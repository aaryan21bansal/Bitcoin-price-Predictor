"EU to give migrants in Greece â¬2,000 to go home","Migrants live in squalor in Moria camp on Lesbos The EU says it will pay â¬2,000 (Â£1,770; $2,225) each to migrants in overcrowded camps on the Greek islands willing to go back to their home countries. EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson announced the scheme in Athens on Thursday. It was agreed with the Greek government. She said it was temporary - open for one month only - and only for migrants who arrived before 1 January. She said 5,000 migrants would be eligible,externalfor the ""voluntary return"". This month, hundreds of migrants and refugees have reached Greek islands near Turkey by boat, increasing the pressure on struggling reception centres. The camps on those islands already have nearly 42,000 asylum seekers, though they were designed for about 6,000. Aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), which is working on the islands, says more than 14,000 of the migrants are children. ""Men, women and children are living in horrific conditions in these overcrowded centres, in constant fear and with very basic access to services like toilets, showers, electricity,"" Stephan Oberreit, MSF head of mission in Greece, told the BBC. ""Our teams in the clinic opposite Moria camp receive around 70 children per day, including children suffering from chronic illnesses, for which we are not able to provide proper care."" Ms Johansson said seven EU member states had agreed to take in at least 1,600 unaccompanied children from the camps, seen as especially vulnerable. This video can not be played Children told the BBC they don't have enough food and are sleeping in the open Many of the migrants are Syrians fleeing the civil war, but there are also Afghans, Pakistanis and West Africans. It is not clear how many would qualify for refugee status. Lesbos refugee centre burns amid migrant tensions Refugees eye Europe as Turkey hits breaking point Aid agencies consider Syria too dangerous for migrants to be sent back there, but some other countries of origin, such as Pakistan, are considered safe enough. Greece has temporarily suspended its processing of new asylum applications - a move condemned by aid groups. Oxfam's spokesman on EU migration, Florian Oel, said ""all EU governments have avoided taking responsibility, not just Greece"" over the migrant crisis. He said the situation had remained very bad since 2016, when Turkey signed a deal with the EU to halt a much larger flow of migrants into Europe. The latest surge in numbers at the Greek border came after Turkey announced that it would no longer stop them trying to enter Greece. Turkey, which is hosting 3.7 million Syrian refugees already, accuses the EU of not doing enough to help. ""People in need of safety have been turned into political bargaining chips,"" Mr Oel told the BBC. ""The EU partners have to share responsibility for those arriving; it means states should relocate refugees to their own countries and do the asylum procedure there. They must agree on permanent rules."" However, he welcomed the EU announcement on relocating unaccompanied children as ""a good first step"". Ms Johansson said repatriation of migrants from the islands would be coordinated with the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the EU border force Frontex. The situation is also acute on the Greece-Turkey land border, where Greek police have used tear gas and water cannon to keep migrants out.

World-renowned chef Michel Roux dies,"Michel Roux was born in Charolles, Burgundy, in 1941 French-born chef and restaurateur Michel Roux has died aged 78. He passed away on Wednesday night surrounded by his family at home in Bray, Berkshire, after battling a long-standing lung condition. Roux and his brother Albert made gastronomic history when their London restaurant, Le Gavroche, became the first three Michelin-starred restaurant in Britain in 1982. A family statement said Roux's ""star will shine forever"". His son Alain and daughters, Francine and Christine, on behalf of the family, said he was ""a father figure inspiring all with his insatiable appetite for life and irresistible enthusiasm"". ""We are grateful to have shared our lives with this extraordinary man and we're so proud of all he's achieved,"" they added. ""A humble genius, legendary chef, popular author and charismatic teacher, Michel leaves the world reeling in his wake. ""But above all, we will miss his mischievous sense of fun, his huge, bottomless heart and generosity and kindness that knew no bounds. Michel's star will shine forever lighting the way for a generation of chefs to follow."" Michel Roux published 15 books that sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide There will be a private family funeral followed later in the year by a ""celebration of life event"". As well as Le Gavroche, the Roux brothers' Waterside Inn in Bray was awarded three Michelin stars in 1985. Roux also opened Skindles in Taplow in 2018 with his son. TV chef James Martin led tributes from the culinary world on social media, writing that he was ""broken and so sad"" that ""we have lost a legend"". Chef Raymond Blanc called the Roux brothers ""pioneers"" who changed the world of gastronomy in the UK, and the official Michelin Guide UK said Roux ""inspired a whole generation of chefs"".

Since 1983, Michel Roux published 15 books that sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide. He was also known for the Roux Scholarship, an annual chef competition founded in 1982 with Albert to enable a new generation of chefs in the UK to train in some of the greatest restaurants in the world. Many scholars have gone on to win Michelin stars following their enrolment in the Roux Scholarship, and it is considered the most acclaimed competition of its kind in the UK. Albert (left) and Michel Roux each received an OBE in 2002 for their services to cooking Food has always been part of the Roux family history, and Michel was born in a room above his grandfather's charcuterie in Burgundy, France, in 1941. Aged 14, he was apprenticed to a grand pÃ¢tissier near Paris where he spent three years pursuing his craft. Following a period as a pastry cook at the British embassy in Paris, Roux was taken on as a commis chef by the de Rothschild's household before following his brother to work in England in the 1960s.

What is the 'delay' stage of fighting coronavirus?,"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

Coronavirus: How can I look after my older relatives?VideoVideoWhat does âdelayâ mean for you?Coronavirus: Stories of self-isolation,"Older people are more likely to become severely ill if they catch coronavirus,according to the NHS.,externalGenerally,it says, anyone,externalover the age of 65 is considered an ""older person"" but there is no strict definition as people age at different rates. The latest government advice is that everyone in the UK should suspend all ""non-essential contact with others"" - but what measures are being taken and what advice is there for looking after older and elderly people? Thegovernment advises,externalthat, by the weekend, groups particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 - such as those over the age of 70 - will be asked to stay at home for 12 weeks. If you are visiting an elderly relative for an essential purpose, you should ""keep a bit more distance, preferably at least 1m [3ft] apart, no kissing and hugging, sadly, and those hand hygiene practices are incredibly important"", says Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK. Inits online advice,external, Carers UK echoes this sentiment, saying the best way to protect people you come into contact with is to protect yourself by washing your hands well and often, using sanitiser gel when it is not possible to wash, and generally followingNHS advice on not spreading the virus.,external Age UK adds that if people are worried about visiting the elderly at home, they can always maintain contact via the phone, post or online. This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said nobody should visit care homes unnecessarily - but stopped short of saying people must not visit relatives in care homes under any circumstances. Meanwhile,government advice online,externalstates anyone who has a new continuous cough or high temperature should not visit care homes and should instead self-isolate. People who are ""generally unwell"" should also stay away from care homes, according to the advice. It adds, however, care homes should consider the ""positive impact of seeing friends and family"" when reviewing their visitor policies. Any visitors travelling to care homes for essential purposes must practise good hygiene, the government says. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mental health charity Mind has tips,externalfor those who may be alone or worried about the virus, including putting extra photos up of people you care about, and limiting how long you read the news. It says elderly relatives could also be encouraged to: stay active by cleaning, dancing, or doingseated exercises,external get as much sunlight and fresh air as they can join an online support community,such as Elefriends,external There are also steps to help prevent loneliness in those avoiding contact or staying at home. Olivia Field, loneliness lead at the British Red Cross, says those staying at home should make sure they find time to do things they enjoy, such as watching TV, reading, writing, art or cooking. ""Ensuring you feel stimulated and have fun protects against loneliness and improves your general wellbeing,"" she says. ""Remember there are other ways to connect with friends and family - for example, phone, email, social media. ""Talking to people about your worries, about feeling lonely, or simply just about your day, helps."" Some people are wearing face masks, although the government does not advise it Age UK stresses it is also important to think of ""practical"" ways to help, such as running errands on relatives' behalf or picking up supplies such as food and medication. Simon Hewett-Avison, from charity Independent Age, also says families need to make sure elderly people have the supplies they need but urges a ""balanced approach"" rather than panicked stockpiling. Both the government and supermarkets have urged people not to stockpile goods. Carers UK says those who cannot visit elderly relatives should think of other ways of spending time together - setting up a family group chat, for example, or playing games online. ""If online communication isn't possible, never underestimate the value of a regular simple phone call to offer social contact and support,"" it says. Families and carers should also consider contingency plans if the situation changes, the charity says, such as arranging for a trusted neighbour to help an elderly relative if they are unable to. The government has said there was ""no need"" for coronavirus stockpiling If you have concerns about an elderly relative's health or need more information about coronavirus, you canvisit the NHS 111 website,external. Older people and their families can also call Age UK Advice for free on 0800 169 65 65. Finally, Age UK says while advice and circumstances could change in the weeks and months ahead, the need for support will remain constant. ""Now is not the time to back off our older population, who need our love and support more than ever,"" Ms Abrahams says. ""Do provide reassurance and now's a good time to make a plan together as a family.""

Coronavirus: Stories of self-isolation,"Alison Cameron was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 5 March A woman self-isolating with coronavirus says she feels like ""death on legs"", while another family describes the stress of being stuck inside waiting for test results. Alison Cameron, 53, believes she contracted the virus after a chance meeting with someone who was later diagnosed with it. ""I had a respiratory tract infection that got a great deal worse. I was finding it hard to breathe,"" she said. ""I feel really unwell. I am currently in isolation. It is not pleasant. At the heart of it I feel like death on legs."" Ms Cameron, from London, contacted NHS 111and was tested on 5 March. She received a positive result four days later. ""It's a horrible feeling not being able to go out and it is quite frightening,"" she said. Ms Cameron, who once worked in international relations, is currently on benefits due to poor health and said she was finding it costly to order in food. ""I worry about what people would do if they have to use food banks,"" she said. Ms Cameron said she had read five novels in five days and friends had been phoning to help keep her spirits up. But she said it could still be a lonely and ""really, really scary"" experience. The Meyer family are self-isolating and awaiting coronavirus test results Phillip Meyer said an ambulance arrived at his Kent homenine days after he called NHS 111when he and his son developed coughs following a trip to Italy. ""A woman came in dressed in what looked like a hospital gown covered with green plastic, gloves, a face mask and a visor over her head,"" he said. ""She took mouth and nose swabs and said we have to wait 72 hours for the results. ""If we have had coronavirus then the symptoms have been very mild."" The Meyer family returned from skiing in Italy on 24 February Mr Meyer said his wife was verbally abused by a patient in a doctors waiting room. ""When my son and I were asked to self-isolate, NHS 111 were quite explicit that my wife could continue with a pre-arranged doctors appointment,"" he said. ""As a point of courtesy she let the receptionist know that my son and I were self-isolating. The receptionist leapt back from the glass window and said she shouldn't be there. ""The practice manager came out and told her it was fine but another patient was swearing at her saying if she effing killed her child she would effing kill her. ""So we took a decision quite early on to self-isolate the whole family."" Couple postpone wedding over coronavirus fears Should I self-isolate and how do I do it? Volunteers rally round to help contain coronavirus Mr Meyer said he had found some elements of staying at home difficult. ""The children think it's great but it's hard to get them to understand that they can't play Xbox all day. We are trying to get them to work so that's quite stressful. ""I'm a very active person. I do a lot of cycling and about 15,000 steps a day so it's frustrating just being around the house all day. ""I've got an indoor bike and it's one of the only things keeping me sane,"" he said.

""The NHS said we didn't have to self-isolate, then the Foreign Office site said we do, so we just decided to apply common sense."" Mr Fennemore said he and his wife could work from home and had ordered their grocery shopping to be delivered. ""I cleared out a big cupboard yesterday and I might do some decorating, but I imagine after another 10 days we might start getting cabin fever."" Paul Fennemore and his wife Aly had been skiing in Italy York Central MP Rachael Maskell is working from home York Central MP Rachael Maskell said she had been told to self-isolate until 19 March as a result of a meeting she had with health minister Nadine Dorries who has been diagnosed with coronavirus.

""This is the frustration, it all feels a little surreal when you are asymptomatic, you're not showing signs of a cough or an aching chest or a temperature, you're feeling fine."" Ms Maskell said she had ""shifted her work online"". ""Yes it's an inconvenience, but nothing compared to the spread of coronavirus.""

Shares in US and UK suffer worst day since 1987,"Shares around the world have plunged as investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth with government action insufficient to arrest the decline. The main UK index dropped more than 10% in its worst day since 1987. In the US, the Dow and S&P 500 were also hit by their steepest daily falls since 1987. The declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to ease financial strains. At the start of US trading, plummeting shares triggered an unusual automatic suspension in trading for the second time this week. When trade resumed 15 minutes later, shares continued to fall, taking cues from the slide in European markets. The S&P 500 fell 9.5% and the Nasdaq ended 9.4% lower, while losses on the UK's FTSE 100 wiped some Â£160.4bn off the market. In France and Germany, indexes cratered more than 12%. Eurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis Trump halts travel from Europe to US Coronavirus: LV pulls out of travel cover ""Markets are at a breaking point,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. ""No one knows what a total economic shutdown, however temporary, looks like."" The declines came after the US restricted travel from mainland Europe. Losses on European indexes accelerated afterthe eurozone's central bank failed to cut interest rates, although it did pledge fresh stimulus measures. The New York branch of the Federal Reserve said it was pumping $1.5tr to ease strains in the debt markets, offering increased overnight loans to banks and expanding the kinds of assets it will buy to keep firms lending. The announcement, which came after European markets had closed, briefly sent shares higher, but they dropped back by the end of the day. Rate cuts by the US central bank last week and the Bank of England on Wednesday also did little to soothe investors. ""What we really need is some huge confidence that this isn't going to cause the kind of stress and horrible loss of life [it has] in Italy everywhere else in the world,"" said former Goldman Sachs chief economist Lord Jim O'Neill. Stocks in Asia also saw big falls earlier, with Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closing 4.4% lower. Panicked selling led to trading halts in Brazil, while not a single company in the FTSE 100 index gained on Thursday. Travel companies saw some of the biggest falls, driven byUS President Donald Trump's 30-day ban on travellers from mainland Europe. Shares in Delta Air Lines and United Airlines - among the most affected by the ban - dropped more than 20%. In the UK, airline group IAG was down more than 15% and Tui fell 17%. Other companies warning on the impact of Covid-19 on Thursday included: BT Groupannounced that chief executive Philip Jansen had tested positive for coronavirus. It said he had ""relatively mild"" symptoms and would work remotely Broadcomsaid uncertainty about demand was prompting it to withdraw its 2020 growth forecast Norwegiansaid it would ground 40% of its long-haul fleet and cancel up to 25% of its short-haul flights until the end of May WH Smithissued a profit warning after the outbreak hit sales in its travel division, which includes store at airports and train stations Cineworldshares fell by more than 20%. It said that in a worst-case scenario, there was a risk it might not be able to repay its debts Estate agent Savillssaid the outbreak had caused a big drop in transactions in China and across Asia Princess Cruises,a line owned by Carnival, said it would suspend operations for 60 days.Vikingannounced a similar move Disneyclosed its California parks until the end of March Oil prices also fell, with Brent crude down more than 8% at about $33 a barrel. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, tensions were high. Some traders were speculating the tumbles could trigger a second trading suspension - something that has never happened, not even during the financial crisis. Since the start of the market turmoil, indexes in the US and elsewhere have fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a threshold that is a red flag for a recession. ""It looks increasingly likely that the coming contraction will be deeper and more protracted than we were anticipating just a few days ago,"" said Jay Bryson, acting chief economist at Wells Fargo. ""The airline and hotel industries are in free fall, and there will be multiplier effects."" Investors in the US are now watching the US government response. US President Donald Trump said new, temporary travel restrictions would not apply to the UK In a presidential address on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he would extend deadlines for tax payments for those affected, increase low-cost loans to small businesses and provide financial relief for US workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to the illness. But Republicans and Democrats in Congress appear at odds over additional steps while Mr Trump's favoured approach - a tax cut for workers - has failed to garner widespread support. ""The stock market at least is saying it's not been enough yet,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. The Western world's three largest central banks have now pitted their collective firepower against the economic chill caused by the coronavirus - to little effect. Stock markets continue to slide. The FTSE 100 has had its worst day since Black Monday in October 1987. Observers again might wonder what new information is spooking investors, given that central banks have in the last 10 days done their best to halt the slide. In truth, there is little new - most traders already knew that the virus is likely to cause significant economic disruption likely to push most Western economies into recession. What may have spooked them again is President Donald Trump's decision to stop most travel between continental Europe and the United States - a big enough factor in itself, but more importantly, the manner in which it was done. There was no consultation, and Mr Trump looked uncharacteristically uncertain, as if he, too, had finally been panicked by the virus. There is also a small, but telling detail - Mr Trump first said the ban would apply to cargo flights, but then corrected himself to say it would not. A big proportion of cargo, however, is carried in the belly holds of passenger aircraft. If there are no passenger flights, there will be much less cargo, an enormous disruption to exporters and manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic.

Trump travel ban met with confusion and criticism,"This video can not be played Five takeaways from Donald Trump's Oval Office address President Donald Trump's coronavirus travel ban on 26 European countries has been met with anger and confusion, with EU leaders accusing him of making the decision ""without consultation"". The Covid-19 pandemic is a ""global crisis"", said top European Union officials Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel. It ""requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,"" they said. The ban is due to go into effect on Friday at midnight EDT (0400 GMT). It affects only countries that are members ofthe Schengen border-free travel areaand does not affect US citizens, the UK, or Ireland. It is a major escalation in the response to Covid-19 by Mr Trump, who has been accused of inaction. However, the ban was met with frustration in Washington as well as abroad. On Thursday, the US leader said he did not inform his EU counterparts because ""it takes time"". ""We had to move quickly,"" Mr Trump said, adding that the EU did not consult the US when raising taxes on American goods. AnalysisbyTara McKelvey, BBC White House correspondent The European ambassador was, naturally, diplomatic. ""We feel there should have been cooperation rather than action that targets one continent,"" the diplomat, who asked not to be named, says on the phone, referring to the travel ban. Mr Trump's action took him and other ambassadors in Washington by surprise. Still he made his views about the travel ban, as well his frustration and anger about the restrictions, clear: ""We are not very pleased,"" he says. ""No."" Others are equally dismayed: the Atlantic Council's Daniel Fried, a former US ambassador to Poland, says he found the president's remarks disappointing: ""Anti-EU bashing is indulgence."" Ambassadors here in Washington, both current and former, are now waiting for the president's next move - with a fair amount of dread. As another former ambassador put it: ""I am not confident."" Over 1,300 confirmed cases of the virus have been reported in the US, with 38 deaths so far. Italy now has over 12,000 confirmed cases and 827 deaths, second to China. France, Spain and Germany have also seen a rise in cases. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Mr Trump called the ban the ""most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history"". He accused the EU of failing to take ""the same precautions"" as the US in fighting the virus to justify the ban. Stocks plummeted following Mr Trump's announcement, in which he said that the travel ban would also include trade and cargo. The statement was later retracted. Trading on Wall Street was stopped on Thursday morning after theDow Jones dropped 7% and UK indices fell to their lowest since the 2008 financial crisis. Tom Bossert, Mr Trump's former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, criticised the ban, saying: ""There's little value to European travel restrictions. Poor use of time & energy.""

Shopping centre giant Intu warns it could go bust,"Intu owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester The owner of some of the UK's biggest shopping centres, Intu, has said there are doubts that it can survive unless it raises extra funds. Its comments came as the firm - which owns Manchester's Trafford Centre and the Lakeside complex in Essex -reported a Â£2bn loss in 2019.,external The weakness in the retail sector meant Intu wrote down the value of its shopping centre sites by nearly Â£2bn. Intu will try to raise extra cash after an earlier plan to raise Â£1bn failed. The collapse and contraction of High Street retailers has left landlords such as Intu struggling to fill vacant space. At the same time, Intu has run up debts of nearly Â£5bn. In January, the firm approached its shareholders to ask for more money amid the downturn in the retail sector. But last week, Intu said it was at risk of breaching debt covenants after it was forced to abandon the fundraising attempt. It said ""extreme market conditions"" deterred investors from giving fresh cash. To help it keep going, the firm said it would try to engage with investors, or it might have to sell more of its assets. The company has already been selling shopping centres to raise cash. Intu said it could also try to seek waivers on its debt commitments to lenders and spend less in the short term. Braehead, Glasgow Broadmarsh, Nottingham Chapelfield, Norwich Derby Eldon Square, Newcastle Lakeside, Essex Merry Hill, West Midlands Metrocentre, Gateshead Milton Keynes Potteries, Stoke-on-Trent Trafford Centre, Manchester Uxbridge Victoria Centre, Nottingham Watford Centres run as joint ventures: Manchester Arndale St David's, Cardiff The Mall, Cribbs Causeway Last year was the ""worst"" for retail sales in 25 years, trade body the British Retail Consortiumsaid in January. Tough trading conditions in 2019 hurt landlords, who struggled to fill vacant stores. Firms such as Debenhams, Toys R Us, House of Fraser, New Look and HMV all tried to negotiate with landlords to reduce rent. Intu was hit by some of the most high-profile retail failures, as more firms shut up shop after more online competition and problems paying business rates and increased wages. The firm's share price has collapsed since its high of 378p in December 2010. Its shares stood at 34p when trading began at the start of 2020, and on Wednesday were worth about 4.7p after falling 17% in reaction to its results.

More than 90 names were added to the line-up on Thursday, joining headliners Taylor Swift and Sir Paul McCartney. US rap star Kendrick Lamar will top the bill on Friday, with Supergrass, Lana Del Rey and AJ Tracey also due to play. Emily Eavis said organisers had ""fingers firmly crossed"" the event would go ahead in June. She said she was releasing a poster of the line-up ""with the best intentions"" given ""the current circumstances"".

The coronavirus outbreak has already affected several tours and festivals, with acts like The Who, BTS, Miley Cyrus and Madonna having cancelled or postponed shows. In the US, April's Coachella festival has been delayed, while music industry showcase South By Southwest, was scrapped altogether. The Country To Country festival, due to take place in London, Dublin and Glasgow this weekend, was also postponed at the last minute on Thursday night. Rescheduled dates will be announced ""in the coming days,""organisers said,external. With more disruptions expected, shares in concert promoters Live Nation dropped by 16.6% on Wednesday, representing a single-day loss of more than $1.8bn (Â£1.4bn). Glastonbury's team are hoping their festival can go ahead if the spread of the virus slows down. However, if there is a government-imposed lockdown in the run-up to the festival, it could impact their ability to build stages and prepare the Somerset site for the arrival of 175,000 ticket-holders on 24 June. Taylor Swift will headline the Pyramid Stage on Sunday night... if the show goes ahead The acts announced on Thursday did not constitute Glastonbury's full line-up, but flagged up some of the festival's biggest bookings for 2020. Among them were former headliners Manic Street Preachers, Happy Mondays, Sinead O'Connor and Skunk Anansie, alongside festival stalwarts Dizzee Rascal, Primal Scream and Elbow. Suzanne Vega, the festival's first-ever female headliner, will also return to Worthy Farm - 31 years after playing the Pyramid Stagein a bullet-proof vest, after her band received death threats. Brazilian Tropicalia legend Gilberto Gil will make his first appearance since playing Glastonbury's inaugural festival in 1970. The musician was actually living in the Eavis farmhouse at the time, after being exiled by his country's military dictatorship. US R&B stars TLC will make their debut, while Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds will play immediately before Paul McCartney's Saturday night headline slot. Pop icon Diana Ross hasalready been announcedto play the Sunday afternoon ""legend slot""; while festival favourites Dua Lipa, Pet Shop Boys and Fatboy Slim will headline The Other Stage - Glastonbury's second-biggest arena. Fifty-two per cent of the acts announced so far are female or bands featuring a mix of genders, after Eavis pledged to achieve a gender-balanced line-up ""as soon as possible"". ""Our future has to be 50/50,""she told Radio 1's Newsbeatearlier this year. ""It's a challenge.

"World-renowned chef Michel Roux diesRoux passed away at his home in Bray, Berkshire, following a long battle with a lung condition.","Michel Roux was born in Charolles, Burgundy, in 1941 French-born chef and restaurateur Michel Roux has died aged 78. He passed away on Wednesday night surrounded by his family at home in Bray, Berkshire, after battling a long-standing lung condition. Roux and his brother Albert made gastronomic history when their London restaurant, Le Gavroche, became the first three Michelin-starred restaurant in Britain in 1982. A family statement said Roux's ""star will shine forever"". His son Alain and daughters, Francine and Christine, on behalf of the family, said he was ""a father figure inspiring all with his insatiable appetite for life and irresistible enthusiasm"". ""We are grateful to have shared our lives with this extraordinary man and we're so proud of all he's achieved,"" they added. ""A humble genius, legendary chef, popular author and charismatic teacher, Michel leaves the world reeling in his wake. ""But above all, we will miss his mischievous sense of fun, his huge, bottomless heart and generosity and kindness that knew no bounds. Michel's star will shine forever lighting the way for a generation of chefs to follow."" Michel Roux published 15 books that sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide There will be a private family funeral followed later in the year by a ""celebration of life event"". As well as Le Gavroche, the Roux brothers' Waterside Inn in Bray was awarded three Michelin stars in 1985. Roux also opened Skindles in Taplow in 2018 with his son. TV chef James Martin led tributes from the culinary world on social media, writing that he was ""broken and so sad"" that ""we have lost a legend"". Chef Raymond Blanc called the Roux brothers ""pioneers"" who changed the world of gastronomy in the UK, and the official Michelin Guide UK said Roux ""inspired a whole generation of chefs"".

Since 1983, Michel Roux published 15 books that sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide. He was also known for the Roux Scholarship, an annual chef competition founded in 1982 with Albert to enable a new generation of chefs in the UK to train in some of the greatest restaurants in the world. Many scholars have gone on to win Michelin stars following their enrolment in the Roux Scholarship, and it is considered the most acclaimed competition of its kind in the UK. Albert (left) and Michel Roux each received an OBE in 2002 for their services to cooking Food has always been part of the Roux family history, and Michel was born in a room above his grandfather's charcuterie in Burgundy, France, in 1941. Aged 14, he was apprenticed to a grand pÃ¢tissier near Paris where he spent three years pursuing his craft. Following a period as a pastry cook at the British embassy in Paris, Roux was taken on as a commis chef by the de Rothschild's household before following his brother to work in England in the 1960s.

Australian GP called off over coronavirus,"The Australian Grand Prix is the second race to be called off over coronavirus concerns The Australian Grand Prix has been called off after teams and drivers forced the hand of Formula 1's bosses. A decision to cancel the race was made in the early hours of Friday morning after a McLaren team member tested positive for the coronavirus in Melbourne. The race's abandonment was not made official for another eight hours. By that time Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen had flown home. And McLaren said later on Friday that 14 further team members had been placed in quarantine in their hotel for the next 14 days because of their close contact with the infected employee. The decision throws into doubt the rest of the F1 season, with the Bahrain Grand Prix due to take place next weekend without spectators the next race to come under scrutiny. BBC Sport understands Ferrari were the first team to make it clear they were not prepared to race in Melbourne in the circumstances. Confirmation of the abandonment in from the FIA and F1 came after Mercedes sent a letter requesting the cancellation of the race. Mercedes said: ""We share the disappointment of the sport's fans that this race cannot go ahead as planned. However, the physical and mental health and wellbeing of our team members and of the wider F1 community are our absolute priority. ""In light of the force majeure events we are experiencing with regards to the coronavirus pandemic, we no longer feel the safety of our employees can be guaranteed if we continue to take part in the event. ""If organisers try to press ahead with the weekend it appears at this stage as if not all the teams will take part."" The statement cancelling the race said a majority of teams suggested overnight they felt the race should not go ahead. Events developed rapidly following McLaren's decision to pull out of the race after their team member's positive coronavirus test. On Friday morning, with a statement cancelling the race still not forthcoming, Australian GP organisers initially told local media the race was going ahead as planned. This video can not be played 'Itâs a joke': fan anger as Australian GP cancelled due to coronavirus fears But Victoria state premier Daniel Andrews then announced if the race went ahead it would be without spectators. Legal complications delayed the announcement of the cancellation but the farcical situation will be seen by many to have damaged the reputations of both the F1 and the FIA. Coronavirus and sport - timeline Hamilton 'very surprised' by F1 stance World champion Lewis Hamiltonsaid on Thursday at the official F1 news conferencehe was ""very, very surprised"" the sport was pressing on with plans to continue with the race while the outbreak of the virus worsened and other sports suspended or cancelled events. An initial meeting of team bosses with F1 and FIA officials on Thursday night, after a tense day in the paddock at Albert Park, broke up with an agreement to carry on with Friday practice as normal and review the situation later that day. But the plans changed later in the evening as several insiders - including leading drivers - expressed their concerns about the idea of racing amid the risk of further cases of coronavirus in the tight-knit F1 paddock. The decision was reviewed at later meetings and eventually, at around 0200 Friday local time (1500 GMT on Thursday), the decision was made to call the race off. After that, Vettel and Raikkonen flew back to Europe on the same flight although Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas remain in Melbourne. Many F1 team members woke up thinking the race was going ahead, only to read news of its cancellation. On Friday morning, a senior source reconfirmed to BBC Sport, which first reported the information, that the race was still off. But in farcical scenes, crowds flocked to Albert Park expecting to see the cars out on track and organisers initially told Australian media that the race weekend was going ahead as planned. In total, eight F1 workershave been assessed and tested for Covid-19. Seven were cleared on Thursday but an eighth, from McLaren, tested positive. Australian Grand Prix organisers said in a statement a ninth person had been assessed and tested, with the result pending. This person was ""not associated with any F1 team, the FIA or associated suppliers"", the statement said. It now seems certain a huge question mark will hang over the Bahrain Grand Prix, scheduled to be the second meeting of the season on 22 March. A decision is also expected imminentlyon the Vietnam Grand Prix, scheduled for 5 April, after the government in Hanoi banned travel into the country for anyone who has been in Italy - among other locations - in the previous 14 days. F1 chief executive Chase Carey was in Hanoi on Thursday trying to find a way around the restrictions. The Chinese Grand Prix, scheduled to be the fourth race,was postponed in Februaryafter government officials said it could not go ahead. The next race after Vietnam is scheduled to be the Dutch Grand Prix on 5 May, the start of a run of three races in four weekends that also includes the Spanish and Monaco events. But with the coronavirus situation developing by the day, and countries imposing tighter restrictions on travel, it is impossible to know at this stage whether any of those races can go ahead. The decision to cancel the race in Australia raises huge questions about the future of the sport this year. F1 authorities faced criticism for their decision to press ahead with the season-opening race, and it is true the teams feel they lacked direction and leadership from the powers that be. But the FIA and F1 were responding to advice from local authorities, with Australian officials saying earlier in the week they saw no reason for their race not to go ahead. The fact it has now been called off is an illustration of the speed with which the coronavirus pandemic has developed across the globe. But it also shines a spotlight on what some will see as the F1 authorities having rather too firm a focus on 'keeping the show on the road' - as well as the dollars rolling in - and not enough on the realities of what really matters. Now, not only does the sport not know when - or even if - the season can start, but the authorities, teams and race promoters have to face the question of what happens to all the fees that have been paid for races that might now never happen. The answer to that may well be different for separate events, and it will depend on who has made this decision, who pays for the race in each specific country, and the legal and contractual complexities of each deal. In addition, there are the knock-on effects for the teams themselves, as a large proportion of their income comes from those race fees. Some teams need that income more than others - and some need it very much indeed. F1 is entering uncharted waters, and to describe them as choppy could be a massive understatement.

"Italy says lockdown can work as deaths top 1,000","This video can not be played Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio: ""There is a way to defeat this virus"" Coronavirus has claimed 1,016 lives in Italy, officials say, but Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio says he hopes his country will be the first in Europe to get over the emergency. Another 188 people died over 24 hours. However, Mr Di Maio told the BBC the measures imposed in the first area of the outbreak were proving effective. Two weeks after the first 10 towns in northern Italy were declared a ""red zone"" and put under lockdown, he said they had no new infections. This then served as a model to tighten measures across the country. Italy has now seen 1,016 deaths, amid a total number 15,113 infections. Civil protection officials say 1,258 have recovered, although the number of cases has gone up by 2,651 since Wednesday. Italy is the world's worst-hit country after China. ""Italy was the first nation in Europe to be affected so badly,"" said Mr Di Maio. ""But I hope it also means that Italy is the first one to leave the emergency behind."" Movement has been limited to urgent medical or professional need. All shops are now closed, except for pharmacies and those stocking food; companies have been ordered to shut non-essential departments; a wide range of venues - from theatres to schools and hairdressers to museums - are closed. ""Our grandfathers were drafted to go to war; we're being asked to stay at home,"" said Mr Di Maio. ""If a doctor and a nurse can work for 24 hours non-stop, we can give up leaving our own home. The huge majority of citizens are respecting the rules. Those who aren't will face sanctions: either fines or criminal charges."" Italy shuts nearly all shops amid virus crisis Italy hit by confusion amid coronavirus lockdown Italian authorities say it could take two weeks for the impact of the restrictions to be seen on the coronavirus outbreak nationwide, which is still surging in towns and cities outside the initial red zone. It is placing exceptional strain on Italy's healthcare system - one of the best in Europe. The government has named a new commissioner to deal with the virus, Domenico Arcuri. He will co-ordinate the programme to resupply hospitals with equipment they urgently need. Mr Di Maio offered to share the knowledge Italy had built up with any other country that needed it As the outbreak in China begins to ease, the government in Beijing is sending Italy teams of specialist doctors and supplies. ""We need oxygen units, and we have started production with factories that produce them or others that can adapt to start producing them,"" said Mr Di Maio. ""We're in contact with countries across the world, many of them are willing to supply us with equipment."" But, he says, the purchase of medical supplies should be organised at a pan-European level, with a single unit to resupply hospitals and clinics. LIVE UPDATES:Latest as Italy closes shops and US bans travel EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Countries across the world have grounded flights to Italy or banned entry to Italians or anyone travelling from Italy. Austria and Slovenia are placing restrictions on their borders with Italy. Italian nationals living in other countries have also reported individual acts of hostility towards them, deplored by the foreign minister as ""unacceptable discrimination"", prompting ""interventions"" from his government. A handful of politicians here have been infected with the virus or are in preventative self-isolation, including the leader of the Democratic Party, part of the governing coalition. Mr Di Maio said he had been tested - and was negative. Italy is now facing its biggest crisis since World War Two. The government has pledged to spend â¬25bn ($28bn; Â£22bn) to tackle it - three times more than it estimated it would need just a week ago. The economy is now expected to slide into deep recession. But the foreign minister sounded a note of optimism, with a message to the international community that ""Italy will make it and Europe will make it - I'm sure"". And he offered to share the experience and knowledge that the Italian government had built up since the outbreak began with any country that needed it.

Could the US do what Italy has done?,"Could a lockdown of Seattle ever happen? As coronavirus sweeps across the US, American officials have warned that mandatory prevention measures may be necessary to stop its spread. But is the US willing to go as far as Italy - another democracy - or even authoritarian China? Italy has banned mass gatherings and barred citizens from travelling outside of their home region. China has forced more than 50 million citizens to self-isolate and even threatened severe penalties, including death, for quarantine breakers. So what measures is the US willing to take, and could coronavirus besiege an American city? Experts say the US could eventually follow Italy's plan to quarantine a large segment of its population, but it would be very hard and would face strong opposition. ""The likelihood of that happening in the United States is extremely, extremely small,"" says Dr Irwin Redlener, Director of Columbia University's National Centre for Disaster Preparedness. ""Essentially that amounts to martial law,"" he tells BBC News. ""Government ordered shutdowns"" of public spaces and ability to travel would be ""a very far step for Americans to manage,"" he added. ""It's just part of our culture. It's just the antithesis of the freedoms that we theoretically have."" Italian authorities check passengers' documents at the Milan train station Dr Anthony Fauci of the US National Institutes of Health has said that ""anything is possible"" given the scale of the outbreak, but large scale quarantines do not appear to be on the horizon. Because relatively few tests have been conducted in the US, the true scope of the problem is still unknown. On Tuesday, New York's governor ordered a one-mile ""containment zone"" for the city of New Rochelle, about 20 miles (32km) from downtown Manhattan. Businesses within the epicenter of the state's outbreak will remain open, but large gathering spaces such as community centres, schools and houses of worship will be closed. National Guards troops will be deployed to help to clean the shuttered facilities and deliver food to self-quarantining residents, who are free to leave the zone if they desire. ""You're not containing people,"" Gov Andrew Cuomo said. ""You're containing facilities."" Emergency managers are focused on individual precautions, but they are also talking about the possibility of travel restrictions similar to Italy's, says Kyle McPhee, the Director of Preparedness Programmes for Hagerty Consulting, which specialises in disaster recovery and prevention. According to Mr McPhee, the emphasis now is on ""self-imposed quarantine or voluntary quarantine"". It puts the burden ""on the individual and the public to keep themselves and their neighbours and their community safe,"" he says. This video can not be played Milan quarantine resident: ""It's really important to be responsible in this moment"" Emergency planners make contingency plans based on worst and best case scenarios, meaning that plans for forced quarantines are certainly being discussed. But Mr McPhee warned that mass closures could have knock-on effects and it could be short-sighted to implement them in a hurry. For example, closing schools could have unintentional consequences in the US, says Dr Redlener. ""By closing schools in poorer neighbourhoods, working parents have to take off, they won't get compensation, and there's a tremendous economic impact on them."" Allow Twitter content?

Poor families often depend on US schools to provide breakfast and lunch to pupils, making it likely that children would go hungry. ""These are not steps to be taken lightly"" he says, adding that any quarantine measure will face ""strenuous legal challenges, at every level of government"" from civil rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has published a letter signed by 450 public health experts acknowledging that ""individual rights must sometimes give way to the greater good"" during an outbreak. People can sometimes be quarantined, for example. ""This is as it should be"" - as long as the measures are in line with scientific research proving effectiveness, says the group. Pharmacies in the US are running low on cleaning supplies and bottled water However, citizens must not lose their right to challenge the government's ability to hold them in captivity even if there is a quarantine, the group warns. It also cautioned that containment zones could become ""politicised"", for example if the US government tries to use them to find undocumented immigrants and deport them. If migrants are afraid to come forward to seek medical treatment, the larger community will be at greater risk, the letter warns. Finally, there are far more gun-owners in the US than anywhere else in the world, as well as anti-government factions that would certainly oppose government intrusion in their lives. During public health emergencies local governments form ""emergency operation centres"" to manage the response, says Mr McPhee. They are typically lead by the local health agency, which would take advice from experts before issuing quarantine orders. The legal situation at US borders is different and managed federally. Under President Donald Trump, the federal government has banned non-citizens from coronavirus-hit regions entry, but US citizens are allowed back into the country after a two-week quarantine. Local officials need more help from Washington, said Scott Gottlieb, the former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner. ""There's no systematic plan of when a city should close school, when they should tell businesses that they have to telework, when they should close movie theatres and cancel large gatherings,"" he told CBS news. ""We leave these decisions to local officials, but we really should have a comprehensive plan in terms of recommendations to cities."" Trump briefs the press on the US coronavirus response The governor of Washington state, where the majority of US deaths from Covid-19 have occurred, has said that officials are weighing ""whether mandatory measures are required"". But closing events and public spaces ""could be hard for the public because they may not have seen the full wave yet,"" Gov Jay Inslee said. Washington has been receiving face masks and hospital gowns from the Strategic National Stockpile, the country's emergency medical stash, but more has to be done by the federal government to make emergency medical supplies available, Mr Inslee said. The Strategic National Stockpile currently contains more than $7bn in medical supplies that could be tapped in the event of an emergency. The US health secretary has warned that it contains only a fraction of the face masks that medical workers need to stay safe while treating US patients. Prison reform activists say that those in jail are more likely to contract the virus due overcrowding and low levels of sanitisation. The US jails more of its citizens per capita than any other country. Inmates are quarantined from the rest of society, but not from each other. Activists warn that prisoners often lack hand-washing facilities or hand sanitiser, which is sometimes deemed contraband due to its alcohol content. Handcuffed people also cannot cover their mouths when they cough or sneeze. Incarcerated inmates across Italy rioted when new restrictions were announced on prison visits due to the virus, and Iran has temporarily released 70,000 prisoners to keep Covid-19 from spreading behind bars. In the US, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state has hired prisoners to produce approximately 100,000 gallons of hand sanitiser per week, but activists questioned whether they would be permitted to actually use the stuff.

Coronavirus: What is it like to self-isolate?,"Alison Cameron was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 5 March A woman self-isolating with coronavirus says she feels like ""death on legs"", while another family describes the stress of being stuck inside waiting for test results. Alison Cameron, 53, believes she contracted the virus after a chance meeting with someone who was later diagnosed with it. ""I had a respiratory tract infection that got a great deal worse. I was finding it hard to breathe,"" she said. ""I feel really unwell. I am currently in isolation. It is not pleasant. At the heart of it I feel like death on legs."" Ms Cameron, from London, contacted NHS 111and was tested on 5 March. She received a positive result four days later. ""It's a horrible feeling not being able to go out and it is quite frightening,"" she said. Ms Cameron, who once worked in international relations, is currently on benefits due to poor health and said she was finding it costly to order in food. ""I worry about what people would do if they have to use food banks,"" she said. Ms Cameron said she had read five novels in five days and friends had been phoning to help keep her spirits up. But she said it could still be a lonely and ""really, really scary"" experience. The Meyer family are self-isolating and awaiting coronavirus test results Phillip Meyer said an ambulance arrived at his Kent homenine days after he called NHS 111when he and his son developed coughs following a trip to Italy. ""A woman came in dressed in what looked like a hospital gown covered with green plastic, gloves, a face mask and a visor over her head,"" he said. ""She took mouth and nose swabs and said we have to wait 72 hours for the results. ""If we have had coronavirus then the symptoms have been very mild."" The Meyer family returned from skiing in Italy on 24 February Mr Meyer said his wife was verbally abused by a patient in a doctors waiting room. ""When my son and I were asked to self-isolate, NHS 111 were quite explicit that my wife could continue with a pre-arranged doctors appointment,"" he said. ""As a point of courtesy she let the receptionist know that my son and I were self-isolating. The receptionist leapt back from the glass window and said she shouldn't be there. ""The practice manager came out and told her it was fine but another patient was swearing at her saying if she effing killed her child she would effing kill her. ""So we took a decision quite early on to self-isolate the whole family."" Couple postpone wedding over coronavirus fears Should I self-isolate and how do I do it? Volunteers rally round to help contain coronavirus Mr Meyer said he had found some elements of staying at home difficult. ""The children think it's great but it's hard to get them to understand that they can't play Xbox all day. We are trying to get them to work so that's quite stressful. ""I'm a very active person. I do a lot of cycling and about 15,000 steps a day so it's frustrating just being around the house all day. ""I've got an indoor bike and it's one of the only things keeping me sane,"" he said.

She had been teaching English in a school as part of her languages degree at the University of York. ""I booked my flight home and one hour later Ryanair announced it was the last one so I was so relieved that I managed to get back,"" said the 20-year-old from Leeds. ""I rang my parents and we made a plan for them to get the caravan ready for me because our house is small and we share bathrooms. ""It's hooked up to electricity and water, I've got a fridge freezer and cupboards which my parents stocked up before I arrived. My mum made me a beef stew and left it outside. ""I like my own company so I don't think it's going to bother me too much. ""I've got lots of uni work to do and I've got books, wi-fi and my art stuff. I am trying to look at it as an artistic retreat."" Paul Fennemore said he was trying to stay busy to avoid cabin fever Paul Fennemore, a university lecturer from Oxfordshire, said he and his wife had decided to self-isolate after returning from a ski trip in Italy. So far neither of them had any symptoms and were coping well with staying in the house. ""What we are not coping very well with is the conflicting advice,"" he said. ""The NHS said we didn't have to self-isolate, then the Foreign Office site said we do, so we just decided to apply common sense."" Mr Fennemore said he and his wife could work from home and had ordered their grocery shopping to be delivered. ""I cleared out a big cupboard yesterday and I might do some decorating, but I imagine after another 10 days we might start getting cabin fever."" Paul Fennemore and his wife Aly had been skiing in Italy York Central MP Rachael Maskell is working from home York Central MP Rachael Maskell said she had been told to self-isolate until 19 March as a result of a meeting she had with health minister Nadine Dorries who has been diagnosed with coronavirus. ""I'm great in myself,"" she told BBC Look North. ""This is the frustration, it all feels a little surreal when you are asymptomatic, you're not showing signs of a cough or an aching chest or a temperature, you're feeling fine."" Ms Maskell said she had ""shifted her work online"". ""Yes it's an inconvenience, but nothing compared to the spread of coronavirus.""

In the US, April's Coachella festival has been delayed, while music industry showcase South By Southwest, was scrapped altogether. The Country To Country festival, due to take place in London, Dublin and Glasgow this weekend, was also postponed at the last minute on Thursday night. Rescheduled dates will be announced ""in the coming days,""organisers said,external. With more disruptions expected, shares in concert promoters Live Nation dropped by 16.6% on Wednesday, representing a single-day loss of more than $1.8bn (Â£1.4bn). Glastonbury's team are hoping their festival can go ahead if the spread of the virus slows down. However, if there is a government-imposed lockdown in the run-up to the festival, it could impact their ability to build stages and prepare the Somerset site for the arrival of 175,000 ticket-holders on 24 June. Taylor Swift will headline the Pyramid Stage on Sunday night... if the show goes ahead The acts announced on Thursday did not constitute Glastonbury's full line-up, but flagged up some of the festival's biggest bookings for 2020. Among them were former headliners Manic Street Preachers, Happy Mondays, Sinead O'Connor and Skunk Anansie, alongside festival stalwarts Dizzee Rascal, Primal Scream and Elbow. Suzanne Vega, the festival's first-ever female headliner, will also return to Worthy Farm - 31 years after playing the Pyramid Stagein a bullet-proof vest, after her band received death threats. Brazilian Tropicalia legend Gilberto Gil will make his first appearance since playing Glastonbury's inaugural festival in 1970. The musician was actually living in the Eavis farmhouse at the time, after being exiled by his country's military dictatorship. US R&B stars TLC will make their debut, while Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds will play immediately before Paul McCartney's Saturday night headline slot. Pop icon Diana Ross hasalready been announcedto play the Sunday afternoon ""legend slot""; while festival favourites Dua Lipa, Pet Shop Boys and Fatboy Slim will headline The Other Stage - Glastonbury's second-biggest arena.

Apps 'must check images for abuse before publishing'Inquiry says apps should screen posts before displaying them to help tackle 'explosion' of child abuse imagery.Technology,"Internet companies must do more to tackle ""an explosion"" in images of child sex abuse on their platforms, a UK-held inquiry has concluded. The panel also said the technology companies had ""failed to demonstrate"" they were fully aware of the number of under-13s using their services and lacked a plan to combat the problem. It has called for all images to be screened before publication. And it said more stringent age checks were also required. Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were identified as the most commonly cited apps where grooming was said to take place. And the industry at large was accused of being ""reactive rather than proactive"" in response to the issues. ""Action seemed driven by a desire to avoid reputational damage rather than to prioritise protection of children,"" the inquiry said. The report follows,externala series of public hearings, between January 2018 and May 2019, during which the police said they believed the UK was the world's third biggest consumer of live-streamed child sex abuse. Facebook was one of the first to respond. ""[We] have made huge investments in sophisticated solutions,"" said its European head of safety, David Miles. ""As this is a global, industry-wide issue, we'll continue to develop new technologies and work alongside law enforcement and specialist experts in child protection to keep children safe."" Microsoft also promised to ""consider these findings carefully"", while Google said it would keep working with others to ""tackle this evil crime"". The report said some steps should be taken before the end of September. Leading its list is a requirement for screening before images appear online. The report noted technologies such as Microsoft's PhotoDNA had made it possible for pictures to be quickly checked against databases of known illegal imagery without humans needing to look at them. But at present, this filtering process typically happened after the material had already become available for others to see. Users might be frustrated by a delay in seeing their content go live but, the panel said, it had not been told of any technical reason this process could not happen before publication. The inquiry also said the UK government should introduce legislation to compel the companies involved to adopt more effective checks to deter under-age users. Pre-teens were at ""particularly acute"" risk of being groomed, it said. Pakistan law aims to catch child abusers 'My search for boy in a child abuse video' 'I was abused - now I want to give hope to others' The panel recognised many services were officially banned to under-13s. But it said in many cases, the only test was to require users to fill in a date-of-birth form, which could easily be falsified. ""There must be better means of ensuring compliance,"" it said. The report acknowledged detecting and preventing the live-streaming of abuse was difficult but highlighted a French app as an example to learn from. It said Yubo used algorithms to detect possible instances of child nudity, which a human moderator would then check to see if action if necessary. It was suggested the big social networks could learn from a smaller rival, Yubo The panel also noted existing anti-abuse technologies did not work when communications were protected by end-to-end encryption, which digitally scrambles communications without giving platform providers a key. The inquiry highlighted WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage and FaceTime already used the technique by default and Facebook intended to deploy it more widely soon. However, it did not say how this should be addressed.

Coronavirus: How can I look after my older relatives?,"Older people are more likely to become severely ill if they catch coronavirus,according to the NHS.,externalGenerally,it says, anyone,externalover the age of 65 is considered an ""older person"" but there is no strict definition as people age at different rates. The latest government advice is that everyone in the UK should suspend all ""non-essential contact with others"" - but what measures are being taken and what advice is there for looking after older and elderly people? Thegovernment advises,externalthat, by the weekend, groups particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 - such as those over the age of 70 - will be asked to stay at home for 12 weeks. If you are visiting an elderly relative for an essential purpose, you should ""keep a bit more distance, preferably at least 1m [3ft] apart, no kissing and hugging, sadly, and those hand hygiene practices are incredibly important"", says Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK. Inits online advice,external, Carers UK echoes this sentiment, saying the best way to protect people you come into contact with is to protect yourself by washing your hands well and often, using sanitiser gel when it is not possible to wash, and generally followingNHS advice on not spreading the virus.,external Age UK adds that if people are worried about visiting the elderly at home, they can always maintain contact via the phone, post or online. This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said nobody should visit care homes unnecessarily - but stopped short of saying people must not visit relatives in care homes under any circumstances. Meanwhile,government advice online,externalstates anyone who has a new continuous cough or high temperature should not visit care homes and should instead self-isolate. People who are ""generally unwell"" should also stay away from care homes, according to the advice. It adds, however, care homes should consider the ""positive impact of seeing friends and family"" when reviewing their visitor policies. Any visitors travelling to care homes for essential purposes must practise good hygiene, the government says. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mental health charity Mind has tips,externalfor those who may be alone or worried about the virus, including putting extra photos up of people you care about, and limiting how long you read the news. It says elderly relatives could also be encouraged to: stay active by cleaning, dancing, or doingseated exercises,external get as much sunlight and fresh air as they can join an online support community,such as Elefriends,external There are also steps to help prevent loneliness in those avoiding contact or staying at home. Olivia Field, loneliness lead at the British Red Cross, says those staying at home should make sure they find time to do things they enjoy, such as watching TV, reading, writing, art or cooking. ""Ensuring you feel stimulated and have fun protects against loneliness and improves your general wellbeing,"" she says. ""Remember there are other ways to connect with friends and family - for example, phone, email, social media. ""Talking to people about your worries, about feeling lonely, or simply just about your day, helps."" Some people are wearing face masks, although the government does not advise it Age UK stresses it is also important to think of ""practical"" ways to help, such as running errands on relatives' behalf or picking up supplies such as food and medication. Simon Hewett-Avison, from charity Independent Age, also says families need to make sure elderly people have the supplies they need but urges a ""balanced approach"" rather than panicked stockpiling. Both the government and supermarkets have urged people not to stockpile goods. Carers UK says those who cannot visit elderly relatives should think of other ways of spending time together - setting up a family group chat, for example, or playing games online. ""If online communication isn't possible, never underestimate the value of a regular simple phone call to offer social contact and support,"" it says. Families and carers should also consider contingency plans if the situation changes, the charity says, such as arranging for a trusted neighbour to help an elderly relative if they are unable to. The government has said there was ""no need"" for coronavirus stockpiling If you have concerns about an elderly relative's health or need more information about coronavirus, you canvisit the NHS 111 website,external. Older people and their families can also call Age UK Advice for free on 0800 169 65 65. Finally, Age UK says while advice and circumstances could change in the weeks and months ahead, the need for support will remain constant. ""Now is not the time to back off our older population, who need our love and support more than ever,"" Ms Abrahams says. ""Do provide reassurance and now's a good time to make a plan together as a family.""

Canada's Trudeau self-isolating over virus fears,"Sophie GrÃ©goire Trudeau and PM Justin Trudeau will self-isolate Sophie GrÃ©goire Trudeau, wife of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, has tested positive for coronavirus after returning from a trip to London, a statement from the PM's office says. ""She will remain in isolation for the time being. She is feeling well, is taking all the recommended precautions and her symptoms remain mild,"" it read. The couple is now self-isolating. Mr Trudeau is in good health and has no symptoms, according to his office, but will remain in isolation for 14 days. There are no plans at present for Mr Trudeau to be tested for coronavirus. ""The prime minister will continue to fully assume his duties and will address Canadians tomorrow [Friday],"" his office said. There are currently approximately 103 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Canada. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Ms GrÃ©goire Trudeau began to show mild flu-like symptoms including a low fever late on Wednesday night after returning from the UK. Ms GrÃ©goire Trudeau shared a stage with other celebrities at the London event Among other engagements she had been at a charity event attended by 12,000 people at Wembley Arena for WE day, an annual series of youth empowerment events. She shared a stage with former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and singer Leona Lewis. Other guests at the event included celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, actor Idris Elba and Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton. After she tested positive for Covid-19, Ms GrÃ©goire Trudeau said: ""Although I'm experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon. ""We will get through this situation together. Please share the facts and take your health seriously."" Health workers will contact people whom Mrs GrÃ©goire Trudeau has recently met. However, those who have been in contact with the prime minister are deemed not to be at risk, as Mr Trudeau has shown no symptoms. A number of politicians around the globe have been self-isolating in recent days after coming into possible contact with the virus, including five senior US Republicans and a Canadian cabinet minister. Mr Trudeau was scheduled to hold meetings over the next two days in Ottawa with provincial premiers and First Nations leaders. Those meetings have been postponed. Mr Trudeau will now be speaking with those provincial counterparts over the phone, with the topic focusing on Canada's response to the pandemic, said the prime minister's office in a statement. Another federal party leader, the NDP's Jagmeet Singh, said on Thursday he was also staying at home because he was feeling unwell, though doctors have told him that his symptoms are not consistent with the coronavirus. ""Their advice is for me to limit contact with the public until I am feeling better,"" he said on Twitter. There are currently approximately 103 confirmed cases of the coronavirus  in Canada, in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, Quebec, and Manitoba. There has been one death linked to the disease. Canada announced on Wednesday  a C$1bn ($728m; Â£562m) coronavirus response fund to deal with the pandemic. The funding package will help the country address the domestic impact of the virus and to support further research, including vaccine development. Mr Trudeau said his government was ready to do more if the situation warranted. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the prime minister urged Canadians to follow the recommendations of public health officials in order to help slow the spread of the disease and to avoid overburdening the health care system.

""She will remain in isolation for the time being. She is feeling well, is taking all the recommended precautions and her symptoms remain mild,"" it read. The couple is now self-isolating. Mr Trudeau is in good health and has no symptoms, according to his office, but will remain in isolation for 14 days. There are no plans at present for Mr Trudeau to be tested for coronavirus. ""The prime minister will continue to fully assume his duties and will address Canadians tomorrow [Friday],"" his office said. There are currently approximately 103 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Canada. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Ms GrÃ©goire Trudeau began to show mild flu-like symptoms including a low fever late on Wednesday night after returning from the UK. Ms GrÃ©goire Trudeau shared a stage with other celebrities at the London event Among other engagements she had been at a charity event attended by 12,000 people at Wembley Arena for WE day, an annual series of youth empowerment events. She shared a stage with former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and singer Leona Lewis. Other guests at the event included celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, actor Idris Elba and Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton. After she tested positive for Covid-19, Ms GrÃ©goire Trudeau said: ""Although I'm experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon. ""We will get through this situation together. Please share the facts and take your health seriously."" Health workers will contact people whom Mrs GrÃ©goire Trudeau has recently met. However, those who have been in contact with the prime minister are deemed not to be at risk, as Mr Trudeau has shown no symptoms. A number of politicians around the globe have been self-isolating in recent days after coming into possible contact with the virus, including five senior US Republicans and a Canadian cabinet minister.

BBC could scale back output if hit by coronavirus,"BBC director general Tony Hall has told MPs there's a chance that part of its services could be ""out of action"" for a spell if the corporation's newsrooms suffered an outbreak of coronavirus. Lord Hall said the BBC is ""intent on keeping absolutely everything open"". Asked whether there could be a scaling back of services, he replied: ""There could be - I hope there won't be."" Executives are ""working through how we could cope with"" a service being out of action, he added. He said they are looking at how to ensure ""we can keep broadcasting the information that the people need to have"", but that the BBC is ""gaming out"" what would happen if many staff go sick. ""You could imagine a local station or some other part of our news operation being out of action for a period."" The outgoing director general told the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee that he would chair another meeting about the issue later on Thursday. ""We have to make sure our news services keep transmitting on television and on radio, and we are making sure we've got every eventuality covered,"" he said. ""We are gaming out what happens if x% of the staff [caught coronavirus] or what happens if there was a case in one of our stations or newsrooms, what would we do and how we would cope with that?"" LIVE UPDATES:Follow the latest developments EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Lord Hall added: ""At the moment we are intent on keeping absolutely everything open, all our networks going, because we know that globally, nationally and locally, people turn to us for information, as they did during the floods. ""[We want] to make sure we can keep going if for some reason there was illness within a team. We're not planning on anything other than keeping everything going at the moment, but we need to plot just in case something happens. ""The primary purpose is to keep our services going. If we were hit to a very high degree by sickness then our priority is to make sure we have a service people would turn to, and that that service would keep going."" Victoria Derbyshire took issue with the audience figures quoted by the director general The hearing at the House of Commons also covered a wide range of other programmes and issues: Radio 4 Today programme- Lord Hall said he was ""very pleased that ministers are back"" on the programme as the coronavirus outbreak continues, following an apparent informal government boycott. Victoria Derbyshire Show- He said the Â£3m budget for the BBC Two programme, which is being axed, is too much for an audience of 300,000, who are ""more male and older than you might think"". But he said he hoped ""Victoria herself and the journalism which they do will find a home on the News Channel and elsewhere around the BBC"". However,Derbyshire tweeted,externalthat those audience ratings ""completely ignored"" digital figures for stories that wouldn't have been commissioned if the TV programme didn't exist. Six Nations- The rights to the rugby tournament are split between the BBC and ITV, and Lord Hall said the corporation was ""in the middle of negotiations"" about what happens when that deal ends in 2021. ""We want to keep those free to air,"" he said. ""They probably will not be free to air. Frankly we believe they ought to be listed events."" Over-75s- BBC director of policy Clare Sumner said older people who will no longer be eligible for free TV licences from June would be dealt with ""sympathetically"" if they don't pay. ""In the first instance we're going to have to take the first year to help people [and] support them to pay,"" she said. ""That is our whole strategy here."" BBC News app- ""We are going to completely reboot, start again with our BBC News app this year,"" the director general said. ""That's our big investment priority. One of the areas is to personalise it."" Local radio- The network could be reorganised, Lord Hall said. ""We're looking at ways that we can move some of the pieces to more reflect what we think the important geographies are and communities are, especially those without a voice and those more in the Midlands and the north."" BBC Three- Lord Hall didn't talk about reports that BBC Three could be reinstated as a TV channel, but did say: ""What we're looking at, and the board will be looking at this over the coming weeks, is whether we can divert more resources into BBC Three to build the kind of creative content they're delivering."" News Channel- ""I can't foresee an end to the News Channel, even though people have talked about its demise for a very long time,"" Lord Hall said. ""I think people want to find out what's happening live."" Equal pay- Asked how many gender pay tribunals the corporation was currently fighting, Lord Hall said there were 11 in the pipeline. Star salaries- Lord Hall said transparency over publishing presenters' pay was right, but added: ""We have undoubtedly lost people because their pay has been known to other broadcasters who have used that to take them away from us, and it's happening reasonably often."" Diversity- Every key management group in the BBC will have two additional members as diversity advisors by the end of March ""to add actual diversity - BAME or it could be a disability or whatever"", he said.

"Trump travel ban met with confusion and criticismEU leaders said President Trump's decision was made ""unilaterally and without consultation"".","This video can not be played Five takeaways from Donald Trump's Oval Office address President Donald Trump's coronavirus travel ban on 26 European countries has been met with anger and confusion, with EU leaders accusing him of making the decision ""without consultation"". The Covid-19 pandemic is a ""global crisis"", said top European Union officials Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel. It ""requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,"" they said. The ban is due to go into effect on Friday at midnight EDT (0400 GMT). It affects only countries that are members ofthe Schengen border-free travel areaand does not affect US citizens, the UK, or Ireland. It is a major escalation in the response to Covid-19 by Mr Trump, who has been accused of inaction. However, the ban was met with frustration in Washington as well as abroad. On Thursday, the US leader said he did not inform his EU counterparts because ""it takes time"". ""We had to move quickly,"" Mr Trump said, adding that the EU did not consult the US when raising taxes on American goods. AnalysisbyTara McKelvey, BBC White House correspondent The European ambassador was, naturally, diplomatic. ""We feel there should have been cooperation rather than action that targets one continent,"" the diplomat, who asked not to be named, says on the phone, referring to the travel ban. Mr Trump's action took him and other ambassadors in Washington by surprise. Still he made his views about the travel ban, as well his frustration and anger about the restrictions, clear: ""We are not very pleased,"" he says. ""No."" Others are equally dismayed: the Atlantic Council's Daniel Fried, a former US ambassador to Poland, says he found the president's remarks disappointing: ""Anti-EU bashing is indulgence."" Ambassadors here in Washington, both current and former, are now waiting for the president's next move - with a fair amount of dread. As another former ambassador put it: ""I am not confident."" Over 1,300 confirmed cases of the virus have been reported in the US, with 38 deaths so far. Italy now has over 12,000 confirmed cases and 827 deaths, second to China. France, Spain and Germany have also seen a rise in cases. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Mr Trump called the ban the ""most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history"". He accused the EU of failing to take ""the same precautions"" as the US in fighting the virus to justify the ban. Stocks plummeted following Mr Trump's announcement, in which he said that the travel ban would also include trade and cargo. The statement was later retracted. Trading on Wall Street was stopped on Thursday morning after theDow Jones dropped 7% and UK indices fell to their lowest since the 2008 financial crisis. Tom Bossert, Mr Trump's former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, criticised the ban, saying: ""There's little value to European travel restrictions. Poor use of time & energy.""

UK shares suffer worst day since 1987,"Shares around the world have plunged as investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth with government action insufficient to arrest the decline. The main UK index dropped more than 10% in its worst day since 1987. In the US, the Dow and S&P 500 were also hit by their steepest daily falls since 1987. The declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to ease financial strains. At the start of US trading, plummeting shares triggered an unusual automatic suspension in trading for the second time this week. When trade resumed 15 minutes later, shares continued to fall, taking cues from the slide in European markets. The S&P 500 fell 9.5% and the Nasdaq ended 9.4% lower, while losses on the UK's FTSE 100 wiped some Â£160.4bn off the market. In France and Germany, indexes cratered more than 12%. Eurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis Trump halts travel from Europe to US Coronavirus: LV pulls out of travel cover ""Markets are at a breaking point,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. ""No one knows what a total economic shutdown, however temporary, looks like."" The declines came after the US restricted travel from mainland Europe. Losses on European indexes accelerated afterthe eurozone's central bank failed to cut interest rates, although it did pledge fresh stimulus measures. The New York branch of the Federal Reserve said it was pumping $1.5tr to ease strains in the debt markets, offering increased overnight loans to banks and expanding the kinds of assets it will buy to keep firms lending. The announcement, which came after European markets had closed, briefly sent shares higher, but they dropped back by the end of the day. Rate cuts by the US central bank last week and the Bank of England on Wednesday also did little to soothe investors. ""What we really need is some huge confidence that this isn't going to cause the kind of stress and horrible loss of life [it has] in Italy everywhere else in the world,"" said former Goldman Sachs chief economist Lord Jim O'Neill. Stocks in Asia also saw big falls earlier, with Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closing 4.4% lower. Panicked selling led to trading halts in Brazil, while not a single company in the FTSE 100 index gained on Thursday. Travel companies saw some of the biggest falls, driven byUS President Donald Trump's 30-day ban on travellers from mainland Europe. Shares in Delta Air Lines and United Airlines - among the most affected by the ban - dropped more than 20%. In the UK, airline group IAG was down more than 15% and Tui fell 17%. Other companies warning on the impact of Covid-19 on Thursday included: BT Groupannounced that chief executive Philip Jansen had tested positive for coronavirus.

On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, tensions were high. Some traders were speculating the tumbles could trigger a second trading suspension - something that has never happened, not even during the financial crisis. Since the start of the market turmoil, indexes in the US and elsewhere have fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a threshold that is a red flag for a recession. ""It looks increasingly likely that the coming contraction will be deeper and more protracted than we were anticipating just a few days ago,"" said Jay Bryson, acting chief economist at Wells Fargo. ""The airline and hotel industries are in free fall, and there will be multiplier effects."" Investors in the US are now watching the US government response. US President Donald Trump said new, temporary travel restrictions would not apply to the UK In a presidential address on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he would extend deadlines for tax payments for those affected, increase low-cost loans to small businesses and provide financial relief for US workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to the illness. But Republicans and Democrats in Congress appear at odds over additional steps while Mr Trump's favoured approach - a tax cut for workers - has failed to garner widespread support. ""The stock market at least is saying it's not been enough yet,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. The Western world's three largest central banks have now pitted their collective firepower against the economic chill caused by the coronavirus - to little effect. Stock markets continue to slide. The FTSE 100 has had its worst day since Black Monday in October 1987. Observers again might wonder what new information is spooking investors, given that central banks have in the last 10 days done their best to halt the slide. In truth, there is little new - most traders already knew that the virus is likely to cause significant economic disruption likely to push most Western economies into recession. What may have spooked them again is President Donald Trump's decision to stop most travel between continental Europe and the United States - a big enough factor in itself, but more importantly, the manner in which it was done. There was no consultation, and Mr Trump looked uncharacteristically uncertain, as if he, too, had finally been panicked by the virus. There is also a small, but telling detail - Mr Trump first said the ban would apply to cargo flights, but then corrected himself to say it would not. A big proportion of cargo, however, is carried in the belly holds of passenger aircraft. If there are no passenger flights, there will be much less cargo, an enormous disruption to exporters and manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic.

UK coronavirus-related deaths rise to 10,"Two more people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK deaths to 10. There are now 596 confirmed cases in the UK, up from 456 on Wednesday - with 491 in England, 60in Scotland,20in Northern Irelandand 25in Wales. It comes as the government is expected to announce within hours that it is stepping up its coronavirus response. It is anticipated the UK will switch to tactics aimed at delaying its spread, rather than containing it. The latest two deaths were an 89-year-old at Charing Cross Hospital in London and a woman in her 60s at Queen's Hospital in Romford, NHS England said. They both had underlying health conditions. As of 09:00 GMT, a total of 29,764 people had been tested for the virus in the UK. The rise in confirmed cases - of 140 -  is the first time the day-on-day increase has been more than 100. LIVE UPDATES:Latest as Italy closes shops and US bans travel EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Meanwhile, the World Health Organization haslabelled the outbreakof the disease as a pandemic. Schools, colleges and other public facilities in the Republic of Irelandare to close until 29 March. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was expected to sign off plans to move from the ""containment"" phase of the outbreak to ""delay"" at the Cobra meeting on Thursday. Speaking as the meeting continued, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK has moved into the delay phase. She added that the Scottish government has decided that from Monday gatherings of more than 500 people will be cancelled - to reduce pressure on frontline services. Overnight, US President Donald Trumpsuspended travel to the US from 26 European countries- but not the UK or Ireland. In other developments: Three Leicester City players have self-isolatedafter showing symptoms of coronavirus Durham Universityhas cancelled classroom based lessons from Mondayand the London School of Economics has also said that ""all teaching activity"" and exams will be done online Scottish Secretary Alister Jack suggested new UK measures could include requiring people to stay at home if they have a raised temperature combined with symptoms of a cold Barchester, which runs more than 200 care homes across the UK, has asked visitors to ""minimise"" their visits A cabinet minister was confirmed as being in self-isolation while awaiting test results after coming into contact with minister Nadine Dorries,who has tested positive for the virus The Italian governmentforced all shops except food stores and pharmacies to closeas the country strengthens its lockdown due to the virus Real Madrid footballershave gone into quarantineafter a basketball player who shares training facilities with the La Liga club tested positive for the virus McLaren have withdrawn from this weekend's Australian Grand Prixafter a team member tested positive Princess Cruises, which has seen more than 700 cases of the disease reported on its cruise ships, has paused operations until 10 May The UK is currently in the ""containment"" phase - the first stage of the government'sfour-part plan,external: Containment Delay Mitigation Research - which runs alongside the other phases Delay is where ""social distancing"" measures will be considered - which could include restrictions on public gatherings above a certain number of people, although this is not thought likely at this stage. The move could also result in people who show even minor signs of respiratory tract infections - such as a cough - or a fever soon being toldto self-isolate. Speaking to BBC News, deputy chief medical officer for England Dr Jenny Harries said the introduction of social distancing measures should come at ""exactly the right time"". She also warned that members of the public wearing face masks could be putting themselves at more risk of contracting the virus - if they touch it with unwashed hands or put it on a surface they have not cleaned. ""You can actually trap the virus in the mask and start breathing it in,"" she said. The move to delay is an acknowledgement the virus cannot be contained. This is not unexpected given health officials have been clear in the past week or so that we should expect widespread community transmission. The key now is how quickly, and by how much, cases start to rise. A good scenario given the circumstances would be for infections to climb gradually over the coming months and for the peak weeks - where the risk is that half the overall cases could come quickly - to be kept under control. That will allow the health service to manage as best it can. The government has a range of powers at its disposal. But expect the most drastic to be reserved for just before the peak. The focus of today's advice is expected to be how the vulnerable can be protected - the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC Breakfast any new measures would seek to protect people who are especially vulnerable and would be ""guided by the science"". ""We now believe the virus could spread significantly,"" he said. This video can not be played The University of Westminster's Dr Adele McCormick demonstrates how to wash your hands Mr Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that blanket bans on foreign travel like that imposed by the US are unlikely to have a ""material effect"" on the spread of infection. He said the UK government was ""looking at interventions that provide very high clinical benefit and minimise the social impact"". The delay phase aims to lower the peak impact of the virus and push it away from the winter season - when pressures on the NHS are more acute because of issues including seasonal flu. Biggest daily rise as UK virus cases reach 460 What is a pandemic and why use the term now? Is the UK ready for a major outbreak? Delaying the outbreak's impact could also buy time for the testing of drugs and development of vaccines and/or improved therapies or tests to help reduce the impact of the disease. The Cobra committee last met on Monday, when it was decidedthe UK should remain in the containment phase. On Wednesday, in his first Budget, Mr Sunakpledged billions of pounds of investment to get the country through the coronavirus outbreak,as well as saying the NHS would get ""whatever resources it needs"". Meanwhile the Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru have cancelled their respective spring conferences. In response to the World Health Organization labelling the outbreak of the disease a pandemic, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whittytweeted,externalthat the UK ""had been planning"" for this situation. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Newsnight that alternative areas like operating theatres and recovery rooms could be adapted to help cope with increased hospital admissions. He said: ""The idea that we've got a fixed number of beds and capacity is not right."" Alison Cameron, 53, is one of 15 people in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea to have been diagnosed with the disease. She contacted NHS 111 after she began finding it difficult to breathe. ""I feel really unwell. I am currently in isolation. It is not pleasant,"" she said, adding: ""At the heart of it I feel like death on legs."" She believes she contracted the virus after a chance meeting with someone who was subsequently diagnosed with it. ""It's a horrible feeling not being able to go out and it is quite frightening,"" she said. ""I am more worried about my neighbours because they are quite vulnerable too."" Read more here. US President Donald Trump announced sweeping new travel restrictions on Europe in a bid to combat the spread of the virus. The ban applies to anyone who has been inthe EU's Schengen border-free areawithin 14 days prior to their arrival in the US. The travel order does not apply to US citizens.

EU condemns Trump travel ban,"This video can not be played Five takeaways from Donald Trump's Oval Office address President Donald Trump's coronavirus travel ban on 26 European countries has been met with anger and confusion, with EU leaders accusing him of making the decision ""without consultation"". The Covid-19 pandemic is a ""global crisis"", said top European Union officials Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel. It ""requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,"" they said. The ban is due to go into effect on Friday at midnight EDT (0400 GMT). It affects only countries that are members ofthe Schengen border-free travel areaand does not affect US citizens, the UK, or Ireland. It is a major escalation in the response to Covid-19 by Mr Trump, who has been accused of inaction. However, the ban was met with frustration in Washington as well as abroad. On Thursday, the US leader said he did not inform his EU counterparts because ""it takes time"". ""We had to move quickly,"" Mr Trump said, adding that the EU did not consult the US when raising taxes on American goods. AnalysisbyTara McKelvey, BBC White House correspondent The European ambassador was, naturally, diplomatic. ""We feel there should have been cooperation rather than action that targets one continent,"" the diplomat, who asked not to be named, says on the phone, referring to the travel ban. Mr Trump's action took him and other ambassadors in Washington by surprise. Still he made his views about the travel ban, as well his frustration and anger about the restrictions, clear: ""We are not very pleased,"" he says. ""No."" Others are equally dismayed: the Atlantic Council's Daniel Fried, a former US ambassador to Poland, says he found the president's remarks disappointing: ""Anti-EU bashing is indulgence."" Ambassadors here in Washington, both current and former, are now waiting for the president's next move - with a fair amount of dread. As another former ambassador put it: ""I am not confident."" Over 1,300 confirmed cases of the virus have been reported in the US, with 38 deaths so far. Italy now has over 12,000 confirmed cases and 827 deaths, second to China. France, Spain and Germany have also seen a rise in cases. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Mr Trump called the ban the ""most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history"". He accused the EU of failing to take ""the same precautions"" as the US in fighting the virus to justify the ban. Stocks plummeted following Mr Trump's announcement, in which he said that the travel ban would also include trade and cargo. The statement was later retracted. Trading on Wall Street was stopped on Thursday morning after theDow Jones dropped 7% and UK indices fell to their lowest since the 2008 financial crisis. Tom Bossert, Mr Trump's former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, criticised the ban, saying: ""There's little value to European travel restrictions. Poor use of time & energy.""

Trump halts travel from Europe to US,"This video can not be played Five takeaways from Donald Trump's Oval Office address US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping travel restrictions on 26 European countries in a bid to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The ban applies to travellers from countries which are members ofthe Schengen border-free travel area. The UK, Ireland and other non-Schengen countries are unaffected. US citizens are also exempt. The EU condemned the measures, which it said were taken ""unilaterally and without consultation"". The new rules go into effect on Friday at midnight EDT (0400 GMT) and mark a major escalation from the US president, who has been accused of inaction over the coronavirus. There are 1,135 confirmed cases of the virus across the US, with 38 deaths so far. Shares around the world fell furtherfollowing Mr Trump's announcement. At the start of US trading, shares plunged triggering an automatic temporary suspension in trading aimed at curbing panicky selling.

Justifying the travel restrictions, he accused the EU of failing to take ""the same precautions"" as the US in fighting the virus. In his speech he said all travel from Europe would be suspended, buta presidential proclamation later,externalsaid it would only apply to anyone who had been inthe EU's Schengen border-free areain the 14 days before their arrival in the US. Mr Trump also said the suspension would also apply to cargo coming from Europe into the US. He later tweeted to say that trade would ""in no way be affected"". The speech included plans to provide billions of dollars in loans to small businesses and the president urged Congress to free up more funds. President Trump said for most Americans the risk was ""very, very low"" adding, ""no nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States"". In its response the EU said the coronavirus was ""a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action"". ""The EU disapproves of the fact that the US decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,"" European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel said in a statement. Senior Democrats said it was ""alarming"",externalthat President Trump had not addressed a shortage of coronavirus testing kits in the US. ""The best way to help keep the American people safe and ensure their economic security is for the president to focus on fighting the spread of the coronavirus itself,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. On the travel ban, Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University, tweeted: ""Most of Europe is as safe as US.This will have no impact on US ... germs don't respect borders."",external Concern over the outbreak rose after a number of new cases were confirmed in the US earlier this month. Containment efforts have begun in earnest. Troops have been deployed to New Rochelle, just north of New York City, where one outbreak is believed to have originated. The National Guard will deliver food to some individuals who have been told to self-isolate there. The governor of Washington state has also banned large gatherings in several counties. The north-western state is the focal point of the outbreak in the US, accounting for 24 of at least 38 deaths across the country. Could the US do what Italy has done? Who Trump supporters blame for virus 'hysteria' How worried should the US be over coronavirus? What's the risk on public transport? In an unprecedented move,the National Basketball Association (NBA) announced that it would suspend the seasonafter Wednesday night's games. The decision came after one player for the Utah Jazz tested positive for the virus. The Oscar-winning actorTom Hanks, meanwhile, announced that he and his wife, the actress and singer Rita Wilson, had contracted the virus in Australia. Allow Twitter content?

Dr Anthony Fauci, director the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Congress that the outbreak was ""going to get worse"", and that depended on the ability to contain those infected. High medical costs make the virus particularly problematic in the US - many Americans avoid visiting their doctor because of unaffordable charges. A lack of paid sick leave is another concern, as are fears about the number of available tests. But Vice-President Mike Pence, who is in charge of the task force co-ordinating the response to the crisis, has said that ""any American can be tested, no restrictions, subject to doctor's orders"", and that insurers had promised to offset the charges.

How prepared is the UK for a major outbreak?,"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

Australian GP in doubt as McLaren pull out,"The Australian Grand Prix is the second race to be called off over coronavirus concerns The Australian Grand Prix has been called off after teams and drivers forced the hand of Formula 1's bosses. A decision to cancel the race was made in the early hours of Friday morning after a McLaren team member tested positive for the coronavirus in Melbourne. The race's abandonment was not made official for another eight hours. By that time Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen had flown home. And McLaren said later on Friday that 14 further team members had been placed in quarantine in their hotel for the next 14 days because of their close contact with the infected employee. The decision throws into doubt the rest of the F1 season, with the Bahrain Grand Prix due to take place next weekend without spectators the next race to come under scrutiny. BBC Sport understands Ferrari were the first team to make it clear they were not prepared to race in Melbourne in the circumstances. Confirmation of the abandonment in from the FIA and F1 came after Mercedes sent a letter requesting the cancellation of the race. Mercedes said: ""We share the disappointment of the sport's fans that this race cannot go ahead as planned. However, the physical and mental health and wellbeing of our team members and of the wider F1 community are our absolute priority. ""In light of the force majeure events we are experiencing with regards to the coronavirus pandemic, we no longer feel the safety of our employees can be guaranteed if we continue to take part in the event. ""If organisers try to press ahead with the weekend it appears at this stage as if not all the teams will take part."" The statement cancelling the race said a majority of teams suggested overnight they felt the race should not go ahead. Events developed rapidly following McLaren's decision to pull out of the race after their team member's positive coronavirus test. On Friday morning, with a statement cancelling the race still not forthcoming, Australian GP organisers initially told local media the race was going ahead as planned. This video can not be played 'Itâs a joke': fan anger as Australian GP cancelled due to coronavirus fears But Victoria state premier Daniel Andrews then announced if the race went ahead it would be without spectators. Legal complications delayed the announcement of the cancellation but the farcical situation will be seen by many to have damaged the reputations of both the F1 and the FIA. Coronavirus and sport - timeline Hamilton 'very surprised' by F1 stance World champion Lewis Hamiltonsaid on Thursday at the official F1 news conferencehe was ""very, very surprised"" the sport was pressing on with plans to continue with the race while the outbreak of the virus worsened and other sports suspended or cancelled events. An initial meeting of team bosses with F1 and FIA officials on Thursday night, after a tense day in the paddock at Albert Park, broke up with an agreement to carry on with Friday practice as normal and review the situation later that day. But the plans changed later in the evening as several insiders - including leading drivers - expressed their concerns about the idea of racing amid the risk of further cases of coronavirus in the tight-knit F1 paddock. The decision was reviewed at later meetings and eventually, at around 0200 Friday local time (1500 GMT on Thursday), the decision was made to call the race off. After that, Vettel and Raikkonen flew back to Europe on the same flight although Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas remain in Melbourne. Many F1 team members woke up thinking the race was going ahead, only to read news of its cancellation. On Friday morning, a senior source reconfirmed to BBC Sport, which first reported the information, that the race was still off. But in farcical scenes, crowds flocked to Albert Park expecting to see the cars out on track and organisers initially told Australian media that the race weekend was going ahead as planned. In total, eight F1 workershave been assessed and tested for Covid-19. Seven were cleared on Thursday but an eighth, from McLaren, tested positive. Australian Grand Prix organisers said in a statement a ninth person had been assessed and tested, with the result pending. This person was ""not associated with any F1 team, the FIA or associated suppliers"", the statement said. It now seems certain a huge question mark will hang over the Bahrain Grand Prix, scheduled to be the second meeting of the season on 22 March. A decision is also expected imminentlyon the Vietnam Grand Prix, scheduled for 5 April, after the government in Hanoi banned travel into the country for anyone who has been in Italy - among other locations - in the previous 14 days. F1 chief executive Chase Carey was in Hanoi on Thursday trying to find a way around the restrictions. The Chinese Grand Prix, scheduled to be the fourth race,was postponed in Februaryafter government officials said it could not go ahead. The next race after Vietnam is scheduled to be the Dutch Grand Prix on 5 May, the start of a run of three races in four weekends that also includes the Spanish and Monaco events. But with the coronavirus situation developing by the day, and countries imposing tighter restrictions on travel, it is impossible to know at this stage whether any of those races can go ahead. The decision to cancel the race in Australia raises huge questions about the future of the sport this year. F1 authorities faced criticism for their decision to press ahead with the season-opening race, and it is true the teams feel they lacked direction and leadership from the powers that be. But the FIA and F1 were responding to advice from local authorities, with Australian officials saying earlier in the week they saw no reason for their race not to go ahead. The fact it has now been called off is an illustration of the speed with which the coronavirus pandemic has developed across the globe. But it also shines a spotlight on what some will see as the F1 authorities having rather too firm a focus on 'keeping the show on the road' - as well as the dollars rolling in - and not enough on the realities of what really matters. Now, not only does the sport not know when - or even if - the season can start, but the authorities, teams and race promoters have to face the question of what happens to all the fees that have been paid for races that might now never happen. The answer to that may well be different for separate events, and it will depend on who has made this decision, who pays for the race in each specific country, and the legal and contractual complexities of each deal. In addition, there are the knock-on effects for the teams themselves, as a large proportion of their income comes from those race fees. Some teams need that income more than others - and some need it very much indeed. F1 is entering uncharted waters, and to describe them as choppy could be a massive understatement.

US trading suspended again as global stocks plunge,"Shares around the world have plunged as investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth with government action insufficient to arrest the decline. The main UK index dropped more than 10% in its worst day since 1987. In the US, the Dow and S&P 500 were also hit by their steepest daily falls since 1987. The declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to ease financial strains. At the start of US trading, plummeting shares triggered an unusual automatic suspension in trading for the second time this week. When trade resumed 15 minutes later, shares continued to fall, taking cues from the slide in European markets. The S&P 500 fell 9.5% and the Nasdaq ended 9.4% lower, while losses on the UK's FTSE 100 wiped some Â£160.4bn off the market. In France and Germany, indexes cratered more than 12%. Eurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis Trump halts travel from Europe to US Coronavirus: LV pulls out of travel cover ""Markets are at a breaking point,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. ""No one knows what a total economic shutdown, however temporary, looks like."" The declines came after the US restricted travel from mainland Europe. Losses on European indexes accelerated afterthe eurozone's central bank failed to cut interest rates, although it did pledge fresh stimulus measures. The New York branch of the Federal Reserve said it was pumping $1.5tr to ease strains in the debt markets, offering increased overnight loans to banks and expanding the kinds of assets it will buy to keep firms lending. The announcement, which came after European markets had closed, briefly sent shares higher, but they dropped back by the end of the day. Rate cuts by the US central bank last week and the Bank of England on Wednesday also did little to soothe investors. ""What we really need is some huge confidence that this isn't going to cause the kind of stress and horrible loss of life [it has] in Italy everywhere else in the world,"" said former Goldman Sachs chief economist Lord Jim O'Neill. Stocks in Asia also saw big falls earlier, with Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closing 4.4% lower. Panicked selling led to trading halts in Brazil, while not a single company in the FTSE 100 index gained on Thursday. Travel companies saw some of the biggest falls, driven byUS President Donald Trump's 30-day ban on travellers from mainland Europe. Shares in Delta Air Lines and United Airlines - among the most affected by the ban - dropped more than 20%. In the UK, airline group IAG was down more than 15% and Tui fell 17%. Other companies warning on the impact of Covid-19 on Thursday included: BT Groupannounced that chief executive Philip Jansen had tested positive for coronavirus. It said he had ""relatively mild"" symptoms and would work remotely Broadcomsaid uncertainty about demand was prompting it to withdraw its 2020 growth forecast Norwegiansaid it would ground 40% of its long-haul fleet and cancel up to 25% of its short-haul flights until the end of May WH Smithissued a profit warning after the outbreak hit sales in its travel division, which includes store at airports and train stations Cineworldshares fell by more than 20%. It said that in a worst-case scenario, there was a risk it might not be able to repay its debts Estate agent Savillssaid the outbreak had caused a big drop in transactions in China and across Asia Princess Cruises,a line owned by Carnival, said it would suspend operations for 60 days.Vikingannounced a similar move Disneyclosed its California parks until the end of March Oil prices also fell, with Brent crude down more than 8% at about $33 a barrel. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, tensions were high. Some traders were speculating the tumbles could trigger a second trading suspension - something that has never happened, not even during the financial crisis. Since the start of the market turmoil, indexes in the US and elsewhere have fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a threshold that is a red flag for a recession. ""It looks increasingly likely that the coming contraction will be deeper and more protracted than we were anticipating just a few days ago,"" said Jay Bryson, acting chief economist at Wells Fargo. ""The airline and hotel industries are in free fall, and there will be multiplier effects."" Investors in the US are now watching the US government response. US President Donald Trump said new, temporary travel restrictions would not apply to the UK In a presidential address on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he would extend deadlines for tax payments for those affected, increase low-cost loans to small businesses and provide financial relief for US workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to the illness. But Republicans and Democrats in Congress appear at odds over additional steps while Mr Trump's favoured approach - a tax cut for workers - has failed to garner widespread support. ""The stock market at least is saying it's not been enough yet,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. The Western world's three largest central banks have now pitted their collective firepower against the economic chill caused by the coronavirus - to little effect. Stock markets continue to slide. The FTSE 100 has had its worst day since Black Monday in October 1987. Observers again might wonder what new information is spooking investors, given that central banks have in the last 10 days done their best to halt the slide. In truth, there is little new - most traders already knew that the virus is likely to cause significant economic disruption likely to push most Western economies into recession. What may have spooked them again is President Donald Trump's decision to stop most travel between continental Europe and the United States - a big enough factor in itself, but more importantly, the manner in which it was done. There was no consultation, and Mr Trump looked uncharacteristically uncertain, as if he, too, had finally been panicked by the virus. There is also a small, but telling detail - Mr Trump first said the ban would apply to cargo flights, but then corrected himself to say it would not. A big proportion of cargo, however, is carried in the belly holds of passenger aircraft. If there are no passenger flights, there will be much less cargo, an enormous disruption to exporters and manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic.

UK expected to step up coronavirus response,"Two more people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK deaths to 10. There are now 596 confirmed cases in the UK, up from 456 on Wednesday - with 491 in England, 60in Scotland,20in Northern Irelandand 25in Wales. It comes as the government is expected to announce within hours that it is stepping up its coronavirus response. It is anticipated the UK will switch to tactics aimed at delaying its spread, rather than containing it. The latest two deaths were an 89-year-old at Charing Cross Hospital in London and a woman in her 60s at Queen's Hospital in Romford, NHS England said. They both had underlying health conditions. As of 09:00 GMT, a total of 29,764 people had been tested for the virus in the UK. The rise in confirmed cases - of 140 -  is the first time the day-on-day increase has been more than 100. LIVE UPDATES:Latest as Italy closes shops and US bans travel EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Meanwhile, the World Health Organization haslabelled the outbreakof the disease as a pandemic. Schools, colleges and other public facilities in the Republic of Irelandare to close until 29 March. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was expected to sign off plans to move from the ""containment"" phase of the outbreak to ""delay"" at the Cobra meeting on Thursday. Speaking as the meeting continued, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK has moved into the delay phase. She added that the Scottish government has decided that from Monday gatherings of more than 500 people will be cancelled - to reduce pressure on frontline services. Overnight, US President Donald Trumpsuspended travel to the US from 26 European countries- but not the UK or Ireland. In other developments: Three Leicester City players have self-isolatedafter showing symptoms of coronavirus Durham Universityhas cancelled classroom based lessons from Mondayand the London School of Economics has also said that ""all teaching activity"" and exams will be done online Scottish Secretary Alister Jack suggested new UK measures could include requiring people to stay at home if they have a raised temperature combined with symptoms of a cold Barchester, which runs more than 200 care homes across the UK, has asked visitors to ""minimise"" their visits A cabinet minister was confirmed as being in self-isolation while awaiting test results after coming into contact with minister Nadine Dorries,who has tested positive for the virus The Italian governmentforced all shops except food stores and pharmacies to closeas the country strengthens its lockdown due to the virus Real Madrid footballershave gone into quarantineafter a basketball player who shares training facilities with the La Liga club tested positive for the virus McLaren have withdrawn from this weekend's Australian Grand Prixafter a team member tested positive Princess Cruises, which has seen more than 700 cases of the disease reported on its cruise ships, has paused operations until 10 May The UK is currently in the ""containment"" phase - the first stage of the government'sfour-part plan,external: Containment Delay Mitigation Research - which runs alongside the other phases Delay is where ""social distancing"" measures will be considered - which could include restrictions on public gatherings above a certain number of people, although this is not thought likely at this stage. The move could also result in people who show even minor signs of respiratory tract infections - such as a cough - or a fever soon being toldto self-isolate. Speaking to BBC News, deputy chief medical officer for England Dr Jenny Harries said the introduction of social distancing measures should come at ""exactly the right time"". She also warned that members of the public wearing face masks could be putting themselves at more risk of contracting the virus - if they touch it with unwashed hands or put it on a surface they have not cleaned. ""You can actually trap the virus in the mask and start breathing it in,"" she said. The move to delay is an acknowledgement the virus cannot be contained. This is not unexpected given health officials have been clear in the past week or so that we should expect widespread community transmission. The key now is how quickly, and by how much, cases start to rise. A good scenario given the circumstances would be for infections to climb gradually over the coming months and for the peak weeks - where the risk is that half the overall cases could come quickly - to be kept under control. That will allow the health service to manage as best it can. The government has a range of powers at its disposal. But expect the most drastic to be reserved for just before the peak. The focus of today's advice is expected to be how the vulnerable can be protected - the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC Breakfast any new measures would seek to protect people who are especially vulnerable and would be ""guided by the science"". ""We now believe the virus could spread significantly,"" he said. This video can not be played The University of Westminster's Dr Adele McCormick demonstrates how to wash your hands Mr Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that blanket bans on foreign travel like that imposed by the US are unlikely to have a ""material effect"" on the spread of infection. He said the UK government was ""looking at interventions that provide very high clinical benefit and minimise the social impact"". The delay phase aims to lower the peak impact of the virus and push it away from the winter season - when pressures on the NHS are more acute because of issues including seasonal flu. Biggest daily rise as UK virus cases reach 460 What is a pandemic and why use the term now? Is the UK ready for a major outbreak? Delaying the outbreak's impact could also buy time for the testing of drugs and development of vaccines and/or improved therapies or tests to help reduce the impact of the disease. The Cobra committee last met on Monday, when it was decidedthe UK should remain in the containment phase. On Wednesday, in his first Budget, Mr Sunakpledged billions of pounds of investment to get the country through the coronavirus outbreak,as well as saying the NHS would get ""whatever resources it needs"". Meanwhile the Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru have cancelled their respective spring conferences. In response to the World Health Organization labelling the outbreak of the disease a pandemic, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whittytweeted,externalthat the UK ""had been planning"" for this situation. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Newsnight that alternative areas like operating theatres and recovery rooms could be adapted to help cope with increased hospital admissions. He said: ""The idea that we've got a fixed number of beds and capacity is not right."" Alison Cameron, 53, is one of 15 people in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea to have been diagnosed with the disease. She contacted NHS 111 after she began finding it difficult to breathe. ""I feel really unwell. I am currently in isolation. It is not pleasant,"" she said, adding: ""At the heart of it I feel like death on legs."" She believes she contracted the virus after a chance meeting with someone who was subsequently diagnosed with it. ""It's a horrible feeling not being able to go out and it is quite frightening,"" she said. ""I am more worried about my neighbours because they are quite vulnerable too."" Read more here.

"'No apology' for borrowing, says chancellor","Rishi Sunak delivered the Budget to the Commons on Wednesday Borrowing more money to invest into the UK is ""the right economic thing to do"", the chancellor has said. Rishi Sunak told the BBC that interest rates were at a ""multi-decade low"" and he was ""not going to make an apology"" for the Budget - which included a Â£30bn package of investment. The Bank of England announceda cut in interest rateson Wednesday. But the Resolution Foundation warned of a Â£575 a year blow to households, even before the impact of coronavirus. The think tank said the mark down of the UK economy by the Office of Budget Responsibility, without taking the outbreak into account, was ""incredibly grim and yet still unbelievably optimistic"". Its chief executive, Torsten Bell, said: ""In reality, once we take the economic impact of coronavirus into account, this is the weakest official growth outlook on record."" Labour's John McDonnell told the BBC's Today programme he welcomed more investment from the government, but ""10 years of austerity brought the country to our knees"" and the Budget was ""only going part way to making up"" for Tory cuts. Sunak pumps billions into economy to combat virus Get Britain building, says Sunak on infrastructure The chancellor's very large cheque book The chancellor said the plans he laid out on Wednesday were a ""significant step change"" for the government and the amount it would invest in infrastructure. As well as a Â£5bn emergency response fund for the NHS and a number of other measures to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, he announced spending of more than Â£600bn on roads, rail, housing and broadband across the next five years. This video can not be played Sunak: Budget is a ""very coherent plan"" But questioned over the OBR's low growth forecasts in the short term, Mr Sunak said the organisation had praised the government's long-term investment plans. ""We can look at that as see we are on the right track with the plans we are doing, and it will start to have an immediate effect on people,"" he told Today. Former Prime Minister Theresa May urged ""restraint and caution"" on spending after the Budget announcement. She told the Commons: ""Although spending a lot of money may be popular and may seem the natural thing to do, there is, of course, that necessity to have a realistic assessment of the longer term impact of those decisions and of the longer term consequences. ""It is also necessary to ensure that we have that restraint and caution that enables us to make the public finances continue to be strong into the future."" Mr Sunak defended his plans, saying he would be sticking to the fiscal rules set out in his the Tory's election manifesto. ""But we are going to take advantage of these historically and unprecedented very low interest rates to invest in the long-term productivity of our economy,"" he said. ""That is, I think, the right economic thing to do, whilst overall having stable management of our debt."" Mr Sunak added: ""I am not going to make an apology for responding at scale in a comprehensive fashion to the immediate challenges we face from coronavirus. I do think that is the right thing to do."" This is a new government with a new chancellor much hungrier for spending, much hungrier for borrowing and much less bothered about the size of the national debt - and we are talking about very, very big numbers here. The case the government makes is: it is coherent and correct to do this as it is dead cheap for governments to borrow in the long term. Rishi Sunak believes that what started off as a temporary, extraordinary period of low interest rates is basically now locked in for the long term. It is the economic and political fashion now to think it is going to be a long-term situation, therefore if borrowing is so cheap, why wouldn't you want to be more flash with the cash? But with respect to the economists, sometimes their crystal balls are a bit wonky, things can change, and some Conservatives on the backbenches believe this may not be the time to run up a new, additional, huge overdraft. However, the government's judgement is 'now is the time' - not least because they want to be able to keep the very many promises they have made to electorate. Easy budgets are ones where you stand up and write big cheques. But sometimes they pave the way for much harder budgets in the years to come. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn.

UK stocks plunge as US brings in virus travel ban,"Shares around the world have plunged as investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth with government action insufficient to arrest the decline. The main UK index dropped more than 10% in its worst day since 1987. In the US, the Dow and S&P 500 were also hit by their steepest daily falls since 1987. The declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to ease financial strains. At the start of US trading, plummeting shares triggered an unusual automatic suspension in trading for the second time this week. When trade resumed 15 minutes later, shares continued to fall, taking cues from the slide in European markets. The S&P 500 fell 9.5% and the Nasdaq ended 9.4% lower, while losses on the UK's FTSE 100 wiped some Â£160.4bn off the market. In France and Germany, indexes cratered more than 12%. Eurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis Trump halts travel from Europe to US Coronavirus: LV pulls out of travel cover ""Markets are at a breaking point,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. ""No one knows what a total economic shutdown, however temporary, looks like."" The declines came after the US restricted travel from mainland Europe. Losses on European indexes accelerated afterthe eurozone's central bank failed to cut interest rates, although it did pledge fresh stimulus measures. The New York branch of the Federal Reserve said it was pumping $1.5tr to ease strains in the debt markets, offering increased overnight loans to banks and expanding the kinds of assets it will buy to keep firms lending. The announcement, which came after European markets had closed, briefly sent shares higher, but they dropped back by the end of the day. Rate cuts by the US central bank last week and the Bank of England on Wednesday also did little to soothe investors. ""What we really need is some huge confidence that this isn't going to cause the kind of stress and horrible loss of life [it has] in Italy everywhere else in the world,"" said former Goldman Sachs chief economist Lord Jim O'Neill. Stocks in Asia also saw big falls earlier, with Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closing 4.4% lower. Panicked selling led to trading halts in Brazil, while not a single company in the FTSE 100 index gained on Thursday. Travel companies saw some of the biggest falls, driven byUS President Donald Trump's 30-day ban on travellers from mainland Europe. Shares in Delta Air Lines and United Airlines - among the most affected by the ban - dropped more than 20%. In the UK, airline group IAG was down more than 15% and Tui fell 17%. Other companies warning on the impact of Covid-19 on Thursday included: BT Groupannounced that chief executive Philip Jansen had tested positive for coronavirus. It said he had ""relatively mild"" symptoms and would work remotely Broadcomsaid uncertainty about demand was prompting it to withdraw its 2020 growth forecast Norwegiansaid it would ground 40% of its long-haul fleet and cancel up to 25% of its short-haul flights until the end of May WH Smithissued a profit warning after the outbreak hit sales in its travel division, which includes store at airports and train stations Cineworldshares fell by more than 20%. It said that in a worst-case scenario, there was a risk it might not be able to repay its debts Estate agent Savillssaid the outbreak had caused a big drop in transactions in China and across Asia Princess Cruises,a line owned by Carnival, said it would suspend operations for 60 days.Vikingannounced a similar move Disneyclosed its California parks until the end of March Oil prices also fell, with Brent crude down more than 8% at about $33 a barrel. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, tensions were high. Some traders were speculating the tumbles could trigger a second trading suspension - something that has never happened, not even during the financial crisis. Since the start of the market turmoil, indexes in the US and elsewhere have fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a threshold that is a red flag for a recession. ""It looks increasingly likely that the coming contraction will be deeper and more protracted than we were anticipating just a few days ago,"" said Jay Bryson, acting chief economist at Wells Fargo. ""The airline and hotel industries are in free fall, and there will be multiplier effects."" Investors in the US are now watching the US government response. US President Donald Trump said new, temporary travel restrictions would not apply to the UK In a presidential address on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he would extend deadlines for tax payments for those affected, increase low-cost loans to small businesses and provide financial relief for US workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to the illness. But Republicans and Democrats in Congress appear at odds over additional steps while Mr Trump's favoured approach - a tax cut for workers - has failed to garner widespread support. ""The stock market at least is saying it's not been enough yet,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. The Western world's three largest central banks have now pitted their collective firepower against the economic chill caused by the coronavirus - to little effect. Stock markets continue to slide. The FTSE 100 has had its worst day since Black Monday in October 1987. Observers again might wonder what new information is spooking investors, given that central banks have in the last 10 days done their best to halt the slide. In truth, there is little new - most traders already knew that the virus is likely to cause significant economic disruption likely to push most Western economies into recession. What may have spooked them again is President Donald Trump's decision to stop most travel between continental Europe and the United States - a big enough factor in itself, but more importantly, the manner in which it was done. There was no consultation, and Mr Trump looked uncharacteristically uncertain, as if he, too, had finally been panicked by the virus. There is also a small, but telling detail - Mr Trump first said the ban would apply to cargo flights, but then corrected himself to say it would not. A big proportion of cargo, however, is carried in the belly holds of passenger aircraft. If there are no passenger flights, there will be much less cargo, an enormous disruption to exporters and manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic.

McLaren pull out of Australian GP,"The Australian Grand Prix is the second race to be called off over coronavirus concerns The Australian Grand Prix has been called off after teams and drivers forced the hand of Formula 1's bosses. A decision to cancel the race was made in the early hours of Friday morning after a McLaren team member tested positive for the coronavirus in Melbourne. The race's abandonment was not made official for another eight hours. By that time Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen had flown home. And McLaren said later on Friday that 14 further team members had been placed in quarantine in their hotel for the next 14 days because of their close contact with the infected employee. The decision throws into doubt the rest of the F1 season, with the Bahrain Grand Prix due to take place next weekend without spectators the next race to come under scrutiny. BBC Sport understands Ferrari were the first team to make it clear they were not prepared to race in Melbourne in the circumstances. Confirmation of the abandonment in from the FIA and F1 came after Mercedes sent a letter requesting the cancellation of the race. Mercedes said: ""We share the disappointment of the sport's fans that this race cannot go ahead as planned. However, the physical and mental health and wellbeing of our team members and of the wider F1 community are our absolute priority. ""In light of the force majeure events we are experiencing with regards to the coronavirus pandemic, we no longer feel the safety of our employees can be guaranteed if we continue to take part in the event. ""If organisers try to press ahead with the weekend it appears at this stage as if not all the teams will take part."" The statement cancelling the race said a majority of teams suggested overnight they felt the race should not go ahead. Events developed rapidly following McLaren's decision to pull out of the race after their team member's positive coronavirus test. On Friday morning, with a statement cancelling the race still not forthcoming, Australian GP organisers initially told local media the race was going ahead as planned. This video can not be played 'Itâs a joke': fan anger as Australian GP cancelled due to coronavirus fears But Victoria state premier Daniel Andrews then announced if the race went ahead it would be without spectators. Legal complications delayed the announcement of the cancellation but the farcical situation will be seen by many to have damaged the reputations of both the F1 and the FIA. Coronavirus and sport - timeline Hamilton 'very surprised' by F1 stance World champion Lewis Hamiltonsaid on Thursday at the official F1 news conferencehe was ""very, very surprised"" the sport was pressing on with plans to continue with the race while the outbreak of the virus worsened and other sports suspended or cancelled events. An initial meeting of team bosses with F1 and FIA officials on Thursday night, after a tense day in the paddock at Albert Park, broke up with an agreement to carry on with Friday practice as normal and review the situation later that day. But the plans changed later in the evening as several insiders - including leading drivers - expressed their concerns about the idea of racing amid the risk of further cases of coronavirus in the tight-knit F1 paddock. The decision was reviewed at later meetings and eventually, at around 0200 Friday local time (1500 GMT on Thursday), the decision was made to call the race off. After that, Vettel and Raikkonen flew back to Europe on the same flight although Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas remain in Melbourne. Many F1 team members woke up thinking the race was going ahead, only to read news of its cancellation. On Friday morning, a senior source reconfirmed to BBC Sport, which first reported the information, that the race was still off. But in farcical scenes, crowds flocked to Albert Park expecting to see the cars out on track and organisers initially told Australian media that the race weekend was going ahead as planned. In total, eight F1 workershave been assessed and tested for Covid-19. Seven were cleared on Thursday but an eighth, from McLaren, tested positive. Australian Grand Prix organisers said in a statement a ninth person had been assessed and tested, with the result pending. This person was ""not associated with any F1 team, the FIA or associated suppliers"", the statement said. It now seems certain a huge question mark will hang over the Bahrain Grand Prix, scheduled to be the second meeting of the season on 22 March. A decision is also expected imminentlyon the Vietnam Grand Prix, scheduled for 5 April, after the government in Hanoi banned travel into the country for anyone who has been in Italy - among other locations - in the previous 14 days. F1 chief executive Chase Carey was in Hanoi on Thursday trying to find a way around the restrictions. The Chinese Grand Prix, scheduled to be the fourth race,was postponed in Februaryafter government officials said it could not go ahead. The next race after Vietnam is scheduled to be the Dutch Grand Prix on 5 May, the start of a run of three races in four weekends that also includes the Spanish and Monaco events. But with the coronavirus situation developing by the day, and countries imposing tighter restrictions on travel, it is impossible to know at this stage whether any of those races can go ahead. The decision to cancel the race in Australia raises huge questions about the future of the sport this year. F1 authorities faced criticism for their decision to press ahead with the season-opening race, and it is true the teams feel they lacked direction and leadership from the powers that be. But the FIA and F1 were responding to advice from local authorities, with Australian officials saying earlier in the week they saw no reason for their race not to go ahead. The fact it has now been called off is an illustration of the speed with which the coronavirus pandemic has developed across the globe. But it also shines a spotlight on what some will see as the F1 authorities having rather too firm a focus on 'keeping the show on the road' - as well as the dollars rolling in - and not enough on the realities of what really matters. Now, not only does the sport not know when - or even if - the season can start, but the authorities, teams and race promoters have to face the question of what happens to all the fees that have been paid for races that might now never happen. The answer to that may well be different for separate events, and it will depend on who has made this decision, who pays for the race in each specific country, and the legal and contractual complexities of each deal. In addition, there are the knock-on effects for the teams themselves, as a large proportion of their income comes from those race fees. Some teams need that income more than others - and some need it very much indeed. F1 is entering uncharted waters, and to describe them as choppy could be a massive understatement.

La Liga suspended with Real in quarantine,"Real Madrid fans wear masks at a recent game at the Bernabeu Spain's La Liga, the Dutch Eredivisie, Portugal's Primeira Liga and USA's Major League Soccer have been suspended over coronavirus concerns. There will be no action in the Spanish top flight for ""at least the next two rounds of matches"" as a result of the quarantine of the Real Madrid squad. Netherlands' top two leagues have also been suspended for the same period. The 2020 Major League Soccer season - which started less than two weeks ago - has been suspended for 30 days. La Liga took action after a Real Madrid basketball player, who shares training facilities with the football club, tested positive for the virus. Real's match against Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday was postponed on Thursday. ""The recommendation has been made to quarantine both the basketball first team and the football first team, given that the two squads share facilities in Ciudad Real Madrid,"" a Real statement said. The Spanish second division has also been suspended and La Liga said it will ""revaluate"" the situation following the completion of quarantine ""in the affected clubs and other possible situations that may arise"". Real, who are second in La Liga, were due to host Eibar on Friday and had already cancelled all pre-match media duties. In a statement, the Eredivisie said: ""All matches in the Eredivisie and Keuken Kampioen Divisie [second tier] have been suspended for the next two match days because of the coronavirus outbreak."" Ajax currently lead the top flight on goal difference from AZ Alkmaar. It follows the Dutch government's ban on events of more than 100 people. The suspension of MLS comes a day after the NBA announced its intention to halt its season. A statement from MLS commissioner Don Garber read: ""Our clubs were united today in the decision to temporarily suspend our season - based on the advice and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), and other public health authorities, and in the best interest of our fans, players, officials and employees. ""We'd like to thank our fans for their continued support during this challenging time."" The Portuguese football chiefs had announced games would be played behind closed doors before announcing a full suspension, for an indefinite period, just a few hours later. The decision was made following a meeting with that included members of the league, national federation and players' union. The coronavirus outbreak, now declared a pandemic, has led to widespread disruption of sporting fixtures around the world. In Italy, all sport is suspended, including Serie A until 3 April, with the country in lockdown. Juventus and Italy centre-back Daniele Rugani says he is ""fine""after testing positive for the virus, and Reuters have reported that the entire Juve squad will spend two weeks in quarantine. Two Europa League last-16 first-leg fixtures scheduled for Thursday have been postponed and a number will be played behind closed doors,including Manchester United's trip to LASK.

Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said the measures take effect from 18:00 on Thursday until 29 March. He said that Northern Ireland and the UK would be briefed on developments. Some 27 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Ireland on Thursday, according to the Department of Health. There are now 70 total confirmed cases in the country. The first death linked to coronavirus in Ireland - involving an elderly woman with underlying health conditions - was announced on Wednesday. Meanwhile two more people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 10. There are now 596 confirmed cases in the UK. On Thursdayanother two more caseswere diagnosed in Northern Ireland, bringing the total to 20. Making the announcement, Mr Varadkar added that indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people andoutdoor gatherings of more than 500 should be cancelled.He said people should work remotely if possible. Airports and ports will remain open. Northern Ireland's schools and colleges will not close at this stage. First Minister Arlene Foster said NI would follow scientific advice. Ireland's chief medical officer Tony Holohan said ""he recognises the differences"" on the island of Ireland in the way governments are dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak. Mr Holohan said: ""We have assessed the situation from our point of view and we believe that closing schools is an important part of the strategy for the reasons of ultimately protecting older and vulnerable people from schoolchildren who may not be significantly affected in terms of the illness."" Earlier on Thursday, stocks tumbled around the worldafter US President Donald Trump restricted travelto the US from mainland Europe in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The UK and Ireland were not included. Mr Trump announced a ban on travellers from 26 European countries entering the United States for 30 days, starting on Friday.

Coronavirus: Live coverage It employs more than 750 staff at its factory in Strabane, County Tyrone, near the border with County Donegal in the Republic. Kieran Kennedy said: ""That will be very challenging for a lot of our staff. It will have a real impact on our manufacturing."" The taoiseach said he realised the restrictions would be a ""real shock"". ""It is going to involve big changes in the way we live our lives and I know I'm asking people to make enormous sacrifices but we're doing it for each other,"" Mr Varadkar said. ""Our economy will suffer but it will bounce back. ""Lost time in school or college will be recovered and in time our lives will go back to normal. ""Ireland is a great nation, we're great people, we've experienced hardship and struggle before, we've overcome many trials in the past."" Mr Varadkar said shops should remain open and public transport will continue to operate. In other developments: TheUK government is expected to announce that it is stepping up its responseto the coronavirus.

Trump halts travel from Europe to USThe US restricts arrivals from 26 European countries in a bid to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Five takeaways from Donald Trump's Oval Office address US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping travel restrictions on 26 European countries in a bid to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The ban applies to travellers from countries which are members ofthe Schengen border-free travel area. The UK, Ireland and other non-Schengen countries are unaffected. US citizens are also exempt. The EU condemned the measures, which it said were taken ""unilaterally and without consultation"". The new rules go into effect on Friday at midnight EDT (0400 GMT) and mark a major escalation from the US president, who has been accused of inaction over the coronavirus. There are 1,135 confirmed cases of the virus across the US, with 38 deaths so far. Shares around the world fell furtherfollowing Mr Trump's announcement. At the start of US trading, shares plunged triggering an automatic temporary suspension in trading aimed at curbing panicky selling.

Justifying the travel restrictions, he accused the EU of failing to take ""the same precautions"" as the US in fighting the virus. In his speech he said all travel from Europe would be suspended, buta presidential proclamation later,externalsaid it would only apply to anyone who had been inthe EU's Schengen border-free areain the 14 days before their arrival in the US. Mr Trump also said the suspension would also apply to cargo coming from Europe into the US. He later tweeted to say that trade would ""in no way be affected"". The speech included plans to provide billions of dollars in loans to small businesses and the president urged Congress to free up more funds. President Trump said for most Americans the risk was ""very, very low"" adding, ""no nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States"". In its response the EU said the coronavirus was ""a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action"". ""The EU disapproves of the fact that the US decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,"" European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel said in a statement. Senior Democrats said it was ""alarming"",externalthat President Trump had not addressed a shortage of coronavirus testing kits in the US. ""The best way to help keep the American people safe and ensure their economic security is for the president to focus on fighting the spread of the coronavirus itself,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. On the travel ban, Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University, tweeted: ""Most of Europe is as safe as US.This will have no impact on US ... germs don't respect borders."",external Concern over the outbreak rose after a number of new cases were confirmed in the US earlier this month. Containment efforts have begun in earnest. Troops have been deployed to New Rochelle, just north of New York City, where one outbreak is believed to have originated. The National Guard will deliver food to some individuals who have been told to self-isolate there. The governor of Washington state has also banned large gatherings in several counties.

Dr Anthony Fauci, director the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Congress that the outbreak was ""going to get worse"", and that depended on the ability to contain those infected. High medical costs make the virus particularly problematic in the US - many Americans avoid visiting their doctor because of unaffordable charges. A lack of paid sick leave is another concern, as are fears about the number of available tests. But Vice-President Mike Pence, who is in charge of the task force co-ordinating the response to the crisis, has said that ""any American can be tested, no restrictions, subject to doctor's orders"", and that insurers had promised to offset the charges.

Greenland and Antarctica ice loss accelerating,"This video can not be played Why is Antarctica's mighty Thwaites Glacier melting? Earth's great ice sheets, Greenland and Antarctica, are now losing mass six times faster than they were in the 1990s thanks to warming conditions. A comprehensive review of satellite data acquired at both poles is unequivocal in its assessment of accelerating trends, say scientists. Between them, Greenland and Antarctica lost 6.4 trillion tonnes of ice in the period from 1992 to 2017. This was sufficient to push up global sea-levels by 17.8mm. ""That's not a good news story,"" said Prof Andrew Shepherd from the University of Leeds in the UK. ""Today, the ice sheets contribute about a third of all sea-level rise, whereas in the 1990s, their contribution was actually pretty small at about 5%. This has important implications for the future, for coastal flooding and erosion,"" he told BBC News. The researcher co-leads a project called theIce Sheet Mass Balance Intercomparison Exercise, or Imbie,external. Deepest point on land found in Antarctica '56 lakes' found under Greenland ice Journey to the 'doomsday glacier' It's a team of experts who have reviewed polar measurements acquired by observational spacecraft over nearly three decades. These are satellites that have tracked the changing volume, flow and gravity of the ice sheets. This video can not be played Prof Shepherd: ""Whatever coastal planning measures are being planned, they need to be built sooner"" Imbie's Antarctica assessmentwas lodged with the journal Nature in 2018;its Greenland summarywas published in the print edition of the periodical this week. The team has used the latest milestone to offer some general remarks. The key one is the recognition that ice losses are now running at the upper end of expectations when compared with the computer models used by the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In the panel's 2014 assessment,external, its mid-range simulations (RCP4.5) suggested global sea-levels might rise by 53cm by 2100. But the Imbie team's studies show that ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland are actually heading to much more pessimistic outcomes, and will likely add another 17cm to those end-of-century forecasts. The massive ice sheet covering Greenland is melting faster than it was in the 1990s ""If that holds true it would put 400 million people at risk of annual coastal flooding by 2100,"" said Prof Shepherd. ""What our latest estimates mean is that the timescales people are expecting will be shorter. Whatever town or coastal planning measures you're intending to put in place, they need to be built sooner."" Greenland and Antarctica are responding to climate change in slightly different ways. CLIMATE CHANGE:A really simple guide A TO Z:Climate-related words and phrases explained YOUR HOME:How much warmer is your city?,external FOOD:What is your diet's carbon footprint? IN CHARTS:How warm has the world got? The southern polar ice sheet's losses come from the melting effects of warmer ocean water attacking its edges. The northern polar ice sheet feels a similar sort of assault but is also experiencing surface melt from warmer air temperatures. Of that combined 17.8mm contribution to sea-level rise, 10.6mm (60 %) was due to Greenland ice losses and 7.2mm (40%) was due to Antarctica. The combined rate of ice loss for the pair was running at about 81 billion tonnes per year in the 1990s. By the 2010s, it had climbed to 475 billion tonnes per year. Greenland and Antarctica (pictured) are responding to climate change in slightly different ways The delivery of the Imbie results was timed so they could be incorporated into the IPCC's next big assessment of the state of Earth's climate - the so-called Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) due out next year. Prof Shepherd warns that future intercomparisons risk being of poorer quality because of the likely near-term demise of some dedicated polar satellites and the lack of clear and urgent plans to replace them. His particular concern is to see successors to the European Space Agency's CryoSat-2 satellite and the American space agency's IceSat-2 platform. These models observe more of the ice sheets than other satellites because they fly orbits that go very close to the north and south poles. ""I fear we will soon be back to the situation of the early 2000s when we had to make do with missions that were not really designed to look at polar regions. We'll be doing our best despite the absence of the data we really require - unfortunately. But we've been there before.""

The Portuguese football chiefs had announced games would be played behind closed doors before announcing a full suspension, for an indefinite period, just a few hours later. The decision was made following a meeting with that included members of the league, national federation and players' union. The coronavirus outbreak, now declared a pandemic, has led to widespread disruption of sporting fixtures around the world. In Italy, all sport is suspended, including Serie A until 3 April, with the country in lockdown. Juventus and Italy centre-back Daniele Rugani says he is ""fine""after testing positive for the virus, and Reuters have reported that the entire Juve squad will spend two weeks in quarantine. Two Europa League last-16 first-leg fixtures scheduled for Thursday have been postponed and a number will be played behind closed doors,including Manchester United's trip to LASK.

'Nolo beer' sales rocket thanks to young teetotallers,"Sales of no or low alcohol beer are up 30% since 2016, as 18-24 year olds increasingly shun alcohol. ""Nolo"" alcohol is set to be one of the driving trends of 2020, according to the craft brewers' trade organisation. It says growing health consciousness has prompted almost one in four young people to become teetotal. The number of alcohol drinkers across the British population also appears to have fallen slightly. The number of 18-24 year olds who say they don't drink has increased by 6% in the past 12 months, to 23%, according to the Society of Independent Brewers' (SIBA) British Craft Beer Report. The report is forecasting that no alcohol, low alcohol and ""free-from"" beers are set to be one of the fastest growing parts of the market in 2020, with under 35s choosing low alcohol versions of drinks for a quiet night in or to accompany meals. ""As the consumers in this age bracket get older, this is obviously going to have an increasing impact on beer sales in the future,"" added the association, which boasts more than 700 breweries. ""Consumers are more conscious of their physical and mental health than they have ever been, and this has driven the fall in alcohol consumption we are seeing, especially among young people."" Young drinkers lead the trend for alcohol-free beer The challenges of catering for Generation Z Six in 10 of those aged 35-44 drink beer, compared with 44% of 18-24 year olds, the report found. Growth in beer sales is slowing, with total beer sales in 2019 rising by 1.1%, compared with a 2.6% climb a year earlier. The report also indicated a slight increase in the overall number of people who never drink alcohol, with 17% saying they were teetotal, compared to 16% a year earlier. ""The findings in this year's report show a drastically changing marketplace - with consumers opting for no or low alcohol options, particularly young people,"" said Caroline Nodder, editor of the report. She added that there is likely to be more growth in no or low alcoholic drinks over the next 12 months as people become more health-conscious, providing a market for small independent breweries.

"Italy shuts nearly all shops amid virus crisisPM Conte says only food shops and chemists will stay open, as the WHO says coronavirus is a pandemic.","This video can not be played Coronavirus outbreak has officially become pandemic says WHO Italy is to close all shops except food stores and pharmacies in Europe's toughest lockdown yet as virus deaths and cases continue to mount. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said bars, restaurants, hairdressers and non-essential company departments would also close. Meanwhile,President Donald Trump has suspended all travel from Europe to the United States for 30 daysfrom Friday. He said the EU had ""failed to take the same precautions"" as the US, However, he said the United Kingdom would be exempt from the new travel ban. Earlier the World Health Organization (WHO) said the outbreak was a pandemic. WHO chief Dr Tedros said cases outside China had soared 13-fold in two weeks. He said he was ""deeply concerned"" by ""alarming levels of inaction"". What is a pandemic and why use the term now? Stock markets plunge as WHO confirms pandemic A pandemic is defined as a disease that is spreading in multiple countries around the world at the same time. In a televised address,  Mr Conte said any impact of the tightened restrictions - in force from Thursday until 25 March - on the rate of new cases would take a couple of weeks to be seen. The country has already closed schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues across the country. Pharmacies and food shops will remain open It has more than 12,000 confirmed cases and a death toll of 827. The confirmed cases include a player for Juventus football club, Daniele Rugani. The player was currently asymptomatic, the club said. ""Juventus Football Club is currently activating all the isolation procedures required by law, including the census of those who have had contact with him,"" a statement said. Juventus player Daniele Rugani (R) has been confirmed to have the virus Nearly 900 people with the virus in Italy were in intensive care, the WHO's emergencies head Michael Ryan said. ""Iran [another outbreak hotspot] and Italy are suffering now but I guarantee you other countries will be in that situation very soon,"" he said. Dr Tedros said that calling the outbreak a pandemic did not mean the WHO was changing its advice about what countries should do. He called on governments to change the course of the outbreak by taking ""urgent and aggressive action"". ""Several countries have demonstrated that this virus can be suppressed and controlled,"" he said. ""The challenge for many countries who are now dealing with large clusters or community transmission is not whether they can do the same - it's whether they will."" This video can not be played What life looks like under Italy's coronavirus lockdown Governments had to ""strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimising disruption and respecting human rights"". ""We're in this together to do the right things with calm and protect the citizens of the world. It's doable,"" he said. His appeal was followed by the several other countries announcing ever more stringent restrictions to try to prevent the virus taking a hold. Denmark - which has 514 confirmed cases, up 10-fold since Monday, but no deaths so far - is to close all schools and universities from Friday and will send home all public sector employees who are not in critical roles in the coming days. The government also urged the cancellation of events with more than 100 people attending. Meanwhile India has suspended most visas for foreigners until 15 April and Guatemala is banning European citizens from entering from Thursday. By Philippa Roxby, BBC Health The use of the p-word by the WHO to describe the global spread of this new coronavirus is not a huge surprise. Up until now, it has talked merely of the ""threat"" or the ""potential"" for a pandemic. But with cases in more than 100 countries, and increasing numbers not linked to travel, the language has changed. The WHO no longer ""declares"" a pandemic the way it used to, so this is as official as it gets. Yet this doesn't mean the pandemic cannot be controlled, it explains. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? It's a call to action and a plea for all countries not to give up, no matter how large the number of cases. Practically, countries are being told to continue to do what they have been advised to do. That means some may have to step up their response. But the WHO is not changing what it's doing or the threat level of the virus. What the use of the word ""pandemic"" highlights is the importance of countries around the world taking urgent action to respond to their own outbreaks - because now it's everyone's responsibility to turn the tide on the virus.

The WHO had sent 40,000 testing kits to Iran but there was still a shortage of ventilators and oxygen. Earlier, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70% of the country's population - some 58 million people - could contract the coronavirus.

Sunak pumps billions into economy to combat coronavirusThe chancellor warns the outbreak is likely to cause a temporary but significant disruption to the economy.UK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the âlargest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 yearsâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a Â£30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak. He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding. In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together."" The Bank of England hasannounced an emergency cut in interest rates. Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus. ""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs. Of the Â£30bn in extra spending, Â£12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least Â£5bn for the NHS in England and Â£7bn for business and workers across the UK. This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to Â£18bn next year, and even more in following years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around Â£100bn to public borrowing by 2024. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Kuenssberg: The chancellor's very large cheque book Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator McDonnell criticises Budget over social care Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, whichhas now been labelled a pandemicby the World Health Organization. But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts. Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include: Statutorysick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate""even if they have not displayed symptoms Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below Â£51,000suspended for a year A Â£500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to Â£1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres The number of coronavirus cases in the UKreached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus. The chancellor said that without accounting for the impact of coronavirus, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.1% in 2020, the slowest rate since 2009. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Despite speculation that he would ditch the framework on spending set by predecessor Mr Javid, Mr Sunak said his Budget is delivered ""not just within the fiscal rules of the manifesto but with room to spare"". The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving Â£6bn over the next five years. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Islam: The chancellor's two Budgets Borrowing surge to fund 'significant' spending plans Budget gets mixed reaction on green issues Chancellor pledges big increase to research spend In other Budget measures, the chancellor announced that fuel duty would be frozen for another year. A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled andduties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more. The so-calledtampon tax will be abolished,and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journalswill be scrapped from 1 December. And the chancellorpledged to more than doublespending on UK government research and development by 2024. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Talk of ""levelling up"" a ""cruel joke"" The chancellorannounced more than Â£600bn for road, rail, housing and broadband projectsover five years, aimed at delivering on the Conservatives' election promise to boost economic growth outside of London and the south-east of England.
