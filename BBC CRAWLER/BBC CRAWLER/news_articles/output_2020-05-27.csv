Johnson urges UK to 'move on' from Cummings row,"Boris Johnson has ruled out an inquiry into the conduct of his top adviser at the height of lockdown, insisting it was time to ""move on"" from the row. Dominic Cummings is accused of breaking lockdown rules by travelling from London to County Durham. The prime minister rejected claims he had damaged his own authority and the government's coronavirus message by not sacking Mr Cummings. He said the public had had enough of the ""political ding-dong"" over it. Around 40 Tory MPs havecalled for Mr Cummings to resign or be firedafter his 260-mile journey came to light. And Cabinet Office Minister Penny Mordaunt has reportedly said there are ""inconsistencies"" in Mr Cummings' account of his actions during lockdown and there was ""no doubt"" he took risks. Latest updates as Johnson faces senior MPs Durham police lockdown travel fines revealed How Cummings' trip posed a challenge to local MPs What did Dominic Cummings do? In an email to her Portsmouth North constituents,seen by The Guardian,external, she said: ""Other families have been faced with the same situation Mr Cummings and chosen to stay put."" She did not call for Mr Cummings to be sacked - but apologised for the way the past few days have ""undermined key public health messages"". Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the prime minister had given ""no credible explanation"" why evidence had not been passed on to the cabinet secretary to investigate. The Labour MP added that the prime minister's handling of the story had ""undermined the public health message he is trying to put forward"". Sajid Javid, who resigned as chancellor in February after Mr Johnson ordered him to fire his team of aides, also called on Mr Cummings to apologise. In a letter to constituents firstreported by the Bromsgrove Standard,external, he said he did not believe the aide's trip to County Durham was ""necessary or justified"". On Tuesday,junior minister Douglas Ross resigned in protestat Mr Cummings' defence of his behaviour, saying that his interpretation of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"". This video can not be played Labour's Yvette Cooper: ""We need you to get this right"" At an appearance before theCommons Liaison Committee,external, Mr Johnson said he ""did not propose to add"" to his previous statements on Mr Cummings - or what he described as the ""autobiography"" the aide delivered on Monday. The prime minister used the phrase ""move on"" five times in 20 minutes, as he faced hostile questions from select committee chairs. Asked whether the Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK's top civil servant, should investigate Mr Cummings' actions, he said: ""Quite frankly, I am not certain that right now an inquiry into that matter is a very good use of official time. ""We are working flat out on coronavirus."" He said the public wanted the government to ""focus on them and their needs, rather than on a political ding-dong about what one adviser may or may not have done"". This video can not be played Pete Wishart: 80% of people think his chief adviser broke the rules Asked whether the government's ""moral authority"" had been undermined by Mr Cummings' actions and his own defence of them, Mr Johnson said: ""I, of course, am deeply sorry for all the hurt and pain and anxiety that people have been going through throughout this period - this country has been going through a, frankly, most difficult time. ""We are asking people to do quite exceptionally tough things, separating them from their families."" While Mr Johnson was taking part in a video conference with the panel of senior MPs, Conservative MP Giles Watlingtweeted,external: ""I've been listening to the PM in the Liaison Committee. I applaud him for sticking by his man, but I'm afraid Mr Cummings should stand down. ""His continued presence at the heart of government at this time is an unwanted distraction."" Wednesday's session was the first time the prime minister has faced questions from MPs since the allegations against Mr Cummings emerged at the end of last week. He used his appearance at the committee to announce thatNHS England's test and trace system would be up and running from Thursday. He was also quizzed about schools, care homes and the economy. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive from his London home to his parents' farm in County Durham with his wife - who had coronavirus symptoms - and his son has dominated the headlines since the story broke on Friday night. The PM's chief adviser gave a news conference on Monday, explaining that he decided to make the trip because he felt it would be better to self-isolate in a place where he had options for childcare if required. He has received the continued support of the prime minister, who said that his aide had acted legally and with integrity. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? On Wednesdays Mr Johnson would ordinarily face Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions, but MPs are currently on recess. The Liaison Committee - a panel of 37 MPs who chair various select committees - is the only Commons committee that can question the prime minister. This was Mr Johnson's first appearance before the committee since he became PM last July. DAVID ATTENBOROUGH'S MINDFUL MIX:Soothing sounds to escape to CORONAVIRUS NEWSCAST:Cummings up roses?

"From 'We've shut it down' to 100,000 US dead","It's an uncanny and almost tragically perfect piece of symmetry. The number of US servicemen and women killed in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan - over an aggregate 44 years of fighting - is almost exactly the same as the number of Americans who've now lost their lives to coronavirus in just three months of America's war against the hidden enemy, as Donald Trump likes to refer to Covid-19. He also calls it the Chinese virus, but we'll come to that. Now I know you could replace the Covid-19 deaths with US cancer deaths or road crash victims and come up with similarly stark or perhaps even more dramatic statistics. But sadly, fatal car accidents and terminal tumours have always been with us. A global pandemic has not. And out of nowhere 100,000 American families are this spring mourning loved ones, whose lives have been cut short by this virus. 1.5m Americans have been infected. Many millions more have lost their jobs. How the pandemic in US compares to rest of world One of Donald Trump's first acts when he moved into the Oval Office in 2017, was to restore to a central position the bust of Winston Churchill that Barack Obama had moved out in favour of a bronze of Martin Luther King Jr. And in this fight against coronavirus, Donald Trump does see himself as a war leader; the property tycoon who could work a shovel on a Manhattan building site was also going to be shown to be a man of destiny -  the untried field-marshal, with a baton in his knapsack ready to command the troops to get the job done. But also keeping the home fires burning, and lifting the morale of a frightened nation. It has all been far more jagged than that. Trump toured a Ford car factory that switched to making ventilators Donald Trump is not imbued with the gift of soaring Churchillian rhetoric; there have been no ""we shall fight them on the beaches"" moments. Nor has he conjured the Rooseveltian calm when delivering one of his fireside chats. There have been days of infamy, but they have been invariably generated by things that the president has said, rather than what has been done to the United States. And anyway, for a self-styled war leader he must at least face the charge of ignoring the warnings about the enemy he was confronting in the early stages, appearing more Neville Chamberlain than Winston Churchill. Korean War (1950-1953):36,500 Vietnam War (1961-1975):58,000 Iraq War (2003-2011):4,500 Afghanistan (2001-today):2,000 Covid-19 (Feb 2020- today):100,000 The initial period of the US effort against the virus was marked by one significant action in late January, when the president stopped non-American visitors from China entering the United States. That was smart and decisive (although some have argued, to my mind unfairly, that Trump should have stopped anyone and everyone coming from China). But any tactical advantage that had given the administration was squandered in February where there was a month of inaction and incompetence. Attempts to roll out testing were woeful (the president was badly let down by the Centers for Disease Control). Procurement of PPE was weak. The federal emergency stockpile of vital equipment was like Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard: bare. The president had also disbanded the entire global-health-security unit of the National Security Council. He also eliminated the US government's $30m (Â£23m) Complex Crises Fund. These were decisions that badly undermined the American ability to counter the disease. This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus All while he was on a determined mission to tell America that this thing from China was no biggie, and certainly was not going to upend the economy - the centrepiece of his strategy for re-election in November. It is worth just going through the president's quotes from these critical few weeks. Jan 22:""It's one person coming in from China and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine."" Feb 2:""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China."" Feb 10:""Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that's true. But we're doing great in our country. China, I spoke with President Xi, and they're working very, very hard. And I think it's going to all work out fine."" Feb 11:""In our country, we only have, basically, 12 cases and most of those people are recovering and some cases fully recovered. So it's actually less."" Feb 24:""The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC and World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock market starting to look very good to me!"" Feb 26:""When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done."" Crisis? What crisis? But in March the contours became clearer, and it was not pretty. The news was all grim. Because of a lack of testing, there had been extensive community transmission - people were coming down with coronavirus, but it wasn't clear where they'd contracted it, who they'd caught it from, how they'd got it. The ""track and trace"" (the language of coronavirus that we've all now become so familiar with) was now impossible. Although the first reported outbreak was out on the West Coast in Washington state, Covid-19 was playing a mean sleight of hand on us all. This pesky virus got us to look in one direction, when we really should have been focused on the other. Where Covid-19 was really letting rip was on the East Coast, especially in the biggest, richest and most densely populated city in the US, New York, with devastating consequences. This video can not be played What Trump voters think of his handling of the virus outbreak If the city was quickly to become the most worrying centre of the outbreak, the borough of Queens became the epicentre of the epicentre - the district where Donald Trump had grown up. And the visuals from there drove home to Americans - and to the president - the scale of the unfolding disaster. At Elmhurst Hospital, refrigerated container lorries were parked to store bodies that the morgue had no way of dealing with. I interviewed a young doctor from there at the height of the pandemic who painted a harrowing picture of daily life and death. The young doctors being asked to play god In the richest city of the wealthiest country on the planet, we saw nurses heading into intensive care units to treat Covid patients wearing bin liners as PPE, because that is all they had. We saw the ER consultant putting on his ski goggles to examine a patient, because the hospital didn't have the right face masks. We saw mass graves being dug on a small island in the Bronx to accommodate all those who'd died with no next of kin, or with no money for a funeral. Like the inscription on the tomb of the unknown soldiers in the Commonwealth war graves: ""known unto God"". America, this all-mighty superpower, with enough weaponry to blow the planet to smithereens many times over, was looking ragged and not in control of events in its own backyard. It's hard to see this chapter of America's story going down as another moment of this nation's greatness. Refrigerator lorries are being used as makeshift mortuaries in New York If Queens is where Donald Trump grew up, Manhattan is where he made his money - and nothing says money like Wall Street, the pulse and oxygen monitor of the US economy. And the president likes to stand over its bed to take its vitals hourly. But as it became clear that the US economy was going to have to shut down, so the Dow Jones index went diving downwards - vertiginous drops, causing circuit-breakers to kick in, and causing the president and his advisers to fret that his whole re-election strategy had gone up in flames. But then the precipitous falls would be followed by dizzying rises as word came from Capitol Hill that lawmakers might be close to some agreement to inject gazillions into the cryogenically frozen economy. More than 25,000 of the deaths have come from New York state, and Governor Andrew Cuomo became coronavirus's first political superstar. His daily factual and highly detailed presentation of what was happening, where it was happening, what was being done to mitigate, and what still needed to be done, became appointment-to-view television across the US. Cometh the hour and all that. This video can not be played New York Governor Andrew Cuomo takes coronavirus test live on TV This lifelong Democrat - who also grew up in Queens - was drawing admiring glances from a lot of Republicans, and with many Democrats quietly thinking: ""I wish he was our candidate for president in November, and not Joe Biden."" Like an old-fashioned newspaper, he delineated clearly what was fact and what was opinion. In the space of 45 highly polished minutes he would deliver the news stories of New York's descent into the abyss, and then give you his op-ed column. He admitted his response wasn't perfect, acknowledging he could have acted earlier. And he also gave praise to Donald Trump where he thought it was due; he tweaked the tail of the administration when he thought it needed a bit of a kicking. At around the same time as Cuomo was capturing the nation's attention, Donald Trump decided he would go daily with a White House briefing too. It is hard to overstate how much Donald Trump loves - and needs - the roar of the crowd. Governing is dull. Campaigning - and the adoration from his rallies - is what gives him energy. It's what gets his heart pumping and the blood circulating. This video can not be played Trump gets in spat with Asian American reporter over ""nasty question"" And because of the lockdown, here was a president who was deprived of the two things he yearns for most - a day out playing golf, and an evening rally addressing raucous, loving crowds. There were also no heads of states visiting him, where the cameras would record his thoughts on whatever was the subject du jour. He was being starved of the oxygen of publicity, and so daily to the briefing room he would come, with us reporters playing the most unlikely role as his ventilator. Being intubated to a bunch of journalists he's never trusted was never going to end well. Vice President Mike Pence had been given the task of heading the coronavirus taskforce. A poisoned chalice it may have been, but it's a task he's performed with aplomb. He is across the detail of everything, and was the perfect link person between the different branches of government and the White House; between the different branches of government and the governors of the 50 states. And two other things he did with considerable deftness. He never forgot to praise the president to the hilt, saluting him for his leadership. Woe betide you if you don't. And he never forgets to display empathy - talking about the suffering of the American people, expressing condolences to those who'd lost loved ones. That is something that came easily to Mr Pence and is something Donald Trump hardly ever does. Though there would be a revolving cast of characters in the briefing room - the two other stalwarts were Dr Anthony Fauci, the independent-minded head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr Deborah Birx, who used to head the fight against Aids for the Obama administration, and was made the coronavirus response co-ordinator. These were the scientists who wanted to ensure that the judgements the president made were evidence based. They had limited success. The face of America's fight against coronavirus 'Ousted' vaccine expert says US is facing its 'darkest winter' No sooner had the US economy gone into shutdown than other, more business-minded voices were in Donald Trump's other ear telling him that the remedy his doctors were prescribing was worse than the disease. Let people go back to work. Reopen the economy. The loss of jobs, the recession, depression, the devastation of the US economy will be worse than the death toll. And you could see where the president's sympathies lay. First he advocated that the US should reopen by Easter, with churches packed. Only to have that kyboshed by doctors Birx and Fauci. When asked about this Dr Fauci gave an object lesson in disagreeing with the president without disagreeing: ""You don't set the timeline, the virus does,"" he told reporters. Masterful. But the impetus to reopen became overwhelming. The jobless totals were soaring, and Donald Trump saw his ""strong economy"" election strategy disappearing down the plug-hole. And all the while the death toll was mounting, ever, ever higher. What started as a trickle at the end of February became a gradual flow. The gradual flow then became a steady stream. And by late April the stream became a torrent. African American communities in New Orleans have been hit hard Coronavirus was indiscriminating about who it infected, but selective with who it killed. The statistics were striking - if you were black or Latino you were much more likely to die. Longstanding health inequalities came to the fore. If you'd grown up in an impoverished background, you were more likely to have the pre-existing conditions - the co-morbidities, as they say in the US - that would prove so deadly with coronavirus: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart disease. And if you live in densely packed, multi-generational households, and work in factories or meat-packing plants where social distancing is impossible, then - surprise, surprise - you're more likely to contract the disease. Why has the virus hit African Americans so hard? The untold story of America's biggest outbreak The US Surgeon General, Admiral Jerome Adams - himself African American - addressed this directly, and spoke powerfully about it. But he seemed to pay a price for doing so - he was not seen again at another White House news conference. Someone must have taken exception to what he said. The president's own erratic performances at these briefings were coming to be seen as counterproductive by Republican strategists. The president's poll numbers were going down. I was at a couple of the most extraordinary briefings. There was the one where the president made it all about himself. His staff had produced a lengthy campaign style video detailing how brilliantly he'd handled the outbreak - for the first 45 minutes of this over two-hour-long news conference, Donald Trump spoke about himself. He spoke about how unfair the media was to him. It was ""poor me"". Not once in those first 45 minutes did he talk about those who'd died, nor about those who'd been infected. Nor about the millions who were fretting about how they were going to pay the bills having lost their jobs. I was also at the briefing where the president spoke about injecting disinfectant to treat coronavirus. Dr Birx, who was sitting at the side of the briefing room, looked like she was in some kind of gastric agony as she listened to the president, but never felt she had the space to stand up and say: ""This is dangerous nonsense."" His performance was lampooned and ridiculed. But as the criticism piled up against the president, so Donald Trump bristled. And there were two culprits who'd be forced onto the perp walk of shame. The first was China. Despite his early praise for President Xi, China was now in Donald Trump's cross-hairs. China had lied and covered up. This was the Wuhan flu, the city where the outbreak originated. The Chinese had taken actions to protect themselves, but not anyone else. Worse still in Donald Trump's eyes, China had intimidated the World Health Organization, and its weak, pusillanimous leadership had allowed itself to be cowed by Beijing, and therefore had failed to warn the world sufficiently of the dangers that this new strain of virus presented. In this, sure, there was blame shifting - but President Trump had a point, both about shortcomings of the WHO, and the candour of the Chinese leadership. Trump gives WHO ultimatum over Covid-19 handling What are President Trump's charges against the WHO? All of this fired up the Trump base, but it was as nothing compared with the president shifting firmly in favour of reopening the US economy. Wild demonstrations sprang up - particularly in Democrat-run states, which the president did nothing to tamp down. In California, surfer dudes, backed by libertarian Republicans and small business owners, protested at beachside locations in a bizarre Baywatch meets the Tea Party moment. In Michigan, heavily armed men carrying assault rifles and dressed as though they were auditioning as extras for a movie about mercenaries laid siege to the State House. A public health emergency, with a virus that is no respecter of whether you are a Democrat or Republican, Trump lover or Trump hater, had divided and bitterly polarised the country. Like everything else. If you want the country to reopen you're with Trump (broadly); if you're wary about reopening too soon you're a Dem (broadly). If you love the fact that the president has ignored the advice of the Food and Drug Administration over the dangers of hydroxychloroquine, and decided to take it anyway, then you are firmly in his camp. And although the president has publicly stated that everyone ought to wear a mask, the fact that he chooses not to is taken as a clear dog-whistle to his supporters that you really don't have to. In the face - so to speak - of all medical advice, the mask is being seen by some as an act of provocation, a symbol of the nanny state. Shopkeepers who insist that customers wear a mask are being intimidated by thuggish gangs patrolling outside their premises. It is grotesque. They are being ripped up and destroyed as though a symbol of oppression by the ""Deep State"", rather than a small effort to halt the spread of the disease. Our film crews have been jostled and abused for wearing face masks while filming these protesters. Needless to say, these people are no respecters of social distancing. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? UPLIFTING STORY:'I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown' POST-COVID WORLD:Will we ever shake hands again? GLOBAL TAKE:Which country has the most generous bailout? THE LOST SIX WEEKS:Missed chances for US to contain outbreak And now that America has reached this grim milestone of 100,000 dead, what of the future? In public opinion there does seem to be a battle going on between head versus heart. Science pitted against gut instinct. The role of the state against the rights of the individual. The US resistance to a continued lockdown If a phone app that can track and trace your movements is the vital tool to prevent a second wave of the virus, it relies on a sizeable majority of the population handing over their personal data for it to be effective. Will that happen? In a country whose founding fathers fretted about the dangers of the state becoming too mighty, I just cannot see it (and this goes far wider than pro- and anti-Trump). And what if, please God, an effective vaccine is found? You can be sure that the anti-vaxx brigade (and remember Donald Trump was once one of its advocates) will be out in force, stirring up doubts about the science, the medicine, the state, Big Brother, you name it. Donald Trump has boasted repeatedly in the past couple of months that no country has done more coronavirus testing that then USA. ""It's not even close,"" he says. No country has built more ventilators or supplied so much PPE to its front-line workers, he says. The president has claimed that other world leaders are jealous of what the US has managed to achieve. Really? Germany, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Greece: envious? Hard to believe somehow. No country has had more deaths, more infections. Anywhere else, so far, is not even close.

HK 'no longer autonomous from China' - Pompeo,"This video can not be played Police arrested dozens of people in Causeway Bay US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told Congress that Hong Kong no longer merits special treatment under US law. The declaration could have major implications for Hong Kong's trade hub status and is likely to anger Beijing. ""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,"" he said in a statement. It follows Beijing's plan to impose a controversial new security law on the territory. The security law was ""only the latest in a series of actions that fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""It is now clear that China is modelling Hong Kong after itself,"" he added. US condemns Chinaâs Hong Kong security law Hong Kong 'needs security law to fight terrorism' HK leader dismisses concerns over freedoms Hong Kong police have arrested hundreds of peopleamid new anti-mainland unrest. Until now the US has given Hong Kong - a global financial and trading hub - special status under US law. The provision dates from when the territory was a British colony and gives it favourable trading terms. But since last year this status has been conditional on the US secretary of state regularly certifying that Hong Kong maintains sufficient autonomy from mainland China. If the secretary of state fails to certify this, the US Congress can revoke Hong Kong's special trade status. This would mean treating Hong Kong the same as mainland China for trade and other purposes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It could jeopardise billions of dollars worth of trade between Hong Kong and the US and could dissuade people from investing there in the future. It would also hurt mainland China, which uses Hong Kong as a kind of middleman for transactions with the rest of the world. Mainland companies and multinational firms use the territory as an international or regional base. Shortly after Mr Pompeo's declaration, prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong called on US, European and Asian leaders to follow his lead and reconsider Hong Kong's special trade status if Beijing imposes the security law. ""Once the law is implemented, Hong Kong will be assimilated into China's authoritarian regime, on both rule of law and human rights protections,""he warned.,external The security law would create ""massive damage to expats and investors in Hong Kong"", he said. Maintaining the city's autonomy was the ""only way"" to protect business, he added. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese, Washington Mr Pompeo's latest declaration serves as a warning to Beijing that the special administrative region's preferential treatment is at risk. It has huge economic implications, but the geopolitical implications may be even greater. The move will likely meet angry reaction from Beijing and further jeopardise already fragile US-China relations, which appear to be in free fall amid tensions over trade, the pandemic and technological rivalry. A key question to ask is how much removing Hong Kong's special trade status helps Hongkongers fighting for their autonomy and freedoms. Or does it mostly punish people in Hong Kong while adding limited strategic leverage over China? Beijing has proposed imposing it in Hong Kong. It would ban treason, secession, sedition and subversion and China says it is needed to combat violent protests that have grown in the territory. The background you need on Hong Kong's protests Hong Kong security law: Why is it worrying people? The anti-mainland sentiment was fuelled last year by a proposed - and later scrapped - bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to China. Protesters in the city's Mong Kok district on Wednesday Critics say the security law is a direct attempt to curtail the freedoms given Hong Kong in the mini-constitution that was agreed when sovereignty was handed back to China in 1997. Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam has denied that the law, which is set to go to a vote this week and could be in force as early as the end of June, will curtail the rights of Hong Kong residents. A group of 200 senior politicians from around the world have issued a joint statement criticising China's plan. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the US would announce a ""very powerful"" response to the proposed legislation before the end of the week. China's plans had already been condemned by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who described them as a ""death knell"" for the city's freedoms. The UK, Australia and Canada have also expressed their ""deep concern"".

Trump threatens to shut down social media firms,"President Trump has taken the extraordinary step of threatening to close down social media platforms. The threat came after Twitter added fact-check links to his tweets for the first time. The battle between the president and the social-media companies has been brewing for a time. But now it feels as though an all-out war is looming between Donald Trump and Twitter ahead of the US presidential election, in November. Last night, a couple of Trump tweets raging about ""fraudulent"" postal ballots in US elections featured - for some users but not all - a strapline linking to what Twitter called ""facts about mail-in ballots.""

"From 'We've shut it down' to 100,000 US deadMore Americans have been killed in three months by coronavirus than in 44 years of foreign wars.US & Canada","It's an uncanny and almost tragically perfect piece of symmetry. The number of US servicemen and women killed in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan - over an aggregate 44 years of fighting - is almost exactly the same as the number of Americans who've now lost their lives to coronavirus in just three months of America's war against the hidden enemy, as Donald Trump likes to refer to Covid-19. He also calls it the Chinese virus, but we'll come to that. Now I know you could replace the Covid-19 deaths with US cancer deaths or road crash victims and come up with similarly stark or perhaps even more dramatic statistics. But sadly, fatal car accidents and terminal tumours have always been with us. A global pandemic has not. And out of nowhere 100,000 American families are this spring mourning loved ones, whose lives have been cut short by this virus. 1.5m Americans have been infected. Many millions more have lost their jobs. How the pandemic in US compares to rest of world One of Donald Trump's first acts when he moved into the Oval Office in 2017, was to restore to a central position the bust of Winston Churchill that Barack Obama had moved out in favour of a bronze of Martin Luther King Jr. And in this fight against coronavirus, Donald Trump does see himself as a war leader; the property tycoon who could work a shovel on a Manhattan building site was also going to be shown to be a man of destiny -  the untried field-marshal, with a baton in his knapsack ready to command the troops to get the job done. But also keeping the home fires burning, and lifting the morale of a frightened nation. It has all been far more jagged than that. Trump toured a Ford car factory that switched to making ventilators Donald Trump is not imbued with the gift of soaring Churchillian rhetoric; there have been no ""we shall fight them on the beaches"" moments. Nor has he conjured the Rooseveltian calm when delivering one of his fireside chats. There have been days of infamy, but they have been invariably generated by things that the president has said, rather than what has been done to the United States. And anyway, for a self-styled war leader he must at least face the charge of ignoring the warnings about the enemy he was confronting in the early stages, appearing more Neville Chamberlain than Winston Churchill. Korean War (1950-1953):36,500 Vietnam War (1961-1975):58,000 Iraq War (2003-2011):4,500 Afghanistan (2001-today):2,000 Covid-19 (Feb 2020- today):100,000 The initial period of the US effort against the virus was marked by one significant action in late January, when the president stopped non-American visitors from China entering the United States. That was smart and decisive (although some have argued, to my mind unfairly, that Trump should have stopped anyone and everyone coming from China). But any tactical advantage that had given the administration was squandered in February where there was a month of inaction and incompetence. Attempts to roll out testing were woeful (the president was badly let down by the Centers for Disease Control). Procurement of PPE was weak. The federal emergency stockpile of vital equipment was like Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard: bare. The president had also disbanded the entire global-health-security unit of the National Security Council. He also eliminated the US government's $30m (Â£23m) Complex Crises Fund. These were decisions that badly undermined the American ability to counter the disease. This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus All while he was on a determined mission to tell America that this thing from China was no biggie, and certainly was not going to upend the economy - the centrepiece of his strategy for re-election in November. It is worth just going through the president's quotes from these critical few weeks. Jan 22:""It's one person coming in from China and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine."" Feb 2:""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China."" Feb 10:""Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that's true. But we're doing great in our country. China, I spoke with President Xi, and they're working very, very hard. And I think it's going to all work out fine."" Feb 11:""In our country, we only have, basically, 12 cases and most of those people are recovering and some cases fully recovered. So it's actually less."" Feb 24:""The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC and World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock market starting to look very good to me!"" Feb 26:""When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done."" Crisis? What crisis? But in March the contours became clearer, and it was not pretty. The news was all grim. Because of a lack of testing, there had been extensive community transmission - people were coming down with coronavirus, but it wasn't clear where they'd contracted it, who they'd caught it from, how they'd got it. The ""track and trace"" (the language of coronavirus that we've all now become so familiar with) was now impossible. Although the first reported outbreak was out on the West Coast in Washington state, Covid-19 was playing a mean sleight of hand on us all. This pesky virus got us to look in one direction, when we really should have been focused on the other. Where Covid-19 was really letting rip was on the East Coast, especially in the biggest, richest and most densely populated city in the US, New York, with devastating consequences. This video can not be played What Trump voters think of his handling of the virus outbreak If the city was quickly to become the most worrying centre of the outbreak, the borough of Queens became the epicentre of the epicentre - the district where Donald Trump had grown up. And the visuals from there drove home to Americans - and to the president - the scale of the unfolding disaster. At Elmhurst Hospital, refrigerated container lorries were parked to store bodies that the morgue had no way of dealing with. I interviewed a young doctor from there at the height of the pandemic who painted a harrowing picture of daily life and death. The young doctors being asked to play god In the richest city of the wealthiest country on the planet, we saw nurses heading into intensive care units to treat Covid patients wearing bin liners as PPE, because that is all they had. We saw the ER consultant putting on his ski goggles to examine a patient, because the hospital didn't have the right face masks. We saw mass graves being dug on a small island in the Bronx to accommodate all those who'd died with no next of kin, or with no money for a funeral. Like the inscription on the tomb of the unknown soldiers in the Commonwealth war graves: ""known unto God"". America, this all-mighty superpower, with enough weaponry to blow the planet to smithereens many times over, was looking ragged and not in control of events in its own backyard. It's hard to see this chapter of America's story going down as another moment of this nation's greatness. Refrigerator lorries are being used as makeshift mortuaries in New York If Queens is where Donald Trump grew up, Manhattan is where he made his money - and nothing says money like Wall Street, the pulse and oxygen monitor of the US economy. And the president likes to stand over its bed to take its vitals hourly. But as it became clear that the US economy was going to have to shut down, so the Dow Jones index went diving downwards - vertiginous drops, causing circuit-breakers to kick in, and causing the president and his advisers to fret that his whole re-election strategy had gone up in flames. But then the precipitous falls would be followed by dizzying rises as word came from Capitol Hill that lawmakers might be close to some agreement to inject gazillions into the cryogenically frozen economy. More than 25,000 of the deaths have come from New York state, and Governor Andrew Cuomo became coronavirus's first political superstar. His daily factual and highly detailed presentation of what was happening, where it was happening, what was being done to mitigate, and what still needed to be done, became appointment-to-view television across the US. Cometh the hour and all that. This video can not be played New York Governor Andrew Cuomo takes coronavirus test live on TV This lifelong Democrat - who also grew up in Queens - was drawing admiring glances from a lot of Republicans, and with many Democrats quietly thinking: ""I wish he was our candidate for president in November, and not Joe Biden."" Like an old-fashioned newspaper, he delineated clearly what was fact and what was opinion. In the space of 45 highly polished minutes he would deliver the news stories of New York's descent into the abyss, and then give you his op-ed column. He admitted his response wasn't perfect, acknowledging he could have acted earlier. And he also gave praise to Donald Trump where he thought it was due; he tweaked the tail of the administration when he thought it needed a bit of a kicking. At around the same time as Cuomo was capturing the nation's attention, Donald Trump decided he would go daily with a White House briefing too. It is hard to overstate how much Donald Trump loves - and needs - the roar of the crowd. Governing is dull. Campaigning - and the adoration from his rallies - is what gives him energy. It's what gets his heart pumping and the blood circulating. This video can not be played Trump gets in spat with Asian American reporter over ""nasty question"" And because of the lockdown, here was a president who was deprived of the two things he yearns for most - a day out playing golf, and an evening rally addressing raucous, loving crowds. There were also no heads of states visiting him, where the cameras would record his thoughts on whatever was the subject du jour. He was being starved of the oxygen of publicity, and so daily to the briefing room he would come, with us reporters playing the most unlikely role as his ventilator. Being intubated to a bunch of journalists he's never trusted was never going to end well. Vice President Mike Pence had been given the task of heading the coronavirus taskforce. A poisoned chalice it may have been, but it's a task he's performed with aplomb. He is across the detail of everything, and was the perfect link person between the different branches of government and the White House; between the different branches of government and the governors of the 50 states. And two other things he did with considerable deftness. He never forgot to praise the president to the hilt, saluting him for his leadership. Woe betide you if you don't. And he never forgets to display empathy - talking about the suffering of the American people, expressing condolences to those who'd lost loved ones. That is something that came easily to Mr Pence and is something Donald Trump hardly ever does. Though there would be a revolving cast of characters in the briefing room - the two other stalwarts were Dr Anthony Fauci, the independent-minded head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr Deborah Birx, who used to head the fight against Aids for the Obama administration, and was made the coronavirus response co-ordinator. These were the scientists who wanted to ensure that the judgements the president made were evidence based. They had limited success. The face of America's fight against coronavirus 'Ousted' vaccine expert says US is facing its 'darkest winter' No sooner had the US economy gone into shutdown than other, more business-minded voices were in Donald Trump's other ear telling him that the remedy his doctors were prescribing was worse than the disease. Let people go back to work. Reopen the economy. The loss of jobs, the recession, depression, the devastation of the US economy will be worse than the death toll. And you could see where the president's sympathies lay. First he advocated that the US should reopen by Easter, with churches packed. Only to have that kyboshed by doctors Birx and Fauci. When asked about this Dr Fauci gave an object lesson in disagreeing with the president without disagreeing: ""You don't set the timeline, the virus does,"" he told reporters. Masterful. But the impetus to reopen became overwhelming. The jobless totals were soaring, and Donald Trump saw his ""strong economy"" election strategy disappearing down the plug-hole. And all the while the death toll was mounting, ever, ever higher. What started as a trickle at the end of February became a gradual flow. The gradual flow then became a steady stream. And by late April the stream became a torrent. African American communities in New Orleans have been hit hard Coronavirus was indiscriminating about who it infected, but selective with who it killed. The statistics were striking - if you were black or Latino you were much more likely to die. Longstanding health inequalities came to the fore. If you'd grown up in an impoverished background, you were more likely to have the pre-existing conditions - the co-morbidities, as they say in the US - that would prove so deadly with coronavirus: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart disease. And if you live in densely packed, multi-generational households, and work in factories or meat-packing plants where social distancing is impossible, then - surprise, surprise - you're more likely to contract the disease. Why has the virus hit African Americans so hard? The untold story of America's biggest outbreak The US Surgeon General, Admiral Jerome Adams - himself African American - addressed this directly, and spoke powerfully about it. But he seemed to pay a price for doing so - he was not seen again at another White House news conference. Someone must have taken exception to what he said. The president's own erratic performances at these briefings were coming to be seen as counterproductive by Republican strategists. The president's poll numbers were going down. I was at a couple of the most extraordinary briefings. There was the one where the president made it all about himself. His staff had produced a lengthy campaign style video detailing how brilliantly he'd handled the outbreak - for the first 45 minutes of this over two-hour-long news conference, Donald Trump spoke about himself. He spoke about how unfair the media was to him. It was ""poor me"". Not once in those first 45 minutes did he talk about those who'd died, nor about those who'd been infected. Nor about the millions who were fretting about how they were going to pay the bills having lost their jobs. I was also at the briefing where the president spoke about injecting disinfectant to treat coronavirus. Dr Birx, who was sitting at the side of the briefing room, looked like she was in some kind of gastric agony as she listened to the president, but never felt she had the space to stand up and say: ""This is dangerous nonsense."" His performance was lampooned and ridiculed. But as the criticism piled up against the president, so Donald Trump bristled. And there were two culprits who'd be forced onto the perp walk of shame. The first was China. Despite his early praise for President Xi, China was now in Donald Trump's cross-hairs. China had lied and covered up. This was the Wuhan flu, the city where the outbreak originated. The Chinese had taken actions to protect themselves, but not anyone else. Worse still in Donald Trump's eyes, China had intimidated the World Health Organization, and its weak, pusillanimous leadership had allowed itself to be cowed by Beijing, and therefore had failed to warn the world sufficiently of the dangers that this new strain of virus presented. In this, sure, there was blame shifting - but President Trump had a point, both about shortcomings of the WHO, and the candour of the Chinese leadership. Trump gives WHO ultimatum over Covid-19 handling What are President Trump's charges against the WHO? All of this fired up the Trump base, but it was as nothing compared with the president shifting firmly in favour of reopening the US economy. Wild demonstrations sprang up - particularly in Democrat-run states, which the president did nothing to tamp down. In California, surfer dudes, backed by libertarian Republicans and small business owners, protested at beachside locations in a bizarre Baywatch meets the Tea Party moment. In Michigan, heavily armed men carrying assault rifles and dressed as though they were auditioning as extras for a movie about mercenaries laid siege to the State House. A public health emergency, with a virus that is no respecter of whether you are a Democrat or Republican, Trump lover or Trump hater, had divided and bitterly polarised the country. Like everything else. If you want the country to reopen you're with Trump (broadly); if you're wary about reopening too soon you're a Dem (broadly). If you love the fact that the president has ignored the advice of the Food and Drug Administration over the dangers of hydroxychloroquine, and decided to take it anyway, then you are firmly in his camp. And although the president has publicly stated that everyone ought to wear a mask, the fact that he chooses not to is taken as a clear dog-whistle to his supporters that you really don't have to. In the face - so to speak - of all medical advice, the mask is being seen by some as an act of provocation, a symbol of the nanny state. Shopkeepers who insist that customers wear a mask are being intimidated by thuggish gangs patrolling outside their premises. It is grotesque. They are being ripped up and destroyed as though a symbol of oppression by the ""Deep State"", rather than a small effort to halt the spread of the disease. Our film crews have been jostled and abused for wearing face masks while filming these protesters. Needless to say, these people are no respecters of social distancing. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? UPLIFTING STORY:'I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown' POST-COVID WORLD:Will we ever shake hands again? GLOBAL TAKE:Which country has the most generous bailout? THE LOST SIX WEEKS:Missed chances for US to contain outbreak And now that America has reached this grim milestone of 100,000 dead, what of the future? In public opinion there does seem to be a battle going on between head versus heart. Science pitted against gut instinct. The role of the state against the rights of the individual. The US resistance to a continued lockdown If a phone app that can track and trace your movements is the vital tool to prevent a second wave of the virus, it relies on a sizeable majority of the population handing over their personal data for it to be effective. Will that happen? In a country whose founding fathers fretted about the dangers of the state becoming too mighty, I just cannot see it (and this goes far wider than pro- and anti-Trump). And what if, please God, an effective vaccine is found? You can be sure that the anti-vaxx brigade (and remember Donald Trump was once one of its advocates) will be out in force, stirring up doubts about the science, the medicine, the state, Big Brother, you name it. Donald Trump has boasted repeatedly in the past couple of months that no country has done more coronavirus testing that then USA. ""It's not even close,"" he says. No country has built more ventilators or supplied so much PPE to its front-line workers, he says. The president has claimed that other world leaders are jealous of what the US has managed to achieve. Really? Germany, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Greece: envious? Hard to believe somehow. No country has had more deaths, more infections. Anywhere else, so far, is not even close.

"Trump threatens to shut down social media firmsThe president claims Twitter is ""stifling free speech"", after it added fact-check links to his posts.Technology","President Trump has taken the extraordinary step of threatening to close down social media platforms. The threat came after Twitter added fact-check links to his tweets for the first time. The battle between the president and the social-media companies has been brewing for a time. But now it feels as though an all-out war is looming between Donald Trump and Twitter ahead of the US presidential election, in November. Last night, a couple of Trump tweets raging about ""fraudulent"" postal ballots in US elections featured - for some users but not all - a strapline linking to what Twitter called ""facts about mail-in ballots.""

Test and trace system will start on Thursday,"A massive system to find people who come into close contact with those infected with coronavirus will start in England on Thursday, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister said it ""will change people's lives"". The aim of the test and trace system is to move from lockdown for all towards more targeted measures. However, scientists have warned it is not a ""magic bullet"" and may prevent between 5% and 15% of infections. Northern Irelandhas its own version up and running,Scotlandhas announced its own system will start on Thursday andWales' systemis due to start in early June. As is currently the case, anyone who develops symptoms of coronavirus - a persistent cough, fever or a sudden loss of taste or sense of smell - will have to isolate for seven days and the rest of their household for 14 days. The difference is that from Thursday, everyone with symptoms shouldask for a test online,externalor call to arrange a test by calling 119. If the test comes back negative, everyone in your household can go back to normal. But if the test comes back positive, the NHS Test and Trace team will get in touch - via text, email or phone call - to discuss whom you have come into close contact with. In full: How will contact tracing work in England? Schools and workplaces could see 'local lockdowns' How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Any of those contacts deemed at risk of catching the virus will be instructed by the NHS to go into isolation for 14 days, whether they are sick or not. They will be tested only if they develop symptoms. The rest of their household does not have to isolate, unless someone becomes ill. Those isolating will be eligible for statutory sick pay. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the daily Downing Street briefing this ""must become a new way of life"" and will require a ""national effort"" - otherwise lockdown would have to continue. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Every single person can get a test"" ""It is your civic duty, so you avoid unknowingly spreading the virus and you help to break the chain of transmission,"" he said. He also confirmed that, from Thursday, anyone with symptoms - including the under-5s - can be tested for coronavirus. Earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee that the government ""will consider bringing in financial sanctions"" if people do not self-isolate. Only people who have been ""close"" to an infected person will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace. It will not be the case that one teacher testing positive would lead to the whole school going into isolation, for example. Close contacts are: people you spend 15 minutes or more with at a distance of less than 2m people you have direct contact with - such as sexual partners, household members or people with whom you have had face-to-face conversations at a distance of less than 1m The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? At the moment coronavirus is being suppressed by lockdown restrictions which are applied across the whole of society. The ambition is to pivot from lockdown for the many to isolation for the few. How far that can go will depend on the effectiveness of the scheme. Baroness Dido Harding, the chairwoman of NHS Test and Trace, said: ""[It] is designed to enable the vast majority to get on with their lives in a much more normal way... trading national lockdown for individual isolation."" Test and trace will also give far more detail on how and where the virus is spreading. Mr Hancock said this information could lead tolocal lockdowns to tackle flare-upsin towns, schools or workplaces. A report published earlier by the Royal Society said the success of the scheme would depend on how quickly contacts can be found and whether the public buys in. It concluded that between 5% and 15% of infections could be prevented. But the 15% figure depends on finding contacts within three days and 80% of people reporting their symptoms or going into isolation when asked. Prof Anne Johnson, one of the report's authors, said: ""It is an important part in bringing the pandemic under control, but we're very clear it is not a magic bullet."" This is a big ask - there will be a lot for people to get used to. First, if you test positive for the virus you will be expected to pass on contact details of people you have recently met. Some may be concerned about that though NHS leaders emphasise that confidentiality and data security will be rigorously observed. On the other hand you may get a call from a contact tracer and advised you are at risk because of a recent encounter with someone with the virus. And even if you are fit and well you will still be told to self-isolate for two weeks. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has called on people to do their civic duty. The big question is whether sufficient numbers will respond positively to that. Sanctions have not been ruled out if they don't. There's a lot riding on policies like this to be adopted in every part of the UK, not least as a vehicle to help each nation out of lockdown. Instead, social distancing, hand hygiene and isolating everyone who gets ill will have a far greater effect, the report said. By comparison, isolating cases and quarantining members of their household is thought to cut infections by 50%. And scientists,including those advising the government, have warned thatthe row over the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummingswill make it harder to get public support such measures. The government says it has 25,000 contact tracers ready to go and that it has plenty of testing capacity. The contacts of 2,000 people who have just tested positive for coronavirus will be chased on Thursday. However, the real pressure will be on the speed of testing. Prof John Newton, the national coordinator of Test and Trace said: ""In order to be successful it requires rapid testing."" Mr Johnson said on Wednesday there was now a target to get test results in less than 24 hours. There is a particular problem with home testing kits, which have to be posted out. Prof Newton said it would be ""very difficult"" to get those results in less than 48 hours. The NHS contact tracing app is not ready to roll out and was described by Mr Hancock as a ""complement"". He denied technical issues were delaying its roll out. In other developments: A further 412 coronavirus deaths were recorded in all settings across the UK, taking the confirmed death toll to 37,460 The prime minister said he has asked scientists to review the 2m social distancing rule as the virus is suppressed in order to help public transport and the hospitality sector Mr Johnson has ruled out an inquiry into Mr Cummings' conduct during lockdown,insisting it was time to ""move on"" from the row Local lockdownsare not being considered in Walesto maintain a ""clear message"" about coronavirus, the Welsh Government has said FollowJameson Twitter,external CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL:Take a look behind the scenes of the NHS ESCAPE WITH NORMAL PEOPLE:The show everyone is talking about Schools and workplaces could see 'local lockdowns' Track and trace system in place from June - PM Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

How will contact tracing work?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

Johnson urges UK to 'move on' from Cummings rowThe PM rules out an inquiry into the conduct of his top aide at the height of the coronavirus lockdown.UK PoliticsComments,"Boris Johnson has ruled out an inquiry into the conduct of his top adviser at the height of lockdown, insisting it was time to ""move on"" from the row. Dominic Cummings is accused of breaking lockdown rules by travelling from London to County Durham. The prime minister rejected claims he had damaged his own authority and the government's coronavirus message by not sacking Mr Cummings. He said the public had had enough of the ""political ding-dong"" over it. Around 40 Tory MPs havecalled for Mr Cummings to resign or be firedafter his 260-mile journey came to light. And Cabinet Office Minister Penny Mordaunt has reportedly said there are ""inconsistencies"" in Mr Cummings' account of his actions during lockdown and there was ""no doubt"" he took risks. Latest updates as Johnson faces senior MPs Durham police lockdown travel fines revealed How Cummings' trip posed a challenge to local MPs What did Dominic Cummings do? In an email to her Portsmouth North constituents,seen by The Guardian,external, she said: ""Other families have been faced with the same situation Mr Cummings and chosen to stay put."" She did not call for Mr Cummings to be sacked - but apologised for the way the past few days have ""undermined key public health messages"". Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the prime minister had given ""no credible explanation"" why evidence had not been passed on to the cabinet secretary to investigate. The Labour MP added that the prime minister's handling of the story had ""undermined the public health message he is trying to put forward"". Sajid Javid, who resigned as chancellor in February after Mr Johnson ordered him to fire his team of aides, also called on Mr Cummings to apologise. In a letter to constituents firstreported by the Bromsgrove Standard,external, he said he did not believe the aide's trip to County Durham was ""necessary or justified"". On Tuesday,junior minister Douglas Ross resigned in protestat Mr Cummings' defence of his behaviour, saying that his interpretation of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"". This video can not be played Labour's Yvette Cooper: ""We need you to get this right"" At an appearance before theCommons Liaison Committee,external, Mr Johnson said he ""did not propose to add"" to his previous statements on Mr Cummings - or what he described as the ""autobiography"" the aide delivered on Monday. The prime minister used the phrase ""move on"" five times in 20 minutes, as he faced hostile questions from select committee chairs. Asked whether the Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK's top civil servant, should investigate Mr Cummings' actions, he said: ""Quite frankly, I am not certain that right now an inquiry into that matter is a very good use of official time. ""We are working flat out on coronavirus."" He said the public wanted the government to ""focus on them and their needs, rather than on a political ding-dong about what one adviser may or may not have done"". This video can not be played Pete Wishart: 80% of people think his chief adviser broke the rules Asked whether the government's ""moral authority"" had been undermined by Mr Cummings' actions and his own defence of them, Mr Johnson said: ""I, of course, am deeply sorry for all the hurt and pain and anxiety that people have been going through throughout this period - this country has been going through a, frankly, most difficult time. ""We are asking people to do quite exceptionally tough things, separating them from their families."" While Mr Johnson was taking part in a video conference with the panel of senior MPs, Conservative MP Giles Watlingtweeted,external: ""I've been listening to the PM in the Liaison Committee. I applaud him for sticking by his man, but I'm afraid Mr Cummings should stand down. ""His continued presence at the heart of government at this time is an unwanted distraction."" Wednesday's session was the first time the prime minister has faced questions from MPs since the allegations against Mr Cummings emerged at the end of last week. He used his appearance at the committee to announce thatNHS England's test and trace system would be up and running from Thursday. He was also quizzed about schools, care homes and the economy. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive from his London home to his parents' farm in County Durham with his wife - who had coronavirus symptoms - and his son has dominated the headlines since the story broke on Friday night. The PM's chief adviser gave a news conference on Monday, explaining that he decided to make the trip because he felt it would be better to self-isolate in a place where he had options for childcare if required. He has received the continued support of the prime minister, who said that his aide had acted legally and with integrity. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? On Wednesdays Mr Johnson would ordinarily face Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions, but MPs are currently on recess. The Liaison Committee - a panel of 37 MPs who chair various select committees - is the only Commons committee that can question the prime minister. This was Mr Johnson's first appearance before the committee since he became PM last July. DAVID ATTENBOROUGH'S MINDFUL MIX:Soothing sounds to escape to CORONAVIRUS NEWSCAST:Cummings up roses?

Here's a look back at some of the most significant developments from around the world today:  And finally...  You've been kept up-to-date today by a few of us here at the BBC, including Owen Amos, Saira Asher, Andreas Illmer, Krutika Pathi, Yvette Tan, Frances Mao, Sean Fanning, Claire Heald, Gareth Evans, Rob Greenall, Joseph Lee, Steven Sutcliffe, Emlyn Begley, Rebecca Seales, Kate Whannel, Jennifer Scott, Jo Couzens, Holly Honderich, Mal Siret and Paulin Kola. With the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to think of things we wish we'd done before coronavirus uprooted our lives. We asked you - if you could go back to the beginning of 2020, what would your pre-lockdown advice for yourself be? Responses ranged from ""buy stock in Zoom"" and ""find a partner to self-isolate with"", to ""spend as much time with loved ones as you can and hug them extra tight.""

A company called Zipline will be allowed to use drones on two specified routes after the Federal Aviation Administration granted it an emergency waiver. It is the first time the FAA has allowed beyond-line-of-sight drone deliveries in the US. Read more here. Mackenzie beach in the coastal city of Larnaca, Cyprus Cyprus says it will cover all costs - including medication, accommodation, food and drink - for anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 while on holiday on the Mediterranean island. Patients and their families on vacation there will only have to pay to be transported back to the airport and for their flights home. An exclusive 100-bed hospital, equipped with intensive care units and respirators, will provide care for anyone who becomes seriously ill with the virus, the government says. A 500-bed ""quarantine hotel"" will also be provided. The Cypriot government says that its tourist season will open on 9 June to travellers from Germany, Greece and Israel. ""For our important markets like the UK, Russia and Sweden, I expect early July,"" deputy tourism minister Savvas Perdios said. Last year's 4 July celebration in DC US President Donald Trump is pushing ahead with his plans for a 4 July parade in Washington, DC, in the face of protests from local lawmakers and virus concerns. A group of Democratic lawmakers penned a letter to the Trump administration saying that Trump's proposed parade would ""needlessly risk the health and safety of thousands of Americans"". DC will begin its phased reopening later this week, though gatherings of 10 or more people are still banned. Gatherings of more than 250 people - like the crowds that assembled for last year's celebration - will not be allowed until a virus vaccine is found, or the public health risk is drastically reduced. Trump's Salute to America - last year's 4 July celebration in DC - featured military flyovers and fireworks, drew tens of thousands of people to downtown DC, and cost $5.4m (Â£4.4m). A scientist works on a possible Covid-19 vaccine at a lab in Maryland Fewer than half of Americans say they would get a vaccine for the coronavirus if one became available, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. While just 49% of Americans would opt in, the majority - 61% - say they expect a vaccine will be publicly available by 2021, with only 17% saying it will take longer. About 1 in 5 Americans say they do not plan to get vaccinated, while 31% remain unsure. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump unveiled Operation Warp Speed, a mission to expedite vaccine development. He has promised to deliver a jab by year-end, a timeline widely disputed by scientists.  The only two hospitals in Southern California's rural Imperial County were forced to close their doors to new Covid patients this week, after admitting a flood of patients from Mexico. Roughly half of the coronavirus patients in several of the California hospitals dotting the US southern border are recent arrivals from Mexico, reports the Washington Post newspaper. The patients traveling from Mexico to the US include some of the 1.5 million Americans who live there. As a result, Imperial County - which sits directly on the border - has a markedly higher rate of infection than any other county in California: 760 per 100,000 residents, the Post reports.  Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The Prime Minister's adviser Dominic Cummings says he drove 30 minutes from Durham to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight before driving back to London after recovering from coronavirus symptoms. Eye symptoms with coronavirus have been reported, say the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the College of Optometrists. Like any upper respiratory tract infection, including colds and flu, it can cause irritation of the membrane covering the eye - a condition called conjunctivitis or sometimes pink or red eye (because the whites of the eyes become bloodshot). The World Health Organization now includes this alongside other more common symptoms of the virus - but UK guidelines do not. Viral conjunctivitis can make the eyes water and feel gritty and uncomfortable, rather than painful. It does not usually interfere greatly with eyesight. Read more here. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, authorities in New York City and Los Angeles say that hate incidents against people of Asian descent have increased considerably. A reporting centre says it has receivedover 1,700 reports of coronavirus-related discrimination,externalfrom at least 45 US states since it launched in March. In states including New York, California, and Texas, East Asians have been spat on, punched or kicked - and in one case even stabbed. The spike in anti-Asian prejudice has left many Asian Americans wondering where they fit in US society. ""Then the pandemic made me realise that because I am Asian, and because of how I look like or where I was born, I could never become one of them,"" one woman tells the BBC. Read more about the rise in abuse of Asian Americans and what it reveals about US identity. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News More than 150 different drugs are being researched around the world. Most are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus. Antiviral treatments are being tested to see if they directly affect the coronavirus's ability to thrive inside the body, and drugs that can calm the immune system are also of interest. The latest clinical trials of an antiviral drug originally developed to treat Ebola, for example,have been encouraging. Research centres around the world are alsoattempting to use survivors' bloodas a treatment, in the hope that the antibodies they have built up will help to clear the virus in others.

Parker, who lives in a care home in Scotland, says she was inspired byCaptain Tom Moore, who raised almost Â£33m for the NHS by completing laps of his garden in the run-up to his 100th birthday. Police in Ecuador have raided the offices of the health ministry and the home of the health minister over alleged overpricing of coronavirus testing kits. Jorge Yunda, the mayor of Ecuador's capital, Quito, has called for the temporary resignation of Health Minister Lenin Mantilla so that an independent inquiry can take place. Two-hundred thousand kits were imported from South Korea to be used in Ecuador, one of the worst-affected countries in South America, with nearly 40,000 people infected and more than 3,200 deaths. US President Donald Trump has tweeted that the country has tested 15.5 million people for Covid-19, and that the figure is ""by far the most in the world"". But does this claim stand
up to scrutiny? In fact, the BBC Reality Check
team hasfact-checked the president's claims on testingbefore, and found them
wanting. It is difficult to find truly
accurate numbers for global testing because different countries have different
ways of conducting and counting tests. This means that in order to compare
numbers, we have to decide whether figures from around the world are
comparable, or even trustworthy. According to figures from China's state news agency Xinhua, the combined number of people tested in just two areas totals around 17 million â that's10.41 million in the province of Guangdong,externaland6.5 million in Wuhan,external, where the city authorities say theyplan to test the entire populationof around 11 million. To attain these figures, the Chinese authorities have been ""batch testing"" - testing multiple samples in groups. They expect the vast majority of Covid-19 tests to be negative, which makes sense statistically, but if samples within a certain batch test positive, the samples are then tested individually. So, the total for the whole of China's estimated 1.4 billion population is likely to be much higher than Mr Trump's 15.5 million. But according to BBC China analyst Kerry Allen, there's no way to independently check how many individual tests have been carried out. US President Donald Trump met New York Governor Andrew Cuomo today, and the political rivals discussed major infrastructure projects which Cuomo hopes will help jump-start his state's beleaguered economy. Noting the ""political differences"" between himself and the Republican president, the Democrat said the two had had a good discussion. New York reported 74 deaths in the past 24 hours, continuing the state's downward trend in Covid-19 infections, hospitalisations and fatalities.  Governor Cuomo held his daily news briefing in Washington DC after meeting President Trump Reality Check People in England who are contacted through the new NHS Test and
Trace team will be required to self-isolate for up to 14 days â even if they
donât have symptoms. This means you should stay at home and not leave it for any
reason - including leaving the house to buy food or medicine. Instead,
you should order these online or by phone or ask someone to deliver them to your

home. Find out how self-isolating works and how long you need to do it for. There have been more than 260,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 37,000 people have lost their lives, according to government figures. But these numbers include only people who have been tested. The latest measures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest the total number of deaths is much higher. The first ONS measure, counting death certificates mentioning the virus, suggests deaths reached 45,000 by the week beginning 15 May, while the second, recording deaths over and above the expected number, suggests a toll of more than 59,000 by the same date. Find out how many confirmed cases there are in your area. Gavin LeeBBC Europe reporter Today was all about the pitch by Ursula von der Leyen -a recovery fund worth â¬750bn(Â£670bn; $825bn) - and it's just the start. It will take a Herculean
effort by the European Commission to get all member states on-side, especially as it wants this agreed by leaders at the next EU summit in three weeks' time. After a round-robin of calls to European diplomats this afternoon,
 I got a clear sense that thereâs not yet an overall majority in favour.
Southern Mediterranean countries such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy have
all indicated initial support. There are many countries, including Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and
Lithuania, that wonât commit either way until theyâve read the small print of
the plans. And there is well-publicised opposition from the self-proclaimed
""frugal four"" consisting of Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. The feeling here in Brussels is that it will need to be a face-to-face meeting between leaders to forge a compromise, because videoconferencing
is a poor substitute for fiscal diplomacy. And thatâs not likely to happen
until internal borders are reopened, some time over the summer.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: Ursula von der Leyen speaks of 'Europe's moment' We reported earlier about theâ¬750bn (Â£670bn; $825bn) recovery fundproposed by the EU's executive Commission to help the bloc tackle the coronavirus crisis.

In the coming weeks, more than 12,000 Boeing workers in the US are set to lose their jobs as cuts at the American aerospace giant take effect. The firm said it would inform workers of 6,670 cuts this week and has also approved 5,520 voluntary redundancies. The planned reductions are not a surprise after Boeing revealed plans last month to slash its global workforce by 10% - or roughly 16,000 jobs. ""I wish there were some other way,"" chief executive Dave Calhoun said. The company was already in crisis after two fatal crashes of its 737 Max led to the global grounding of the plane last year - and now a drop in demand for air travel has left it reeling.

The president retweeted a disparaging post from a Fox News personality, apparently insulting Biden's masked appearance. He later denied that he was making fun of his Democratic rival. Trump has mostly refused to wear masks in public, deepening a partisan divide over the practice. A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation this month found that 89% of Democrats and 72% of independents report wearing a mask every time or most of the time when they leave home, compared to 58% of Republicans.

Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the prime minister had given ""no credible explanation"" why evidence had not been passed on to the cabinet secretary to investigate. The Labour MP added that the prime minister's handling of the story had ""undermined the public health message he is trying to put forward"". Sajid Javid, who resigned as chancellor in February after Mr Johnson ordered him to fire his team of aides, also called on Mr Cummings to apologise. In a letter to constituents firstreported by the Bromsgrove Standard,external, he said he did not believe the aide's trip to County Durham was ""necessary or justified"".

The prime minister used the phrase ""move on"" five times in 20 minutes, as he faced hostile questions from select committee chairs. Asked whether the Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK's top civil servant, should investigate Mr Cummings' actions, he said: ""Quite frankly, I am not certain that right now an inquiry into that matter is a very good use of official time. ""We are working flat out on coronavirus."" He said the public wanted the government to ""focus on them and their needs, rather than on a political ding-dong about what one adviser may or may not have done"". This video can not be played Pete Wishart: 80% of people think his chief adviser broke the rules Asked whether the government's ""moral authority"" had been undermined by Mr Cummings' actions and his own defence of them, Mr Johnson said: ""I, of course, am deeply sorry for all the hurt and pain and anxiety that people have been going through throughout this period - this country has been going through a, frankly, most difficult time. ""We are asking people to do quite exceptionally tough things, separating them from their families."" While Mr Johnson was taking part in a video conference with the panel of senior MPs, Conservative MP Giles Watlingtweeted,external: ""I've been listening to the PM in the Liaison Committee. I applaud him for sticking by his man, but I'm afraid Mr Cummings should stand down. ""His continued presence at the heart of government at this time is an unwanted distraction."" Wednesday's session was the first time the prime minister has faced questions from MPs since the allegations against Mr Cummings emerged at the end of last week. He used his appearance at the committee to announce thatNHS England's test and trace system would be up and running from Thursday. He was also quizzed about schools, care homes and the economy. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive from his London home to his parents' farm in County Durham with his wife - who had coronavirus symptoms - and his son has dominated the headlines since the story broke on Friday night. The PM's chief adviser gave a news conference on Monday, explaining that he decided to make the trip because he felt it would be better to self-isolate in a place where he had options for childcare if required. He has received the continued support of the prime minister, who said that his aide had acted legally and with integrity. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

Fund marks 'Europe's moment',"This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen's proposals will have to please ""frugal"" states as well as the Southern European countries that need the money most A recovery fund worth â¬750bn (Â£670bn; $825bn) has been proposed by the EU's executive Commission to help the EU tackle an ""unprecedented crisis"". The package will be made up of grants and loans for every EU member state. Economies across the 27-nation EU bloc have been ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic, but several southern states had big debts even before the crisis. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said ""this is Europe's moment"". ""Things we take for granted are being questioned. None of that can be fixed by any single country alone,"" she told the European Parliament. ""This is about all of us and it is way bigger than any of us."" The Commission has dubbed the plan Next Generation EU. Without the backing of all 27 EU member states, it cannot go ahead. But Germany and France have backed plans for the money to be raised on the capital markets. Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said the fund was a ""European turning point"" that would be added to instruments that had already been launched. Spain and Italy have seen the highest number of deaths in the EU during the coronavirus crisis and, in the wake of the financial crisis, are particularly keen on grants rather than loans being added to their public debt. Several ""frugal"" states object to taking on debt for other countries. Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden reject the idea of cash handouts to relatively poorer countries. Why Merkel may help fund Europe's virus recovery Macron and Merkel float 'ambitious' EU virus fund A PR show of EU unity to the wider, doubting world Mrs von der Leyen said the â¬750bn fund would be made up of â¬500bn in grants and â¬250bn in loans. It would be raised by lifting the EU's resources ceiling to 2% of EU gross national income and would be reliant on the EU's strong credit rating. When added to a proposed â¬1.1 trillion budget for 2021-27, the â¬750bn recovery fund would bring to â¬1.85tn the amount that the Commission says will ""kick-start our economy and ensure Europe bounces forward"". When added to an earlier â¬540bn initial rescue package, that would amount to a total of â¬2.4tn, said the Commission president. The EU's much-cherished four freedoms had to be fully restored, she added, those of freedom of people, goods, services and capital. She said ""this is an urgent and exceptional need for an urgent and exceptional crisis"". The money raised on the capital markets would be paid back over 30 years between 2028 and 2058, but not later. The Commission says it could be paid back in several ways: A carbon tax based on the Emissions Trading Scheme A digital tax A tax on non-recycled plastics This video can not be played Coronavirus leads to food industry crisis in Europe Commissioner Maros Sefcovic says recovery has to be based on green and digital policies as well as ""increased resilience"" and lessons learned from the Covid-19 crisis. The budget will be ""equipped with increased firepower,externalto be able to generate massive investment at the scale and speed needed to kick-start all our economies"", he says. The European Central Bank has played a key role in helping eurozone countries emerge from the debt crisis with its stimulus programme of bond-buying. But concerns about the ECB programme's future were raised earlier this month whenGermany's top court ruled that it violated the German constitution. The UK has left the EU so is unlikely to have any involvement in the fund as it stands. By Gavin Lee, BBC News Brussels Ursula von der Leyen's pitch was just the start of what will take a huge effort to get all member states on side, especially as the Commission wants this agreed at the next leaders' summit in three weeks' time. But I get a clear sense there's not yet an overall majority in favour. Southern Mediterranean countries have all indicated initial support. One Italian diplomat told me, if agreed, Italy may be eligible for grants of up to 5% of the country's GDP. Many, including Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Lithuania, won't commit either way until they've read the small print. ""With these things, the devil is often in the detail,"" one Bulgarian official told me. An Austrian diplomat was encouraged â¬250bn would be raised through loans but suggested â¬500bn in grants was a ""non-starter"" at this point. The feeling here is it will need a face-to-face meeting between leaders to forge a compromise, and that's not likely to happen until internal borders are reopened over the summer. Read more from Gavin. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke of an ""essential day for Europe"" while Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: ""Now let's speed up the negotiation and make the resources available soon."" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the plan included ""many of our demands"" and was ""a starting point for negotiations"". Greece said it was a ""bold proposal"" and it was now up to member states to ""rise to the occasion"". There was a more cautious reaction from some of the so-called ""frugal"" states. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the current budget plan was ""simply too high"". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte had already warned on Tuesday that a recovery fund ""should consist of loans, without any mutualisation of debts"". Plans for the long-heralded Green Recovery Fund have been given a partial welcome by environment groups, even though exact details are yet to be revealed. Campaigners have argued that it is vital for the EU to spend its post Covid-19 stimulus on projects that will also help tackle the climate crisis. They say the package should drive investment into projects needed to meet Europe's net zero emissions target. That includes building renovation, renewables, clean transport, industrial innovation and better land use and food systems. But there's annoyance that Brussels has given way to regions by allowing them to spend their funds however they want until 2022 - even if that means investing in schemes which are good for job-creation but bad for the climate.

Virus 'may scar young throughout working life',"The International Labour Organisation has said young people are disproportionately being affected by the coronavirus health crisis. In a new report the ILO, which is a United Nations agency, warns there is a risk they could be scarred throughout their working lives. They could become what the report calls a ""lockdown generation"". It says young women have been especially hit by the increase in unemployment. Young people have been affected by what the report calls ""a triple shock"". The virus, it says, is destroying their employment, disrupting education and training and putting obstacles in the way of those who want to start work or change jobs. One in five have stopped work since the onset of the pandemic. Among those who have remained in employment, working hours have declined by almost a quarter. Before the crisis, more than 40% of young people were working in hard-hit sectors such as accommodation, food services and retailing. Three quarters were in informal employment and therefore had little protection if they do lose their jobs. In Africa, the figure is more than 90%. Education and training, including ""on the job"" programmes are suffering massive disruption, the ILO says. A great deal of training is now being done at a distance, online. But the ILO says few low-income countries have managed to make that transition. The agency calls for targeted intervention by governments to guarantee employment and training for young people in low and middle-income countries that may need foreign support both for finance and implementation. The report also says that rigorous testing and tracing of infections strongly translates to lower labour market disruption than do confinement and lockdown measures. The ILO argues that testing and tracing improves the chances of what it calls an employment-rich recovery. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Why did he say he predicted the virus?,"Of the many details about travel plans, eye tests, and drives made at Dominic Cummings's Rose Garden press conference on Monday, one thing stood out to me that does matter, and will matter well beyond the future of one adviser. One of the absolutely core issues in assessing the government's early performance in combating the pandemic, is whether it left it too late to impose the lockdown. Scientists involved in pandemic planning have pinpointed a specific error - that it was too reliant on existing mathematic modelling of the pandemic based on influenza. They say it had not accounted for the fact that coronavirus was a different virus. This had two principal vital differences. Coronavirus is far more contagious than the influenza models, and, unlike flu, there are no approved existing vaccines or treatments. This rendered the available pandemic stockpiles of treatments and pre-purchase of tens of millions of vaccines unusable. So only testing, tracing, or forms of social distancing and lockdown were going to work. This video can not be played Dominic Cummings: ""I believe that in all the circumstances, that I behaved reasonably and legally"" So for the PM's chief adviser to claim, in the middle of his defence, ""only last year I wrote explicitly about the danger of coronaviruses"" is worthy of some inspection. Such prescience would indeed have been impressive and helpful, and he does have a long-standing and well-known interest in mathematical modelling and big data. Looking at his blog, there is one reference to coronavirus, and it was indeed in a blog written in March last year. But it wasn't quite as billed. It is a blog about the risk of a pandemic starting from a leak from a biological lab. The point of it is that governments should pay money to ""Red Teams"" to try to break security at such institutions, including Â£1m to ""honey trap"" the security bosses. If this is the writing that ""explicitly"" warned of the danger of coronaviruses, then it rather suggests that a key No 10 figure believes that biolab security is the relevant issue. But then things get even stranger. The internet archive Wayback Machine, which tracks the changing versions of publicly available websites, shows that the blog was edited some time between 9 April and 3 May this year (after the pandemic started) to insert the reference to coronavirus and Chinese labs. This was first pointed out by a data scientist Jens Wiechers on social media,and can be seen here.,external It is in the form ofa new quote from an article,externalalready linked to in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. It was not in the original blog. And the sitemap of Mr Cumming's blog corroborates this, showing that this post was indeed edited at 20:55:20 on the evening of 14 April this year,still available here.,externalThis happens to be the day Mr Cummings returned to work from his Durham trip. I don't regret what I did, says Cummings The families who stayed away in lockdown Dominic Cummings: What did he do during lockdown? Analysis: Johnson failed to close down Cummings story It is a mystery why he felt the need to burnish his credentials as a coronavirus sage so much that he pointed to having explicitly warned about something that was only added to his blog after the event. There is no other reference to coronavirus or Sars or Mers on his blog. There is a page on the mathematics of pandemic modelling and ""herd immunity"" in a long essay written on the education system in 2013, but no references to coronaviruses. It is difficult to see why editing a year-old personal blog would have been on any list of priorities for any No 10 official on a day like that - in the middle of the period where hospital deaths had peaked the previous week, but care home deaths were still mounting. But Mr Cummings clearly felt the need on Monday to point to examples of prescience on this specific issue. The context of his quote on coronavirus was to help disprove the allegation, first made in the Sunday Times, that he had backed a so-called ""herd immunity"" strategy. I've asked No 10 for a response on the change to his blog, the reference to Chinese biolabs, and whether he stands by the idea he explicitly wrote about the dangers of coronaviruses. A source acknowledged that the blog was updated and pointed to the fact that the original blog from last year linked to the separate article [in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists] which did discuss coronaviruses.

Who are the astronauts?,"Bob Behnken (L) and Doug Hurley arrived in Florida on 20 May to prepare for launch Two US astronauts have achieved a world first by travelling to the International Space Station (ISS) and back aboard a spacecraft built by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Here, BBC News profiles the crew members. On 30 May 2020, Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken broke a nine-year hiatus for Nasa, becoming the first astronauts to launch from US soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011. In the intervening years, Nasa bought seats for its astronauts - at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per flight - on the Russian Soyuz. But officials have also worked with Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing to develop new, American spacecraft capable of ferrying humans to and from the ISS - under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program. Musk's vehicle was first to fly; Hurley and Behnken travelled to the ISS in the sleek Crew Dragon spacecraft. Key questions about the mission How we got to this point What is the Crew Dragon? Evolution of the spacesuit What's the mission plan? The Crew Dragon undergoes final processing prior to the Demo-2 launch ""It's well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station and I am certainly honoured to be a part of it,"" Hurley, 53, said at the beginning of May, before the flight. Behnken, 49, added: ""On my first flight... I didn't have a son, so I'm really excited to share the mission with him."" This video can not be played Nasa's Dr Michael Barratt explains what qualities are required of today's astronauts. Nasa chose two of its most experienced astronauts to help California-based SpaceX ready the Crew Dragon for launch. The two are also longstanding friends. ""Being lucky enough to fly with your best friend... I think there's a lot of people who wish they could do that,"" says Hurley. When they launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, their spouses knew exactly what they were going through. That's because they're astronauts too. Marine Colonel Hurley's wife Karen Nyberg flew into space twice - aboard the shuttle and the Soyuz - retiring from Nasa this year. They have a 10-year-old son, Jack, whose formative years were shaped by space travel. Hurley and Nyberg take their son for a stroll in Red Square, just prior to Nyberg's 2013 flight Nyberg began training for a six-month space station mission just a few months after Jack's birth. In the meantime, Hurley was preparing for his own flight - piloting the last ever shuttle mission. Sometimes, Nyberg took Jack to Russia, at other times he stayed at home in Texas. ""Literally from the time Jack was old enough to comprehend things, he was either going to Russia or Skyping with mommy. That's just the way it was,""Hurley told the Houston Chronicle in 2013.,external Air Force Colonel Behnken is married to Megan McArthur, who flew on the last mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. As an active member of the astronaut corps, she is a potential candidate to be the first woman on the Moon when Nasa returns in 2024. Their son, Theo, is six. Hurley, Behnken, Nyberg and McArthur all graduated from the same astronaut class (2000) and attended each other's weddings. The men are so used to each other's company, they now have a spooky rapport. Behnken in 2009, training for the STS-130 shuttle mission They ""can predict - almost by body language - what the person's opinion is or what their next action is going to be,""Behnken told CNN before the launch,external. ""We've just been doing this so long that it's kind of like having a second set of hands."" Hurley says of Behnken: ""I know instantaneously when I've not done something correctly - just put it that way. He doesn't have a good poker face."" But Behnken admits Hurley is the more organised of the two. The older of the two men was raised in the hamlet of Apalachin, in upstate New York. ""It was just a great small town existence... we didn't get a stoplight until I was, I think, in college,"" Hurley said in 2009. Behnken hails from  St Ann, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. In 2010,he described it as ""a blue collar kind of a neighbourhood"",external, adding: ""I guess, in my bag of tricks... I'm more of a working class sort of a person."" Hurley piloted the final flight of the shuttle era, in 2011 He took jobs in construction before deciding that working outdoors in the summer heat wasn't for him. Both men went to college on military scholarships and gained undergraduate degrees in engineering. While Behnken went on to complete a PhD at Caltech - the elite institute featured in the Big Bang Theory television show - Hurley became an officer in the Marines. They both subsequently trained as military test pilots - at different training schools. It's been the archetypal background for Nasa's astronauts since the days of its first intake - the Mercury Seven. ""When I showed up [at Nasa] it was like: 'Well, I have a PhD and an MD,' and I'm sitting there going, 'Mmm, wow! Maybe I was a bit of a slacker',"" said Hurley. ""But you know, your professional development as a pilot and the thousands of hours you get as a pilot... brings something to the table."" Hurley and Behnken were selected as astronaut candidates three years before the shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry, killing seven crew members. After the disaster, Nasa decided it would retire the shuttle, handing over space station transport to private firms. Behnken (L) and Hurley pose for pictures in front of the Crew Dragon Thus, when the two men were finally assigned their flights, the shuttle programme was in its final phase. Their missions focused on fulfilling Nasa's prior commitments to complete construction of the ISS, including the delivery of crew compartments designed to fit in the shuttle's payload bay. When the spaceplane was retired, the pair were assigned to the Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Hurley and Behnken were announced as theprime crew for Demo-2, the first flight of SpaceX's vehicle with humans onboard.,external ""Bob and I, the last two years, have essentially been living in California, working hand-in-hand with the folks at SpaceX to get us to this point,"" Hurley said this month. They've had to get used to the Crew Dragon's touchscreen controls after previously working with the chunky buttons on shuttle instrument panels. Hurley says a background in evaluating military aircraft as test pilots proved crucial in their work with SpaceX. ""That, in and of itself, helped both of us tremendously, because all along the process that you see in the military, there are delays, there are technical challenges, there are things that you don't expect and you have to work through them,"" he explained. Setbacks - including two spectacular explosions that destroyed a rocket and one of the Crew Dragon capsules - have seen the mission slip by nearly four years from its original date of October 2016. ""We were well-prepared for that part of it, when I think it caused some frustration within Nasa as launch dates weren't made,"" explained Hurley. Despite bumps in the road, Behnken's enthusiasm remained undimmed: ""It's probably the dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand new spaceship."" Hurley told CNN: ""From a first flight standpoint, certainly, there might be some greater quantifiable risk to some degree. ""But probably no different to any other spaceflight we've flown humans on before.""

Test and trace system will start on ThursdayAnyone coming into close contact with infected people in England will be told to isolate.,"A massive system to find people who come into close contact with those infected with coronavirus will start in England on Thursday, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister said it ""will change people's lives"". The aim of the test and trace system is to move from lockdown for all towards more targeted measures. However, scientists have warned it is not a ""magic bullet"" and may prevent between 5% and 15% of infections. Northern Irelandhas its own version up and running,Scotlandhas announced its own system will start on Thursday andWales' systemis due to start in early June. As is currently the case, anyone who develops symptoms of coronavirus - a persistent cough, fever or a sudden loss of taste or sense of smell - will have to isolate for seven days and the rest of their household for 14 days. The difference is that from Thursday, everyone with symptoms shouldask for a test online,externalor call to arrange a test by calling 119. If the test comes back negative, everyone in your household can go back to normal. But if the test comes back positive, the NHS Test and Trace team will get in touch - via text, email or phone call - to discuss whom you have come into close contact with. In full: How will contact tracing work in England? Schools and workplaces could see 'local lockdowns' How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Any of those contacts deemed at risk of catching the virus will be instructed by the NHS to go into isolation for 14 days, whether they are sick or not. They will be tested only if they develop symptoms. The rest of their household does not have to isolate, unless someone becomes ill. Those isolating will be eligible for statutory sick pay. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the daily Downing Street briefing this ""must become a new way of life"" and will require a ""national effort"" - otherwise lockdown would have to continue. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Every single person can get a test"" ""It is your civic duty, so you avoid unknowingly spreading the virus and you help to break the chain of transmission,"" he said. He also confirmed that, from Thursday, anyone with symptoms - including the under-5s - can be tested for coronavirus. Earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee that the government ""will consider bringing in financial sanctions"" if people do not self-isolate. Only people who have been ""close"" to an infected person will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace. It will not be the case that one teacher testing positive would lead to the whole school going into isolation, for example. Close contacts are: people you spend 15 minutes or more with at a distance of less than 2m people you have direct contact with - such as sexual partners, household members or people with whom you have had face-to-face conversations at a distance of less than 1m The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? At the moment coronavirus is being suppressed by lockdown restrictions which are applied across the whole of society. The ambition is to pivot from lockdown for the many to isolation for the few. How far that can go will depend on the effectiveness of the scheme. Baroness Dido Harding, the chairwoman of NHS Test and Trace, said: ""[It] is designed to enable the vast majority to get on with their lives in a much more normal way... trading national lockdown for individual isolation."" Test and trace will also give far more detail on how and where the virus is spreading. Mr Hancock said this information could lead tolocal lockdowns to tackle flare-upsin towns, schools or workplaces. A report published earlier by the Royal Society said the success of the scheme would depend on how quickly contacts can be found and whether the public buys in. It concluded that between 5% and 15% of infections could be prevented. But the 15% figure depends on finding contacts within three days and 80% of people reporting their symptoms or going into isolation when asked. Prof Anne Johnson, one of the report's authors, said: ""It is an important part in bringing the pandemic under control, but we're very clear it is not a magic bullet."" This is a big ask - there will be a lot for people to get used to. First, if you test positive for the virus you will be expected to pass on contact details of people you have recently met. Some may be concerned about that though NHS leaders emphasise that confidentiality and data security will be rigorously observed. On the other hand you may get a call from a contact tracer and advised you are at risk because of a recent encounter with someone with the virus. And even if you are fit and well you will still be told to self-isolate for two weeks. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has called on people to do their civic duty. The big question is whether sufficient numbers will respond positively to that. Sanctions have not been ruled out if they don't. There's a lot riding on policies like this to be adopted in every part of the UK, not least as a vehicle to help each nation out of lockdown. Instead, social distancing, hand hygiene and isolating everyone who gets ill will have a far greater effect, the report said. By comparison, isolating cases and quarantining members of their household is thought to cut infections by 50%. And scientists,including those advising the government, have warned thatthe row over the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummingswill make it harder to get public support such measures. The government says it has 25,000 contact tracers ready to go and that it has plenty of testing capacity. The contacts of 2,000 people who have just tested positive for coronavirus will be chased on Thursday. However, the real pressure will be on the speed of testing. Prof John Newton, the national coordinator of Test and Trace said: ""In order to be successful it requires rapid testing."" Mr Johnson said on Wednesday there was now a target to get test results in less than 24 hours. There is a particular problem with home testing kits, which have to be posted out. Prof Newton said it would be ""very difficult"" to get those results in less than 48 hours. The NHS contact tracing app is not ready to roll out and was described by Mr Hancock as a ""complement"". He denied technical issues were delaying its roll out. In other developments: A further 412 coronavirus deaths were recorded in all settings across the UK, taking the confirmed death toll to 37,460 The prime minister said he has asked scientists to review the 2m social distancing rule as the virus is suppressed in order to help public transport and the hospitality sector Mr Johnson has ruled out an inquiry into Mr Cummings' conduct during lockdown,insisting it was time to ""move on"" from the row Local lockdownsare not being considered in Walesto maintain a ""clear message"" about coronavirus, the Welsh Government has said FollowJameson Twitter,external CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL:Take a look behind the scenes of the NHS ESCAPE WITH NORMAL PEOPLE:The show everyone is talking about Schools and workplaces could see 'local lockdowns' Track and trace system in place from June - PM Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

A company called Zipline will be allowed to use drones on two specified routes after the Federal Aviation Administration granted it an emergency waiver. It is the first time the FAA has allowed beyond-line-of-sight drone deliveries in the US. Read more here. Mackenzie beach in the coastal city of Larnaca, Cyprus Cyprus says it will cover all costs - including medication, accommodation, food and drink - for anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 while on holiday on the Mediterranean island. Patients and their families on vacation there will only have to pay to be transported back to the airport and for their flights home. An exclusive 100-bed hospital, equipped with intensive care units and respirators, will provide care for anyone who becomes seriously ill with the virus, the government says. A 500-bed ""quarantine hotel"" will also be provided. The Cypriot government says that its tourist season will open on 9 June to travellers from Germany, Greece and Israel. ""For our important markets like the UK, Russia and Sweden, I expect early July,"" deputy tourism minister Savvas Perdios said. Last year's 4 July celebration in DC US President Donald Trump is pushing ahead with his plans for a 4 July parade in Washington, DC, in the face of protests from local lawmakers and virus concerns. A group of Democratic lawmakers penned a letter to the Trump administration saying that Trump's proposed parade would ""needlessly risk the health and safety of thousands of Americans"". DC will begin its phased reopening later this week, though gatherings of 10 or more people are still banned. Gatherings of more than 250 people - like the crowds that assembled for last year's celebration - will not be allowed until a virus vaccine is found, or the public health risk is drastically reduced. Trump's Salute to America - last year's 4 July celebration in DC - featured military flyovers and fireworks, drew tens of thousands of people to downtown DC, and cost $5.4m (Â£4.4m). A scientist works on a possible Covid-19 vaccine at a lab in Maryland Fewer than half of Americans say they would get a vaccine for the coronavirus if one became available, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. While just 49% of Americans would opt in, the majority - 61% - say they expect a vaccine will be publicly available by 2021, with only 17% saying it will take longer. About 1 in 5 Americans say they do not plan to get vaccinated, while 31% remain unsure. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump unveiled Operation Warp Speed, a mission to expedite vaccine development. He has promised to deliver a jab by year-end, a timeline widely disputed by scientists.  The only two hospitals in Southern California's rural Imperial County were forced to close their doors to new Covid patients this week, after admitting a flood of patients from Mexico. Roughly half of the coronavirus patients in several of the California hospitals dotting the US southern border are recent arrivals from Mexico, reports the Washington Post newspaper. The patients traveling from Mexico to the US include some of the 1.5 million Americans who live there. As a result, Imperial County - which sits directly on the border - has a markedly higher rate of infection than any other county in California: 760 per 100,000 residents, the Post reports.  Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The Prime Minister's adviser Dominic Cummings says he drove 30 minutes from Durham to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight before driving back to London after recovering from coronavirus symptoms. Eye symptoms with coronavirus have been reported, say the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the College of Optometrists. Like any upper respiratory tract infection, including colds and flu, it can cause irritation of the membrane covering the eye - a condition called conjunctivitis or sometimes pink or red eye (because the whites of the eyes become bloodshot). The World Health Organization now includes this alongside other more common symptoms of the virus - but UK guidelines do not. Viral conjunctivitis can make the eyes water and feel gritty and uncomfortable, rather than painful. It does not usually interfere greatly with eyesight. Read more here. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, authorities in New York City and Los Angeles say that hate incidents against people of Asian descent have increased considerably. A reporting centre says it has receivedover 1,700 reports of coronavirus-related discrimination,externalfrom at least 45 US states since it launched in March. In states including New York, California, and Texas, East Asians have been spat on, punched or kicked - and in one case even stabbed. The spike in anti-Asian prejudice has left many Asian Americans wondering where they fit in US society. ""Then the pandemic made me realise that because I am Asian, and because of how I look like or where I was born, I could never become one of them,"" one woman tells the BBC. Read more about the rise in abuse of Asian Americans and what it reveals about US identity. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News More than 150 different drugs are being researched around the world. Most are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus. Antiviral treatments are being tested to see if they directly affect the coronavirus's ability to thrive inside the body, and drugs that can calm the immune system are also of interest. The latest clinical trials of an antiviral drug originally developed to treat Ebola, for example,have been encouraging. Research centres around the world are alsoattempting to use survivors' bloodas a treatment, in the hope that the antibodies they have built up will help to clear the virus in others.

Parker, who lives in a care home in Scotland, says she was inspired byCaptain Tom Moore, who raised almost Â£33m for the NHS by completing laps of his garden in the run-up to his 100th birthday. Police in Ecuador have raided the offices of the health ministry and the home of the health minister over alleged overpricing of coronavirus testing kits. Jorge Yunda, the mayor of Ecuador's capital, Quito, has called for the temporary resignation of Health Minister Lenin Mantilla so that an independent inquiry can take place. Two-hundred thousand kits were imported from South Korea to be used in Ecuador, one of the worst-affected countries in South America, with nearly 40,000 people infected and more than 3,200 deaths. US President Donald Trump has tweeted that the country has tested 15.5 million people for Covid-19, and that the figure is ""by far the most in the world"". But does this claim stand
up to scrutiny? In fact, the BBC Reality Check
team hasfact-checked the president's claims on testingbefore, and found them
wanting. It is difficult to find truly
accurate numbers for global testing because different countries have different
ways of conducting and counting tests. This means that in order to compare
numbers, we have to decide whether figures from around the world are
comparable, or even trustworthy. According to figures from China's state news agency Xinhua, the combined number of people tested in just two areas totals around 17 million â that's10.41 million in the province of Guangdong,externaland6.5 million in Wuhan,external, where the city authorities say theyplan to test the entire populationof around 11 million. To attain these figures, the Chinese authorities have been ""batch testing"" - testing multiple samples in groups. They expect the vast majority of Covid-19 tests to be negative, which makes sense statistically, but if samples within a certain batch test positive, the samples are then tested individually. So, the total for the whole of China's estimated 1.4 billion population is likely to be much higher than Mr Trump's 15.5 million. But according to BBC China analyst Kerry Allen, there's no way to independently check how many individual tests have been carried out. US President Donald Trump met New York Governor Andrew Cuomo today, and the political rivals discussed major infrastructure projects which Cuomo hopes will help jump-start his state's beleaguered economy. Noting the ""political differences"" between himself and the Republican president, the Democrat said the two had had a good discussion. New York reported 74 deaths in the past 24 hours, continuing the state's downward trend in Covid-19 infections, hospitalisations and fatalities.  Governor Cuomo held his daily news briefing in Washington DC after meeting President Trump Reality Check People in England who are contacted through the new NHS Test and
Trace team will be required to self-isolate for up to 14 days â even if they
donât have symptoms. This means you should stay at home and not leave it for any
reason - including leaving the house to buy food or medicine. Instead,
you should order these online or by phone or ask someone to deliver them to your
home. You should not have visitors and you should do any exercise at
home. Find out how self-isolating works and how long you need to do it for. There have been more than 260,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 37,000 people have lost their lives, according to government figures. But these numbers include only people who have been tested. The latest measures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest the total number of deaths is much higher. The first ONS measure, counting death certificates mentioning the virus, suggests deaths reached 45,000 by the week beginning 15 May, while the second, recording deaths over and above the expected number, suggests a toll of more than 59,000 by the same date. Find out how many confirmed cases there are in your area. Gavin LeeBBC Europe reporter Today was all about the pitch by Ursula von der Leyen -a recovery fund worth â¬750bn(Â£670bn; $825bn) - and it's just the start. It will take a Herculean
effort by the European Commission to get all member states on-side, especially as it wants this agreed by leaders at the next EU summit in three weeks' time. After a round-robin of calls to European diplomats this afternoon,
 I got a clear sense that thereâs not yet an overall majority in favour.
Southern Mediterranean countries such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy have
all indicated initial support. There are many countries, including Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and
Lithuania, that wonât commit either way until theyâve read the small print of
the plans. And there is well-publicised opposition from the self-proclaimed
""frugal four"" consisting of Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. The feeling here in Brussels is that it will need to be a face-to-face meeting between leaders to forge a compromise, because videoconferencing
is a poor substitute for fiscal diplomacy. And thatâs not likely to happen
until internal borders are reopened, some time over the summer.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: Ursula von der Leyen speaks of 'Europe's moment' We reported earlier about theâ¬750bn (Â£670bn; $825bn) recovery fundproposed by the EU's executive Commission to help the bloc tackle the coronavirus crisis. Here are two charts explaining how the package, made up of grants and loans, will be distributed and invested among EU member states. In the coming weeks, more than 12,000 Boeing workers in the US are set to lose their jobs as cuts at the American aerospace giant take effect. The firm said it would inform workers of 6,670 cuts this week and has also approved 5,520 voluntary redundancies. The planned reductions are not a surprise after Boeing revealed plans last month to slash its global workforce by 10% - or roughly 16,000 jobs. ""I wish there were some other way,"" chief executive Dave Calhoun said. The company was already in crisis after two fatal crashes of its 737 Max led to the global grounding of the plane last year - and now a drop in demand for air travel has left it reeling.

The president retweeted a disparaging post from a Fox News personality, apparently insulting Biden's masked appearance. He later denied that he was making fun of his Democratic rival. Trump has mostly refused to wear masks in public, deepening a partisan divide over the practice. A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation this month found that 89% of Democrats and 72% of independents report wearing a mask every time or most of the time when they leave home, compared to 58% of Republicans.

Evolution of the spacesuit,"The spacesuits worn by astronauts for the Crew Dragon mission have been getting a lot of attention. How do they differ from other astronaut attire down the years? The futuristic flight suits worn by Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken during Saturday's successful launch look a world away from the bulky orange shuttle flight suits worn when astronauts last launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center. The helmets are 3D-printed and the gloves are touchscreen-sensitive. But their primary purpose remains the same - to protect crew members from depressurisation, where air is lost from the capsule. The suits also ensure astronauts have sufficient oxygen and regulate their temperature. A communications link and breathable air are provided via a single ""umbilical"" cable in the seat that plugs in to the suit. Bob Behnken suits up in the sleek SpaceX suit The Starman suits, as they've been called, are all in one piece and customised for the astronaut. Their look was conceived by Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez, who has worked on Captain America: Civil War and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. But they are just designed for use inside the SpaceX capsule, known as the Crew Dragon, and are not suitable for use on spacewalks. Aerospace giant Boeing also has a contract with Nasa to carry astronauts to the space station in its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft. It has developed a pressure suit to protect astronauts during the key phases of launch and re-entry. Key questions about the mission How we got to this point What is the Crew Dragon? Who are the astronauts? What's the mission plan? The Boeing Blue suit, as worn by Nasa astronaut Chris Ferguson The Boeing Blue suits are about 40% lighter than earlier generations of spacesuits worn by American astronauts - and more flexible. They contain different internal layers to keep astronauts cool. The suit also has touchscreen-sensitive gloves - so astronauts can work with tablets in the spacecraft. The soft, hood-like helmet features a wide polycarbonate visor to give Starliner passengers better peripheral vision throughout their ride to and from space. Zips in the torso area will make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing. In October 2019, Nasa shared a close-up look at two next-generation suits for the agency's Artemis programme. Under this effort, Nasa will seek to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024, using the agency's Orion spacecraft. The Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or xEMU, (L) and the Orion Crew Survival Suit being revealed in 2019 One of the suits is called the Orion Crew Survival System, and is comparable to the suits used by SpaceX and Boeing. It recalls the so-called Pumpkin suits used by space shuttle astronauts, but is more lightweight. The other suit, called the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) suit is designed to be worn on the surface of the Moon. It is much bulkier than the pressure suits designed to be worn inside spacecraft. This is because it needs to protect the wearer from temperature extremes outside the walls of the spacecraft. It is also designed to provide some shielding against micrometeorites and other small particles of space debris. In these respects, it is similar to suits previously used for spacewalking at the International Space Station (ISS). Cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov wearing the Orlan suit outside the space station in 2014 There are two suits used for spacewalking at the ISS. One is the Russian Orlan type, which was first used in December 1977. The Orlan is a one-piece spacesuit. The ""backpack"" opens like a fridge door, allowing the spacewalker to climb inside. Nasa's Extravehicular Mobility Suit (EMU) was introduced in 1981 and is the other suit used at the space station. Swedish astronaut Christer Fuglesang on a spacewalk in the EMU Unlike the Orlan, the EMU comes in separate pieces, with a bottom and top half. The semi-rigid suit provides around 8.5 hours of life support for its wearer outside in the vacuum of space. Astronauts travelling to the ISS train with both suits. The suit worn by Apollo astronauts on the Moon was also called the EMU - though it's different from the modern design. It was the result of years of development. Buzz Aldrin on the Moon in 1969 Spacesuits have come a long way since the first spacewalk by the late cosmonaut Alexei Leonov in March 1965. Leonov's suit inflated after he stepped out into the vacuum, so that his hands came out of his gloves. Only by bleeding air out of the suit, which put the cosmonaut at risk of the bends, was he able to get back inside the spacecraft. A painting by Alexei Leonov of his spacewalk in 1965 . Â© 2025 BBC.

How will contact tracing work in England?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

How we got to this point,"Elon Musk's SpaceX is flying people to and from the International Space Station (ISS), using the Crew Dragon vehicle. But why is Nasa paying a private company to launch its astronauts? To understand the background to the Crew Dragon missions, we need to go back almost 20 years to a tragic accident. On 1 February 2003, the space shuttle Columbia broke apart while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. All seven astronauts aboard perished in the disaster. The loss of Columbia and its crew was the trigger for a dramatic shift in direction for America's human spaceflight programme. On 14 January 2004, President George W Bush announced that the space shuttle would be retired after completion of the International Space Station (ISS). In its place, America would build a new vehicle capable of returning astronauts to the Moon. Artwork: Nasa conceived of the Orion spacecraft as a replacement to the shuttle The following year, then-Nasa chief Mike Griffin announced that the completion of the ISS would, for the first time, open up commercial opportunities for the routine transportation of cargo and astronauts to low-Earth orbit. This, Griffin reasoned, was required to free up enough funds to achieve a Moon return. Nasa established a Commercial Crew & Cargo Program Office (C3PO) to oversee the effort. At the time, SpaceX, the company started by South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk was just a few years old. Musk had lofty ambitions about bringing down the cost of spaceflight by re-using space hardware and settling humans on Mars. ""SpaceX was founded to make life multi-planetary,"" says Jessica Jensen, director of Starship mission hardware and operation at SpaceX. But, she adds: ""We were a very small company for several years. So we had to look for opportunities - how do you go from being a small company to actually putting people into orbit. When Nasa came out with the need to fly cargo to and from the International Space Station, we jumped on that."" The Dragon 1 spacecraft was designed to carry cargo to and from the space station SpaceX was shortlisted for evaluation under the Nasa cargo programme in 2006. But by 2008, SpaceX and Tesla, the electric car manufacturer in which Musk had invested, were running low on cash. Musk was faced with an impossible choice: ""I could either split the funds that I had between the two companies, or focus it on one company - with certain death for the other,""he told Business Insider in 2013.,external ""I decided in the end to split what I had and try to keep both companies alive. But that could have been a terrible decision that could have resulted in both companies dying."" Fortunately, on 23 December 2008, Nasa awarded SpaceX with a $1.6bn contract to ferry cargo and supplies to the ISS. Describing his reaction, Musk said: ""I couldn't even maintain my composure, I was like: 'I love you guys'."" The company's Dragon 1 capsule could carry cargo and supplies, but not humans. Nevertheless, it represented a milestone for the company. In November 2008, Barack Obama had been elected president. His administration kicked off a review of the human spaceflight programme, which led to the cancellation of his predecessor's plan to return to the Moon (known as Constellation). SpaceX performed a successful flight to the space station without crew in 2019 However, the Obama administration favoured the continued commercialisation of space, backing the development of private crew vehicles. But it would take time and, after the space shuttle was retired, Nasa had to fill the gap by paying Russia tens of millions of dollars per seat to fly its astronauts to the ISS on the Soyuz vehicle, which launches from Baikonur in Kazakhstan. Congress was initially sceptical about the Commercial Crew Program and did not provide sufficient funds at first. But Charles Bolden, the former astronaut who took over from Griffin as Nasa chief under Obama, persisted and eventually secured the support he needed. From their initial $50m investment in the programme in 2010, the space agency whittled several competing companies down to two - SpaceX and Boeing - in 2014. Since then, they have been refining and testing their spacecraft designs. In March 2019, SpaceX performed a triumphant launch of the Crew Dragon without astronauts. Using automated procedures, the capsule successfully approached and docked with the space station. It was carrying a mannequin called Ripley - after Ellen Ripley, the protagonist in the Alien movies - decked out with sensors to measure the G forces experienced during flight, particularly the launch and return phases. Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the aim of taking humans to other planets Despite this success, and others along the way, it hasn't always been plain sailing for SpaceX. In 2016, a Falcon 9 rocket blew up on the launch pad. And in April 2019, a Crew Dragon capsule exploded during a so-called static fire test on the ground. No one was hurt in either event. The spacecraft was also having problems with the parachute system designed to bring it back safely to Earth. These mishaps, along withearlier funding shortfalls for the Commercial Crew Program,external, had introduced delays to an original timeline that would have seen SpaceX launch crew to the ISS in October 2016. Frustrated by the hold ups and the time SpaceX was spending on its Starship project to build a super heavy-lift launch vehicle, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted: Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Bridenstine sent the tweet the night before a major Starship media event where Musk was due to speak. The next day, Musk shot back with a dig at the agency's own timelines. Asked about the tweet by CNN, Musk answered: ""Did he (Bridenstine) say Commercial Crew or SLS?"" The SpaceX founder was referring to Nasa's Space Launch System rocket - designed to launch humans to the Moon - which has also been hit by delays and cost overruns. Musk's company wasn't alone in experiencing challenges, however. A timing anomaly prevented Boeing's spacecraft - the CST-100 Starliner - from docking with the space station during an uncrewed test flight last year. This video can not be played ""Go Nasa, go SpaceX. God speed Bob and Doug"" However, a successful in-flight test of the Crew Dragon's launch abort system in January 2020 helped clear the way for the historic first lift-off with astronauts from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on 30 May. Nasa's Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken spent two months aboard the ISS before returning to Earth safely in the capsule. In the post-launch press conference, both Bridenstine and Musk struck more conciliatory tones, in contrast to the tensions over the Starship project. ""If you would have told me then (eight months prior, when he sent the tweet) that we would be right here today, I don't know that I would have believed it,"" said Bridenstine. ""Since that day, Elon Musk and SpaceX have delivered on everything Nasa has asked them to deliver on - and at a speed that we never would have guessed."" The Nasa chief also congratulated SpaceX on its safety culture. Musk replied: ""Nasa made us way better than we would otherwise have been - and of course, we couldn't even have got started without Nasa.""

When will shops open and what will the rules be?,"Many non-essential shops have already reopened, and now restaurants, pubs, hairdressers, outdoor gyms, and other venues will be able to join them from 4 July So, what can customers expect? Shops in England, including those offering clothes, toys, books and electronics, are already throwing open their doors to customers again. Shops in Northern Ireland have reopened too. Many have been announcing their plans: John Lewis isstarting by opening 13 branchesin stages Next is reopening just 25 of its 500 stores at first Debenhams isreopening 50 stores in Englandand three in Northern Ireland Marks and Spencer is reopening all its shops in England and Northern Ireland JD Sports is reopening all 309 of its stores in England Primark is reopening all 153 of its stores in England Argos, which has kept outlets in Sainsbury's stores open, is reopening 145 standalone stores for click and collect TopShop is reopening all its stores in England and selected ones in Northern Ireland Music retailer HMV is reopening 93 of its 113 stores Currys PC World is reopening 131 of its outlets Mobile phone operators are reopening too. Three UK is starting with 250 stores, Vodafone is opening 65 and EE is opening all its shops in England, while O2 has opened ""some"" shops River Island is opening 150 stores, with more to follow on Thursday Gap is reopening all its 81 shops in England H&M is opening ""the majority"" of its English stores DIY, furniture and bicycle stores have also been reopening, following garden centres, open-air markets and car showrooms. Furniture giant Ikeaopened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. Supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations stayed open during lockdown. Can my boss force me to go back to work? Shops which reopenmust meet the government's Covid-19 secure guidelines.,external These include showing customers they are aware of safety measures, putting protective coverings on large items like beds or sofas, and frequent cleaning of regularly-touched surfaces. Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2 metres (6ft) apart had become a regular fixture. But this 2m-metre rule has now been reduced to a minimum of 1m. But some more unfamiliar measures - including pleas not to touch items unless you intend to buy - have been announced by some other shops. For example, John Lewis will clean baskets after each use, and will not let customers use fitting rooms. Services such as personal styling, the bureau de change and food and drink outlets will be closed. Marks & Spencer will also not be offering all of its services, such as its bra-fitting service, for example. What will a post-lockdown high street look like? Jobs go as Debenhams shuts more stores All the staff at Next will wear plastic visors, with the option to also wear masks if they want to. Waterstones says it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. River Island says it will do the same with items of clothing, Currys PC World says only 42 of its shops will be fully open from Monday, with full browsing access for customers. In another 89 outlets, shoppers will be able to request products at the entrance and have them collected by staff. Some shops, including Three UK and River Island, will have reduced opening hours to begin with. H&M says it will make customers use different entrances and exits, while only a limited number of people will be allowed in at any one time. Stores have been askedto encourage people to shop alone,external. Big retailers have been urged to talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible,to stop people using public transport. The number of customers in stores will be limited, while shopping centres have been told they are responsible for controlling queues in common areas outside stores. A reduction of the 2m distancing rule to what the prime minister called a ""1m-plus rule"" means many businesses in England have been given the green light to reopen from 4 July. Pubs and restaurants can start serving customers indoors, although it will be limited to table service only. Hairdressers can reopen, but staff must wear visors. Museums, hotels, cinemas, camping parks and outdoor gyms are among other areas that can also reopen provided safety measures are in place, such as distancing. But nightclubs, swimming pools, indoor gyms and casinos are among sectors that will remain closed. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping In Northern Ireland,all shops are now allowed to open. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said thatall shops can open on Monday 22 Juneas long as they havesocial distancing measuresin place. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that smaller shops and outdoor marketswill be allowed to reopen from 29 June in phase twoof the country's lockdown-easing plan. Shops of all sizes will be able to open from that date as long as they have outdoor entrances and exits. Indoor shopping centres will remain closed, except for essential retailers such as supermarkets and pharmacists. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in his latest easing measures that he expects Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to continue ""responding at their own pace"". The British Retail Consortium (BRC) predicted that it may take time for customers to return to their old shopping habits. It estimated that the lockdown has cost non-essential retailers Â£1.8bn a week in lost sales. However,there were queues outside some Primark shops in London and Birminghambefore their 08:00 BST opening times. And the Birmingham branch opened its doors 35 minutes early to satisfy the demand. Primark says no 'special discounts' at reopening Most shops - like this Primark in Birmingham - have been locked since 23 March Queues also formed outside shops such as TK Maxx and Foot Lockerin the centre of Manchester. With many people fearful for their jobs, now may not be the time to splurge on the High Street - but there may be bargains.

Abused wife entitled to killed husband's estate,"This video can not be played Speaking to reporters during a press conference, Sally Challen said: ""I still love Richard and miss him dreadfully"" An abused woman who won an appeal after killing her controlling husband with a hammer can inherit his estate, a judge has ruled. Sally Challen, 65, was found guilty of murdering 61-year-old Richard in Surrey and jailed for life in 2011. She was freed after her conviction was quashed in February last year and prosecutors later accepted her manslaughter plea. Judge Paul Matthews has now ruled that Mrs Challen can inherit his estate. He concluded that a rule barring people who kill from inheriting their victim's estate should be waived in Mrs Challen's case. Sally Challen had never denied killing her husband in 2010 The judge analysed arguments about Mrs Challen's inheritance claim at a High Court hearing in Bristol earlier this month before announcing his decision. Mr Challen had left no will and a major asset, the home the Challens shared, had been jointly owned. Judge Matthews said his decision would mean that Mrs Challen, not the couple's sons, would inherit the estate. He added: ""I emphasise that the facts of this terrible case are so extraordinary, with such a fatal combination of conditions and events, that I would not expect them easily to be replicated in any other."" Sally and Richard Challen had two sons and had been married for 31 years Mrs Challen, of Claygate in Surrey, was given a life term after being convicted of murder at a trial at Guildford Crown Court in summer 2011. Appeal judgesquashed that murder conviction in February last yearand ordered a new trial. A judge had been due to oversee a new trial but Mrs Challen was released following a preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey, after prosecutors accepted her plea to manslaughter. The first Christmas with Mum after she's freed from jail Wife home after murder conviction quashed Abused wife will not face murder retrial The lesser charge was accepted on the grounds of diminished responsibility after a psychiatric report concluded Mrs Challen was suffering from an ""adjustment disorder"". Mr Justice Edis said the killing came after ""years of controlling, isolating and humiliating conduct"" with the added provocation of her husband's ""serial multiple infidelity"". He imposed a new sentence of nine years and four months for manslaughter, but concluded that she had already served her time.

No decision on all primary years back to school,"There is still no decision on whether all primary children will really be asked back to school next month, schools minister Nick Gibb told MPs. After the first wave of pupils return on 1 June in England, ministers aim for all primary year groups to go back for four weeks before the end of term. Mr Gibb was pressed by MPs on the education select committee whether this full return in mid-June was ""unlikely"". ""It is difficult to say,"" the minister told the select committee. The minister for school standards was challenged by MPs about whether plans to bring all primary year groups back into school for the last month of term were still going ahead. 'Virus may be here for year' so schools must open School reopening plan will go ahead, says PM Teachers 'unconvinced' by school reopening evidence ""Is it unlikely that the government's ambition for all children in primary school to return before the summer is going to happen?"" asked committee chair, Robert Halfon. ""I think you need to give some steer,"" Mr Halfon urged the minister. ""It is difficult to say. It will be totally led by the science,"" said Mr Gibb. He told MPs the decision - which would mean more than another two million children returning to primary school - would depend on the level of coronavirus infection over the ""next few weeks"". Head teachers, uncertain about what they should be planning, have questioned the plausibility ofaccommodating all years in primary school, when they will be limited to 15 pupils per classroom. Committee member Christian Wakeford MP said that in some schools there was ""literally no room"" for that to be done safely. The minister suggested there could be a rota system - but also spoke of the importance of full-time lessons so that parents would be able to go to work. ""It's better for children to have full-time education consistently, "" he told MPs. Mr Gibb was challenged over whether the row over Dominic Cummings had damaged the credibility of the government's health messages - which could reduce trust in the safety of returning to school. ""The government's message has been undermined - and even though the law may not have been broken, the spirit of the law has indeed been broken,"" said Conservative MP Jonathan Gullis. He asked how the Department for Education could ""rebuild and regain confidence"". Mr Gibb said that: ""The reason we can even have this discussion is because of the success of people's commitment to social distancing."" He told MPs: ""The more we all adhere to the rules the more that we'll be able to make further progress in reopening schools."" There were later warnings about public trust being undermined from the Early Years Alliance, representing nurseries, pre-school providers and child minders. Chief executive Neil Leitch said childcare providers were working hard to reopen and were concerned their efforts were going to be damaged by the Cummings row, with parents losing confidence in the credibility of the government's safety assurances. ""Anything that erodes public faith in the government's public health messages - and, in turn, risks damaging parents' trust in the government's rationale for asking childcare providers to reopen - is of course going to be of concern,"" he said. Mr Gullis, a former teacher, went on to tell Mr Gibb at the committee hearing that he was ""baffled"" that the DfE had not opted to bring back Year 5 age group in England, seeing as they faced national curriculum tests, or Sats, next year. Mr Gibb said Sats were primarily an accountability measure for primary schools and were ""not qualifications for young people like GCSEs and A-levels - they're not qualifications that that affect their future"". ""No-one asks how young people did in their Sats like they do GCSEs, A-levels, degree and technical qualifications."" MPs also raised concerns that boys and children from ethnic minorities in Years 11 and 13 - who will receive their GCSE and A-levels results on the basis of teacher predictions and rankings - might be unfairly disadvantaged because of unconscious bias. Mr Gibb said he and the exams watchdog, Ofqual, had consulted widely and had devised a system that was ""the best way to deliver fair results"". ""Ultimately, the head teacher will sign off that calculated, estimated grades are fair and right and that the rank order of pupils is fair and right. ""The onus is on teachers to be as fair and accurate as they can be and, given their professionalism, I'm sure they will be."" Committee chair Mr Halfon asked if children in Years 11 and 13 would receive any help from their school if they opted to take resits in the autumn. ""For many young people retaking their GCSEs, it will be about revision, I'm afraid, at home and it will depend on the relationship that they have with their school, particularly if they've left,"" Mr Gibb said. ""Some won't have have left, some will be going into the sixth form in the school and will still have the relationship with the school. ""But these are issues that we are addressing because we want to make sure that this system is as fair as possible for all young people."" Mr Gibb also revealed that he was having discussions about possible summer school catch-up sessions. ""We are talking to the sector, to education charities, to those engaged in teacher training and so on, with a view to coming forward with a package of catch-up over the summer. ""I'm being a bit coy with details because we are still having these discussions now and we will be able to say something fairly soon about the outcome of those discussions."" Asked about the problems many families faced over the free school meal vouchers, Mr Gibb acknowledged the scheme had had ""a bumpy start"", but said it had delivered millions of pounds worth of food. The cost of the national voucher scheme would be met by the department over the half term break, he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Coronavirus in Wales: Date set for contact tracing to startUpdates on the pandemic in Wales from Wednesday 27 May.Wales,"The contacts of people who receive a positive coronavirus test result in Wales will be traced from 1 June, the Welsh Government has announced Local lockdowns are not being considered in Wales to maintain a ""clear message"" about coronavirus, the Welsh Government says Tributes are paid to two Cardiff and Vale healthcare workers who died after contracting coronavirus Eleven more people have died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 1,293, Public Health Wales said on Wednesday Some coursework could be removed and courses streamlined for pupils due to sit A-level and GCSE exams next year, regulator Qualifications Wales says Ministers are due to set out how Â£2.4bn is being spent to help firms and public services struggling with the coronavirus pandemic A Conservative MP says his family has been reminded of the government's lockdown rules amid reports police broke up a party at his house A wildlife charity has suggested ways Wales can recover from the Covid-19 outbreak and protect the environment at the same time David Dulin and Rhiannon Beacham That brings an end to today's coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Wales. Here's what's happened: The vast sums of public money being spent by the Welsh Government to tackle the coronavirus pandemic have been revealed. Ministers said Â£2.4bn is going onhealthcare, businesses, councils and elsewhereto tackle the effects of Covid-19. Most - Â£1.6bn - is being used to support the economy.  Lucy Williamson would happily exercise locally like the government advice but she can't as her local park is shut. It affected her mental heath so much she now drives for a walk - but wishes the park near her house was available. Now a mental health charityis calling for more parks to be reopened in Wales. The Welsh Government has said the decision to shut parks is up to local authorities. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Not being able to walk in park 'really upsetting' A Conservative MP has
accused Dominic Cummings of showing a ""lack of judgement"" over his
controversial trip to Barnard Castle during the lockdown. The aide to Prime
Minister Boris Johnson has come under intense scrutiny in recent days after he
drove 260 miles to his parents' home in Durham in March. Wrexham MP Sarah
Atherton said she had been contacted by a number of constituents who were concerned about his actions. In an email sent in
response, the former nurse said she understood his explanation for the main
journey due to fears over safeguarding and a lack of childcare if he became
incapacitated by Covid-19. However, Ms Atherton
criticised a shorter trip he later made to the town of Barnard Castle, which
the senior adviser said was to test his ability to drive back to London, after
experiencing loss of vision due to the virus. ""I
cannot understand the rationale behind his journey to Barnard Castle, she said. âAs a figure in the
public eye he showed poor judgement, and I fear his actions may undermine the
national message."" Unlike some of her Tory colleagues, Ms Atherton, who was elected as an MP for the first time in December 2019 has not called for Mr Cummings' resignation. Instead she said: ""We must draw a line under this issue and focus our efforts on our recovery plans."" Public
Health Wales is offering parents, parents-to-be, grandparents and carer-givers
free online courses designed to help them understand the development and
emotional milestones of their children. The courses,
which cover everything from pre-birth to late teens, have been designed by NHS
and other experts to provide extra support to all. âHealthy
family relationships are important in supporting childrenâs wellbeing and
development, particularly in the earliest years of life,â said Amy McNaughton,
consultant in public health at Public Health Wales. âFamilies
in Wales are living through extraordinary times. I canât stress enough that it
is completely normal to need help and that it is okay to ask for and accept
it.â Initially
launched by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, the bilingual service has
been adopted by Public Health Wales for an initial 12-month trial. During
this time every parent in Wales can access the courses on the In Our Place
website. âWe
know that parents and care-givers are facing new challenges trying to adapt to
todayâs situation so weâre working to help them to find the positives through
these times,â said Walesâ deputy minister for health and social services Julie
Morgan. A family was rescued after being cut off on sand banks at West Shore beach in Llandudno. The town's coastguard said the incident happened at about 11:00 BST and the family was picked up by Conwy lifeboat ""seconds before the sand they were standing on disappeared beneath the sea"". Posting on social media, the coastguard said: ""The message remains the same here in Wales, stay at home but you may leave home to excercise locally."" ""We will still come to your aid, but remember, your choices might put people, including you and front-line responders, at risk."" McDonald's staff will have their temperature checked before work as branches across the UK reopen for drive-thru or delivery. All branches will be open on Tuesday to Thursday by the end of next week, following a UK pilot which sawqueues at drive-thrus following lockdown. The burger chain said it expected ""demand to be high"" in the coming weeks, but there would be restrictions in place to ensure safety. ""Over the last fortnight, our employees, franchisees and suppliers have worked tirelessly to implement new procedures to enable safe working so that we can now help all parts of the UK and Ireland to enjoy the return of the Big Mac,"" a spokesman said. The chain said it had closed drive-thru lanes where demand had led to lengthy queues impacting people living nearby, and it was working with police and local authorities. The locations of the restaurants being reopened will be released on the morning of each day next week. Safety measures include: Local lockdowns are not being considered in Wales, to maintain a ""clear message"" about coronavirus, the Welsh Government has said Finance MinisterRebecca Evans said imposing different rules could cause a ""great deal of confusion"". This is not the case in England where local lockdowns could be used to suppress ""flare-ups"" of coronavirus. ""I think the testing, and tracing work will be really important in terms of negating the need for that kind of local lockdown in future, because it will be about tracking those individuals who have had contact with somebody who has been proven to have the coronavirus,"" she said. A valleys community is staying connected in lockdown througha locally-produced newsletter. Residents of Coronation Terrace and Birchgrove Street in Porth, Rhondda Cynon Taff, receive Our Street News on a monthly basis. The pamphlet features local stories but also practical information and phone numbers to help older residents who do not have access to the internet. Editor Rachel Pedley said the newsletter was helping residents overcome loneliness and isolation. ""It was absolutely lovely to hear from a lady who has written an article, who has lived here since 1963, and she was really excited,"" she said. Boris Johnson is being questioned by senior MPs amid continued calls for his top adviser to resign. The prime ministeris being asked about Dominic Cummings' lockdown trip to County Durham at the Commons Liaison Committee- and will also be grilled about the government's handling of the pandemic. About 40 Tory MPs havecalled for Mr Cummings to resign or be firedafter his 260-mile journey came to light. A woman has raised more than Â£4,000 for the NHS after dancing for 24 hours. Carys Roberts, 59, has previously danced with chart-toppers Hot Chocolate,
Bananarama and Kool and the Gang, and on Top of the Pops. But the pilates and dance class tutor's more low-key danceathon took place in Criccieth memorial hall in aid of Betsi Cadwaladr University
Health Board charity Awyr Las. ""I
did have a dip in energy between one and three in the morning but I got a
second burst of energy then and I was still full of energy at the finish,"" she said. With school sports clubs and leisure centres out of bounds, there are fears exercise inequalities have heightened during lockdown. While 34% of Welsh adults say they have done more exercise during lockdown, 33% are doing less, according to a survey carried out by Savanta ComRes on behalf of Sport Wales. While more affluent communities are doing more exercise - 39%, those from more deprived communities are doing less exercise - 33%. The gap is ""more glaring"" for children, with 9% of adults reporting their children are doing no physical activity or exercise on a typical day. For those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, the figure is 14%. Sport Wales said the restrictions had ""intensified"" inequalities which already existed in sports participation, and hit deprived communities especially hard. Chief Executive Brian Davies said the closure of schools, clubs and sports centres had hit poorer communities hard. âAs part of the collective work that is being undertaken towards the safe re-introduction of sport at all levels in Wales, we must ensure that we reflect this insight in our efforts to make sport and physical activity as accessible as possible and target our resources to reach those communities and groups who are statistically less active,"" he said. Savanta ComRes surveyed 1,007 Welsh adults between 8 and 12 May. The data has been weighted to be demographically representative of Welsh adults aged over 16 by gender, age and the estimated households with children under 16. Swansea University has become the first institution in Wales to announce its plans for teaching from September. It says all courses will be taught in a dual way  â face to face and virtually - but has ruled out large lectures initially. International students will receive support if they need to pass through any quarantine controls in place at the time of their arrival. Accommodation will be available as normal with social distancing measures in place. Swansea Universityâs pro-vice-chancellor Prof Martin Stringer said it was ""shaping its delivery"" to ensure students would be fully part of its community. Some 8.4 million workers are now covered by the UK government's furlough scheme, up from eight million a week earlier,the Treasury has said. Claims for subsidies filed by employers rose to Â£15bn from Â£11.1bn, it added. The scheme, brought in to mitigate the effects of coronavirus, allows employees to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to Â£2,500. A similar scheme for self-employed workers saw 2.3 million claims made worth Â£6.8bn. Dyfed Powys Police have been using social media to remind people not to drive to the coast, as the sun continues to shine in Wales. They have reminded people that exercise should start and finish from home. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Asaph Cathedral has received Â£21,000 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to
support the building during the closure of all places of worship. During
lockdown, the cathedral has been unable to hold any fundraising events or
large-scale diocesan services which cover the day-to-day running costs of the
UKâs smallest ancient cathedral. In
addition, the cathedralâs tearoom has been closed since the middle of March. The
Dean of St Asaph Cathedral, the Very Reverend Nigel Williams, said: âThanks to
the National Lottery and its players we can now ensure the bills are paid over
the next four months to maintain the building ready to welcome visitors back as
soon as possible. âWeâre
grateful that the National Lottery Heritage Fund is supporting us at this
crucial time â itâs a lifeline to us and others who are passionate about
sustaining heritage for the benefit of all.â The contacts of people who receive a positive coronavirus test result in Wales will be traced from 1 June, the Welsh Government has announced. The Welsh Governmentwants to restart contact tracingas a way to help ease the country out of lockdown. Contacts of those who have tested positive will be asked to self-isolate in an effort to prevent further infections. Contact tracing pilots have been run in four health board areas since 18 May. Premier League clubs have agreed to resume contact training as plans to restart the seasonmove to the next phase. Players will be able to ""train as a group and engage in tackling while minimising unnecessary close contact"". Discussions are ongoing as work continues towards resuming the season, when conditions allow and it is safe. Players and staff will continue to be tested twice a week for coronavirus during stage two of Project Restart. Cardiff and Vale health board has said two of their members of staff died in the same week after contracting coronavirus. Nurse Dominga David and
theatre assistant Allan Macalalad died after testing positive for Covid-19. In a letter to
colleagues, chief executive Len Richards offered condolences to their families. Dominga David, 62, had
worked at University Hospital of Llandough since 2004 and Mr Richards said she âwill
be remembered as an exceptionally hard worker and a respectful, kind and
compassionate person when interacting with patients, families and colleagues
alike. âThe teams say she was
part of their family and she was well-loved by everyone. She is survived by her
son Renzie, to whom we send our deepest condolences.â Theatre assisant Allan Macalalad, 44, worked in ophthalmology theatres. He was a carpenter by
trade and settled in Cardiff with his wife, Elsie, who is a nurse with a
neighbouring health board. He is survived by Elsie and his son, Justin. âThe ophthalmology
theatres and SSSU team are a close knit team and were shocked and saddened to
hear of Allanâs passing,"" Mr Richards wrote. He described Mr Macalalad as a perfect gentleman, sociable,
hardworking, and a loyal team player. âIt is absolutely heart-breaking to have
lost two colleagues in the same week to Covid-19,"" executive nurse director Ruth Walker said. ""Both Allan and Dominga were
valued members of our team here in Cardiff and Vale UHB and we will miss them
profoundly and we send our condolences to their respective families. âOur thoughts are with Allan and Domingaâs
teams in UHB, and their loved ones both here in the UK and the Philippines.â Dominga David A Gwynedd
man has been jailed for assaulting an emergency worker, with police describing the
offence as a âdespicable actâ. Karl
Wayne Edwards, 50, from Bangor Street, Y Felinheli, was jailed for four months
yesterday. âThis
is the second example in a week of someone being jailed for spitting at custody
staff,â North Wales Police inspector Neil Jones said. âThis
is unacceptable in normal times. During Covid-19 this despicable act is a
source of unnecessary stress, and anyone who behaves this way will be robustly
dealt with. âLet
me be clear - we will not tolerate assaults upon our staff under any
circumstances, and anyone who commits these assaults can expect the prospect of
a jail term.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
UK furlough scheme now covers 8.4 million workers,"Some 8.4 million workers are now covered by the government's furlough scheme, up from eight million a week earlier, the Treasury has said. Claims for subsidies filed by employers rose to Â£15bn from Â£11.1bn, it added. The scheme, brought in to mitigate the effects of coronavirus, allows employees to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to Â£2,500. A similar scheme for self-employed workers saw 2.3 million claims made worth Â£6.8bn. The Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, as it is known, differs from the furlough scheme because it is a grant paid out in a single instalment covering three months and amounting to 80% of average profit. The furlough scheme, officially called the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, was originally intended to last until the end of July, but has now been extended until the end of October. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed that it will continue to provide the same level of earnings, but has said the government will ask companies to ""start sharing"" the cost of the scheme from August. Sources have told the BBC the Treasury still expects to be paying more than half the costs between August and October. Marketing professional Sian Melonie, from Hackney in east London, is one of the many people who, through no fault of their own, are not in a position to benefit from the government's furlough scheme or its help for self-employed workers. After 12 years in work, she decided to go self-employed last year and began working for a large cinema group. She was due to start a fixed-term contract from 30 March, but that offer was withdrawn when the pandemic hit. ""l don't qualify for any support. I can't be furloughed and I don't qualify for self-employed benefits, because I'm new to it,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm one of the people who slipped through the cracks."" But Sian says she is not angry and is using her savings to tide her over. ""However, my concern is how much longer it goes on for, because l am essentially spending what l had saved for my self-assessment tax for later this year. ""I'm hoping things get back to normal and the economy can bounce back."" Recent figures from the government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, indicate thatthe cost of the government's efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic is expected to hit Â£123.2bn. The wages for nearly 11 million jobs are currently being paid by the taxpayer amid the still ongoing pandemic shutdowns. Supporting a third of all jobs at Â£22bn bill so far is still believed to represent value for money by the Government. The 8.4 million on the furlough scheme have kept their contractual relationship with their bosses. Those jobs can be ""switched back on"" as lockdowns are lifted. Not all of them will be, but it has been an incredible logistical effort from HMRC to process this. And in the next few days the Treasury will announce that employers will enjoy more flexibility, enabling them to bring back furloughed workers part time. They will though, get a smaller rate of subsidy from August. However, the self employment scheme remains due for expiry within days. The level of unemployment - which has been kept much lower than it would have been - will inevitably go up as support is phased away. But Downing Street appears to have developed a taste for such intervention. With recovery like to take longer than originally hoped, versions of such schemes are likely to be with us for some time. The OBR expects annual borrowing to equal 15.2% of the UK economy, which would be the highest since the 22.1% seen at the end of World War Two. It said it had increased its estimate because of the rising cost of the furlough scheme. If you have been affected by the furlough scheme, email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Trump threatens to shut down social-media companies,"President Trump has taken the extraordinary step of threatening to close down social media platforms. The threat came after Twitter added fact-check links to his tweets for the first time. The battle between the president and the social-media companies has been brewing for a time. But now it feels as though an all-out war is looming between Donald Trump and Twitter ahead of the US presidential election, in November. Last night, a couple of Trump tweets raging about ""fraudulent"" postal ballots in US elections featured - for some users but not all - a strapline linking to what Twitter called ""facts about mail-in ballots."" This then led to a page debunking the president's claims but featuring articles from two organisations he regards as his sworn enemies, CNN and the Washington Post. It took him no time to fight back,tweeting,external: ""Twitter is completely stifling free speech, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen."" Then, on Wednesday morning, the president woke up and raised the temperature even furtherwith this two-part tweet,external: ""Republicans feel that social-media platforms totally silence conservatives voices. ""We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. ""We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. ""We can't let a more sophisticated version of that... happen again - just like we can't let largescale mail-in ballots take root in our country. ""It would be a free-for-all on cheating, forgery and the theft of ballots. ""Whoever cheated the most would win. ""Likewise, social media. ""Clean up your act, now."" So does he mean any of this? It is very hard to see Congress passing laws to strongly regulate or close down social-media platforms. The president refers to free speech. But as a private company, Twitter is free to police its platform as it sees fit. Nevertheless, for Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, this is undoubtedly just the start of a clash that will continue right up until the November election. In recent days, he has been under huge pressure to do something about President Trump's tweets. Now, he has acted but not in a way that might have been expected. There has been a furore over the way the president has used Twitter seemingly to endorse a baseless conspiracy theory about one of his critics, the TV presenter and former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough. Twitter chief Jack Dorsey has resisted pressure to delete some of President Trump's previous tweets President Trump has repeatedly suggested the death in an accident, in 2001, of one of the Congressman's aides, Lori Klausutis, is a ""cold case"" that deserves to be reopened by the police. And that led the widower of Ms Klausutis to write to Jack Dorsey, pleading with him to remove the president's tweets because of the pain they were causing her family. So far, Mr Dorsey has refused, apparently convinced the president's Twitter feed has protected status because it is part of the public record. Nor was there any attempt to correct the inaccuracies in the tweets. Adding a fact-check to the tweets about mail-in ballots appears to fit in witha new Twitter policy on protecting elections,external. It warns users they may not post or share content that may interfere in elections or might suppress participation. Last night, another baseless conspiracy theory - this time about a made-up crime involving Donald Trump in 2000 - was posted by an account called TheTweetofGod. It too has neither been removed nor fact-checked, perhaps because Twitter realises it would be accused of inconsistency. The president's Facebook page also features his diatribes about mail-in ballots and Joe Scarborough, with no sign of any fact-checking or limits on sharing such material. But that's not to suggest it will escape his ire. Last week, the president tweeted,external: ""The radical left is in total command and control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google."" And he intended to ""remedy this illegal situation"". There have since been reports the White House might set up a special commission to investigate the claim. Whatever the social-media companies do about their most famous and controversial user is bound to cause anger on one side or another. They can look forward to a long hot summer.

Foy and Smith to reunite in empty theatre,"Claire Foy and Matt Smith first appeared in Lungs at the Old Vic in 2019 Claire Foy and Matt Smith will reunite in a socially-distanced play to be streamed from an empty Old Vic theatre. The pair co-starred in Netflix's The Crown before appearing together in Lungs at the London venue last year. They will reprise their roles as the couple in Duncan MacMillan's play for several live performances next month. Viewers will be asked to pay between Â£10-Â£65 to watch online.The Old Vic has warned,externalit is in a ""seriously perilous"" financial position. Like all theatres, it has been shut since the lockdown began in mid-March. However, it is not eligible for Arts Council England's Â£160m emergency relief fund. The Old Vic has the words ""We'll be back"" on the front of its building ""Significant support is urgently needed if we are to emerge from this crisis still able to deliver exciting entertainment and social benefit,"" the theatre said in a statement. The revival of Lungs will launch the famous theatre's Old Vic: In Camera series, which will feature other well-known actors in rehearsed play-readings - all streamed online. ""This series is both an exciting creative experiment and also crucial in igniting the box office now all our usual channels of revenue have been entirely wiped out and we fight to preserve this beloved theatre for our audiences,"" the statement said. Prince Charles issues warning on the arts Lesley Manville: 'Most actors are not loaded' Alan Ayckbourn: Streaming 'just isn't theatre' Theatres are 'clinging on' but face precarious future Each performance of Lungs will be limited to 1,000 viewers - mimicking the venue's actual capacity. Virtual theatre-goers will select a seat and ticket price as normal, but will in reality all have the same view. Many theatre companies have released shows online in recent months - but they were either recorded before lockdown, or have been filmed in actors' homes, rather than in the empty venues themselves. Entertainment venues could potentially reopen to audiences from 4 July at the earliest, according to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's three-stage plan to reopen the country. But that date rests on a lot of things, not least whether it will be financially viable to reopen if social distancing is still in place. Sir Cameron Mackintosh recently told the BBCthat West End and Broadway theatres are unlikely to be able to stage musicals until early next year. On Wednesday, Sir Cameron and Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's planned 14-month tour of The Phantom of the Opera - which was forced to shut after its opening night in Leicester in March - was called off completely. A statement said: ""The great uncertainty around the duration of social distancing requirements and the perilous financial situation in which many regional theatres find themselves have conspired to make re-routing an entire major tour like Phantom impossible for some time as so many existing tours are needing to reschedule.""

Johnson grilled by MPs amid Cummings row,"Boris Johnson has ruled out an inquiry into the conduct of his top adviser at the height of lockdown, insisting it was time to ""move on"" from the row. Dominic Cummings is accused of breaking lockdown rules by travelling from London to County Durham. The prime minister rejected claims he had damaged his own authority and the government's coronavirus message by not sacking Mr Cummings. He said the public had had enough of the ""political ding-dong"" over it. Around 40 Tory MPs havecalled for Mr Cummings to resign or be firedafter his 260-mile journey came to light. And Cabinet Office Minister Penny Mordaunt has reportedly said there are ""inconsistencies"" in Mr Cummings' account of his actions during lockdown and there was ""no doubt"" he took risks. Latest updates as Johnson faces senior MPs Durham police lockdown travel fines revealed How Cummings' trip posed a challenge to local MPs What did Dominic Cummings do? In an email to her Portsmouth North constituents,seen by The Guardian,external, she said: ""Other families have been faced with the same situation Mr Cummings and chosen to stay put."" She did not call for Mr Cummings to be sacked - but apologised for the way the past few days have ""undermined key public health messages"". Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the prime minister had given ""no credible explanation"" why evidence had not been passed on to the cabinet secretary to investigate. The Labour MP added that the prime minister's handling of the story had ""undermined the public health message he is trying to put forward"". Sajid Javid, who resigned as chancellor in February after Mr Johnson ordered him to fire his team of aides, also called on Mr Cummings to apologise. In a letter to constituents firstreported by the Bromsgrove Standard,external, he said he did not believe the aide's trip to County Durham was ""necessary or justified"". On Tuesday,junior minister Douglas Ross resigned in protestat Mr Cummings' defence of his behaviour, saying that his interpretation of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"". This video can not be played Labour's Yvette Cooper: ""We need you to get this right"" At an appearance before theCommons Liaison Committee,external, Mr Johnson said he ""did not propose to add"" to his previous statements on Mr Cummings - or what he described as the ""autobiography"" the aide delivered on Monday. The prime minister used the phrase ""move on"" five times in 20 minutes, as he faced hostile questions from select committee chairs. Asked whether the Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK's top civil servant, should investigate Mr Cummings' actions, he said: ""Quite frankly, I am not certain that right now an inquiry into that matter is a very good use of official time. ""We are working flat out on coronavirus."" He said the public wanted the government to ""focus on them and their needs, rather than on a political ding-dong about what one adviser may or may not have done"". This video can not be played Pete Wishart: 80% of people think his chief adviser broke the rules Asked whether the government's ""moral authority"" had been undermined by Mr Cummings' actions and his own defence of them, Mr Johnson said: ""I, of course, am deeply sorry for all the hurt and pain and anxiety that people have been going through throughout this period - this country has been going through a, frankly, most difficult time. ""We are asking people to do quite exceptionally tough things, separating them from their families."" While Mr Johnson was taking part in a video conference with the panel of senior MPs, Conservative MP Giles Watlingtweeted,external: ""I've been listening to the PM in the Liaison Committee. I applaud him for sticking by his man, but I'm afraid Mr Cummings should stand down. ""His continued presence at the heart of government at this time is an unwanted distraction."" Wednesday's session was the first time the prime minister has faced questions from MPs since the allegations against Mr Cummings emerged at the end of last week. He used his appearance at the committee to announce thatNHS England's test and trace system would be up and running from Thursday. He was also quizzed about schools, care homes and the economy. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive from his London home to his parents' farm in County Durham with his wife - who had coronavirus symptoms - and his son has dominated the headlines since the story broke on Friday night. The PM's chief adviser gave a news conference on Monday, explaining that he decided to make the trip because he felt it would be better to self-isolate in a place where he had options for childcare if required. He has received the continued support of the prime minister, who said that his aide had acted legally and with integrity. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? On Wednesdays Mr Johnson would ordinarily face Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions, but MPs are currently on recess. The Liaison Committee - a panel of 37 MPs who chair various select committees - is the only Commons committee that can question the prime minister.

UK furlough scheme now covers 8.4 million workersThe scheme to pay wages of workers on leave because of coronavirus has now cost Â£15bn.,"Some 8.4 million workers are now covered by the government's furlough scheme, up from eight million a week earlier, the Treasury has said. Claims for subsidies filed by employers rose to Â£15bn from Â£11.1bn, it added. The scheme, brought in to mitigate the effects of coronavirus, allows employees to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to Â£2,500. A similar scheme for self-employed workers saw 2.3 million claims made worth Â£6.8bn. The Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, as it is known, differs from the furlough scheme because it is a grant paid out in a single instalment covering three months and amounting to 80% of average profit. The furlough scheme, officially called the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, was originally intended to last until the end of July, but has now been extended until the end of October. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed that it will continue to provide the same level of earnings, but has said the government will ask companies to ""start sharing"" the cost of the scheme from August. Sources have told the BBC the Treasury still expects to be paying more than half the costs between August and October. Marketing professional Sian Melonie, from Hackney in east London, is one of the many people who, through no fault of their own, are not in a position to benefit from the government's furlough scheme or its help for self-employed workers. After 12 years in work, she decided to go self-employed last year and began working for a large cinema group. She was due to start a fixed-term contract from 30 March, but that offer was withdrawn when the pandemic hit. ""l don't qualify for any support. I can't be furloughed and I don't qualify for self-employed benefits, because I'm new to it,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm one of the people who slipped through the cracks."" But Sian says she is not angry and is using her savings to tide her over. ""However, my concern is how much longer it goes on for, because l am essentially spending what l had saved for my self-assessment tax for later this year. ""I'm hoping things get back to normal and the economy can bounce back."" Recent figures from the government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, indicate thatthe cost of the government's efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic is expected to hit Â£123.2bn. The wages for nearly 11 million jobs are currently being paid by the taxpayer amid the still ongoing pandemic shutdowns. Supporting a third of all jobs at Â£22bn bill so far is still believed to represent value for money by the Government. The 8.4 million on the furlough scheme have kept their contractual relationship with their bosses. Those jobs can be ""switched back on"" as lockdowns are lifted. Not all of them will be, but it has been an incredible logistical effort from HMRC to process this. And in the next few days the Treasury will announce that employers will enjoy more flexibility, enabling them to bring back furloughed workers part time. They will though, get a smaller rate of subsidy from August. However, the self employment scheme remains due for expiry within days. The level of unemployment - which has been kept much lower than it would have been - will inevitably go up as support is phased away. But Downing Street appears to have developed a taste for such intervention. With recovery like to take longer than originally hoped, versions of such schemes are likely to be with us for some time. The OBR expects annual borrowing to equal 15.2% of the UK economy, which would be the highest since the 22.1% seen at the end of World War Two. It said it had increased its estimate because of the rising cost of the furlough scheme. If you have been affected by the furlough scheme, email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Johnson to be questioned by MPs amid Cummings rowThe PM will appear before the Liaison Committee as critics call for his chief adviser to resign.UK PoliticsComments,"Boris Johnson has ruled out an inquiry into the conduct of his top adviser at the height of lockdown, insisting it was time to ""move on"" from the row. Dominic Cummings is accused of breaking lockdown rules by travelling from London to County Durham. The prime minister rejected claims he had damaged his own authority and the government's coronavirus message by not sacking Mr Cummings. He said the public had had enough of the ""political ding-dong"" over it. Around 40 Tory MPs havecalled for Mr Cummings to resign or be firedafter his 260-mile journey came to light. And Cabinet Office Minister Penny Mordaunt has reportedly said there are ""inconsistencies"" in Mr Cummings' account of his actions during lockdown and there was ""no doubt"" he took risks. Latest updates as Johnson faces senior MPs Durham police lockdown travel fines revealed How Cummings' trip posed a challenge to local MPs What did Dominic Cummings do? In an email to her Portsmouth North constituents,seen by The Guardian,external, she said: ""Other families have been faced with the same situation Mr Cummings and chosen to stay put."" She did not call for Mr Cummings to be sacked - but apologised for the way the past few days have ""undermined key public health messages"". Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the prime minister had given ""no credible explanation"" why evidence had not been passed on to the cabinet secretary to investigate. The Labour MP added that the prime minister's handling of the story had ""undermined the public health message he is trying to put forward"". Sajid Javid, who resigned as chancellor in February after Mr Johnson ordered him to fire his team of aides, also called on Mr Cummings to apologise. In a letter to constituents firstreported by the Bromsgrove Standard,external, he said he did not believe the aide's trip to County Durham was ""necessary or justified"". On Tuesday,junior minister Douglas Ross resigned in protestat Mr Cummings' defence of his behaviour, saying that his interpretation of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"". This video can not be played Labour's Yvette Cooper: ""We need you to get this right"" At an appearance before theCommons Liaison Committee,external, Mr Johnson said he ""did not propose to add"" to his previous statements on Mr Cummings - or what he described as the ""autobiography"" the aide delivered on Monday. The prime minister used the phrase ""move on"" five times in 20 minutes, as he faced hostile questions from select committee chairs. Asked whether the Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK's top civil servant, should investigate Mr Cummings' actions, he said: ""Quite frankly, I am not certain that right now an inquiry into that matter is a very good use of official time. ""We are working flat out on coronavirus."" He said the public wanted the government to ""focus on them and their needs, rather than on a political ding-dong about what one adviser may or may not have done"". This video can not be played Pete Wishart: 80% of people think his chief adviser broke the rules Asked whether the government's ""moral authority"" had been undermined by Mr Cummings' actions and his own defence of them, Mr Johnson said: ""I, of course, am deeply sorry for all the hurt and pain and anxiety that people have been going through throughout this period - this country has been going through a, frankly, most difficult time. ""We are asking people to do quite exceptionally tough things, separating them from their families."" While Mr Johnson was taking part in a video conference with the panel of senior MPs, Conservative MP Giles Watlingtweeted,external: ""I've been listening to the PM in the Liaison Committee. I applaud him for sticking by his man, but I'm afraid Mr Cummings should stand down. ""His continued presence at the heart of government at this time is an unwanted distraction."" Wednesday's session was the first time the prime minister has faced questions from MPs since the allegations against Mr Cummings emerged at the end of last week. He used his appearance at the committee to announce thatNHS England's test and trace system would be up and running from Thursday. He was also quizzed about schools, care homes and the economy. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive from his London home to his parents' farm in County Durham with his wife - who had coronavirus symptoms - and his son has dominated the headlines since the story broke on Friday night. The PM's chief adviser gave a news conference on Monday, explaining that he decided to make the trip because he felt it would be better to self-isolate in a place where he had options for childcare if required. He has received the continued support of the prime minister, who said that his aide had acted legally and with integrity. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? On Wednesdays Mr Johnson would ordinarily face Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions, but MPs are currently on recess. The Liaison Committee - a panel of 37 MPs who chair various select committees - is the only Commons committee that can question the prime minister. This was Mr Johnson's first appearance before the committee since he became PM last July. DAVID ATTENBOROUGH'S MINDFUL MIX:Soothing sounds to escape to CORONAVIRUS NEWSCAST:Cummings up roses?

"Foy and Smith to reunite in empty theatreThe socially-distanced play, featuring The Crown actors, will be streamed live from the Old Vic.Entertainment & Arts","Claire Foy and Matt Smith first appeared in Lungs at the Old Vic in 2019 Claire Foy and Matt Smith will reunite in a socially-distanced play to be streamed from an empty Old Vic theatre. The pair co-starred in Netflix's The Crown before appearing together in Lungs at the London venue last year. They will reprise their roles as the couple in Duncan MacMillan's play for several live performances next month. Viewers will be asked to pay between Â£10-Â£65 to watch online.The Old Vic has warned,externalit is in a ""seriously perilous"" financial position. Like all theatres, it has been shut since the lockdown began in mid-March. However, it is not eligible for Arts Council England's Â£160m emergency relief fund. The Old Vic has the words ""We'll be back"" on the front of its building ""Significant support is urgently needed if we are to emerge from this crisis still able to deliver exciting entertainment and social benefit,"" the theatre said in a statement. The revival of Lungs will launch the famous theatre's Old Vic: In Camera series, which will feature other well-known actors in rehearsed play-readings - all streamed online. ""This series is both an exciting creative experiment and also crucial in igniting the box office now all our usual channels of revenue have been entirely wiped out and we fight to preserve this beloved theatre for our audiences,"" the statement said. Prince Charles issues warning on the arts Lesley Manville: 'Most actors are not loaded' Alan Ayckbourn: Streaming 'just isn't theatre' Theatres are 'clinging on' but face precarious future Each performance of Lungs will be limited to 1,000 viewers - mimicking the venue's actual capacity. Virtual theatre-goers will select a seat and ticket price as normal, but will in reality all have the same view. Many theatre companies have released shows online in recent months - but they were either recorded before lockdown, or have been filmed in actors' homes, rather than in the empty venues themselves. Entertainment venues could potentially reopen to audiences from 4 July at the earliest, according to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's three-stage plan to reopen the country. But that date rests on a lot of things, not least whether it will be financially viable to reopen if social distancing is still in place. Sir Cameron Mackintosh recently told the BBCthat West End and Broadway theatres are unlikely to be able to stage musicals until early next year. On Wednesday, Sir Cameron and Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's planned 14-month tour of The Phantom of the Opera - which was forced to shut after its opening night in Leicester in March - was called off completely. A statement said: ""The great uncertainty around the duration of social distancing requirements and the perilous financial situation in which many regional theatres find themselves have conspired to make re-routing an entire major tour like Phantom impossible for some time as so many existing tours are needing to reschedule.""

'Short-lived' rebound in house hunter demand,"Demand from property hunters rebounded as curbs on the sector were lifted in England - but the trend may be short-lived, analysis suggests. Buyer demand rose by 88% in the week estate agents were told they could resume viewings and people could move again, property portal Zoopla said. However, actual sales remained sluggish, and the analysis suggests demand could fall again. A tough outlook for jobs could affect people's ability to move home. For those who do still have the money to move, Zoopla echoed others in suggesting residents may have spent lockdown rethinking what they want from their home. Where can I afford to rent or buy? Mortgage payment holiday extended for further three months Another property portal, Rightmove, reported a return to pre-crisis levels of browsing and enquiries from people looking to buy a home at the point restrictions were lifted in England on 13 May. Now, Zoopla's UK Cities House Price Index has said that the rebound in demand went beyond the level seen at the start of March. Portsmouth, Southampton, Oxford, Liverpool and Manchester all saw demand rise. This trend was far more muted where the restrictions remained - in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland - and also in London, where the market had already been relatively slow. The analysis found the rebound would be temporary, after people who had been stuck at home and thinking of moving met with the realities of less settled job prospects. ""Many households are likely to have re-evaluated what they want from their home. This could well explain the scale of the demand returning to the market,"" said Richard Donnell, director of research at Zoopla. He said economic uncertainty was building and that would eventually lead to greater caution among buyers and sellers. A small survey, as part of the research, found that 41% of those asked had put moving plans on hold owing to the uncertainty, loss of income, or future prospects for their finances. Lockdown had meant thousands of people put house sales on hold. Residential property sales in the UK in April hit theirlowest monthly level since comparable records beganin 2005, with 38,060 transactions during the month, according to provisional numbers from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). This was less than half the level seen in the same month the previous year. Great uncertainty remains over the level of recovery in sales, as well as prices. Meanwhile, Rightmove said that, in the week after restrictions in England were lifted, interest from those looking to move in the private rental sector had increased ahead of the level seen at the same time last year. Monday 18 May saw its highest level of rental demand in a single day. The biggest increases in rental searches compared with a year ago were in Rotherham, Cambridge and St Helens, it said. ""A week's worth of data should only be taken as an early indication of activity, but it's certainly encouraging,"" said Miles Shipside, from Rightmove.

"Woman, 99, standing up 100 times for son's hospice","Joyce Richardson said she was ""standing up"" for Herriot Hospice Homecare because she wanted to help other people on her birthday A woman who struggles to stand up will aim to do it 100 times before her 100th birthday in June to raise money for the hospice which cared for her dying son. Joyce Richardson, who served in the Women's Land Army during World War Two, nearly lost the use of her legs after developing sepsis last year. She set herself the challenge to raise money for Herriot Hospice Homecare. The great-great grandmother said she wanted to thank the charity for ""the wonderful support"" her family received. Mrs Richardson, from Thirsk, North Yorkshire, said: ""It may not seem much to most people but, believe you me, hauling myself up out of the chair is a huge struggle every time.""

Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit The latest data shows more than 267,000 cases of confirmed coronavirus around the UK, including 2,013 additional cases confirmed by laboratories today. Yet despite the increase in the number of tests being carried out, the number of new infections is falling. This is how it looks around the different regions of England.  Prime minister Boris Johnson has ruled out an inquiry into the conduct of his top adviser Dominic Cummings during lockdown, insistingit is time for the country to ""move on"" from the row. Mr Cummings is accused of breaking lockdown rules by travelling from London to County Durham. The prime minister rejected claims that his actions had undermined the government's coronavirus message. Mr Johnson faced calls from senior MPs for an inquiry into Mr Cummings' conduct by the UK's top civil servant. But he told them: ""Quite frankly, I am not certain that right now an inquiry into that matter is a very good use of official time. We are working flat out on coronavirus.""

Transport for London (TfL) has been branded ""institutionally unsafe"" by a former board member. Michael Liebreich claims the body's structure ""places safety a distant second priority"" and says bus drivers in the capital havebeen working in ""manifestly unsafe conditions""since the coronavirus lockdown began. Mr Liebreich, who served on the TfL board between 2012 and 2018 and has campaigned for the Conservative party, made the claims to the head of the review into coronavirus deaths among bus workers. A spokesperson for the mayor of London called the claims ""entirely untrue"". ""The safety of passengers and our heroic transport staff is TfL's absolute priority,"" they said ""This has been demonstrated throughout its response to the coronavirus pandemic."" BBC Radio Devon Councils are applying for funds from thegovernment's job retention scheme,externalto cover the cost of hundreds of workers who have been put on paid leave during the pandemic. Teignbridge Council has furloughed about 200 workers, while councils in Torridge and North Devon have furloughed up to fifty workers between them. The government said it did not expect public sector employers to use the scheme but exceptions could be made, for example when councils had to close venues such as leisure centres. Richard MossPolitical editor, North East & Cumbria It is a safe bet that County Durham's three Conservative MPs did not anticipate their biggest challenge to date would be posed by a visit from Dominic Cummings. But that is exactly what Dehenna Davison, Richard Holden and Paul Howell have had to deal with over the last few days. After refusing repeated interview requests, the MPs for Bishop Auckland, North West Durham and Sedgefield gave their verdict in a joint statement on social media last night - more than 24 hours after the Prime Minister's special adviser's press conference. They said they understood his motivations were ""to protect his family"", but then added that none of them would have made the same decisions.

Artist Paul Insect has donated five rainbow benches to London to pay tribute to healthcare workers, hospital staff and everyday workers. The benches, which have been produced in collaboration with furniture designers Block London, have been installed in spots in central London. It is hoped the benches will become a place for people to ""pause and reflect on the past couple of months"" as the capital begins to open up again. ""London has never looked so good as it does now,"" Mr Insect said. ""The streets are clean and the views are unbroken by people - a perfect time to be exploring, of course with the correct social distancing."" Residents of a care home can now see their loved ones face-to-face for the first time since lockdown. Eothen Home in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, has been carrying out routine testing of its staff and people living there, and no-one has suffered coronavirus symptoms. It is nowallowing relatives to visit, subject to a number of strict rules. Manager Dawn Esslemont said although social distance was maintained with no hugs or kisses allowed, it was ""lovely to see the emotion"" of reunions. A shop owner who has been self-isolating from his family since the coronavirus lockdown to run his store has been thanked by his customers. Pritpal Dale, who runs a convenience store in Loughborough, was given a book ""full of thank you messages"" during the clap for key workers on Thursday. The 43-year-oldsaid he was ""choked up"" by the gesturebut insisted he was just doing his job. He said he was temporarily living apart from his family to avoid potentially spreading the virus to them. Â© 2025 BBC.

Â£2.4bn coronavirus spending details to be revealed,"The Dragon's Heart Hospital, at the Principality Stadium, one of the UK's biggest field hospitals The billions of public cash being spent by the Welsh Government on tackling the coronavirus pandemic have been revealed. A total of Â£2.4bn is going on healthcare, businesses, councils, transport and other services. Most - Â£1.6bn - is being used to support the economy. Welsh Government Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said ministers should be able to be allowed to raise more cash through borrowing. Most of the cash has come from Â£1.8bn in extra funding from the UK Treasury. The additional funds mean the Welsh budget for 2020-21 is now 10% larger than it was in March. City and town centres have largely closed as a result of the coronavirus lockdown measures The Welsh Government said it is spending Â£1.7bn, including Â£100m on infrastructure, on measures to support the economy and protect jobs. That includes Â£500m on an economic resilience fund - providing financial support to companies. But the bulk is being spent on business rate relief - a tax paid by firms for the premises they use. More than Â£1bn is being distributed by councils through the tax cuts, and associated grants. To date councils have issued Â£625m in 50,700 business rates grants. The Welsh Government is spending Â£100m on PPE Meanwhile Â£763m is being spent on health and public services, including Â£166m for emergency field hospitals Â£100m for personal protective equipment (PPE) Â£91m on additional NHS staffing Â£40m to pay every care worker a one-off Â£500 bonus. The Welsh Government's contact tracing programme - designed to help ease Wales out of lockdown - has been allocated Â£57m. A total of Â£40m is being spent keeping trains running Meanwhile councils are being given Â£188m through a local authority hardship fund. That includes Â£40m to support extra costs from adult social care Â£40m for free school meals Â£78m to help councils with lost income Â£7m for temporary morgues Councils have claimed they face a deficit of Â£173m through a loss of income and increased costs. Welsh Local Government Association finance spokesperson Antony Hunt warned there was a ""risk that the disease will cast its long shadow over essential local services for years to come"". ""This budget is a good start, and that partnership approach will need to continue to address the financial impacts of this pandemic,"" he added. Lockdown has been in place in Wales since March Some Â£40m is being allocated to ensure the continued operation and maintenance of train services. A total of Â£24m is going to help the Welsh voluntary sector, while Â£15m is being spent on a direct food delivery scheme for people shielding. The extra UK treasury cash comes as a result of new spending on public services in England due to coronavirus. An additional Â£256m has been found from Welsh reserves, and Â£245m from repurposed European funding, according to the Welsh Government's supplementary budget. Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's finance spokesman said ministers needed to find a ""new way of doing things"" as ""new priorities are emerging"", ""We should have had a taste of that willingness to innovate. It's not there."" Rebecca Evans said she and her colleagues should be able to borrow more cash Earlier, Wales' Finance Minister Rebecca Evans urged UK ministers to allow the Welsh Government to borrow more money to help deal with pandemic. Under current rules the Welsh Government is able to borrow Â£150m a year for infrastructure, up to a limit of Â£1bn, and Â£200m a year for day-to-day spending. Speaking at the daily Welsh Government press briefing, Ms Evans said: ""Our capacity and our ability to get money to the frontline has been constrained by the rigid financial rules imposed by the UK Government"". The minister said the Welsh Government wanted ""more flexibility to help us respond to the crisis"". She said the UK Treasury should end ""the arbitrary limits on our borrowing"" and also remove ""the limits on the amount we can draw down from our own reserves"". Responding to the minister, a UK Government spokesperson said: ""An unprecedented level of financial support for Wales - more than Â£2.2 billion extra - has been provided by the UK Government during the coronavirus pandemic and we continue to work more closely than ever with the Welsh Government."" Ms Evans call for more borrowing was described as dangerous by Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Nick Ramsay. He said a ""bold and innovative"" budget was required but what had been presented ""lacked those qualities"". ""Yes, these are unprecedented times but the call for caps on borrowing to be removed could trap Wales and its people into decades of debt,"" he said. Brexit Party Senedd leader Mark Reckless said the supplementary budget ""accentuates our concern that the continuing lockdown of Wales, as England reopens, will mean income tax will rise in Wales next year thanks to devolution"". The additional spending outlined in today's plans is eye-watering in its scale. The Welsh Government will spend an additional Â£2.46bn this year, 10% more than was planned just a few short months ago. The bulk of the money, Â£1.6bn, is going on a massive package of loans and business rate relief in an attempt to ensure that businesses and jobs survive the pandemic. The health service too receives a huge spending boost of Â£763m with Â£100m being spent on PPE equipment alone and Â£166m on emergency field hospitals such as Llandudno's Ysbyty Enfys and Cardiff's Ysbyty Calon y Ddraig. Such is the size of the crisis though that there are fears that the additional spending still isn't enough and that even more money will have to be found to see Wales through.

Mackenzie beach in the coastal city of Larnaca, Cyprus Cyprus says it will cover all costs - including medication, accommodation, food and drink - for anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 while on holiday on the Mediterranean island. Patients and their families on vacation there will only have to pay to be transported back to the airport and for their flights home. An exclusive 100-bed hospital, equipped with intensive care units and respirators, will provide care for anyone who becomes seriously ill with the virus, the government says. A 500-bed ""quarantine hotel"" will also be provided. The Cypriot government says that its tourist season will open on 9 June to travellers from Germany, Greece and Israel. ""For our important markets like the UK, Russia and Sweden, I expect early July,"" deputy tourism minister Savvas Perdios said. Last year's 4 July celebration in DC US President Donald Trump is pushing ahead with his plans for a 4 July parade in Washington, DC, in the face of protests from local lawmakers and virus concerns. A group of Democratic lawmakers penned a letter to the Trump administration saying that Trump's proposed parade would ""needlessly risk the health and safety of thousands of Americans"". DC will begin its phased reopening later this week, though gatherings of 10 or more people are still banned. Gatherings of more than 250 people - like the crowds that assembled for last year's celebration - will not be allowed until a virus vaccine is found, or the public health risk is drastically reduced. Trump's Salute to America - last year's 4 July celebration in DC - featured military flyovers and fireworks, drew tens of thousands of people to downtown DC, and cost $5.4m (Â£4.4m). A scientist works on a possible Covid-19 vaccine at a lab in Maryland Fewer than half of Americans say they would get a vaccine for the coronavirus if one became available, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. While just 49% of Americans would opt in, the majority - 61% - say they expect a vaccine will be publicly available by 2021, with only 17% saying it will take longer. About 1 in 5 Americans say they do not plan to get vaccinated, while 31% remain unsure. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump unveiled Operation Warp Speed, a mission to expedite vaccine development. He has promised to deliver a jab by year-end, a timeline widely disputed by scientists.  The only two hospitals in Southern California's rural Imperial County were forced to close their doors to new Covid patients this week, after admitting a flood of patients from Mexico. Roughly half of the coronavirus patients in several of the California hospitals dotting the US southern border are recent arrivals from Mexico, reports the Washington Post newspaper. The patients traveling from Mexico to the US include some of the 1.5 million Americans who live there. As a result, Imperial County - which sits directly on the border - has a markedly higher rate of infection than any other county in California: 760 per 100,000 residents, the Post reports.  Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The Prime Minister's adviser Dominic Cummings says he drove 30 minutes from Durham to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight before driving back to London after recovering from coronavirus symptoms. Eye symptoms with coronavirus have been reported, say the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the College of Optometrists. Like any upper respiratory tract infection, including colds and flu, it can cause irritation of the membrane covering the eye - a condition called conjunctivitis or sometimes pink or red eye (because the whites of the eyes become bloodshot). The World Health Organization now includes this alongside other more common symptoms of the virus - but UK guidelines do not. Viral conjunctivitis can make the eyes water and feel gritty and uncomfortable, rather than painful. It does not usually interfere greatly with eyesight. Read more here. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, authorities in New York City and Los Angeles say that hate incidents against people of Asian descent have increased considerably. A reporting centre says it has receivedover 1,700 reports of coronavirus-related discrimination,externalfrom at least 45 US states since it launched in March. In states including New York, California, and Texas, East Asians have been spat on, punched or kicked - and in one case even stabbed. The spike in anti-Asian prejudice has left many Asian Americans wondering where they fit in US society. ""Then the pandemic made me realise that because I am Asian, and because of how I look like or where I was born, I could never become one of them,"" one woman tells the BBC. Read more about the rise in abuse of Asian Americans and what it reveals about US identity. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News More than 150 different drugs are being researched around the world. Most are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus. Antiviral treatments are being tested to see if they directly affect the coronavirus's ability to thrive inside the body, and drugs that can calm the immune system are also of interest. The latest clinical trials of an antiviral drug originally developed to treat Ebola, for example,have been encouraging. Research centres around the world are alsoattempting to use survivors' bloodas a treatment, in the hope that the antibodies they have built up will help to clear the virus in others.

Police in Ecuador have raided the offices of the health ministry and the home of the health minister over alleged overpricing of coronavirus testing kits. Jorge Yunda, the mayor of Ecuador's capital, Quito, has called for the temporary resignation of Health Minister Lenin Mantilla so that an independent inquiry can take place. Two-hundred thousand kits were imported from South Korea to be used in Ecuador, one of the worst-affected countries in South America, with nearly 40,000 people infected and more than 3,200 deaths. US President Donald Trump has tweeted that the country has tested 15.5 million people for Covid-19, and that the figure is ""by far the most in the world"". But does this claim stand
up to scrutiny? In fact, the BBC Reality Check
team hasfact-checked the president's claims on testingbefore, and found them
wanting. It is difficult to find truly
accurate numbers for global testing because different countries have different
ways of conducting and counting tests. This means that in order to compare
numbers, we have to decide whether figures from around the world are
comparable, or even trustworthy. According to figures from China's state news agency Xinhua, the combined number of people tested in just two areas totals around 17 million â that's10.41 million in the province of Guangdong,externaland6.5 million in Wuhan,external, where the city authorities say theyplan to test the entire populationof around 11 million. To attain these figures, the Chinese authorities have been ""batch testing"" - testing multiple samples in groups. They expect the vast majority of Covid-19 tests to be negative, which makes sense statistically, but if samples within a certain batch test positive, the samples are then tested individually. So, the total for the whole of China's estimated 1.4 billion population is likely to be much higher than Mr Trump's 15.5 million. But according to BBC China analyst Kerry Allen, there's no way to independently check how many individual tests have been carried out. US President Donald Trump met New York Governor Andrew Cuomo today, and the political rivals discussed major infrastructure projects which Cuomo hopes will help jump-start his state's beleaguered economy. Noting the ""political differences"" between himself and the Republican president, the Democrat said the two had had a good discussion. New York reported 74 deaths in the past 24 hours, continuing the state's downward trend in Covid-19 infections, hospitalisations and fatalities.

Gavin LeeBBC Europe reporter Today was all about the pitch by Ursula von der Leyen -a recovery fund worth â¬750bn(Â£670bn; $825bn) - and it's just the start. It will take a Herculean
effort by the European Commission to get all member states on-side, especially as it wants this agreed by leaders at the next EU summit in three weeks' time. After a round-robin of calls to European diplomats this afternoon,
 I got a clear sense that thereâs not yet an overall majority in favour.
Southern Mediterranean countries such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy have
all indicated initial support. There are many countries, including Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and
Lithuania, that wonât commit either way until theyâve read the small print of
the plans. And there is well-publicised opposition from the self-proclaimed
""frugal four"" consisting of Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. The feeling here in Brussels is that it will need to be a face-to-face meeting between leaders to forge a compromise, because videoconferencing
is a poor substitute for fiscal diplomacy. And thatâs not likely to happen
until internal borders are reopened, some time over the summer.

The firm said it would inform workers of 6,670 cuts this week and has also approved 5,520 voluntary redundancies. The planned reductions are not a surprise after Boeing revealed plans last month to slash its global workforce by 10% - or roughly 16,000 jobs. ""I wish there were some other way,"" chief executive Dave Calhoun said. The company was already in crisis after two fatal crashes of its 737 Max led to the global grounding of the plane last year - and now a drop in demand for air travel has left it reeling.

The president retweeted a disparaging post from a Fox News personality, apparently insulting Biden's masked appearance. He later denied that he was making fun of his Democratic rival. Trump has mostly refused to wear masks in public, deepening a partisan divide over the practice. A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation this month found that 89% of Democrats and 72% of independents report wearing a mask every time or most of the time when they leave home, compared to 58% of Republicans.

Johnson to face senior MPs amid Cummings rowThe PM will be questioned by the Liaison Committee as critics call for his chief adviser to resign.,"Boris Johnson has ruled out an inquiry into the conduct of his top adviser at the height of lockdown, insisting it was time to ""move on"" from the row. Dominic Cummings is accused of breaking lockdown rules by travelling from London to County Durham. The prime minister rejected claims he had damaged his own authority and the government's coronavirus message by not sacking Mr Cummings. He said the public had had enough of the ""political ding-dong"" over it. Around 40 Tory MPs havecalled for Mr Cummings to resign or be firedafter his 260-mile journey came to light. And Cabinet Office Minister Penny Mordaunt has reportedly said there are ""inconsistencies"" in Mr Cummings' account of his actions during lockdown and there was ""no doubt"" he took risks. Latest updates as Johnson faces senior MPs Durham police lockdown travel fines revealed How Cummings' trip posed a challenge to local MPs What did Dominic Cummings do? In an email to her Portsmouth North constituents,seen by The Guardian,external, she said: ""Other families have been faced with the same situation Mr Cummings and chosen to stay put."" She did not call for Mr Cummings to be sacked - but apologised for the way the past few days have ""undermined key public health messages"". Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the prime minister had given ""no credible explanation"" why evidence had not been passed on to the cabinet secretary to investigate. The Labour MP added that the prime minister's handling of the story had ""undermined the public health message he is trying to put forward"". Sajid Javid, who resigned as chancellor in February after Mr Johnson ordered him to fire his team of aides, also called on Mr Cummings to apologise. In a letter to constituents firstreported by the Bromsgrove Standard,external, he said he did not believe the aide's trip to County Durham was ""necessary or justified"". On Tuesday,junior minister Douglas Ross resigned in protestat Mr Cummings' defence of his behaviour, saying that his interpretation of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"". This video can not be played Labour's Yvette Cooper: ""We need you to get this right"" At an appearance before theCommons Liaison Committee,external, Mr Johnson said he ""did not propose to add"" to his previous statements on Mr Cummings - or what he described as the ""autobiography"" the aide delivered on Monday. The prime minister used the phrase ""move on"" five times in 20 minutes, as he faced hostile questions from select committee chairs. Asked whether the Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK's top civil servant, should investigate Mr Cummings' actions, he said: ""Quite frankly, I am not certain that right now an inquiry into that matter is a very good use of official time. ""We are working flat out on coronavirus."" He said the public wanted the government to ""focus on them and their needs, rather than on a political ding-dong about what one adviser may or may not have done"". This video can not be played Pete Wishart: 80% of people think his chief adviser broke the rules Asked whether the government's ""moral authority"" had been undermined by Mr Cummings' actions and his own defence of them, Mr Johnson said: ""I, of course, am deeply sorry for all the hurt and pain and anxiety that people have been going through throughout this period - this country has been going through a, frankly, most difficult time. ""We are asking people to do quite exceptionally tough things, separating them from their families."" While Mr Johnson was taking part in a video conference with the panel of senior MPs, Conservative MP Giles Watlingtweeted,external: ""I've been listening to the PM in the Liaison Committee. I applaud him for sticking by his man, but I'm afraid Mr Cummings should stand down. ""His continued presence at the heart of government at this time is an unwanted distraction."" Wednesday's session was the first time the prime minister has faced questions from MPs since the allegations against Mr Cummings emerged at the end of last week. He used his appearance at the committee to announce thatNHS England's test and trace system would be up and running from Thursday. He was also quizzed about schools, care homes and the economy. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive from his London home to his parents' farm in County Durham with his wife - who had coronavirus symptoms - and his son has dominated the headlines since the story broke on Friday night. The PM's chief adviser gave a news conference on Monday, explaining that he decided to make the trip because he felt it would be better to self-isolate in a place where he had options for childcare if required. He has received the continued support of the prime minister, who said that his aide had acted legally and with integrity. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? On Wednesdays Mr Johnson would ordinarily face Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions, but MPs are currently on recess. The Liaison Committee - a panel of 37 MPs who chair various select committees - is the only Commons committee that can question the prime minister.

"Scotland's largest prison 'not fit for purpose'Inspectors say urgent improvements must be made to Glasgow's Barlinnie jail, which is not due to be replaced until 2025Scotland","Planning permission has been granted for a replacement for Barlinnie Prison, which should open in 2025 Scotland's largest jail is no longer fit for purpose, according to the prisons watchdog. An inspection of Barlinnie prison in Glasgow before the coronavirus pandemic found overcrowding could be in breach of UN human rights agreements. The inspectorate said interim solutions must be sought before a replacement prison is opened in 2025. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said the population had now reduced by 29%, as a result of  the lockdown. The inspection was carried out in September last year, six months before the coronavirus lockdown. Reception cells in Barlinnie were first criticised by HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIPS) in 1995 andsuccessive reports have continued to highlight problems there,external. International inspection organisations have also condemned some of the facilities in the jail. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) have both severely criticised the holding cells as breaching the human rights of prisoners. HMIPS said it was deeply concerning the holding cells, which were first condemned 25 years ago, remained in use. The chief inspector of prisons, Wendy Sinclair-Gieben said: ""The SPS is at risk of ignoring repeated advice to improve Reception. ""Both the 2003 and 2006 Inspectorate reports gave guidance in the strongest possible terms, including reference to a report in 2004 by The Committee for the Prevention of Torture. At the time of the inspection Barlinnie was 40% over capacity, with prisoners doubling up in cells designed for one man ""My report recommends that a new Reception facility should be created as I do not feel that improvement or refurbishment is either realistic or desirable."" She added: ""The reality is that the ageing and fragile physical infrastructure means that the prison is no longer fit for purpose."" Report finds overcrowding in Barlinnie is 'unsafe' Barlinnie more than 40% over capacity Site purchased to replace Victorian prison She highlighted overcrowding at Barlinnie which held 1,489 prisoners at the time of her inspection - more than 40% over its design capacity. This meant significant numbers of prisoners were forced to share cells designed for single occupancy. But she said the inspectorate was impressed with the positive and compassionate attitudes of the staff and the dynamic leadership of the management teams. The SPS said since the beginning of the pandemic numbers had come down dramatically. On May 25, there were 1 ,059 men in Barlinnie - a 29% reduction since the inspection took place. A spokesman said the early release of short-term prisoners and smaller numbers being sent from the courts which are not functioning normally because of the lockdown had contributed to this. He said 79% of the cells had now returned to single occupancy.

Scotland's largest prison 'not fit for purpose',"Planning permission has been granted for a replacement for Barlinnie Prison, which should open in 2025 Scotland's largest jail is no longer fit for purpose, according to the prisons watchdog. An inspection of Barlinnie prison in Glasgow before the coronavirus pandemic found overcrowding could be in breach of UN human rights agreements. The inspectorate said interim solutions must be sought before a replacement prison is opened in 2025. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said the population had now reduced by 29%, as a result of  the lockdown. The inspection was carried out in September last year, six months before the coronavirus lockdown. Reception cells in Barlinnie were first criticised by HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIPS) in 1995 andsuccessive reports have continued to highlight problems there,external. International inspection organisations have also condemned some of the facilities in the jail. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) have both severely criticised the holding cells as breaching the human rights of prisoners. HMIPS said it was deeply concerning the holding cells, which were first condemned 25 years ago, remained in use. The chief inspector of prisons, Wendy Sinclair-Gieben said: ""The SPS is at risk of ignoring repeated advice to improve Reception. ""Both the 2003 and 2006 Inspectorate reports gave guidance in the strongest possible terms, including reference to a report in 2004 by The Committee for the Prevention of Torture. At the time of the inspection Barlinnie was 40% over capacity, with prisoners doubling up in cells designed for one man ""My report recommends that a new Reception facility should be created as I do not feel that improvement or refurbishment is either realistic or desirable."" She added: ""The reality is that the ageing and fragile physical infrastructure means that the prison is no longer fit for purpose."" Report finds overcrowding in Barlinnie is 'unsafe' Barlinnie more than 40% over capacity Site purchased to replace Victorian prison She highlighted overcrowding at Barlinnie which held 1,489 prisoners at the time of her inspection - more than 40% over its design capacity. This meant significant numbers of prisoners were forced to share cells designed for single occupancy. But she said the inspectorate was impressed with the positive and compassionate attitudes of the staff and the dynamic leadership of the management teams. The SPS said since the beginning of the pandemic numbers had come down dramatically. On May 25, there were 1 ,059 men in Barlinnie - a 29% reduction since the inspection took place. A spokesman said the early release of short-term prisoners and smaller numbers being sent from the courts which are not functioning normally because of the lockdown had contributed to this. He said 79% of the cells had now returned to single occupancy.

Johnson to face senior MPs amid Cummings row,"Boris Johnson has ruled out an inquiry into the conduct of his top adviser at the height of lockdown, insisting it was time to ""move on"" from the row. Dominic Cummings is accused of breaking lockdown rules by travelling from London to County Durham. The prime minister rejected claims he had damaged his own authority and the government's coronavirus message by not sacking Mr Cummings. He said the public had had enough of the ""political ding-dong"" over it. Around 40 Tory MPs havecalled for Mr Cummings to resign or be firedafter his 260-mile journey came to light. And Cabinet Office Minister Penny Mordaunt has reportedly said there are ""inconsistencies"" in Mr Cummings' account of his actions during lockdown and there was ""no doubt"" he took risks. Latest updates as Johnson faces senior MPs Durham police lockdown travel fines revealed How Cummings' trip posed a challenge to local MPs What did Dominic Cummings do? In an email to her Portsmouth North constituents,seen by The Guardian,external, she said: ""Other families have been faced with the same situation Mr Cummings and chosen to stay put."" She did not call for Mr Cummings to be sacked - but apologised for the way the past few days have ""undermined key public health messages"". Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the prime minister had given ""no credible explanation"" why evidence had not been passed on to the cabinet secretary to investigate. The Labour MP added that the prime minister's handling of the story had ""undermined the public health message he is trying to put forward"". Sajid Javid, who resigned as chancellor in February after Mr Johnson ordered him to fire his team of aides, also called on Mr Cummings to apologise. In a letter to constituents firstreported by the Bromsgrove Standard,external, he said he did not believe the aide's trip to County Durham was ""necessary or justified"". On Tuesday,junior minister Douglas Ross resigned in protestat Mr Cummings' defence of his behaviour, saying that his interpretation of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"". This video can not be played Labour's Yvette Cooper: ""We need you to get this right"" At an appearance before theCommons Liaison Committee,external, Mr Johnson said he ""did not propose to add"" to his previous statements on Mr Cummings - or what he described as the ""autobiography"" the aide delivered on Monday. The prime minister used the phrase ""move on"" five times in 20 minutes, as he faced hostile questions from select committee chairs. Asked whether the Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK's top civil servant, should investigate Mr Cummings' actions, he said: ""Quite frankly, I am not certain that right now an inquiry into that matter is a very good use of official time. ""We are working flat out on coronavirus."" He said the public wanted the government to ""focus on them and their needs, rather than on a political ding-dong about what one adviser may or may not have done"". This video can not be played Pete Wishart: 80% of people think his chief adviser broke the rules Asked whether the government's ""moral authority"" had been undermined by Mr Cummings' actions and his own defence of them, Mr Johnson said: ""I, of course, am deeply sorry for all the hurt and pain and anxiety that people have been going through throughout this period - this country has been going through a, frankly, most difficult time. ""We are asking people to do quite exceptionally tough things, separating them from their families."" While Mr Johnson was taking part in a video conference with the panel of senior MPs, Conservative MP Giles Watlingtweeted,external: ""I've been listening to the PM in the Liaison Committee. I applaud him for sticking by his man, but I'm afraid Mr Cummings should stand down. ""His continued presence at the heart of government at this time is an unwanted distraction."" Wednesday's session was the first time the prime minister has faced questions from MPs since the allegations against Mr Cummings emerged at the end of last week. He used his appearance at the committee to announce thatNHS England's test and trace system would be up and running from Thursday. He was also quizzed about schools, care homes and the economy. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive from his London home to his parents' farm in County Durham with his wife - who had coronavirus symptoms - and his son has dominated the headlines since the story broke on Friday night. The PM's chief adviser gave a news conference on Monday, explaining that he decided to make the trip because he felt it would be better to self-isolate in a place where he had options for childcare if required. He has received the continued support of the prime minister, who said that his aide had acted legally and with integrity. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?
