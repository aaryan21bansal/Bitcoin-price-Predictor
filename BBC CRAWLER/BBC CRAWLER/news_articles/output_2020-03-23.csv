Parents heed calls not to send children to school,"For most children the school day is now at home and online Parents have heeded warnings not to send children into school unless it was a last resort, say head teachers. Schools in the UK have closed to reduce the spread of coronavirus - and are only open to look after the children of ""key workers"" and vulnerable children. Early snapshot surveys suggested schools had between 1% and 20% of pupils attending. The Department for Education welcomed that numbers in school were ""low"" and that parents had kept children at home. There had been fears too many pupils would turn up and that schools with depleted numbers of teachers would struggle to cope. But Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the numbers at school appeared to be ""manageable"". He said parents appeared to have ""heeded calls to use the emergency provision in schools only in the event that they are key workers who have no option available to keep their children at home"". Parents in Wales urged to keep children out of school School only a 'last resort' parents told in Northern Ireland Latest as nations struggle to halt the spread of coronavirus This was supported by a snapshot survey from the National Association of Head Teachers, with members in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, showing that: in 94% of schools no more than 20% of pupils had attended. A separate survey from the ASCL union, also of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, showed even lower numbers, with: fewer than 10% of pupils in the ""vast majority"" of schools most schools had between 1% and 5% pupils attending This is only the first day for such emergency childcare cover and a full picture will take time to emerge, but the early reports might allay concerns that families would continue to send their children to school. ""It appears that the vast majority of families have responded to our appeal not to send their children to school, and we thank them for that,"" said Paul Whiteman, the NAHT's general secretary. Children have been told to stay at home across the UK. Most children had their last day of school on Friday until further notice Keeping schools open to look after the children of key workers - such as NHS, emergency or transport staff - is intended to help parents keep going to work and to maintain essential services. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, has called for virus testing for all staff in schools that remain open. ""This is no time for half-measures,"" said Dr Bousted, who said staff who were vulnerable, or who had vulnerable family at home, should not be put at risk by being in school. This video can not be played The government has closed all schools, but what does that mean for exams, and who can still go in? Gavin Williamson, England's Education Secretary, said: ""Early indications are that the number of children attending school today is low, and we thank parents for making the right choice and playing their part in our fight against coronavirus. ""People must do everything they can to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."" In Wales, Education Minister Kirsty Williams had called on key workers to ""think very carefully"" before sending their children to school. Northern Ireland's Education Minister, Peter Weir, said children should only attend school if there was ""no other viable option"" for their care. For those children starting their week at home, schools have been putting lessons and coursework online so that pupils can keep up with their studies. At Hampton Hill Junior School in Richmond, London, staff have had emergency training sessions in how to use an online learning system and all children were issued with a log-in so they can work from home. It was a new type of school drop-off for parents of some children at Hampton Hill Junior ""We'll be remotely available to answer any questions,"" Tracey Bannister, the school's special educational needs co-ordinator, told the BBC. Ms Bannister said the mood in school, which is open for key workers' children and vulnerable children, is sombre. ""I think it's a very different mood this morning,"" she said. ""In the staff meeting, we all sat further apart - there is definitely a different mood and maybe trepidation."" Pradeep Shetty, a carer whose daughter is eligible to attend school, says the current situation is difficult for everyone - for those who will be at home and those still coming to school. Mr Shetty says those children who have come to school will soon find it is very different from a regular timetable. ""It's hard for them to take as well - it's not a normal thing, just to be here without their friends."" Amy Arnold, head teacher at Barnham Church of England primary school in Suffolk, says staff are trying to create fun activities outdoors for those pupils who have come to school, such as den building, to limit physical contact. ""We're working hard to keep the children a safe distance apart - inevitably that poses some problems because some of the children are five years old and so they're finding this tricky to understand."" At Enniskillen Royal Grammar School in County Fermanagh, in Northern Ireland, principal Elizabeth Armstrong said a ""small number of pupils"" were in school on Monday morning.

Trump says coronavirus not Asian Americans' fault,"This video can not be played ""Uh oh"" - Trump backs away from task force leader US President Donald Trump - under fire for labelling Covid-19 the ""Chinese virus"" - has said Asian Americans should not be blamed for the outbreak. He said it is ""very important that we totally protect"" Asian Americans, whom he praised as ""amazing people"". Mr Trump spoke out amid rising reports of verbal and physical attacks on the community amid the pandemic. Coronavirus is still spreading in the US, which currently has more than 43,000 confirmed cases and 533 deaths. At a White House coronavirus task force news conference on Monday, Mr Trump said: ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. Live updates Strict new curbs on life in UK announced by PM US-China contagion: The battle behind the scenes ""They're amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form. ""They're working closely with us to get rid of it - we will prevail together."" Asked by a reporter why he had spoken out, Mr Trump said: ""It seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country and I don't like that at all. ""These are incredible people, they love our country and I'm not going to let it happen."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash During press conferences last week, Mr Trump used the term ""China virus"" and ""Chinese virus"", rejecting suggestions from reporters that the term was racist. ""It comes from China,"" Mr Trump said then. ""It's not racist at all."" The World Health Organization has issued guidance against ""stigmatising certain communities"" when naming illnesses. US lawmaker Judy Chu - a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus - was not impressed by Mr Trump's remarks. She told NBC News his comments would not ""be necessary if he and his supporters had not already endangered so many by spreading this toxic xenophobia"". This video can not be played Last week, President Trump was grilled on use of term 'Chinese virus' Analysis byZhaoyin Feng, BBC News Chinese, Washington In describing Covid-19 as the ""Chinese virus"", Mr Trump has been accused of attempting to deflect scrutiny for his domestic handling of the crisis on to external factors. Despite mounting criticism from China and Asian Americans, the president and several high-ranking US officials have continued to use the term. Other than potentially stigmatising Asian-Americans, Mr Trump's ""Chinese virus"" label could turn out to be a self-inflicted wound in the 2020 presidential election. Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial group in the US. According to recent surveys, the community's voters have increasingly leaned Democratic in the past few years, and they are becoming influential in electoral battleground districts. Even as he lavished praise on Asian Americans on Monday, the president was accused of breaking fences, rather than mending them. ""They [Asian Americans] are working closely with us to get rid of it [virus],"" he tweeted, leading some observers to take offence at the ""they/us"" dichotomy. On the day that Britain announced a national lockdown to combat the virus, Mr Trump announced: ""America will again and soon be open for business."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo appeared to suggest the president was putting the country's economic well-being ahead of its public health, tweeting: ""You cannot put a value on human life."" Trump wants US open for business despite pandemic The US is currently in the middle of 15 days of social distancing. Despite the president's signal that he was inclined to ease restrictions, state by state the nation was tightening lockdown measures. On Monday, Washington, Ohio, Louisiana, Oregon, Michigan, Indiana and Massachusetts became the latest to issue ""stay at home"" orders for residents. Wisconsin, Delaware and New Mexico will follow suit on Tuesday, taking the total number of states withdrawing behind closed doors to well over a dozen. These orders will affect about one in three Americans - more than 100 million people. This video can not be played Reality Check tackles misleading health advice being shared online Maryland stopped short on Monday of a ""stay at home"" order, instead joining several other states that have closed all non-essential businesses. Neighbouring Virginia closed schools for the rest of the academic year. The US now has the third highest number of cases in the world, behind Italy and China. Half of America's total caseload is in New York state, which has recorded more than 20,000 positive tests and 157 deaths. US National Guard troops are helping to distribute food and medical supplies across the country. The homeland military force's leader, General Joseph Lengyel, described the situation as like having ""54 different hurricanes hitting every state"". This video can not be played US students on spring break defy COVID-19 warnings As state officials clamour for aid, Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Monday said the US military ""can't meet everybody's needs"". Mr Esper said the Pentagon was working to send field hospitals to support the hard-hit cities of New York and Seattle. On Monday, the top US public health official, Surgeon General Dr Jerome Adams, said: ""I want America to understand this week it's going to get bad."" He noted on the NBC morning show Today that young people were ignoring guidance to practise social distancing. The University of Tampa in Florida said that at least five students who ignored social distancing advice to party on spring break had since tested positive for Covid-19. A man from Phoenix, Arizona, is dead and his wife is in a critical condition after the couple ingested chloroquine phosphate - a substance used to clean fish tanks that is similar to a drug touted by President Trump as a possible treatment for coronavirus. Chloroquine is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating malaria, but it is not authorised as a medication for Covid-19.

Five things that will now be banned,"A series of strict measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak has been introduced by the government. They are aimed at stopping the spread of infection by making people stay at home unless absolutely necessary. Under the new regulations,externalnobody may leave their homes ""without reasonable excuse"". Reasonable excuses include: Shopping for basic necessities such as food or medicine To take exercise (the guidelines suggest once a day, and in Wales that is the law) Seeking medical assistance, or to avoid injury or illness or to escape a risk of harm Providing care or assistance to a vulnerable person, providing emergency assistance, or donating blood Travelling to work or to carry out voluntary services, where it's not possible to do these from home Attending the funeral of a member of your household, or a close family member (or in some circumstances, a friend) Fulfilling legal obligations, such as attending court, satisfying bail requirements or participating in legal proceedings Accessing critical public services including childcare or education, social services, or victim support Allowing children of separated parents to move between both households Moving house where reasonably necessary Religious ministers are also allowed to visit their place of worship. When outside your home, you should keep a safe distance of 2m or more from anyone who is not a member of your household. Many businesses and venues have been ordered to close. These include: Pubs, cafes and restaurants - although food delivery and takeaway are still permitted Cinemas and theatres, libraries, community centres, youth centres, and places of worship All shops selling ""non-essential"" goods - this includes clothing and electronics stores, and hair, beauty and nail salons Indoor and outdoor leisure facilities such as bowling alleys, arcades and soft play facilities Communal places within parks, such as playgrounds, sports courts and outdoor gyms Hotels, hostels, bed-and-breakfasts, campsites and caravan parks (excluding those providing accommodation for key workers, permanent residents and the homeless) Shops that remain open include supermarkets, pharmacies, petrol stations and post offices. A full list can be foundhere,external. Tradespeople can still carry out repair and maintenance work in people's homes as long as they are well and have no symptoms, and keep 2m away from people in the household. However, in households where people are self-isolating, or where a vulnerable individual is beingshielded, no work should be carried out except emergency repairs to remedy a direct safety risk to the household. All gatherings of more than two people have been banned by the government. The only exceptions are: Where the gathering is of a group of people who live together - for example, a parent can take their children to the shops if they can't be left at home alone Where the gathering is essential for work purposes - although workers should try to keep all meetings to a minimum In addition, the government has stopped weddings, baptisms and other religious ceremonies, apart from funerals. The restrictions were announced on 23 March by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, with the plan to review them after three weeks. The police have been given powers to make sure people follow the measures. If you leave your home or gather in public for any reason other than those allowed, the police may instruct you to go home or disperse. They may also instruct you to stop your children from also breaking the rules. They also have the power to take you home or arrest you. What powers do the police have? If the police believe you have broken rules, or if you refuse to follow their instructions, they may issue you with a fine of Â£60 (reduced to Â£30 if paid within 14 days). If it's the second time you've received a fine, the amount will increase to Â£120 and double on each further repeat offence. The guidance says that ""the police will act with discretion and common sense in applying these measures"". Local authorities (such as trading standards officers) will be monitoring local businesses to make sure they also follow the rules. Those that don't comply will face the threat of fines, and of being closed down. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW GUIDANCE:What must I do? NEW RESTRICTIONS:What are they?

So how did day one of homeschooling go?,"With schools closed to the majority of pupils to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus, parents across the country have been asked to become instant homeschoolers. How have they coped with their first day of juggling timetables, curricula and coursework - all the while trying to get their own jobs done? âItâs about being flexibleâ âIâve kind of done a timetable but Iâm not sure how successful thatâs going to be â ask me in a few days,â says Bobbie Gordon in Nottingham. She and her husband - who work in marketing and IT respectively - are trying to be as flexible as possible as they combine work with their new role as homeschoolers to Imogen, 9, Lottie, 6, and four-year-old Hattie. How families can cope with self-isolating together The school of Mum and Dad How to help kids cope with life without school âWeâre just trying to tag-team it,â she says. âItâs about being flexible. Weâre just trying to be supportive of each other as well because it is quite difficult for everybody and weâve both got quite demanding jobs.â The curriculum involves some schoolwork along with things the parents are keen to share with their kids, whether itâs coding, cooking or teaching them how to use the washing machine. âItâs life skills stuff,â says Ms Gordon. âMaybe it will help them realise everything that we have to do!â It's been busy, round at the Gordons' So far on Monday morning, they have done some writing, planted some seeds in the vegetable patch and made soup together. Ms Gordon says sheâs also keen for her kids to keep in touch with friends by video chat, and the eldest has already organised a daily evening video call with her classmates. âItâs 16 very excitable nine-year-olds running round their houses and playing instruments and things,â she says. Day one has gone relatively smoothly, says Ms Gordon, with sunshine and a spacious garden playing their part. âI suspect in a few weeksâ time if itâs horrible, rainy weather and they canât get outside there will be harder days ahead,â she says. âKids want routine, stabilityâ For some parents, itâs been all about maintaining a routine. Joe Wicks, the fitness instructor and TV presenter, attracted more than 800,000 viewers to his YouTube Channel promising a daily 30-minute workout for kids to start the day. He told BBC Radio 5 Live he wanted to play a part in reassuring kids that âalthough this is a weird time, everything is going to be fine, itâs going to return to normal and weâll be reconnected againâ. Joe Wicks woke a nation In St Helens, Catherine Ormesher says her 11-year-old daughter Jessica is also benefitting from sticking to a routine, tackling her maths work on Monday morning just as her school timetable says. âIâm quite shocked actually,â says Ms Ormesher. She says her daughterâs school took âa massive weightâ off of parents by providing them with materials and log-ins for online learning. The school suggested that parents wake up their children at the normal time and begin work at 09:00 GMT. âThe kids have been sending WhatsApp messages to tell each other that theyâre starting their lessons now. Theyâre following the timetable and getting one another motivated,â says Ms Ormesher, who is a carer. âThey obviously want the routine and the stability.â Stability is key Ms Ormesher said the schoolâs music teacher started them off with a âwake and shakeâ â an early morning dance to get kids energised â before a morning of lessons. At her 11:00 break, Jessica asked Amazonâs Alexa to set a reminder for the start of lessons 20 minutes later. But her mum says that holding onto the routine may have a special importance for her, as she was in isolation before school closed, having returned from Spain with an illness. âOn Friday a little boy knocked on the door and left all her books and everything from school on our step. When we opened the door and I gave them to Jess, she just broke her heart crying because she hadnât got to say her goodbyes to her primary school,â she says. âWe focus on safety, love and fun' Educational psychologists â such as Zubeida Dasgupta, who is at home in Brighton with her three children â warn that being home for a prolonged period can be difficult and stressful for some children. Parents may also be stressed and worrying about the health of family members, their finances or food security, she says. So her approach has been to emphasise that home is not school and she is not a teacher. âWe have decided to focus on safety, love and fun, with a little bit of learning where the children are showing interest,â she says. One child is very motivated and organised, she says, working through tasks set by school, helping his younger sister and following his interests in skills such as coding. The others are getting more guidance in activities such as gardening or recording music on the computer. The youngest has volunteered to practise spelling and times tables. âI think we are all experiencing a feeling of loss of control at the moment, so doing activities where your children can be involved in planning and making decisions - and also succeeding - may help them feel a bit more in control,â Ms Dasgupta says. âIf we can support our children through this, it may well end up being a positive experience. They may develop some resilience and discover new found interests and skills.â A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate?

All non-essential shops to close immediately,"Sports Direct has performed a U-turn on keeping its shops open during the coronavirus lockdown following a backlash over its plans. The government has ordered all UK shops selling non-essential goods to close. Sports Direct initially said it would remain open as it was ""uniquely well placed to help keep the UK as fit and healthy as possible"". But after widespread criticism, it now says it will not open ""until we are given the go-ahead by the government"". Sports Direct's chief financial officer, Chris Wootton, said the chain was contacting the government ""at all levels"" to confirm whether its shops were deemed to provide an essential service. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said on Tuesday morning that he could not see ""any justification"" for it to stay open. ""The key thing we need to do is make sure people wherever possible stay at home. Yes it's important people exercise but that should be done once a day and it's a basic thing,"" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. ""People can walk, run or cycle, they should, but there is no reason for a store like Sports Direct to remain open."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The retailer had argued that it provided an essential service. Bosses at the company said the sports equipment it sells can be used to exercise at home at a time when gyms have been closed. In a letter written by Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct and Evans Cycles, Mr Wootton had said: ""Thus our Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores will remain open where possible to allow us to do this (in accordance with the government's current social distancing guidance). ""There is no one else that has the range of product and range of stores to make this reasonably accessible for the whole population."" Bicycle shops are on the list of retailers that are allowed to stay open during the shutdown. Shops selling non-essential items have been ordered to close But Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the shop workers' trade union Usdaw, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I can't see how it [Sports Direct] is an essential service. It's a sports clothing company. ""In my mind, an essential service would include food and medicine and the supply chain around that,"" as well as the National Health Service, he said. Sports Direct's initial plan to stay open drew widespread backlash on social media. Ian Lavery MP, chair of the Labour Party, told the company's founder and chief executive Mike Ashley to ""take some responsibility"". Allow Twitter content?

A number of High Street retailers and food chains had already shut prior to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement on Monday evening, which set out strict new measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus. The government has now issueda list of which ""essential"" retailers are allowed to stay open.,externalThey include: Supermarkets and other food shops Pharmacies Petrol stations Newsagents Bicycle shops Home and hardware stores Laundrettes and dry cleaners Garages Pet shops Post Offices Banks Businesses will still be able to take online orders and deliver items to people's homes. The government this week said it wouldpay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic, in a move aimed at protecting people's jobs. It will pay 80% of salary for staff who are kept on by their employer, covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month. Meanwhile, on Tuesday: A closely-watched economic survey,externalindicated there had been ""record slump"" in UK business activity in March as emergency public health measures dealt a ""severe blow"" to the economy. The compilers of the survey said the figures suggested ""a recession of a scale we have not seen in modern history is looking increasingly likely"" Waitrose became the first UK supermarket to announce it would limit the number of people who could be in a store at any one time B&Q said it would close temporarily to prepare its stores for selling ""essential products"" The boss of the Wetherspoon pub chain saidits staff should feel free to take jobs at supermarketssuch as Tesco while its pubs remain closed. Many retail and hospitality firms have warned the pandemic could see them collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is put on hold. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of retail lobby group the British Retail Consortium, said many shops had already closed temporarily. ""Any retailers that remain open will be following the very latest government public health guidance to ensure they do everything they can to ensure the safety of customers and staff,"" she said. The government had already ordered pubs, restaurants and cafes to close amid concerns that people were ignoring its advice to keep social contact to a minimum. Monday night's announcement came as the number of UK deaths from coronavirus hit 335, while there were 6,650 confirmed cases. Many of the big brands to have already announced closures have promised to pay their staff for several weeks until the government's coronavirus job retention scheme kicks in. However, concern is growing about the millions of self-employed and gig economy workers who will be forced to rely on benefits in the absence of targeted support. Neil Carberry, boss of lobby group the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said the announcement reinforced the need for businesses and workers to access government support measures ""as quickly as possible"". ""With the economy and jobs market in lockdown, all employers can do is stand by their staff as far as possible and reap the benefits during the post-crisis comeback,"" he added.

Boris Johnson's coronavirus address in full,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has used a national TV address to set out strict new measures aimed at protecting people from the coronavirus outbreak. This is his statement in full: ""Good evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades - and this country is not alone. All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won't be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. More than 6,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus in the UK And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it's vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS's ability to cope - and save more lives. And that's why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic. The restrictions will ban gatherings of more than two people who are not in the same household And though huge numbers are complying - and I thank you all - the time has now come for us all to do more. From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction -  you must stay at home. Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households. That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible One form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household; Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person; and Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. That's all - these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. LATEST:Live updates from around the world A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can. If you don't follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the government's instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: Close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship We will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public - excluding people you live with And we'll stop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed. No prime minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people's lives, to their businesses and to their jobs. And that's why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business. And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to. There have been more than 335 deaths from coronavirus in the UK - a third of them have been in London But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost and yet it is also true that there is a clear way through. Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with 7,500 former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy - by simply staying at home - we are increasing our stocks of equipment. We are accelerating our search for treatments. We are pioneering work on a vaccine. And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer. I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus. Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline. But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together. To halt the spread of this disease. To protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives. And I know that as they have in the past so many times, the people of this country will rise to that challenge and we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together and therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.""

Coronavirus: How to apply for business support,"The government has promised the biggest intervention in private sector business since World War Two The governmenthas released more details about the Â£350bn package of financial supportwhich Chancellor Rishi Sunak has promised to UK business to deal with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Last weekhe set out plans to pay employees 80% of their salaries, capped at Â£2,500 per month, in an attempt to protect jobs. Two further schemes to help business were announced on Tuesday: anew interest-free Business Interruption Loan Scheme,externalfor small and medium-sized firms anda Bank of England finance option,externalfor bigger businesses. UK-based small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) with an annual turnover of less than Â£45m can apply for an interest-free loan of up to Â£5m to help them through Covid-19 related difficulties. The government will provide a grant payment to cover the interest and initial fees for the first 12 months, and will guarantee 80% of the loan amount to give banks and financial companies the confidence to lend. Under the scheme, which will initially run for six months, businesses will be able to borrow for up to six years. They will be liable to repay the money in full - the guarantee is for the lenders, not the borrowers. Not necessarily, Firms will have to prove that they are viable businesses which have been trading successfully, but just need extra support to deal with short term difficulties caused by the current disruption. Some firms may not be successful. The money will be provided bymore than 40 lenders who have signed up to the scheme,,externalincluding High Street banks like Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and NatWest, as well as more specialist finance companies. Businesses are asked to contact their own bank first (if they are taking part in the scheme) via the company website if possible, and only approach other lenders if they need to. The British Business Bank, which is running the scheme, told the BBC on 23 March that it expected money to start flowing ""this week"". You can read more about how the scheme will workhere,external. Yes, The British Business Bank says self-employed people with an annual turnover of up to Â£45m can apply under the scheme, as long as they operate through a business bank account, and generate more than 50% of their turnover from trading activity. This includes sole traders, freelancers, and limited partnerships, operating in all sectors. The government has already saidthe UK's five million self-employed peoplewould be allowed to defer self-assessment tax payments, and would benefit from mortgage payment holidays as well as an expansion of welfare support, including universal credit and Local Housing Allowance. HM Treasury told the BBC the government was ""working hard on further measures to support the self-employed"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Am I allowed outside? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Companies that have a yearly turnover of more than Â£45m may be able to take advantage of the Bank of England's new Covid Corporate Financing Facility. The Corporate Financing Facility is effectively a government promise to buy short-term IOUs from companies which are in sound financial health and have a very high credit rating, but which need help to boost their cash flows. The IOUs can be for any period between one week and 12 months. The Bank of England says that eligible companies must have a ""genuine business"" in the UK, and ""make a material contribution to the UK economy"". Generally they will be based in the UK, or have their headquarters here, and employ or provide services to a significant number of people in the country. Companies must apply through their own bank in the first instance, assuming it is taking part in the scheme, and need to request funding of at least Â£1m. The facility will offer finance to companies on similar terms to those available in the markets in the period before the pandemic. The government will not publish details of which firms have taken advantage of the scheme, which is due to run for at least 12 months. You can read more about how the scheme will workhere:,external.

Behind the scenes of the Alex Salmond trial,"Mr Salmond walked free from the court after being cleared of all of the allegations against him After a political career spanning 30 years, Alex Salmond will be more familiar than most with the feeling of sitting waiting for a result to come in. But never one quite like this. This time, the constituency passing judgement on the former first minister was a jury of the High Court in Edinburgh. And rather than a seat in parliament or the outcome of a referendum, his very freedom was on the line. It wasn't just Mr Salmond waiting for a result. Listen to the Alex Salmond trial podcast Nine women also sat nervously awaiting the outcome, to see if their accounts of sexual assault would be believed beyond all reasonable doubt. When the foreman of the jury stood up and announced that Mr Salmond had been cleared of all charges, the former first minister reacted the way he had throughout the trial - by not reacting. He calmly thanked the judge as she told him he was free to go, and walked from the courtroom. The trial was presided over by Lady Dorrian, Scotland's second most senior judge The jury's six total hours of deliberation were preceded by nine days of evidence, with witnesses being questioned by prosecution and defence lawyers amid intense media scrutiny. All of it was presided over by Lady Dorrian, Scotland's second most senior judge. While always fair, she was also scrupulously firm. Lawyers who pushed at the boundaries of what could reasonably be relevant to the case were steered firmly back into line. Witnesses who strayed into hearsay or speculation were stopped dead in their tracks. The lawyers leading the two opposing sides were both titans of the court, vastly experienced operators - but could scarcely have been more different in style. Mr Prentice led the prosecution case Prosecutor Alex Prentice, the advocate depute, was all precision, referring to a huge stack of notes and delivering clipped, precise questions. There was a noticeable pattern to his approach - each woman was asked the exact same things about whether they consented to or invited the former first minister's alleged advances - as Mr Prentice painstakingly built his case. Defence lawyer Gordon Jackson, meanwhile, barked out his questions gruffly, darting from one subject to the next; ""let's move on"" he would growl, leaving his scepticism about the answers hanging heavy in the air. ""The Dean"", as many including Lady Dorrian called him in reference to his position atop the Faculty of Advocates, was loath to stand still behind a lectern as he pursued his quarry. He ranged around the courtroom, wig askew, as he mused on the quality of evidence. This wandering was apparent even when the Crown was taking the lead - at one point he popped up at the back of the press room, watching Alex Prentice's questions on a monitor amid a pack of slightly startled journalists. Mr Salmost and Mr Jackson observed social distancing protocol sa they congratulated each other outside court For his part, Mr Salmond sat placidly in the dock throughout. He occasionally called Mr Jackson over to suggest a certain question, but for the most part seemed content to watch. At the end of each day's evidence he would share a joke and some hand sanitiser with one of the security officers before walking out with a calm smile carefully fixed on his face. The assembly of journalists seated directly behind him peered through the plexiglass screen, seeking in vain for some flicker of emotion. But at most you would occasionally catch him rocking gently from side to side during particularly difficult moments, like when he was waiting for the jury to troop back in with their verdict. When he came to give evidence, there was little of the showmanship which characterised his approach to politics. This was a more reserved Alex Salmond, acutely aware of the difficulty of his position. He did deploy the old politician's trick of turning his opponents own quotes back on them, reading back his own notes of evidence from the complainers as Mr Jackson guided him along, but he rarely strayed into speechifying. Mr Salmond's wife, Moira, accompanied him to court on Alex Prentice borrowed a trick from politics himself with a Paxman-style opening to cross examination, posing the same question four or five times - had Mr Salmond considered the feelings of one of the complainers? - in increasingly icy tones. But for all the former FM was irritated, heaving a sigh into his microphone, his composure did not crack. The nine women named in the charges gave evidence in a closed court, a screen separating them from Mr Salmond and the media decamped to a neighbouring room with a video feed. Their testimony was picked over in occasionally excruciating detail, by both prosecution and defence. Shelagh McCall QC - in theory the defence's junior counsel, but one so senior in her field that the title seems laughable - led the cross-examination of several, but both she and Mr Jackson found themselves well matched. Often, their attempts to pull apart the stories of the complainers only brought out even more eye-catching testimony. For example the much-discussed system where female civil servants were supposedly not allowed to work alone with Mr Salmond in the evening first came out in cross examination. This, combined with the limits placed on the questioning of complainers in sex offences trials, meant cross-examination often seemed to fly by in a trial which ended up lasting for only half as long as it was originally scheduled for. Mr Salmond thanked his legal team and supporters It felt slightly odd to be inside the bubble of the court as the coronavirus story took off outside. At first, a bottle of hand sanitiser appearing in the media room was as much acknowledgement as it got, but as breaking news alerts popped up on everyone's phones the shadow of the virus steadily grew over the court. Every morning we would nervously count the jurors in, to make sure there were still 15. Eventually their number would drop to 13, although Lady Dorrian stressed there were ""various reasons"" for that. Mr Jackson spent the better part of the trial coughing and spluttering; at one point he paused to reassure the jury that he had had his cough for ""about six weeks"" so there was no need for him to go into self-isolation. One of his witnesses did, however, and was unable to attend court. Lady Dorrian spoke about these being ""difficult times"", but was apparently absolutely determined to see the trial through. She was even rumoured to have been contemplating a Saturday sitting at one point. Ultimately it feels like there is little room for analysis or evaluation of the arguments actually made in court. In general, we accept the verdict of the jury in absolute terms; they pronounce an accused guilty because he is guilty, not because of the particular skill of the prosecution. They pronounce him innocent because his guilt has not been proved, not because his defence team have yanked him from the fire. This trial is no different. This does not mean there will be no debate or discussion off the back of it all - far from it, and even Mr Salmond spoke outside court of there being more to say once the coronavirus crisis has eased. Testimony heard in the court has raised questions for the Scottish government, for the SNP, and for Nicola Sturgeon. But those will be addressed in the political arena, not the legal one. As far as the court is concerned, the Alex Salmond trial is over.

Coronavirus support 'not open to firms like mine',"Humphrey Cobbold runs Pure Gym, which employs more than 1,500 people The government's Â£330bn rescue package for British businesses doesn't go far enough, some firms have warned. They fear they are too big for a new interest-free loan scheme, but not credit-worthy enough for a Bank of England finance option. One firm falling through the cracks is Pure Gym. It employs just over 1,500 workers across 265 sites, as well as providing work for 3,500 self-employed personal trainers. ""We're much too large for the new smaller companies' scheme, but for the larger company scheme you have to have an investment rating to apply,"" boss Humphrey Cobbold told the BBC's Today programme. Coronavirus: How to apply for government business support There are two elements to the government rescue package announced on Monday. First is a new Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme which is aimed at helping small and medium-sized companies by allowing them to borrow up to Â£5m at preferential rates. ""Viable businesses"" can apply for a 12-month interest-free loan, 80% of which will be guaranteed by the government. Companies with a larger turnover can take advantage of the Bank of England's new Covid Corporate Financing Facility. That's effectively a government promise to buy short-term IOUs from companies that are investment grade: in short those with a very high credit rating. Details of the government's business support,external Information on the Covid Corporate Financing Facility,external Information on the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan,external ""We're actually caught in the middle between both schemes. They're not really open to us,"" Mr Cobbold said. But like many other companies, Pure Gym faces some difficult financial decisions. ""Following the prime minister's announcement on Friday, we had to take a business that has taken 10 years to build and close it down in 10 hours,"" Mr Cobbold said. ""We burn cash at a rate of about Â£9m-Â£10m a week, so we have quite a task to drive down that burn rate so we can make our cash and liquidity last as long as we can."" There are thousands of businesses that could fall between the two stools, it is reckoned. For instance, most High Street chains won't qualify, such as the likes of M&S, Boots, WH Smith and Pret a Manger. The UK hospitality and retail sector employs 3.2 million people, more than any other sector in the economy. But most of that industry won't be eligible. ""We know that businesses are in urgent need of access to funding during these unprecedented times,"" Business Minister Alok Sharma said. ""The Business Interruption Scheme will make it easier for banks to lend and businesses to borrow."" Raghu Kodakandala has been forced to close his seven restaurants employing 120 staff One firm that is facing desperate times is Leicester-based Koban Restaurant Group. It has seven restaurants employing 120 workers but all have now closed. ""We had no option but to shut down our restaurants with heavy losses,"" owner Raghu Kodakandala told the Today programme. He says the restaurants are not geared up to continue as takeaways - as others have done - because they concentrate on fine dining and steaks and grills. He said he's had to ask his staff to go on unpaid leave. ""As a small company I only have the resource to support them until the end of the month. After that I don't have the cashflow to help them out."" He's desperate to raise some money to help him through the difficult times ahead, but says he's had no joy at the banks. ""I would like to apply for one of the government guaranteed loans, but when I approached some of the partner banks they didn't know how the scheme would be rolled out,"" he said. Banks should have more clarity after the details of the Government's business rescue package were published. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan is available through the British Business Bank. ""Businesses can access the finance through more than 40 accredited lenders, including high street banks and asset finance companies based all over country,"" Keith Morgan, the chief executive of the British Business Bank, told the Today programme. He said there are a range of different financing solutions offered, from smaller working capital loans to larger asset loans. For companies facing an immediate cashflow crisis, he said: ""We would expect money to start flowing this week."" Meanwhile there's a possible ray of hope for firms caught in the cracks: the Treasury said further measures would be announced to ensure large and medium-sized businesses had access to the credit they need.

"PM announces strict new curbs on life in UKGatherings of more than two people are banned, shops ordered to close and social events stopped as part of rules to keep Britons at home and stop the spread of the coronavirus.","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You must stay at home"" Strict new curbs on life in the UK to tackle the spread of coronavirus have been announced by the prime minister. People may only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when it is ""absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil any medical or care needs. Shops selling non-essential goods have been told to shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together will be prohibited. The UK death toll has reached 335. If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in atelevised statement from Downing Street. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Johnson said the country faced a ""moment of national emergency"" and staying at home was necessary to protect the NHS and save lives. He said the restrictions would be in place for at least three weeks and would be kept under constant review. The government guidance,externalsays people should only leave home for one of four reasons: Shopping for basic necessities such as food and medicine. Shopping trips should be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk, or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can continue to take their children to school Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Even when following the above guidance, people should minimise the amount of time spent out of their homes and should keep two metres (6ft) away from people they do not live with. The government is also stopping all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies - but funerals will be allowed. Businesses that will not need to close,externalinclude: Restaurants, cafes and work canteens - but only for food delivery and takeaway services Supermarkets and other premises selling food, including market stalls ""Health shops"" such as pharmacies Petrol stations, garages and car rental businesses Bicycle shops Home and hardware shops Launderettes and dry cleaners Pet shops Corner shops, newsagents and post offices Banks Other premises including libraries, non-essential shops, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship have been ordered to close. Parks will remain open for exercise but people are not allowed to gather in groups. Community centres can remain open but only for the purpose of ""hosting essential voluntary or public services"" such as food banks or service for homeless people, the guidance says. Hotels, hostels, campsites and caravan parks must also close unless key workers need to stay there, or if other people staying there cannot return to their primary residence. This video can not be played What is social distancing? Scientists have said each person with coronavirus infects 2.5 people and that takes about five days. This means, over a period of 30 days, more than 400 people will have been infected as a result of that one person. If a person halves their social exposure, that first infection leads to only 15 infections after 30 days. Several police forces said they were facing a high number of phone calls from members of the public seeking clarification on the new restrictions. Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley warned the public not to ""cripple"" his force's phone lines. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said they were working with the government and other agencies to work out how best to enforce the new rules. But Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said he was already seeing ""large amounts of sickness"" among officers across London and enforcing the new restrictions would be ""a real, real challenge"". ""We will be dealing with it, but I'm not sure we will have the resources to be able to see it through,"" he added. Home Secretary Priti Patel saidin a tweet,externalthat the next few weeks would be ""testing"" for police but that she would make sure officers had ""the resources they need to keep themselves and the public safe"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the new restrictions ""amount to a lockdown"" and are ""not done lightly"". ""I am not going to sugarcoat it in any way,"" she said. ""Coronavirus is the biggest challenge of our lifetime."" In a tweet,external, First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster urged people to follow the restrictions ""to save lives and protect our hospitals"". First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said ""these are really big changes for us all"". ""We are making them because of the speed the virus is continuing to spread,"" he added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the measures were ""the right response"". ""The government must close the loopholes to give security to all workers, including the self-employed, as well as renters and mortgage holders,"" he added. Five things that will now be banned All non-essential shops to close immediately Stay at home, first minister tells Wales This is a lockdown, says Scottish first minister 'Wave of deaths' in NI if social distancing not followed The prime minister said the measures were necessary to tackle ""the biggest threat this country has faced for decades"". ""Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won't be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,"" he said. ""And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. ""To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well."" It seems hard to overstate how huge an impact this will have on the country, and what a massive decision this is for the government to have taken - whose effect will last at least for a period of three weeks at the shortest, potentially for very much longer. Remember this though is not quite the kind of total crackdown we have seen in other countries - at least not yet. Despite tonight's enormous announcement, there are steps that other places have taken - curfews or total travel bans for example - that the UK is not pursuing. The government is not triggering the Civil Contingencies Act, designed for the most serious emergencies which gives ministers draconian powers. Not surprisingly, there is already therefore enormous controversy about whether the UK has been acting fast enough. Read more from Laura The prime minister said he knew the ""damage"" the restrictions were causing to people's lives, businesses and jobs but at present there were ""no easy options"".

What is shielding?,"Guidance for people in England identified as being ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing? Formal advice telling them to take extra care, or ""shield"", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. Most coronavirus restrictionsare being lifted in Englandon 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else. However, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to ""think particularly carefully"" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including: limiting moments of close contact considering whether you and others have been fully vaccinated (you might want to wait until 14 days after your second dose before meeting) considering the risk if Covid levels are high in the general community meeting outside if possible ensuring inside spaces are well-ventilated washing hands regularly and avoiding face-touching continuing social distancing if that feels right for you asking friends/family to take lateral flow tests before meeting There is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Although Scotland moves toCovid protection level zero,externalon 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidkeeping the mandatory use of face coveringspast then would give ""added protection and assurance"" to people who were particularly vulnerable. From 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace. However, companies still havelegally binding health and safety responsibilities,external- and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. Some firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people. TheCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough),externalis available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. You may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons. Read theupdated government advice,external. Although the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it ""expects and recommends"" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport. You should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. TheNHS Volunteer Responders,externalprogramme is still available to offer support. Data showsCovid vaccines are highly effectivein most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection. Being double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. You should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not,book through the NHS website,externalor call 119. The most vulnerable peopleare likely to be offered booster jabs from September,external, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. You are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions. The pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The governmentrecommends several support websites,external. If you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on theNHS Shielded Patient List,external. A combination of factors can contribute toa person's risk,external, including: age (older being higher risk) ethnicity deprivation (according to postcode) weight (body mass index) underlying health issues prescribed medications Cancer patients need to take extra care High risk categories,externalinclude people: with transplanted solid organs undergoing some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy on immunosuppression drugs with heart disease who are also pregnant with severe respiratory conditions (for example: cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD) with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency with Down's syndrome (adults) on dialysis or with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (adults) EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

PM announces strict new curbs on life in UK,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You must stay at home"" Strict new curbs on life in the UK to tackle the spread of coronavirus have been announced by the prime minister. People may only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when it is ""absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil any medical or care needs. Shops selling non-essential goods have been told to shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together will be prohibited. The UK death toll has reached 335. If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in atelevised statement from Downing Street. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Johnson said the country faced a ""moment of national emergency"" and staying at home was necessary to protect the NHS and save lives. He said the restrictions would be in place for at least three weeks and would be kept under constant review. The government guidance,externalsays people should only leave home for one of four reasons: Shopping for basic necessities such as food and medicine. Shopping trips should be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk, or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can continue to take their children to school Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Even when following the above guidance, people should minimise the amount of time spent out of their homes and should keep two metres (6ft) away from people they do not live with. The government is also stopping all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies - but funerals will be allowed. Businesses that will not need to close,externalinclude: Restaurants, cafes and work canteens - but only for food delivery and takeaway services Supermarkets and other premises selling food, including market stalls ""Health shops"" such as pharmacies Petrol stations, garages and car rental businesses Bicycle shops Home and hardware shops Launderettes and dry cleaners Pet shops Corner shops, newsagents and post offices Banks Other premises including libraries, non-essential shops, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship have been ordered to close. Parks will remain open for exercise but people are not allowed to gather in groups. Community centres can remain open but only for the purpose of ""hosting essential voluntary or public services"" such as food banks or service for homeless people, the guidance says. Hotels, hostels, campsites and caravan parks must also close unless key workers need to stay there, or if other people staying there cannot return to their primary residence. This video can not be played What is social distancing? Scientists have said each person with coronavirus infects 2.5 people and that takes about five days. This means, over a period of 30 days, more than 400 people will have been infected as a result of that one person. If a person halves their social exposure, that first infection leads to only 15 infections after 30 days. Several police forces said they were facing a high number of phone calls from members of the public seeking clarification on the new restrictions. Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley warned the public not to ""cripple"" his force's phone lines. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said they were working with the government and other agencies to work out how best to enforce the new rules. But Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said he was already seeing ""large amounts of sickness"" among officers across London and enforcing the new restrictions would be ""a real, real challenge"". ""We will be dealing with it, but I'm not sure we will have the resources to be able to see it through,"" he added. Home Secretary Priti Patel saidin a tweet,externalthat the next few weeks would be ""testing"" for police but that she would make sure officers had ""the resources they need to keep themselves and the public safe"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the new restrictions ""amount to a lockdown"" and are ""not done lightly"". ""I am not going to sugarcoat it in any way,"" she said. ""Coronavirus is the biggest challenge of our lifetime."" In a tweet,external, First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster urged people to follow the restrictions ""to save lives and protect our hospitals"". First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said ""these are really big changes for us all"". ""We are making them because of the speed the virus is continuing to spread,"" he added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the measures were ""the right response"". ""The government must close the loopholes to give security to all workers, including the self-employed, as well as renters and mortgage holders,"" he added. Five things that will now be banned All non-essential shops to close immediately Stay at home, first minister tells Wales This is a lockdown, says Scottish first minister 'Wave of deaths' in NI if social distancing not followed The prime minister said the measures were necessary to tackle ""the biggest threat this country has faced for decades"". ""Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won't be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,"" he said. ""And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. ""To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well."" It seems hard to overstate how huge an impact this will have on the country, and what a massive decision this is for the government to have taken - whose effect will last at least for a period of three weeks at the shortest, potentially for very much longer. Remember this though is not quite the kind of total crackdown we have seen in other countries - at least not yet. Despite tonight's enormous announcement, there are steps that other places have taken - curfews or total travel bans for example - that the UK is not pursuing. The government is not triggering the Civil Contingencies Act, designed for the most serious emergencies which gives ministers draconian powers. Not surprisingly, there is already therefore enormous controversy about whether the UK has been acting fast enough. Read more from Laura The prime minister said he knew the ""damage"" the restrictions were causing to people's lives, businesses and jobs but at present there were ""no easy options"". ""The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost,"" he said. However, Mr Johnson said there was ""a clear way through"", by strengthening the NHS with former clinicians returning to work, accelerating the search for treatments and a vaccine and buying millions of testing kits.

Why is the UK imposing tougher restrictions?,"A series of strict measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak has been introduced by the government. They are aimed at stopping the spread of infection by making people stay at home unless absolutely necessary. Under the new regulations,externalnobody may leave their homes ""without reasonable excuse"". Reasonable excuses include: Shopping for basic necessities such as food or medicine To take exercise (the guidelines suggest once a day, and in Wales that is the law) Seeking medical assistance, or to avoid injury or illness or to escape a risk of harm Providing care or assistance to a vulnerable person, providing emergency assistance, or donating blood Travelling to work or to carry out voluntary services, where it's not possible to do these from home Attending the funeral of a member of your household, or a close family member (or in some circumstances, a friend) Fulfilling legal obligations, such as attending court, satisfying bail requirements or participating in legal proceedings Accessing critical public services including childcare or education, social services, or victim support Allowing children of separated parents to move between both households Moving house where reasonably necessary Religious ministers are also allowed to visit their place of worship. When outside your home, you should keep a safe distance of 2m or more from anyone who is not a member of your household. Many businesses and venues have been ordered to close. These include: Pubs, cafes and restaurants - although food delivery and takeaway are still permitted Cinemas and theatres, libraries, community centres, youth centres, and places of worship All shops selling ""non-essential"" goods - this includes clothing and electronics stores, and hair, beauty and nail salons Indoor and outdoor leisure facilities such as bowling alleys, arcades and soft play facilities Communal places within parks, such as playgrounds, sports courts and outdoor gyms Hotels, hostels, bed-and-breakfasts, campsites and caravan parks (excluding those providing accommodation for key workers, permanent residents and the homeless) Shops that remain open include supermarkets, pharmacies, petrol stations and post offices. A full list can be foundhere,external. Tradespeople can still carry out repair and maintenance work in people's homes as long as they are well and have no symptoms, and keep 2m away from people in the household. However, in households where people are self-isolating, or where a vulnerable individual is beingshielded, no work should be carried out except emergency repairs to remedy a direct safety risk to the household. All gatherings of more than two people have been banned by the government. The only exceptions are: Where the gathering is of a group of people who live together - for example, a parent can take their children to the shops if they can't be left at home alone Where the gathering is essential for work purposes - although workers should try to keep all meetings to a minimum In addition, the government has stopped weddings, baptisms and other religious ceremonies, apart from funerals. The restrictions were announced on 23 March by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, with the plan to review them after three weeks. The police have been given powers to make sure people follow the measures. If you leave your home or gather in public for any reason other than those allowed, the police may instruct you to go home or disperse. They may also instruct you to stop your children from also breaking the rules. They also have the power to take you home or arrest you. What powers do the police have? If the police believe you have broken rules, or if you refuse to follow their instructions, they may issue you with a fine of Â£60 (reduced to Â£30 if paid within 14 days). If it's the second time you've received a fine, the amount will increase to Â£120 and double on each further repeat offence. The guidance says that ""the police will act with discretion and common sense in applying these measures"". Local authorities (such as trading standards officers) will be monitoring local businesses to make sure they also follow the rules. Those that don't comply will face the threat of fines, and of being closed down. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW GUIDANCE:What must I do? NEW RESTRICTIONS:What are they?

So how did day one of homeschooling go?Why is Olympic decision taking so long?,"With schools closed to the majority of pupils to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus, parents across the country have been asked to become instant homeschoolers. How have they coped with their first day of juggling timetables, curricula and coursework - all the while trying to get their own jobs done? âItâs about being flexibleâ âIâve kind of done a timetable but Iâm not sure how successful thatâs going to be â ask me in a few days,â says Bobbie Gordon in Nottingham. She and her husband - who work in marketing and IT respectively - are trying to be as flexible as possible as they combine work with their new role as homeschoolers to Imogen, 9, Lottie, 6, and four-year-old Hattie. How families can cope with self-isolating together The school of Mum and Dad How to help kids cope with life without school âWeâre just trying to tag-team it,â she says. âItâs about being flexible. Weâre just trying to be supportive of each other as well because it is quite difficult for everybody and weâve both got quite demanding jobs.â The curriculum involves some schoolwork along with things the parents are keen to share with their kids, whether itâs coding, cooking or teaching them how to use the washing machine. âItâs life skills stuff,â says Ms Gordon. âMaybe it will help them realise everything that we have to do!â It's been busy, round at the Gordons' So far on Monday morning, they have done some writing, planted some seeds in the vegetable patch and made soup together. Ms Gordon says sheâs also keen for her kids to keep in touch with friends by video chat, and the eldest has already organised a daily evening video call with her classmates. âItâs 16 very excitable nine-year-olds running round their houses and playing instruments and things,â she says. Day one has gone relatively smoothly, says Ms Gordon, with sunshine and a spacious garden playing their part. âI suspect in a few weeksâ time if itâs horrible, rainy weather and they canât get outside there will be harder days ahead,â she says. âKids want routine, stabilityâ For some parents, itâs been all about maintaining a routine. Joe Wicks, the fitness instructor and TV presenter, attracted more than 800,000 viewers to his YouTube Channel promising a daily 30-minute workout for kids to start the day. He told BBC Radio 5 Live he wanted to play a part in reassuring kids that âalthough this is a weird time, everything is going to be fine, itâs going to return to normal and weâll be reconnected againâ. Joe Wicks woke a nation In St Helens, Catherine Ormesher says her 11-year-old daughter Jessica is also benefitting from sticking to a routine, tackling her maths work on Monday morning just as her school timetable says. âIâm quite shocked actually,â says Ms Ormesher. She says her daughterâs school took âa massive weightâ off of parents by providing them with materials and log-ins for online learning. The school suggested that parents wake up their children at the normal time and begin work at 09:00 GMT. âThe kids have been sending WhatsApp messages to tell each other that theyâre starting their lessons now. Theyâre following the timetable and getting one another motivated,â says Ms Ormesher, who is a carer. âThey obviously want the routine and the stability.â Stability is key Ms Ormesher said the schoolâs music teacher started them off with a âwake and shakeâ â an early morning dance to get kids energised â before a morning of lessons. At her 11:00 break, Jessica asked Amazonâs Alexa to set a reminder for the start of lessons 20 minutes later. But her mum says that holding onto the routine may have a special importance for her, as she was in isolation before school closed, having returned from Spain with an illness. âOn Friday a little boy knocked on the door and left all her books and everything from school on our step. When we opened the door and I gave them to Jess, she just broke her heart crying because she hadnât got to say her goodbyes to her primary school,â she says. âWe focus on safety, love and fun' Educational psychologists â such as Zubeida Dasgupta, who is at home in Brighton with her three children â warn that being home for a prolonged period can be difficult and stressful for some children. Parents may also be stressed and worrying about the health of family members, their finances or food security, she says. So her approach has been to emphasise that home is not school and she is not a teacher. âWe have decided to focus on safety, love and fun, with a little bit of learning where the children are showing interest,â she says. One child is very motivated and organised, she says, working through tasks set by school, helping his younger sister and following his interests in skills such as coding. The others are getting more guidance in activities such as gardening or recording music on the computer. The youngest has volunteered to practise spelling and times tables. âI think we are all experiencing a feeling of loss of control at the moment, so doing activities where your children can be involved in planning and making decisions - and also succeeding - may help them feel a bit more in control,â Ms Dasgupta says. âIf we can support our children through this, it may well end up being a positive experience. They may develop some resilience and discover new found interests and skills.â A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate?

Why is Olympic decision taking so long?,"Could the sun be setting on the 2020 Olympic Games? Even the Olympics is not immune. It now seems almost certain that Tokyo 2020 will be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world. But as the IOC gives itself another four weeks to mull over a delay, what forces are at play behind the biggest peacetime decision world sport has ever seen? Why do they need so long to do what most now see as the only option? And what will the fallout be? On Tuesday afternoon, the British Olympic Association (BOA) will add their voice to those demanding a postponement, following an emergency conference call with UK Sport, performance directors, and representatives of TeamGB athletes. Even an actual withdrawal has not been ruled out, depending on the strength of feeling among participants. Ben Hawes, chair of the TeamGB athletes' commission, told BBC Sport he would present a ""strong viewpoint"" that postponement is the only course of action to take, for the health and wellbeing of athletes. Several National Olympic Committees (NOCs) from around the world have already requested a postponement, while Canada and Australia have gone further still by saying they will not send their athletes if it begins this year. IOC member Dick Poundsays postponement ""has been decided"", and it will most likely be until 2021, but told USA Today the ""parameters"" have not been finalised, and ""it will come in stages"". Both the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 organisers have tried to explain how they need time to consider the undoubted complexity of a delayed Olympics. On Monday, Tomahiko Taniguchi, special advisor to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet, told the BBC that the final solution rests with the IOC. He said that, given the complexities involved, ""Lausanne must take a few weeks examining scenarios [for a possible postponement] but it is not Tokyo's decision"". But there has been significant criticism from athletes, including 200m world champion Dina Asher-Smith, about potentially having to wait another four weeks, and Hawes told BBC Sport this timeframe ""does seem too long"". According to well-placed sources, we may now be witnessing a 'game of chicken' over who blinks first between the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 organisers, due to the commercial and legal ramifications that could follow such a decision. Top sports lawyer John Mehrzad QC explains that it will be crucial for litigation purposes who it is that effectively pulls the trigger, because whoever does could open themselves up to potential allegations of breach of the host-city contract. ""The party that 'cancels' or 'postpones' that agreement, unless mutually agreed by the other party, will put itself in breach of contract and expose itself to huge [billions of dollars] damages claims,"" he said. The recipient of any claim could point to the coronavirus pandemic being a ""force majeure"", or 'Act of God' - though Mehrzad points out that an insurer would be likely to say it must be impossible for the Games to be staged for such a case to stand. At present, there is no World Health Organization diktat saying that the Olympics cannot be staged. The IOC has the contractual right to cancel the Games on safety grounds, and is protected from any claims for damages by the host city in such an event. However, the host-city contract does not refer to postponements, and it is understood that the IOC would much rather it was Japan that ultimately took the decision. The boycotts from certain major NOCs could therefore play a key role in clearing this logjam, because not having the participation of Team Canada and the Australian delegation would make it an incomplete Games. The IOC and local organisers could say that this has meant it is no longer possible to proceed with the current schedule, and could provide some protection in the face of any legal cases and insurance claims from the multitude of commercial entities with contracts tied to the event, from broadcasters to sponsors. While a postponement may be inevitable, organising it will not be simple, and there has been some sympathy for the IOC's predicament as they seek a solution to an unprecedented challenge that is not of their making. Ricardo Fort, head of sponsorship at Coca Cola, one of the Olympics' key commercial partners, said: ""The IOC is taking the right steps to proper evaluate their options. Whatever decisions they make, it will be based on facts (and not on the pressure of any federation... no matter the federation or country.)"" Meanwhile, in Japan even though polls show a majority of people now expect a postponement, there will be fears that such a decision, no matter how understandable in the circumstances, will amount to a huge loss of face. After all, no Olympics has ever been rescheduled. The only cancelled Games have occurred in wartime. Both the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organisers have highlighted that postponing a Games that has a budget of Â£10.8bn ($12.6bn/1.35trillion yen) comes with ""many, many challenges"". In a statement, Tokyo 2020 said: ""As we seek to address this unique situation, close coordination with many partners, including the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the Government of Japan, Tokyo 2020 marketing partners, broadcasters, suppliers and contractors, will be essential."" The IOC, meanwhile, pointed out that there have been ""millions of nights"" booked in hotels, which may not be available for a rescheduled Games. There is also the question of whether the Athletes' Village and other key venues will still be available given pre-agreed deals with private occupiers, and the need to find tenants. Can Japan really afford for these venues to remain empty for another year? Will a new Athletes' Village need to be built? However, some within the Olympic movement fear that by appearing to many to be ponderous and out of touch with athletes' concerns, with each day that passes, significant damage is being done to the IOC's brand at a time when it is already concerned about attracting future host cities, and athletes feel left in limbo. After all, as recently as 4 March in Lausanne following an executive board meeting, Bach remarkably claimed the words 'postponement' and 'cancellation' had not even been mentioned during discussions. Given the relentless speed of the outbreak, that seemed at best naive and at worst downright negligent to some. Maybe Bach's hands were tied by Japanese partners loathe to even contemplate a change of plan. Almost certainly a Plan B was in fact being discussed but to many it gave the impression of a sports body in an ivory tower and in denial. And it may be that the IOC now has to dip into its significant reserves to help bail out the many international sports federations that depend on financial handouts thanks to the Â£5bn revenues generated from each Olympic cycle, and which now looks set to be delayed by a year. Some of these federations will have insurance to mitigate the impact of this shock. But others will not and could face a worrying future. Several athletes have been keen to stress that they are the key stakeholders in an Olympics and the previous messaging from the IOC to keep preparing as normal risked putting them and their families at risk. The competitor-led movement Global Athlete has called for a postponement, saying ""athletes do not have the ability to appropriately prepare for these Games and their health and safety must come first"". Before tomorrow's conference call, Hawes said: ""My hope is that we'll come out of tomorrow with a much clearer picture and a consistent picture across athlete feeling and sentiment as well as the sports, the BOA and UK Sport as an organisation. ""From what I've heard so far, everyone is pretty much in agreement with the fact that this now really starting to challenge athletes, both mentally and physically, and we need to have a solution. ""The solution won't come until the IOC makes the decision but the more pressure that can come on from the most critical stakeholders at this point, which is the athletes, the better. We will be going into it with a strong viewpoint which we have been talking to the BOA about for many weeks now."" When asked to clarify if the position from the Athletes' Commission was one in favour of a postponement, he said: ""Yes I believe that for the health and wellbeing of our athletes we have to have some clarity on a postponement, even if it that needs time to understand when that might be."" There is no clear consensus on when the Games should be moved to, mainly due to each sport having its own calendar to consider, and the continued uncertainty surrounding when the pandemic may ease. The example of the Euros being pushed back almost exactly a year could be followed, and currently appears the most likely. The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) telling its athletes to prepare for a 2021 Games could be particularly telling, given the AOC President John Coates is chair of the IOC's Coordination Commission for Tokyo. A 12-month delay of the Olympics would clash with the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, which are scheduled to run from 6-15 August 2021. World Athletics has already been in touch with the organisers, who have given assurances that they will look for alternative dates if that proves necessary. The Championships wouldn't necessarily need to be pushed back by a year - one option could be bringing it forward by a few months. Alternatively, the Games could be postponed to later in 2020, when it would be cooler. The Olympics have been held in autumn before, and the last Tokyo Olympics, in 1964, were held in October, and the Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committee told an IOC teleconference last week that rescheduling to October was ""practical and reasonable"". But it would then clash with the European football season and major US sports. And with US media giant NBC being one of the most important voices in these discussions, a delay of a year looks most likely. Amid the staggering collapse of the global sporting calendar in recent weeks, the Tokyo Games is the last to fall. But this is no mere sports championships. It is a multi-billion pound mega-event that, as we have seen repeatedly, places a huge economic strain on its hosts. This explains perhaps why there is currently something of a dance going on between those at the top table. Each party is waiting for the other to make the move, while also trying to figure out the safest, and least financially and reputationally damaging, solution. It may not take four weeks, though. With pressure mounting, do not be surprised if the plug is pulled much sooner.

They cut a lock on a metal unit before stealing eight oxygen and nitrous oxide canisters. The south Manchester hospital is not believed to be treating any coronavirus patients.

PM announces strict new curbs on life in UKBoris Johnson sets out tough restrictions aimed at tackling the spread of coronavirus.UK,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You must stay at home"" Strict new curbs on life in the UK to tackle the spread of coronavirus have been announced by the prime minister. People may only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when it is ""absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil any medical or care needs. Shops selling non-essential goods have been told to shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together will be prohibited. The UK death toll has reached 335. If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in atelevised statement from Downing Street. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Johnson said the country faced a ""moment of national emergency"" and staying at home was necessary to protect the NHS and save lives. He said the restrictions would be in place for at least three weeks and would be kept under constant review. The government guidance,externalsays people should only leave home for one of four reasons: Shopping for basic necessities such as food and medicine. Shopping trips should be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk, or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can continue to take their children to school Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Even when following the above guidance, people should minimise the amount of time spent out of their homes and should keep two metres (6ft) away from people they do not live with. The government is also stopping all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies - but funerals will be allowed. Businesses that will not need to close,externalinclude: Restaurants, cafes and work canteens - but only for food delivery and takeaway services Supermarkets and other premises selling food, including market stalls ""Health shops"" such as pharmacies Petrol stations, garages and car rental businesses Bicycle shops Home and hardware shops Launderettes and dry cleaners Pet shops Corner shops, newsagents and post offices Banks Other premises including libraries, non-essential shops, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship have been ordered to close. Parks will remain open for exercise but people are not allowed to gather in groups. Community centres can remain open but only for the purpose of ""hosting essential voluntary or public services"" such as food banks or service for homeless people, the guidance says. Hotels, hostels, campsites and caravan parks must also close unless key workers need to stay there, or if other people staying there cannot return to their primary residence. This video can not be played What is social distancing? Scientists have said each person with coronavirus infects 2.5 people and that takes about five days. This means, over a period of 30 days, more than 400 people will have been infected as a result of that one person. If a person halves their social exposure, that first infection leads to only 15 infections after 30 days. Several police forces said they were facing a high number of phone calls from members of the public seeking clarification on the new restrictions. Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley warned the public not to ""cripple"" his force's phone lines. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said they were working with the government and other agencies to work out how best to enforce the new rules. But Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said he was already seeing ""large amounts of sickness"" among officers across London and enforcing the new restrictions would be ""a real, real challenge"". ""We will be dealing with it, but I'm not sure we will have the resources to be able to see it through,"" he added. Home Secretary Priti Patel saidin a tweet,externalthat the next few weeks would be ""testing"" for police but that she would make sure officers had ""the resources they need to keep themselves and the public safe"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the new restrictions ""amount to a lockdown"" and are ""not done lightly"". ""I am not going to sugarcoat it in any way,"" she said. ""Coronavirus is the biggest challenge of our lifetime."" In a tweet,external, First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster urged people to follow the restrictions ""to save lives and protect our hospitals"". First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said ""these are really big changes for us all"". ""We are making them because of the speed the virus is continuing to spread,"" he added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the measures were ""the right response"". ""The government must close the loopholes to give security to all workers, including the self-employed, as well as renters and mortgage holders,"" he added. Five things that will now be banned All non-essential shops to close immediately Stay at home, first minister tells Wales This is a lockdown, says Scottish first minister 'Wave of deaths' in NI if social distancing not followed The prime minister said the measures were necessary to tackle ""the biggest threat this country has faced for decades"". ""Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won't be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,"" he said. ""And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. ""To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well."" It seems hard to overstate how huge an impact this will have on the country, and what a massive decision this is for the government to have taken - whose effect will last at least for a period of three weeks at the shortest, potentially for very much longer. Remember this though is not quite the kind of total crackdown we have seen in other countries - at least not yet. Despite tonight's enormous announcement, there are steps that other places have taken - curfews or total travel bans for example - that the UK is not pursuing. The government is not triggering the Civil Contingencies Act, designed for the most serious emergencies which gives ministers draconian powers. Not surprisingly, there is already therefore enormous controversy about whether the UK has been acting fast enough. Read more from Laura The prime minister said he knew the ""damage"" the restrictions were causing to people's lives, businesses and jobs but at present there were ""no easy options"". ""The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost,"" he said. However, Mr Johnson said there was ""a clear way through"", by strengthening the NHS with former clinicians returning to work, accelerating the search for treatments and a vaccine and buying millions of testing kits. This video can not be played Saturday was the ""busiest ever visitor day in living memory"" in Snowdonia, officials say A further 46 people have died in England since Sunday - aged between 47 and 105 and all with underlying health conditions - while there were four deaths in Scotland and four in Wales. There have been 83,945 tests to date, with 6,650 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britons travelling abroad should return to the UK as soon as possible because international travel is becoming more difficult with the closure of borders and the suspension of flights.

PM announces strict new curbs on life in UKBoris Johnson sets out tough restrictions aimed at tackling the spread of coronavirus.,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You must stay at home"" Strict new curbs on life in the UK to tackle the spread of coronavirus have been announced by the prime minister. People may only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when it is ""absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil any medical or care needs. Shops selling non-essential goods have been told to shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together will be prohibited. The UK death toll has reached 335. If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in atelevised statement from Downing Street. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Johnson said the country faced a ""moment of national emergency"" and staying at home was necessary to protect the NHS and save lives. He said the restrictions would be in place for at least three weeks and would be kept under constant review. The government guidance,externalsays people should only leave home for one of four reasons: Shopping for basic necessities such as food and medicine. Shopping trips should be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk, or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can continue to take their children to school Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Even when following the above guidance, people should minimise the amount of time spent out of their homes and should keep two metres (6ft) away from people they do not live with. The government is also stopping all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies - but funerals will be allowed. Businesses that will not need to close,externalinclude: Restaurants, cafes and work canteens - but only for food delivery and takeaway services Supermarkets and other premises selling food, including market stalls ""Health shops"" such as pharmacies Petrol stations, garages and car rental businesses Bicycle shops Home and hardware shops Launderettes and dry cleaners Pet shops Corner shops, newsagents and post offices Banks Other premises including libraries, non-essential shops, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship have been ordered to close. Parks will remain open for exercise but people are not allowed to gather in groups. Community centres can remain open but only for the purpose of ""hosting essential voluntary or public services"" such as food banks or service for homeless people, the guidance says. Hotels, hostels, campsites and caravan parks must also close unless key workers need to stay there, or if other people staying there cannot return to their primary residence. This video can not be played What is social distancing? Scientists have said each person with coronavirus infects 2.5 people and that takes about five days. This means, over a period of 30 days, more than 400 people will have been infected as a result of that one person. If a person halves their social exposure, that first infection leads to only 15 infections after 30 days. Several police forces said they were facing a high number of phone calls from members of the public seeking clarification on the new restrictions. Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley warned the public not to ""cripple"" his force's phone lines. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said they were working with the government and other agencies to work out how best to enforce the new rules. But Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said he was already seeing ""large amounts of sickness"" among officers across London and enforcing the new restrictions would be ""a real, real challenge"". ""We will be dealing with it, but I'm not sure we will have the resources to be able to see it through,"" he added. Home Secretary Priti Patel saidin a tweet,externalthat the next few weeks would be ""testing"" for police but that she would make sure officers had ""the resources they need to keep themselves and the public safe"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the new restrictions ""amount to a lockdown"" and are ""not done lightly"". ""I am not going to sugarcoat it in any way,"" she said. ""Coronavirus is the biggest challenge of our lifetime."" In a tweet,external, First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster urged people to follow the restrictions ""to save lives and protect our hospitals"". First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said ""these are really big changes for us all"". ""We are making them because of the speed the virus is continuing to spread,"" he added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the measures were ""the right response"". ""The government must close the loopholes to give security to all workers, including the self-employed, as well as renters and mortgage holders,"" he added. Five things that will now be banned All non-essential shops to close immediately Stay at home, first minister tells Wales This is a lockdown, says Scottish first minister 'Wave of deaths' in NI if social distancing not followed The prime minister said the measures were necessary to tackle ""the biggest threat this country has faced for decades"". ""Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won't be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,"" he said. ""And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. ""To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well."" It seems hard to overstate how huge an impact this will have on the country, and what a massive decision this is for the government to have taken - whose effect will last at least for a period of three weeks at the shortest, potentially for very much longer. Remember this though is not quite the kind of total crackdown we have seen in other countries - at least not yet. Despite tonight's enormous announcement, there are steps that other places have taken - curfews or total travel bans for example - that the UK is not pursuing. The government is not triggering the Civil Contingencies Act, designed for the most serious emergencies which gives ministers draconian powers. Not surprisingly, there is already therefore enormous controversy about whether the UK has been acting fast enough. Read more from Laura The prime minister said he knew the ""damage"" the restrictions were causing to people's lives, businesses and jobs but at present there were ""no easy options"". ""The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost,"" he said. However, Mr Johnson said there was ""a clear way through"", by strengthening the NHS with former clinicians returning to work, accelerating the search for treatments and a vaccine and buying millions of testing kits. This video can not be played Saturday was the ""busiest ever visitor day in living memory"" in Snowdonia, officials say A further 46 people have died in England since Sunday - aged between 47 and 105 and all with underlying health conditions - while there were four deaths in Scotland and four in Wales. There have been 83,945 tests to date, with 6,650 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britons travelling abroad should return to the UK as soon as possible because international travel is becoming more difficult with the closure of borders and the suspension of flights.

The UK has been under growing pressure to follow other countries by ordering the closure of more shops, and enforcing rules on social distancing. The PM will make a statement at 20:30 GMT. Meanwhile, people in the most at-risk groups have begun getting an NHS text urging them to stay at home for 12 weeks. The UK's death toll has reached 335. A further 46 people have died in England since Sunday - aged between 47 and 105 and all with underlying health conditions - while there were four deaths in Scotland and four in Wales. There have been 83,945 tests to date, with 6,650 confirmed cases. TheNHS in England has announcedit has identified 1.5 million of the most at-risk people, while there are 200,000 in Scotland, 70,000 in Wales and 40,000 in Northern Ireland.

This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""Incredibly unfair to socialise"" ""It's very selfish,"" he told the Today programme. ""The NHS is doing everything it can and preparing for the spread of this virus. ""If people go within two metres of others who they don't live with then they're helping to spread the virus - and the consequences of that costs lives and it means that, for everyone, this will go on for longer."" Tube drivers furious at crowded carriages Coronavirus deaths in Scotland increase to 14 Seven more deaths in Wales NI's health service is to access private sector beds The health secretary said the government advice on social distancing was ""really clear"" and people should stay two metres apart, staying at home if at all possible. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the government is considering closing all non-essential retail stores and introducing fines for people who ignore the current coronavirus advice. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stressed that everyone should stay at home if possible,adding that ""life should not be carrying on as normal right now"" and that shops not providing essential items should shut. Labour has called on the government to increase lockdown measures to keep people safe. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Other countries across the world have taken further far-reaching social distancing measures."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said companies should not pressure people, who are not key workers, to travel into work. The warning followed crowded scenes on parts of the London Underground during Monday morning's rush hour following a reduction in the number of services in response to the outbreak. This video can not be played What is social distancing? Paul Whiteman, head of school leaders' union the NAHT, said schools are struggling with staff numbers due to the coronavirus outbreak. ""My appeal to the families of key workers is: this is not business as usual. Keep your family at home if at all possible,"" he said. The government has said it is setting up ""hubs"" around the country to arrange deliveries of groceries and medicines to people with specific cancers, severe respiratory conditions and people who have received organ transplants. Councils, pharmacists and members of the Armed Forces will help and there will be opportunities for members of the public to volunteer. The Excel conference centre in east London could potentially be used in the medical response to the outbreak, the Ministry of Defence said. A team of military planners has visited the site to determine how it might ""benefit"" the NHS. The MoD said 250 personnel from its 20,000-strong Covid Support Force are beginning duties - including being trained to drive oxygen tankers and distributing protective equipment for the NHS. Underthe emergency legislation,externalairports could shut and police would be able to force people with virus symptoms to isolate. The proposals -set out last week- also include enabling recently retired NHS staff to return to work without any negative impact on their pensions; fast-tracking funeral arrangements; and allowing more court hearings to take place by phone or video. The powers would have to be renewed every six months. The government is also taking steps to address tax and pensions disincentives that could prevent retired police officers rejoining the service during the outbreak, Home Secretary Priti Patel said. But, speaking in the Commons, she rejected calls for a police presence inside supermarkets, amid incidents of panic-buying, This video can not be played Saturday was the ""busiest ever visitor day in living memory"" in Snowdonia, officials say Downing Street has said Boris Johnson would be prepared to take further actions if stricter measures were needed to enforce social distancing. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Our message is clear, people should stay at home if possible. ""This will save lives, protect the vulnerable and support the NHS."" He said ministers will be looking at data on how much social interaction was continuing and if the information shows it has not stopped then the government would ""need to take further measures"".

We're going to keep bringing you all the latest updates from around the world but as the new day starts in the UK our London colleagues will join us and we'll be posting the lateston this page here. Please do follow us there. As a goodbye from us here's a reminder of where to find the most accurate and up-to-date information on how to protect yourself and your loved ones in these uncertain times.  As uncertainty over the future of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics continues Japanese media are now reporting that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will hold a phone call with Thomas Bach, head of the International Olympic Committee, at 8pm local time, 11GMT. There's been mounting criticism over the IOC and Japan's insistence the Games will go ahead. Many athletes and a number of national Olympic committees say it's impossible to train for the event and that it's extremely unlikely that the global pandemic will be under control by 24 July, the scheduled kick-off date for the Games. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and US Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin say they have not yet reached a deal on a  $2 trillion (Â£1.7tn) coronavirus economic stimulus package, but progress has been made. Mr Schumer said a vote on the deal in the US Senate could take place as early as Tuesday. Democrats in the Republican-controlled chamber have complained that the package does not contain enough funding for states and hospitals. They also want more restrictions on a fund to help large businesses. On the first day of a country-wide lockdown in India, hundreds were held for violating the curfew - and the police dealt out some fairly unusual forms of punishment in some states. Local media reports showed videos of police in Punjab and Maharashtra punishingmen who broke the curfew by forcing them to do push-ups,external. In Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh,police also took to shaming people on social media,external- they posted photos of the alleged violators, saying âthey were against society as they will not stay at homeâ, reported the Hindustan Times. Elsewhere,officials seized vehicles,externalafter questioning people where they were going to determine if it was essential for them to be outside their home. States have also been asked to take legal action if necessary as many have imposed a colonial-era law that prohibits four or more people gathering. Checks and fines are expected to increase on Tuesday as more cities and states go into lockdown to fight the spread of Covid-19 - India has reported 446 active cases, and nine deaths so far.  We have important panda news to lighten your mood. After 58 days of keeping visitors away, the Beijing Zoo reopened on Monday. According to state media, the animals have been faring well during the virus lockdown, some of them seem to have enjoyed the quiet. ""Some of the animals, such as the pandas, preferred to have more exercise when the zoo was empty,"" the China Daily cites zoo director Zhang Chenglin. He also says the area is still being disinfected on a regular basis. For those who can't come down in person to see the animals, the zoo also has online tours where you can watch the animals being fed - or the enclosures being disinfected. The Association of Asian Pacific Airlines (AAPA) has said its members need state support immediately as they face upwards of a $60bn revenue shortfall due to the coronavirus pandemic. âThe magnitude is beyond
belief. Itâs unimaginable,â APAA Director General Andrew Herdman told the BBC. The trade group's member airlines include Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific among others. He added that although carriers were cutting costs by slashing schedules, which saves on expenses like fuel, they continue to shoulder major overheads: ""Weâre still left with fixed costs including staff. The tough thing is that for a lot of staff, thereâs no work for them to do.â The AAPA is calling for government action in the form of deferred tax payments and extensions of interest-free loans to improve cash flow. âThe big focus is protecting the workforce. The airlines will need them once again once thereâs a recovery. But when that will be, nobody knows,â Mr Herman concluded. The gambling hub of Macau will ban all visitors from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan who have travelled overseas in the past 14 days, said a Reuters report quoting its leader Ho Iat Seng. It comes a week after it banned all foreign visitors from entering the region. There are 25 confirmed cases of the virus in Macau - a once bustling casino hub which has now fallen silent amid virus fears. Macau's once bustling casinos are now silent Crime gangs in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro are reported to have ordered curfews to combat coronavirus, saying they are taking action because the government refuses to. Residents of several favelas (shanty towns) say they have received social media messages ordering people off the streets overnight. ""We want the best for the population. If the government doesn't have the capacity to do something [about coronavirus], then organised crime will sort it out,"" said one message reported by the G1 news website. President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticised for his lacklustre response to the outbreak, prompting protests in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio. Simon AtkinsonBBC News, Sydney For the past couple of hours Iâve been talking to Brits stuck in Australia and New Zealand. Several of them are health workers desperate to get back home to help out. For others, they have older relatives who they want to be near. And then there are the young travellers on working holiday visas who are losing their casual jobs and worry about being stuck far from home with no money and no support. For many whoâd already booked to get back, flights booked with airlines such as Emirates and Etihad are no longer flying. Planes going straight to the UK are few and far between and, of course, sold out. The general feeling is helplessness. Being passed around by airlines and travel agents while struggling to get information from the British government. Everyone understands this is a global crisis. Nobody expects an easy answer. But the frustration seems to stem from being told get home as soon as possible â but finding it very hard to work out how to do that. Iâm told the British High Commission here in Australia will have some information soon. Weâll share that as soon as we get it. Busy morning here in Singapore - where most of us are writing this live page from home - catching up on some major developments overnight. TheUKhas told people to stay home, and we're checking in with our colleagues in London on how they and their families might be affected. TheUSreported more than 100 deaths in a single day and theWHOhas warned that the pandemic is ""accelerating"". Here are some updates from closer to home: The 23 de Enero neighbourhood in Caracas has limited water supplies There are major concerns over how Venezuela could deal with a coronavirus outbreak, as the South American country has long been in economic crisis, with regular food and medicine shortages. The lockdown began on 17 March. All borders are shut and there are no flights in or out. People are only permitted to leave their house to buy food or medicines or attend medical appointments. They must wear a mask and, from Sunday, they also need to wear gloves. William Bello, a concierge in his 50s from Caracas, told the BBCâs Guillermo Olmo about his concerns. Mr Bello lives in the 23 de Enero neighbourhood, which is working class and largely pro-government. âPeople are very worried about the disease, so they are respecting the quarantine, but many street traders need to go out and sell stuff if they want something to eat. Police are everywhere and are ordering people to go home when they catch them.â He typically gets running water only twice a week. This needs to be stored in containers and boiled before drinking. âWith the water that we have, weâre trying to follow the recommendations and wash our hands frequently."" Amazon is teaming up with researchers funded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to pick up and deliver coronavirus test kits. The Gates Foundation-backed Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) is learning how the infection spreads. It involves collecting nasal swabs to track the virus among residents of Seattle's King County in Washington. Amazon Care, the retail giant's employee medical care arm, is now helping with deliveries of the kits. King County is one of the places hardest hit by the outbreak in the US. Read more here Online retail giant Amazon and Microsoft's Bill Gates are working together to track the outbreak's spread. Frances MaoSydney As we mentioned earlier, one woman has died and over 50 cases have now been traced back to the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which docked in Sydney last Thursday. Around 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark then, despite authorities knowing that some on board were feeling unwell. However this wasn't relayed to passengers, and by the time the first cases were revealed on Friday, some of those on board were half-way around the round. Just how did Australian authorities get it so wrong in this instance?Read my full report into the debacle. I spoke to one passenger, Elisa McCafferty, who has returned home to London with her husband but fears they both have the virus now. ""They shouldn't have let us disembark,"" she told me this morning. Passengers Elisa McCafferty and her husband are furious over the mishandling of the ship's return to Sydney With domestic transmissions very low, China is focussing on people from overseas bringing the virus into the country. The city of Beijing has now tightened its rules on international arrivals even further, state media report. Anyone entering the city from abroad will go into mandatory centralised quarantine for 14 days and will have to be tested for the coronavirus. The report in the China Daily cited by Reuters also says that whoever enters the city from the rest of China and has travelled from overseas in the past two weeks will also have to be tested and quarantined. China is where the global pandemic started and nearly 3,300 people have died from it there. Asian stocks have jumped after the US central bank rolled out a new plan to ease the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In its latest emergency measure, the Federal Reserve said it would buy unlimited amounts of assets to steady markets. However, a US government bailout bill worth almost $2 trillion being debated in Congress has failed to advance for a second time, as Democrats said proposed financial relief for industries such as airlines would not do enough to help workers. In morning tradingJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was the 6.5% higher, the Hang Seng inHong Konggained 4%, andChina's Shanghai Composite was up by 1.7%. The US Embassy in Peru says it is working to bring its citizens home, after the South American country enforced a nationwide lockdown stranding thousands of people. No flights are allowed to enter or leave the country without government permission. The Charge d'Affaires Denison Offutt said the embassy was ""actively coordinating with Peru on official repatriation flights for US citizens"". Mr Offutt says there are 5,000 US citizens currently in Peru - though he doesn't say how many are tourists or residents. The comments section of the video however, are filled with comments by people claiming to be stranded US citizens in Peru. ""We are 12 family members stranded,"" says one comment. ""I'm still waiting in Magdalena Del Mar - please help us,"" another says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A female  passenger in her 70s who caught the virus on a cruise ship which docked in Sydney last Thursday has died in hospital this morning, health officials say. She was one of the first three cases confirmed on the ship last Friday, and had been taken to hospital immediately after disembarking. About 2,700 passengers were allowed off the ship last week, with many flying overseas, not knowing there were confirmed virus cases on board. This has sparked huge public criticism. We know that many people are contracting the coronavirus around the world, but establishing a death rate is no simple task. The World Health Organization says about 3.4% of all cases have resulted in deaths, but scientists estimate that the death rate is actually much lower because many cases have mild symptoms and are not reported. The rate of fatalities also depends on a range of factors including age, sex, pre-existing conditions and the health system you are in. From the evidence available, we know that some groups of people are more likely to die if they contract the virus - the elderly, the unwell and, maybe, men. Find out more about the difficulty in calculating death rates and the groups most at risk. Cuba has now closed its doors to all tourists, and those that are already in the country will have to go into quarantine. There were on Monday around 32,500 overseas tourists in Cuba - of which 9,400 were staying in homestays. The government says they will be moved to state-run hotels to complete their quarantine, according to Reuters, They won't be let out of quarantine until they find a flight home - though many flights have already been cancelled. - so its likely many will find themselves stranded. Cubans themselves also cannot leave the island without authorisation. There are currently 40 confirmed cases in Cuba.  Holidaymakers scrambled to get out of Cuba Â© 2025 BBC.

PM to address nation on new coronavirus measures,"Crowds were out in the UK's parks on a sunny weekend Boris Johnson is to address the UK on new measures to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, amid concerns people have been ignoring government advice. The UK has been under growing pressure to follow other countries by ordering the closure of more shops, and enforcing rules on social distancing. The PM will make a statement at 20:30 GMT. Meanwhile, people in the most at-risk groups have begun getting an NHS text urging them to stay at home for 12 weeks. The UK's death toll has reached 335. A further 46 people have died in England since Sunday - aged between 47 and 105 and all with underlying health conditions - while there were four deaths in Scotland and four in Wales. There have been 83,945 tests to date, with 6,650 confirmed cases. TheNHS in England has announcedit has identified 1.5 million of the most at-risk people, while there are 200,000 in Scotland, 70,000 in Wales and 40,000 in Northern Ireland. A text message from NHS England tells people in themost at-risk group:,external""Please remain at home for a minimum of 12 weeks. Home is the safest place for you. Staying in helps you stay well and that will help the NHS too."" The government's emergency committee Cobra has met andemergency legislationintroducing measures to respond to the outbreak has cleared its first Commons hurdle with MPs giving it an unopposed second reading. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says Britons travelling abroad should return to the UK as soon as possible because international travel is becoming more difficult with the closure of borders and the suspension of flights. Elsewhere, theBritish Olympic Association said Great Britain will not send a team to Tokyo 2020if the spread of coronavirus continues as predicted. The International Olympic Committee has given itself four weeks to decide on the future of the Games, but Australia and Canada have already announced they will not compete this summer. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Hancock said he didn't know why some people were ignoring the government's advice. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""Incredibly unfair to socialise"" ""It's very selfish,"" he told the Today programme. ""The NHS is doing everything it can and preparing for the spread of this virus. ""If people go within two metres of others who they don't live with then they're helping to spread the virus - and the consequences of that costs lives and it means that, for everyone, this will go on for longer."" Tube drivers furious at crowded carriages Coronavirus deaths in Scotland increase to 14 Seven more deaths in Wales NI's health service is to access private sector beds The health secretary said the government advice on social distancing was ""really clear"" and people should stay two metres apart, staying at home if at all possible. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the government is considering closing all non-essential retail stores and introducing fines for people who ignore the current coronavirus advice. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stressed that everyone should stay at home if possible,adding that ""life should not be carrying on as normal right now"" and that shops not providing essential items should shut. Labour has called on the government to increase lockdown measures to keep people safe. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Other countries across the world have taken further far-reaching social distancing measures."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said companies should not pressure people, who are not key workers, to travel into work. The warning followed crowded scenes on parts of the London Underground during Monday morning's rush hour following a reduction in the number of services in response to the outbreak. This video can not be played What is social distancing? Paul Whiteman, head of school leaders' union the NAHT, said schools are struggling with staff numbers due to the coronavirus outbreak. ""My appeal to the families of key workers is: this is not business as usual. Keep your family at home if at all possible,"" he said. The government has said it is setting up ""hubs"" around the country to arrange deliveries of groceries and medicines to people with specific cancers, severe respiratory conditions and people who have received organ transplants. Councils, pharmacists and members of the Armed Forces will help and there will be opportunities for members of the public to volunteer. The Excel conference centre in east London could potentially be used in the medical response to the outbreak, the Ministry of Defence said. A team of military planners has visited the site to determine how it might ""benefit"" the NHS. The MoD said 250 personnel from its 20,000-strong Covid Support Force are beginning duties - including being trained to drive oxygen tankers and distributing protective equipment for the NHS. Underthe emergency legislation,externalairports could shut and police would be able to force people with virus symptoms to isolate. The proposals -set out last week- also include enabling recently retired NHS staff to return to work without any negative impact on their pensions; fast-tracking funeral arrangements; and allowing more court hearings to take place by phone or video. The powers would have to be renewed every six months. The government is also taking steps to address tax and pensions disincentives that could prevent retired police officers rejoining the service during the outbreak, Home Secretary Priti Patel said. But, speaking in the Commons, she rejected calls for a police presence inside supermarkets, amid incidents of panic-buying, This video can not be played Saturday was the ""busiest ever visitor day in living memory"" in Snowdonia, officials say Downing Street has said Boris Johnson would be prepared to take further actions if stricter measures were needed to enforce social distancing. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Our message is clear, people should stay at home if possible. ""This will save lives, protect the vulnerable and support the NHS."" He said ministers will be looking at data on how much social interaction was continuing and if the information shows it has not stopped then the government would ""need to take further measures"". The spokesman would not say whether extra controls could be brought in as early as today. He added Tuesday's cabinet meeting will see a ""very significant"" number of ministers taking part remotely.

"PM to address nation on new coronavirus measuresThe prime minister is to address the UK, as the NHS texts at-risk patients telling them to stay at home.","Crowds were out in the UK's parks on a sunny weekend Boris Johnson is to address the UK on new measures to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, amid concerns people have been ignoring government advice. The UK has been under growing pressure to follow other countries by ordering the closure of more shops, and enforcing rules on social distancing. The PM will make a statement at 20:30 GMT. Meanwhile, people in the most at-risk groups have begun getting an NHS text urging them to stay at home for 12 weeks. The UK's death toll has reached 335. A further 46 people have died in England since Sunday - aged between 47 and 105 and all with underlying health conditions - while there were four deaths in Scotland and four in Wales. There have been 83,945 tests to date, with 6,650 confirmed cases. TheNHS in England has announcedit has identified 1.5 million of the most at-risk people, while there are 200,000 in Scotland, 70,000 in Wales and 40,000 in Northern Ireland. A text message from NHS England tells people in themost at-risk group:,external""Please remain at home for a minimum of 12 weeks. Home is the safest place for you. Staying in helps you stay well and that will help the NHS too."" The government's emergency committee Cobra has met andemergency legislationintroducing measures to respond to the outbreak has cleared its first Commons hurdle with MPs giving it an unopposed second reading. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says Britons travelling abroad should return to the UK as soon as possible because international travel is becoming more difficult with the closure of borders and the suspension of flights. Elsewhere, theBritish Olympic Association said Great Britain will not send a team to Tokyo 2020if the spread of coronavirus continues as predicted. The International Olympic Committee has given itself four weeks to decide on the future of the Games, but Australia and Canada have already announced they will not compete this summer. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Hancock said he didn't know why some people were ignoring the government's advice. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""Incredibly unfair to socialise"" ""It's very selfish,"" he told the Today programme. ""The NHS is doing everything it can and preparing for the spread of this virus. ""If people go within two metres of others who they don't live with then they're helping to spread the virus - and the consequences of that costs lives and it means that, for everyone, this will go on for longer."" Tube drivers furious at crowded carriages Coronavirus deaths in Scotland increase to 14 Seven more deaths in Wales NI's health service is to access private sector beds The health secretary said the government advice on social distancing was ""really clear"" and people should stay two metres apart, staying at home if at all possible. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the government is considering closing all non-essential retail stores and introducing fines for people who ignore the current coronavirus advice. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stressed that everyone should stay at home if possible,adding that ""life should not be carrying on as normal right now"" and that shops not providing essential items should shut. Labour has called on the government to increase lockdown measures to keep people safe. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Other countries across the world have taken further far-reaching social distancing measures."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said companies should not pressure people, who are not key workers, to travel into work. The warning followed crowded scenes on parts of the London Underground during Monday morning's rush hour following a reduction in the number of services in response to the outbreak. This video can not be played What is social distancing? Paul Whiteman, head of school leaders' union the NAHT, said schools are struggling with staff numbers due to the coronavirus outbreak. ""My appeal to the families of key workers is: this is not business as usual. Keep your family at home if at all possible,"" he said. The government has said it is setting up ""hubs"" around the country to arrange deliveries of groceries and medicines to people with specific cancers, severe respiratory conditions and people who have received organ transplants. Councils, pharmacists and members of the Armed Forces will help and there will be opportunities for members of the public to volunteer. The Excel conference centre in east London could potentially be used in the medical response to the outbreak, the Ministry of Defence said. A team of military planners has visited the site to determine how it might ""benefit"" the NHS. The MoD said 250 personnel from its 20,000-strong Covid Support Force are beginning duties - including being trained to drive oxygen tankers and distributing protective equipment for the NHS. Underthe emergency legislation,externalairports could shut and police would be able to force people with virus symptoms to isolate. The proposals -set out last week- also include enabling recently retired NHS staff to return to work without any negative impact on their pensions; fast-tracking funeral arrangements; and allowing more court hearings to take place by phone or video. The powers would have to be renewed every six months. The government is also taking steps to address tax and pensions disincentives that could prevent retired police officers rejoining the service during the outbreak, Home Secretary Priti Patel said. But, speaking in the Commons, she rejected calls for a police presence inside supermarkets, amid incidents of panic-buying, This video can not be played Saturday was the ""busiest ever visitor day in living memory"" in Snowdonia, officials say Downing Street has said Boris Johnson would be prepared to take further actions if stricter measures were needed to enforce social distancing. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Our message is clear, people should stay at home if possible. ""This will save lives, protect the vulnerable and support the NHS."" He said ministers will be looking at data on how much social interaction was continuing and if the information shows it has not stopped then the government would ""need to take further measures"". The spokesman would not say whether extra controls could be brought in as early as today. He added Tuesday's cabinet meeting will see a ""very significant"" number of ministers taking part remotely.

Commuters to get refund on rail season ticketsThe government is refunding the cost of season tickets for workers staying at home over virus fears.,"Commuters with rail season tickets will receive a refund if they choose to stay at home during the coronavirus outbreak, the government has promised. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would ""ensure no-one is unfairly out of pocket for doing the right thing"". The refund is part of a package of measures to support train companies. There has been a 70% drop in passenger numbers and ticket sales have dropped by two-thirds, the Department for Transport (DfT) said. As a result, the firms responsible for keeping the trains running are facing ""significant drops"" in their income, the government said. The number of services they runhas also been cut. To stop those firms from going under, the DfT has suspended all rail franchise agreements, which govern things such as how many trains run each hour and and restrict how much the companies that run them can charge for tickets. Under these contracts, the train operators are generally required to make payments to the government to run services on parts of the rail network. However, DfT has now suspended these agreements for six months. Instead, all the money from fares will be paid to the government, which will also take on the financial risk of running the network, to save firms from going under as a result of the slump in demand. However, the train operators will continue to run the services ""for a small predetermined management fee"", the DfT said. In reality this was the government's only option. The annual cost of running all of the UK's trains is around Â£12bn. With passenger numbers plummeting and ticket revenue plunging with it, the government had to step in to plug the gap. A lot of taxpayer cash already goes into the railways, but over the next six months an additional injection of several billion pounds might be needed so that the network can still operate. Sadly, the reduction in the number of train services running doesn't save much money. The train companies have other high fixed costs such as staffing and the price of leasing trains. This temporary emergency rail system that we'll soon have is more akin to a nationalised model. Private companies will run the trains but the government underwrites it all and, during this exceptional time, carries the losses. We still can't rule out the possibility that once the details of each deal are worked out, a train company or two pulls out. In that situation, the franchises affected would have to be nationalised. ""This will allow us to ensure that trains necessary for key workers and essential travel continue to operate,"" the DfT said in a statement. However, it warned: ""No other passengers should travel."" Mr Shapps said: ""We are taking this action to protect the key workers who depend on our railways to carry on their vital roles, the hardworking commuters who have radically altered their lives to combat the spread of coronavirus, and the frontline rail staff who are keeping the country moving."" The move was welcomed by the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail. ""The rail industry is working together so that people and goods can keep making essential journeys during this unprecedented national challenge, getting key workers to hospitals, food to shops and fuel to power stations,"" said Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group. ""While we need to finalise the details, this will ensure that train companies can focus all their efforts on delivering a vital service at a time of national need.""

Hancock admits âchallengesâ over NHS equipment,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock says ""millions of masks"" have been ordered for NHS staff The health secretary has acknowledged there have been ""challenges"" with the supply of personal protective equipment to NHS staff in England - but added he is determined to rise to them. Last week, NHS staffsaid the lack of protective gear was putting them at riskduring the coronavirus outbreak. Matt Hancock said a million face masks had been bought over the weekend and he was taking the issue ""very seriously"". From this week, the Army will play a part in helping to distribute supplies. ""I am determined to ensure that the right kit gets to the right hospital, the right ambulance service, the right doctors' surgery, right across the country,"" said Mr Hancock. ""There have been challenges and I can see that. We're on it and trying to solve all the problems."" NHS staff 'at risk' over lack of protective gear Tougher measures warning if virus advice ignored MPs to debate emergency coronavirus powers He added that, since last week, millions of items, including face masks, had been shipped to NHS staff across the country. Health workers have previously warned that a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) - combined with a lack of coronavirus testing for them - meant they were at increased risk of getting the virus and passing it on to patients. The Doctors Association, a lobbying group, said its members were overwhelmingly concerned that patients were being put at risk and that NHS staff could lose their lives. Its chairman said doctors had told him they felt like ""lambs to the slaughter"". And NHS Providers, which represents health trusts in England, said there had been local shortages which were fuelling anxiety over staff safety. While there were signs of significant increases in distribution, further rapid improvement was required, it said. Mr Hancock said the government had shipped 2.6 million masks over a 24-hour period, and had stocks of equipment it was trying to get to the ""right people"". The health secretary also insisted the equipment met World Health Organization guidelines. ""I take very seriously my responsibility, as secretary of state, to make sure that everybody working in the NHS, across social care, is safe, and for that they need the right equipment,"" he added. NHS England said the army would ""play its part"" from this week, offering personnel to ""help to manage and offload supplies in busy NHS settings"" and distributing PPE supplies. Emily Lawson, chief commercial officer for the NHS, said the health service needed a ""massively increased, urgent volume"" of supplies. ""Working with our partners, we are now seeing much increased capacity, and a more responsive supply chain to help take us through the coronavirus outbreak. We are extremely grateful for the army's support in doing so."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak According to the latest figures, the UK's death toll has reached 281 - including a person aged 18 with an underlying health condition - and there are 5,683 confirmed cases. MPs arepreparing to debate emergency legislationthat would grant powers aimed at tackling the spread of the virus later. Under the proposals, airports could shut and police would be able to force people with virus symptoms to isolate. The powers, which would be time-limited for two years, are expected to be approved by MPs. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonpreviously warned that new, stricter measurescould be introduced in order to tackle the pandemic. Over the weekend, photos emerged showing crowds of people visiting parks and open spaces across parts of the UK. The government has urged people to ""avoid travelling unless it is essential"". Essential travel, the Department for Health and Social Care said, ""does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays"". The number of worldwide cases of coronavirus has passed 300,000 - with more than 13,000 deaths around the world. New Zealand has said it would begin shutdown of non-essential services this week, while Australia has already seen a widespread closure of pubs, clubs, gyms and places of worship. Pressure is also growing on Japan and the International Olympic Committee to cancel or postpone the 2020 games which are due to take place in July.

He told the BBC it was ""wishful thinking"" to believe that countries would bounce back quickly. The OECD has called on governments to rip up spending rules to ensure speedy testing and treatment of the virus. Mr GurrÃ­a said a recent warning that aserious outbreak could halve global growth to 1.5%already looked too optimistic. While the number of job losses and company failures remains uncertain, Mr GurrÃ­a said countries would be dealing with the economic fallout ""for years to come"". He said many of the world's biggest economies would fall into recession in the coming months - defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. ""Even if you don't get a worldwide recession, you're going to get either no growth or negative growth in many of the economies of the world, including some of the larger ones, and therefore you're going to get not only low growth this year, but also it's going to take longer to pick up in the in the future,"" he added. Mr GurrÃ­a said the economic uncertainty created by the virus outbreak meant economies were already suffering a bigger shock than during the September 11 terror attacks or the 2008 financial crisis. He said: ""And the reason is that we don't know how much it's going to take to fix the unemployment because we don't know how many people are going to end up unemployed. We also don't know how much it's going to take to fix the hundreds of thousands of small and medium enterprises who are already suffering.""

Mr GurrÃ­a called on governments to rip up borrowing rules and ""throw everything we got at it"" to deal with the crisis. However, he warned that bigger deficits and larger debt piles would also weigh on heavily indebted countries for years to come. Mr GurrÃ­a said that just weeks ago, policymakers from the G20 club of rich nations believed the recovery would take a 'V' shape - with a short, sharp drop in economic activity followed swiftly by a rebound in growth. ""It was already then mostly wishful thinking,"" he said. ""I do not agree with the idea of a 'V' shaped phenomenon ... Right now we know it's not going to be a 'V'.

Parents urged not to send children to school,"For most children the school day is now at home and online Parents have heeded warnings not to send children into school unless it was a last resort, say head teachers. Schools in the UK have closed to reduce the spread of coronavirus - and are only open to look after the children of ""key workers"" and vulnerable children. Early snapshot surveys suggested schools had between 1% and 20% of pupils attending. The Department for Education welcomed that numbers in school were ""low"" and that parents had kept children at home. There had been fears too many pupils would turn up and that schools with depleted numbers of teachers would struggle to cope. But Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the numbers at school appeared to be ""manageable"". He said parents appeared to have ""heeded calls to use the emergency provision in schools only in the event that they are key workers who have no option available to keep their children at home"". Parents in Wales urged to keep children out of school School only a 'last resort' parents told in Northern Ireland Latest as nations struggle to halt the spread of coronavirus This was supported by a snapshot survey from the National Association of Head Teachers, with members in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, showing that: in 94% of schools no more than 20% of pupils had attended. A separate survey from the ASCL union, also of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, showed even lower numbers, with: fewer than 10% of pupils in the ""vast majority"" of schools most schools had between 1% and 5% pupils attending This is only the first day for such emergency childcare cover and a full picture will take time to emerge, but the early reports might allay concerns that families would continue to send their children to school. ""It appears that the vast majority of families have responded to our appeal not to send their children to school, and we thank them for that,"" said Paul Whiteman, the NAHT's general secretary. Children have been told to stay at home across the UK. Most children had their last day of school on Friday until further notice Keeping schools open to look after the children of key workers - such as NHS, emergency or transport staff - is intended to help parents keep going to work and to maintain essential services. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, has called for virus testing for all staff in schools that remain open. ""This is no time for half-measures,"" said Dr Bousted, who said staff who were vulnerable, or who had vulnerable family at home, should not be put at risk by being in school. This video can not be played The government has closed all schools, but what does that mean for exams, and who can still go in? Gavin Williamson, England's Education Secretary, said: ""Early indications are that the number of children attending school today is low, and we thank parents for making the right choice and playing their part in our fight against coronavirus. ""People must do everything they can to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."" In Wales, Education Minister Kirsty Williams had called on key workers to ""think very carefully"" before sending their children to school. Northern Ireland's Education Minister, Peter Weir, said children should only attend school if there was ""no other viable option"" for their care. For those children starting their week at home, schools have been putting lessons and coursework online so that pupils can keep up with their studies. At Hampton Hill Junior School in Richmond, London, staff have had emergency training sessions in how to use an online learning system and all children were issued with a log-in so they can work from home. It was a new type of school drop-off for parents of some children at Hampton Hill Junior ""We'll be remotely available to answer any questions,"" Tracey Bannister, the school's special educational needs co-ordinator, told the BBC. Ms Bannister said the mood in school, which is open for key workers' children and vulnerable children, is sombre. ""I think it's a very different mood this morning,"" she said. ""In the staff meeting, we all sat further apart - there is definitely a different mood and maybe trepidation."" Pradeep Shetty, a carer whose daughter is eligible to attend school, says the current situation is difficult for everyone - for those who will be at home and those still coming to school. Mr Shetty says those children who have come to school will soon find it is very different from a regular timetable. ""It's hard for them to take as well - it's not a normal thing, just to be here without their friends."" Amy Arnold, head teacher at Barnham Church of England primary school in Suffolk, says staff are trying to create fun activities outdoors for those pupils who have come to school, such as den building, to limit physical contact. ""We're working hard to keep the children a safe distance apart - inevitably that poses some problems because some of the children are five years old and so they're finding this tricky to understand."" At Enniskillen Royal Grammar School in County Fermanagh, in Northern Ireland, principal Elizabeth Armstrong said a ""small number of pupils"" were in school on Monday morning.

"People 'selfish' for ignoring coronavirus adviceThe government is prepared to take more action to stop the virus spreading, says the health secretary.","Crowds were out in the UK's parks on a sunny weekend Boris Johnson is to address the UK on new measures to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, amid concerns people have been ignoring government advice. The UK has been under growing pressure to follow other countries by ordering the closure of more shops, and enforcing rules on social distancing. The PM will make a statement at 20:30 GMT. Meanwhile, people in the most at-risk groups have begun getting an NHS text urging them to stay at home for 12 weeks. The UK's death toll has reached 335. A further 46 people have died in England since Sunday - aged between 47 and 105 and all with underlying health conditions - while there were four deaths in Scotland and four in Wales. There have been 83,945 tests to date, with 6,650 confirmed cases. TheNHS in England has announcedit has identified 1.5 million of the most at-risk people, while there are 200,000 in Scotland, 70,000 in Wales and 40,000 in Northern Ireland. A text message from NHS England tells people in themost at-risk group:,external""Please remain at home for a minimum of 12 weeks. Home is the safest place for you. Staying in helps you stay well and that will help the NHS too."" The government's emergency committee Cobra has met andemergency legislationintroducing measures to respond to the outbreak has cleared its first Commons hurdle with MPs giving it an unopposed second reading. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says Britons travelling abroad should return to the UK as soon as possible because international travel is becoming more difficult with the closure of borders and the suspension of flights. Elsewhere, theBritish Olympic Association said Great Britain will not send a team to Tokyo 2020if the spread of coronavirus continues as predicted.

""The NHS is doing everything it can and preparing for the spread of this virus.

Tube drivers furious at crowded carriages Coronavirus deaths in Scotland increase to 14 Seven more deaths in Wales NI's health service is to access private sector beds The health secretary said the government advice on social distancing was ""really clear"" and people should stay two metres apart, staying at home if at all possible. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the government is considering closing all non-essential retail stores and introducing fines for people who ignore the current coronavirus advice. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stressed that everyone should stay at home if possible,adding that ""life should not be carrying on as normal right now"" and that shops not providing essential items should shut. Labour has called on the government to increase lockdown measures to keep people safe. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Other countries across the world have taken further far-reaching social distancing measures."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said companies should not pressure people, who are not key workers, to travel into work. The warning followed crowded scenes on parts of the London Underground during Monday morning's rush hour following a reduction in the number of services in response to the outbreak.

""My appeal to the families of key workers is: this is not business as usual. Keep your family at home if at all possible,"" he said. The government has said it is setting up ""hubs"" around the country to arrange deliveries of groceries and medicines to people with specific cancers, severe respiratory conditions and people who have received organ transplants. Councils, pharmacists and members of the Armed Forces will help and there will be opportunities for members of the public to volunteer. The Excel conference centre in east London could potentially be used in the medical response to the outbreak, the Ministry of Defence said. A team of military planners has visited the site to determine how it might ""benefit"" the NHS. The MoD said 250 personnel from its 20,000-strong Covid Support Force are beginning duties - including being trained to drive oxygen tankers and distributing protective equipment for the NHS. Underthe emergency legislation,externalairports could shut and police would be able to force people with virus symptoms to isolate. The proposals -set out last week- also include enabling recently retired NHS staff to return to work without any negative impact on their pensions; fast-tracking funeral arrangements; and allowing more court hearings to take place by phone or video. The powers would have to be renewed every six months. The government is also taking steps to address tax and pensions disincentives that could prevent retired police officers rejoining the service during the outbreak, Home Secretary Priti Patel said. But, speaking in the Commons, she rejected calls for a police presence inside supermarkets, amid incidents of panic-buying, This video can not be played Saturday was the ""busiest ever visitor day in living memory"" in Snowdonia, officials say Downing Street has said Boris Johnson would be prepared to take further actions if stricter measures were needed to enforce social distancing.

He said ministers will be looking at data on how much social interaction was continuing and if the information shows it has not stopped then the government would ""need to take further measures"".

Drug dealers 'delivered crack cocaine to hospital',"West Park Hospital in Darlington is one of three mental health hospitals criticised Drug dealers delivered crack cocaine to vulnerable patients at a mental health hospital, the BBC has been told. It is one of the claims made by a number of former patients at units run by the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, which have seen five deaths in less than two years. The trust has been criticised over its services at three hospitals, including West Lane in Middlesbrough,where three teenage girls died. The trust said reviews were under way. One girl admitted to West Park Hospital in Darlington last year told BBC Inside Out: ""Definitely the most alarming [thing] was the presence of crack cocaine on the ward. ""There were two ways [to get it]. Either people left and brought it back in with them, or you could ring a dealer and they would come on to the ward and deliver them for you."" She also said staff were ""tipped off"" ahead of a Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection. ""They were told in advance what would be happening,"" she said. ""Charts that weren't present before were put up with dates and ticks placed on them, and patients were advised by staff to hide contraband on the day of inspection."" Teenagers Christie Harnett (left) and Nadia Sharif died at West Lane Hospital The CQC said the trust was not told when inspections would take place, but did know which services would be looked at. The former patient also said she saw an agency worker acting inappropriately by massaging a patient's feet and telling another she was ""beautiful"". ""It was really quite disturbing and made me feel uncomfortable,"" she said. One girl, who was admitted to West Lane in Middlesbrough with an eating disorder in 2015, said she was still ""haunted every day"" by the memories of her time there. ""It was a horror story from day one,"" she said. She said patients had access to scissors and wires, and liquids such as nail polish remover or paint which some drank. The mental health unit at West Lane Hospital closed after a damning CQC inspection ""Even after things like that happened they wouldn't then be taken away,"" she said. ""We would just be told 'well, if you want to do it that's up to you'."" She also said members of staff would ask patients with eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia for ""diet tips"". West Lane closed in August aftera damning inspection by the CQC. At Roseberry Park in Middlesbrough, patients told the BBC some staff felt they had a licence to ""treat you terribly"". ""They say [you have a] personality disorder, that means they can do whatever they want,"" one said. Marjorie Wallace said she was appalled by the accounts Having seen the BBC's evidence, Marjorie Wallace, CEO of mental health charity Sane, said she was ""absolutely appalled"" and ""the picture of neglect, even amounting to cruelty, means it's more redolent of the dark ages of the old asylums"". ""The trust should be put into special measures immediately and those involved in all those incidents should be held to account,"" Ms Wallace said. The trust said it was ""deeply sorry"" that at West Lane it ""didnât provide safe, high quality care"". A spokesman said the BBC provided too little information for it to respond to the specific allegations made by patients, and a number of reviews and investigations were under way so it would be ""inappropriate to discuss or comment"" further. But he urged any patients with concerns to tell the trust, adding: ""We take all such views extremely seriously and use what they tell us to improve their care and the care of others.""

"Major medical goods shortage in 10 days, NYC warnsNew York's mayor issues a stark warning as the state struggles to slow the spread of coronavirus.US & Canada","The city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, warned that ""people will die who could have lived otherwise"" The coronavirus outbreak in New York will get worse, with damage accelerated by shortages of key medical supplies, the city's mayor has said. ""We're about 10 days away from seeing widespread shortages,"" Bill de Blasio said on Sunday. ""If we don't get more ventilators people will die."" New York state has become the epicentre of the outbreak in the US and accounts for almost half of the country's cases. There are now 31,057 confirmed cases nationwide, with 390 deaths. On Sunday, the state's Governor Andrew Cuomo said 15,168 people had tested positive for the virus, an increase of more than 4,000 from the previous day. ""All Americans deserve the blunt truth,"" Mr de Blasio told NBC News. ""It's only getting worse, and in fact April and May are going to be a lot worse.""

STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash On Friday, President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for the state which gave it access to billions of dollars of federal aid. However, Mr de Blasio has continued to criticise the administration for what he views as an inadequate response. ""I cannot be blunt enough: if the president doesn't act, people will die who could have lived otherwise,"" he said. ""This is going to be the greatest crisis, domestically, since the Great Depression,"" he added, referring to the economic crisis of the 1930s. Speaking at a news conference at the White House on Sunday, Mr Trump said he had also approved a major disaster declaration for Washington state and would approve a similar measure for California. ""This is a challenging time for all Americans. We're enduring a great national trial,"" he said. President Trump also said a number of medical supplies were being sent to locations nationwide, as well as emergency medical stations for New York, Washington and California, the worst-hit states. This video can not be played 60 days of coronavirus in the US - in 60 seconds Doctors across New York have reported depleted medical supplies and a lack of protective gear for healthcare workers on the frontlines of the outbreak. Warnings of such shortages have reverberated across the country as other state governors have pleaded with the federal government to make more supplies available. In California, officials instructed hospitals to restrict coronavirus testing. Meanwhile, a hospital in Washington state - once the centre of the US outbreak - said it could run out of ventilators by April. And on Sunday, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said states were ""competing against each other"" for virus supplies. ""We need millions of masks and hundreds of thousands of gowns and gloves,"" he said. ""We're getting just a fraction of that. So, we're out on the open market competing for these items that we so badly need."" An almost $1.4 trillion (Â£1.2 trillion) emergency stimulus bill intended to blunt the punishing economic impact of the pandemic failed to pass the US Senate on Sunday. The bill got 47 votes, falling short of the 60 needed in the 100-member chamber. Democrats raised objections to the bill with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer saying it had ""many, many problems"". Democrats accused Republicans of wanting to bail out big businesses.

Stocks fall as nations take coronavirus action,"Financial markets in Europe and the US have continued to fall despite fresh action by the Federal Reserve to support the American economy. The US central bank said it would buy as much government debt as needed to soothe markets, while providing new financing for households and firms. Shares in Europe and the US rose on the news, but soon fell back as Congress remained divided over further relief. Investors are worried about economic damage due to the coronavirus. In making its announcement, the Federal Reserve said the pandemic was ""causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world"". ""Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate,"" it said. However, a broader US bailout bill worth almost $2tn being debated in Congress failed to advance for a second time, after Democrats said proposed financial relief for industries such as airlines would not do enough to help workers. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 fell about 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dipped almost 0.3%. The Dow and S&P have now lost more than three years of gains made since US President Donald Trump became president. In London, the FTSE 100 closed nearly 3.8% lower, while Germany's Dax dropped 2% and France's CAC 40 fell 3.3%. Earlier, Asian stock markets closed sharply lower. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: ""We really are in the thick of a global crisis and markets are showing little sign of optimism as the new trading week gets underway. ""Events are moving so fast that it is difficult for investors to truly understand what's going on with businesses."" US stocks have already fallen by around a third since the middle of last month, while even areas of investment normally seen as safe havens, such as the bond market, are under stress as hard-hit funds are forced to sell good assets to cover losses elsewhere. The declines come as countries around the world, including the UK, have announced new measures to slow the spread of the virus, including ordering people to stay at home and closing down bars and restaurants. In the UK, fast food chains McDonald's and Nando's are among the firms closing their doors. As activity slows, numerous companies have announced job cuts or furloughs. On Monday, those firms included Boeing, which said it would suspend production at its factories in Washington state and General Electric, which said it would cut 10% of its aviation workforce. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the shock to global growth will produce ""a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse"". The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmenthas warned that the world will take years to recoverfrom the coronavirus pandemic. Angel GurrÃ­a, OECD secretary general, told the BBC the economic shock was already bigger than the financial crisis and it was ""wishful thinking"" to believe that countries would bounce back quickly. Will government rescue package be enough for firms? Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact McDonald's to close all UK restaurants In the US, the Federal Reserve had already slashed interest rates and intervened to stabilise debt markets, in an effort to cushion the blow to the economy. On Monday, it said it would expand its holdings of government-backed debt as needed to keep financial markets working smoothly. It also announced plans to loosen requirements for banks to encourage them to keep lending, while taking steps that would provide up to $300bn more financing for employers and consumers. It is working on a lending programme for small and medium sized businesses as well. In Asia, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell by nearly 5%, while China's Shanghai Composite lost 2.4%. New Zealand's main share index started the day down by more than 10%, but recovered some ground to close 7.6% lower. The ASX 200 in Sydney dropped more than 7% in early trading and closed down 5.6% at the end of the trading session. In India, where a 14-hour curfew was announced, its Sensex index fell 10%, triggering a ""circuit breaker"" and a 45-minute trading halt. It continued its slide to fall 12%. âIt would be a brave, or foolish, man to call the bottom in equities without a dramatic medical breakthrough,â said Alan Ruskin from Deutsche Bank. Policymakers around the world have been unveiling ever larger emergency rescue packages - but America's central bank has gone further than any other. The announcement aims to ease fears on the financial markets that a financial crisis amongst over-indebted companies could be looming. It said it would not limit the amount of assets it buys on the markets via quantitative easing, an effort to ensure there are sufficient funds in the system. But its separate programme, announced simultaneously - to directly provide aid to smaller businesses and struggling households - is just as important. For it is their financial woes that could turn a recession into a lasting depression. These are massive amounts but as the crisis intensifies, so too will the further measures all policymakers - not just central banks - may have to provide in the coming days.

Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says Britons travelling abroad should return to the UK as soon as possible because international travel is becoming more difficult with the closure of borders and the suspension of flights. Elsewhere, theBritish Olympic Association said Great Britain will not send a team to Tokyo 2020if the spread of coronavirus continues as predicted.

This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""Incredibly unfair to socialise"" ""It's very selfish,"" he told the Today programme. ""The NHS is doing everything it can and preparing for the spread of this virus.

Tube drivers furious at crowded carriages Coronavirus deaths in Scotland increase to 14 Seven more deaths in Wales NI's health service is to access private sector beds The health secretary said the government advice on social distancing was ""really clear"" and people should stay two metres apart, staying at home if at all possible. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the government is considering closing all non-essential retail stores and introducing fines for people who ignore the current coronavirus advice. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stressed that everyone should stay at home if possible,adding that ""life should not be carrying on as normal right now"" and that shops not providing essential items should shut. Labour has called on the government to increase lockdown measures to keep people safe. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Other countries across the world have taken further far-reaching social distancing measures."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said companies should not pressure people, who are not key workers, to travel into work. The warning followed crowded scenes on parts of the London Underground during Monday morning's rush hour following a reduction in the number of services in response to the outbreak.

""My appeal to the families of key workers is: this is not business as usual. Keep your family at home if at all possible,"" he said. The government has said it is setting up ""hubs"" around the country to arrange deliveries of groceries and medicines to people with specific cancers, severe respiratory conditions and people who have received organ transplants. Councils, pharmacists and members of the Armed Forces will help and there will be opportunities for members of the public to volunteer. The Excel conference centre in east London could potentially be used in the medical response to the outbreak, the Ministry of Defence said. A team of military planners has visited the site to determine how it might ""benefit"" the NHS. The MoD said 250 personnel from its 20,000-strong Covid Support Force are beginning duties - including being trained to drive oxygen tankers and distributing protective equipment for the NHS. Underthe emergency legislation,externalairports could shut and police would be able to force people with virus symptoms to isolate. The proposals -set out last week- also include enabling recently retired NHS staff to return to work without any negative impact on their pensions; fast-tracking funeral arrangements; and allowing more court hearings to take place by phone or video. The powers would have to be renewed every six months. The government is also taking steps to address tax and pensions disincentives that could prevent retired police officers rejoining the service during the outbreak, Home Secretary Priti Patel said. But, speaking in the Commons, she rejected calls for a police presence inside supermarkets, amid incidents of panic-buying, This video can not be played Saturday was the ""busiest ever visitor day in living memory"" in Snowdonia, officials say Downing Street has said Boris Johnson would be prepared to take further actions if stricter measures were needed to enforce social distancing.

He said ministers will be looking at data on how much social interaction was continuing and if the information shows it has not stopped then the government would ""need to take further measures"".

Asked whether stricter measures could be introduced, Mr Johnson added: ""I don't think you need to use your imagination very much to see where we might have to go, and we will think about this very, very actively in the next 24 hours. ""It's so important that that pleasure and that ability is preserved but it can only really be preserved if everybody acts responsibly and conforms with those principles of staying apart from one another and social distancing.

"Blood donations needed after 15% drop, says NHS","The NHS is urging blood donors to keep their appointments during the coronavirus outbreak. It said donations were 15% lower than expected last week, amid fears donors are feeling unsure about safety and whether sessions are still going ahead. A spokesman said the impact of the drop was minimal but must be addressed. NHS Blood and Transplant said calls to its contact centre to ask if donation sessions were going ahead went from around 30 to around 500 a day. It said stocks remain ""good"" currently, but officials are keen to reduce uncertainty by maintaining a regular amount of donations over the coming months. The NHSBT said that potential donors need to make sure they are well enough to visit a clinic, and should stay away if they have a high fever or persistent cough. Meanwhile, donation teams are taking extra hygiene precautions to alleviate any fears due to the coronavirus outbreak. Dr Gail Miflin, the chief medical officer for NHSBT, says that donors are needed at times of crisis such as now more than ever. ""Blood donation saves lives and we will need our donors more than ever over the new few weeks and months. Please keep your appointment to donate if you can.

As a goodbye from us here's a reminder of where to find the most accurate and up-to-date information on how to protect yourself and your loved ones in these uncertain times.  As uncertainty over the future of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics continues Japanese media are now reporting that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will hold a phone call with Thomas Bach, head of the International Olympic Committee, at 8pm local time, 11GMT. There's been mounting criticism over the IOC and Japan's insistence the Games will go ahead. Many athletes and a number of national Olympic committees say it's impossible to train for the event and that it's extremely unlikely that the global pandemic will be under control by 24 July, the scheduled kick-off date for the Games. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and US Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin say they have not yet reached a deal on a  $2 trillion (Â£1.7tn) coronavirus economic stimulus package, but progress has been made. Mr Schumer said a vote on the deal in the US Senate could take place as early as Tuesday. Democrats in the Republican-controlled chamber have complained that the package does not contain enough funding for states and hospitals. They also want more restrictions on a fund to help large businesses. On the first day of a country-wide lockdown in India, hundreds were held for violating the curfew - and the police dealt out some fairly unusual forms of punishment in some states. Local media reports showed videos of police in Punjab and Maharashtra punishingmen who broke the curfew by forcing them to do push-ups,external. In Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh,police also took to shaming people on social media,external- they posted photos of the alleged violators, saying âthey were against society as they will not stay at homeâ, reported the Hindustan Times. Elsewhere,officials seized vehicles,externalafter questioning people where they were going to determine if it was essential for them to be outside their home. States have also been asked to take legal action if necessary as many have imposed a colonial-era law that prohibits four or more people gathering. Checks and fines are expected to increase on Tuesday as more cities and states go into lockdown to fight the spread of Covid-19 - India has reported 446 active cases, and nine deaths so far.  We have important panda news to lighten your mood. After 58 days of keeping visitors away, the Beijing Zoo reopened on Monday. According to state media, the animals have been faring well during the virus lockdown, some of them seem to have enjoyed the quiet. ""Some of the animals, such as the pandas, preferred to have more exercise when the zoo was empty,"" the China Daily cites zoo director Zhang Chenglin. He also says the area is still being disinfected on a regular basis. For those who can't come down in person to see the animals, the zoo also has online tours where you can watch the animals being fed - or the enclosures being disinfected. The Association of Asian Pacific Airlines (AAPA) has said its members need state support immediately as they face upwards of a $60bn revenue shortfall due to the coronavirus pandemic. âThe magnitude is beyond
belief. Itâs unimaginable,â APAA Director General Andrew Herdman told the BBC. The trade group's member airlines include Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific among others. He added that although carriers were cutting costs by slashing schedules, which saves on expenses like fuel, they continue to shoulder major overheads: ""Weâre still left with fixed costs including staff. The tough thing is that for a lot of staff, thereâs no work for them to do.â The AAPA is calling for government action in the form of deferred tax payments and extensions of interest-free loans to improve cash flow. âThe big focus is protecting the workforce. The airlines will need them once again once thereâs a recovery. But when that will be, nobody knows,â Mr Herman concluded. The gambling hub of Macau will ban all visitors from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan who have travelled overseas in the past 14 days, said a Reuters report quoting its leader Ho Iat Seng. It comes a week after it banned all foreign visitors from entering the region. There are 25 confirmed cases of the virus in Macau - a once bustling casino hub which has now fallen silent amid virus fears. Macau's once bustling casinos are now silent Crime gangs in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro are reported to have ordered curfews to combat coronavirus, saying they are taking action because the government refuses to. Residents of several favelas (shanty towns) say they have received social media messages ordering people off the streets overnight. ""We want the best for the population. If the government doesn't have the capacity to do something [about coronavirus], then organised crime will sort it out,"" said one message reported by the G1 news website. President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticised for his lacklustre response to the outbreak, prompting protests in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio. Simon AtkinsonBBC News, Sydney For the past couple of hours Iâve been talking to Brits stuck in Australia and New Zealand. Several of them are health workers desperate to get back home to help out. For others, they have older relatives who they want to be near. And then there are the young travellers on working holiday visas who are losing their casual jobs and worry about being stuck far from home with no money and no support. For many whoâd already booked to get back, flights booked with airlines such as Emirates and Etihad are no longer flying. Planes going straight to the UK are few and far between and, of course, sold out. The general feeling is helplessness. Being passed around by airlines and travel agents while struggling to get information from the British government. Everyone understands this is a global crisis. Nobody expects an easy answer. But the frustration seems to stem from being told get home as soon as possible â but finding it very hard to work out how to do that. Iâm told the British High Commission here in Australia will have some information soon. Weâll share that as soon as we get it. Busy morning here in Singapore - where most of us are writing this live page from home - catching up on some major developments overnight. TheUKhas told people to stay home, and we're checking in with our colleagues in London on how they and their families might be affected. TheUSreported more than 100 deaths in a single day and theWHOhas warned that the pandemic is ""accelerating"". Here are some updates from closer to home: The 23 de Enero neighbourhood in Caracas has limited water supplies There are major concerns over how Venezuela could deal with a coronavirus outbreak, as the South American country has long been in economic crisis, with regular food and medicine shortages. The lockdown began on 17 March. All borders are shut and there are no flights in or out. People are only permitted to leave their house to buy food or medicines or attend medical appointments. They must wear a mask and, from Sunday, they also need to wear gloves. William Bello, a concierge in his 50s from Caracas, told the BBCâs Guillermo Olmo about his concerns. Mr Bello lives in the 23 de Enero neighbourhood, which is working class and largely pro-government. âPeople are very worried about the disease, so they are respecting the quarantine, but many street traders need to go out and sell stuff if they want something to eat. Police are everywhere and are ordering people to go home when they catch them.â He typically gets running water only twice a week. This needs to be stored in containers and boiled before drinking. âWith the water that we have, weâre trying to follow the recommendations and wash our hands frequently."" Amazon is teaming up with researchers funded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to pick up and deliver coronavirus test kits. The Gates Foundation-backed Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) is learning how the infection spreads. It involves collecting nasal swabs to track the virus among residents of Seattle's King County in Washington. Amazon Care, the retail giant's employee medical care arm, is now helping with deliveries of the kits. King County is one of the places hardest hit by the outbreak in the US. Read more here Online retail giant Amazon and Microsoft's Bill Gates are working together to track the outbreak's spread. Frances MaoSydney As we mentioned earlier, one woman has died and over 50 cases have now been traced back to the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which docked in Sydney last Thursday. Around 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark then, despite authorities knowing that some on board were feeling unwell. However this wasn't relayed to passengers, and by the time the first cases were revealed on Friday, some of those on board were half-way around the round. Just how did Australian authorities get it so wrong in this instance?Read my full report into the debacle. I spoke to one passenger, Elisa McCafferty, who has returned home to London with her husband but fears they both have the virus now. ""They shouldn't have let us disembark,"" she told me this morning. Passengers Elisa McCafferty and her husband are furious over the mishandling of the ship's return to Sydney With domestic transmissions very low, China is focussing on people from overseas bringing the virus into the country. The city of Beijing has now tightened its rules on international arrivals even further, state media report. Anyone entering the city from abroad will go into mandatory centralised quarantine for 14 days and will have to be tested for the coronavirus. The report in the China Daily cited by Reuters also says that whoever enters the city from the rest of China and has travelled from overseas in the past two weeks will also have to be tested and quarantined. China is where the global pandemic started and nearly 3,300 people have died from it there. Asian stocks have jumped after the US central bank rolled out a new plan to ease the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In its latest emergency measure, the Federal Reserve said it would buy unlimited amounts of assets to steady markets. However, a US government bailout bill worth almost $2 trillion being debated in Congress has failed to advance for a second time, as Democrats said proposed financial relief for industries such as airlines would not do enough to help workers. In morning tradingJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was the 6.5% higher, the Hang Seng inHong Konggained 4%, andChina's Shanghai Composite was up by 1.7%. The US Embassy in Peru says it is working to bring its citizens home, after the South American country enforced a nationwide lockdown stranding thousands of people. No flights are allowed to enter or leave the country without government permission. The Charge d'Affaires Denison Offutt said the embassy was ""actively coordinating with Peru on official repatriation flights for US citizens"". Mr Offutt says there are 5,000 US citizens currently in Peru - though he doesn't say how many are tourists or residents. The comments section of the video however, are filled with comments by people claiming to be stranded US citizens in Peru. ""We are 12 family members stranded,"" says one comment. ""I'm still waiting in Magdalena Del Mar - please help us,"" another says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A female  passenger in her 70s who caught the virus on a cruise ship which docked in Sydney last Thursday has died in hospital this morning, health officials say. She was one of the first three cases confirmed on the ship last Friday, and had been taken to hospital immediately after disembarking. About 2,700 passengers were allowed off the ship last week, with many flying overseas, not knowing there were confirmed virus cases on board. This has sparked huge public criticism. We know that many people are contracting the coronavirus around the world, but establishing a death rate is no simple task. The World Health Organization says about 3.4% of all cases have resulted in deaths, but scientists estimate that the death rate is actually much lower because many cases have mild symptoms and are not reported. The rate of fatalities also depends on a range of factors including age, sex, pre-existing conditions and the health system you are in. From the evidence available, we know that some groups of people are more likely to die if they contract the virus - the elderly, the unwell and, maybe, men. Find out more about the difficulty in calculating death rates and the groups most at risk. Cuba has now closed its doors to all tourists, and those that are already in the country will have to go into quarantine. There were on Monday around 32,500 overseas tourists in Cuba - of which 9,400 were staying in homestays. The government says they will be moved to state-run hotels to complete their quarantine, according to Reuters, They won't be let out of quarantine until they find a flight home - though many flights have already been cancelled. - so its likely many will find themselves stranded. Cubans themselves also cannot leave the island without authorisation. There are currently 40 confirmed cases in Cuba.  Holidaymakers scrambled to get out of Cuba Â© 2025 BBC.

"Parents urged not to send children to schoolSchools are shut from today except to pupils who are vulnerable or whose parents are ""key workers"".Family & Education","For most children the school day is now at home and online Parents have heeded warnings not to send children into school unless it was a last resort, say head teachers. Schools in the UK have closed to reduce the spread of coronavirus - and are only open to look after the children of ""key workers"" and vulnerable children. Early snapshot surveys suggested schools had between 1% and 20% of pupils attending. The Department for Education welcomed that numbers in school were ""low"" and that parents had kept children at home. There had been fears too many pupils would turn up and that schools with depleted numbers of teachers would struggle to cope. But Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the numbers at school appeared to be ""manageable"". He said parents appeared to have ""heeded calls to use the emergency provision in schools only in the event that they are key workers who have no option available to keep their children at home"". Parents in Wales urged to keep children out of school School only a 'last resort' parents told in Northern Ireland Latest as nations struggle to halt the spread of coronavirus This was supported by a snapshot survey from the National Association of Head Teachers, with members in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, showing that: in 94% of schools no more than 20% of pupils had attended. A separate survey from the ASCL union, also of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, showed even lower numbers, with: fewer than 10% of pupils in the ""vast majority"" of schools most schools had between 1% and 5% pupils attending This is only the first day for such emergency childcare cover and a full picture will take time to emerge, but the early reports might allay concerns that families would continue to send their children to school. ""It appears that the vast majority of families have responded to our appeal not to send their children to school, and we thank them for that,"" said Paul Whiteman, the NAHT's general secretary. Children have been told to stay at home across the UK. Most children had their last day of school on Friday until further notice Keeping schools open to look after the children of key workers - such as NHS, emergency or transport staff - is intended to help parents keep going to work and to maintain essential services. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, has called for virus testing for all staff in schools that remain open. ""This is no time for half-measures,"" said Dr Bousted, who said staff who were vulnerable, or who had vulnerable family at home, should not be put at risk by being in school. This video can not be played The government has closed all schools, but what does that mean for exams, and who can still go in? Gavin Williamson, England's Education Secretary, said: ""Early indications are that the number of children attending school today is low, and we thank parents for making the right choice and playing their part in our fight against coronavirus. ""People must do everything they can to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."" In Wales, Education Minister Kirsty Williams had called on key workers to ""think very carefully"" before sending their children to school. Northern Ireland's Education Minister, Peter Weir, said children should only attend school if there was ""no other viable option"" for their care. For those children starting their week at home, schools have been putting lessons and coursework online so that pupils can keep up with their studies. At Hampton Hill Junior School in Richmond, London, staff have had emergency training sessions in how to use an online learning system and all children were issued with a log-in so they can work from home. It was a new type of school drop-off for parents of some children at Hampton Hill Junior ""We'll be remotely available to answer any questions,"" Tracey Bannister, the school's special educational needs co-ordinator, told the BBC. Ms Bannister said the mood in school, which is open for key workers' children and vulnerable children, is sombre. ""I think it's a very different mood this morning,"" she said. ""In the staff meeting, we all sat further apart - there is definitely a different mood and maybe trepidation."" Pradeep Shetty, a carer whose daughter is eligible to attend school, says the current situation is difficult for everyone - for those who will be at home and those still coming to school. Mr Shetty says those children who have come to school will soon find it is very different from a regular timetable. ""It's hard for them to take as well - it's not a normal thing, just to be here without their friends."" Amy Arnold, head teacher at Barnham Church of England primary school in Suffolk, says staff are trying to create fun activities outdoors for those pupils who have come to school, such as den building, to limit physical contact. ""We're working hard to keep the children a safe distance apart - inevitably that poses some problems because some of the children are five years old and so they're finding this tricky to understand."" At Enniskillen Royal Grammar School in County Fermanagh, in Northern Ireland, principal Elizabeth Armstrong said a ""small number of pupils"" were in school on Monday morning.
