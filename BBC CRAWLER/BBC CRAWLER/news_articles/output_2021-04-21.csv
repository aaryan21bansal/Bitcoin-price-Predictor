Labour calls for probe into PM-Dyson texts,"Sir James Dyson texted the prime minister last March when he was involved in efforts to provide ventilators Labour has called for a ""thorough investigation"" into Boris Johnson's contacts with inventor Sir James Dyson. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the messages between the prime minister and Sir James opened up a ""new urgent corridor of inquiry"". The texts - seen by the BBC - show Mr Johnson saying he could ""fix"" tax issues relating to Dyson staff who came to the UK to work on the pandemic. The PM said he made ""no apology"" for trying to get ventilators for the NHS. Labour has said the text messages are part of a pattern of government ""sleaze"" and has called on the cross-party Liaison Committee of senior MPs to investigate ""as soon as possible"". Ms Reeves claimed there was ""a growing feeling that if someone has access to a telephone number of someone like the prime minister or the chancellor, then they are able to gain special treatment"". Liaison Committee Chair Sir Bernard Jenkin said the MPs would consider Ms Reeves request adding that the prime minster was due to appear in front of the committee before the summer recess. Billionaire Dyson moves residency back to the UK PM: I did right thing over Dyson ventilators What is lobbying? A brief guide In March last year, the Department of Health feared the NHS in England would need as many as 20,000 additional ventilators to deal with Covid patients. It asked companies, including Dyson, which is based in Singapore, to help. The prime minister is understood to have called Sir James on 13 March and asked him to participate. Dyson answered the call - although subsequently the company was not called upon to provide ventilators to the NHS. Sir James contacted the Treasury for assurances there would be no extra tax to pay for employees who came to the UK to help. When he failed to get a response, he texted the prime minister directly. In exchanges seen by the BBC, Mr Johnson messaged Sir James saying: ""[Chancellor] Rishi [Sunak] says it is fixed!! We need you here."" When the businessman sought further reassurance for the tax status of the firm and ""senior individuals"", Mr Johnson replied: ""I am First Lord of the Treasury and you can take it that we are backing you to do what you need."" Two weeks later, Mr Sunak told a group of MPs that the tax status of people who came to the UK to provide specific help during the pandemic would not be affected. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he made ""no apology for moving heaven and earth"" to persuade businesses to help bolster supplies of equipment and ventilators to treat coronavirus patients. He said he had done the ""right thing"" and that ""any prime minister"" would have done the same in the circumstances. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on Mr Johnson to reveal ""how many more Covid contracts he personally fixed"" and publish all personal exchanges on these contracts. But Mr Johnson said there was ""nothing to conceal about this"" and he would share details with MPs. The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson had abided by the ministerial code, governing conduct in office, and had ""informed officials in a timely manner"" after his contact with Sir James. He added that he did not know when the prime minister would publish his exchanges with Sir James. Separately, it is understood some in government have suggested the prime minister should be less willing to share his personal contact details - but officials have denied that he was told to change his mobile phone number. It was also revealed recently that former Prime Minister David Cameron hadcontacted several ministers- including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, whom he texted - on behalf of the failed finance firm Greensill Capital. Several inquiries have been launched looking into the work of lobbyists, whose job it is to influence government policy. Mr Cameron has denied that he broke any codes of conduct or any government rules on lobbying.

PM: I did right thing over Dyson ventilators,"This video can not be played Starmer: Is it right to change tax rules for Dyson? Boris Johnson said he made ""no apology for moving heaven and earth"" to get ventilators during the pandemic, amid a row over lobbying by Sir James Dyson. In text messages seen by the BBC, the prime minister promised to ""fix"" tax changes the entrepreneur wanted. Mr Johnson said any PM would have done the same in the circumstances, to secure ventilator supplies. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was part of a pattern of government ""sleaze"" centred on the prime minister. Trading verbal blows with Mr Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions, he claimed there was ""one rule for those who have the prime minister's phone number and another for everybody else"". Johnson told Dyson he would 'fix' tax issue What is lobbying? A brief guide Where is the line on lobbying government? The text messages were sent between Sir James and Mr Johnson in March last year, when coronavirus hit the UK. Sir James wanted to ensure that Dyson workers returning to the UK to help with the pandemic response were not penalised by the tax system. This happened after the governmentasked businesses - including Dyson - to helpsupply more ventilators, amid concern about a shortage of the equipment as coronavirus infections increased. In the House of Commons, Mr Johnson insisted he had done the ""right thing"", saying: ""I make absolutely no apology at all for shifting heaven and earth and doing everything I possibly could, as I think any prime minister would in those circumstances, to secure ventilators for the people of this country."" But Sir Keir compared the way Mr Johnson responded to Sir James' concerns with the government's treatment of steelworkers, nurses and three million self-employed people who have been left out of coronavirus support schemes. He claimed there was a ""pattern to this government"". ""Every day there are new allegations about this Conservative government: dodgy PPE deals; tax breaks for their mates; the health secretary owns shares in a company delivering NHS services,"" Sir Keir said. ""Sleaze, sleaze, sleaze, and it's all on his watch."" Mr Johnson took a swipe at Sir Keir, telling MPs: ""Captain Hindsight snipes continually from the sidelines. This government gets on with delivering on the people's priorities."" I understand Number 11 - the chancellor's team - were uneasy about what Sir James Dyson was asking for in his approach to them, and it's suggested they had quite deliberately not responded to his firm's requests before Sir James himself then texted the PM directly about the tax issue. I'm told Chancellor Rishi Sunak did not and has never had any personal contact with Sir James. When it comes to publication of texts, the Treasury set a precedent a few weeks ago, when it published Mr Sunak's texts to David Cameron about Greensill. At PMQs, the prime minister said he would ""share all the details with the House"". But one of the big issues with rules about how ministers are meant to behave is the proliferation of politics being done by text and WhatsApp. Whatever happened in the case between Boris Johnson and Sir James Dyson, the rules contained in the ministerial code don't really cover the reality of how people communicate now. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on Mr Johnson to reveal ""how many more Covid contracts he personally fixed"" and publish all personal exchanges on these contracts. The prime minister said there was ""absolutely nothing to conceal about this"" and that he was ""happy to share"" the details with MPs ""as indeed I have shared them with my officials immediately"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Johnson's text exchanges with Sir James had been ""referenced"" in correspondence sent by Sir James's company ""as evidence of a guarantee they believed they had been given"". The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson had abided by the ministerial code, governing conduct in office, and had ""informed officials in a timely manner"" after his contact with Sir James. He added that he did not know when the prime minister would publish his exchanges with Sir James. Who is the Ted Hastings of Westminster? What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? In March last year, the Department of Health feared the NHS in England could need as many as 20,000 additional ventilators on top of the 5,000 it had - along with an existing 900 to treat children. The prime minister is understood to have called Sir James on 13 March and asked him to participate. Dyson answered the call and said it spent Â£20m on developing its own design -though subsequently the company was not called upon to provide ventilators to the NHS. But the BBC has discovered that Sir James also raised his concerns with the Treasury, and later the prime minister, about rules that could see staff brought into the UK for the project needing to pay tax. In text exchanges seen by the BBC, the PM messaged Sir James saying: ""[Chancellor] Rishi [Sunak] says it is fixed!! We need you here."" When the businessman sought further reassurance for the tax status of the firm and ""senior individuals"", Mr Johnson replied: ""I am First Lord of the Treasury and you can take it that we are backing you to do what you need."" Two weeks later, Mr Sunak told a group of MPs that the tax status of people who came to the UK to provide specific help during the pandemic would not be affected. Sir James said he was ""hugely proud"" of his firm's response in ""the midst of a national emergency"", and that he would ""do the same again if asked"". He said: ""When the prime minister rang me to ask Dyson to urgently build ventilators, of course, I said yes. ""Our ventilator cost Dyson Â£20m, freely given to the national cause, and it is absurd to suggest that the urgent correspondence was anything other than seeking compliance with rules, as 450 Dyson people - in UK and Singapore - worked around the clock, seven days a week to build potentially life-saving equipment at a time of dire need. ""Mercifully, they were not required as medical understanding of the virus evolved. Neither Weybourne (Dyson's holding company) nor Dyson received any benefit from the project; indeed commercial projects were delayed, and Dyson voluntarily covered the Â£20 million of development costs."" Sir James also said his company had not claimed ""one penny"" from governments in any jurisdiction in relation to Covid.

What is Greensill lobbying row about?,"Former Prime Minister David Cameron made about Â£3.3m from shares in the collapsed finance company Greensill Capital, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest. Last month an MPs' report accused Mr Cameron of ""a significant lack of judgement"" in lobbying the government on behalf of the company, although it said he did not break any rules. In 2020, Mr Cameron tried to persuade ministers to allow Greensill - who employed him as an adviser - to join a scheme called the Corporate Covid Financing Facility (CCFF). This would have allowed the company to issue loans, insured by the government, to help firms through the pandemic. However, Mr Cameron - and the company's founder, Lex Greensill - were unsuccessful in their attempts. Greensill Capital collapsed this year, with the loss of 440 jobs, and possible billion-pound losses for investors. Mr Cameron has consistently declined to say how much he was being paid by Greensill, except that it was ""far more"" than his salary as PM. However, BBC's Panorama has obtained a letter from Greensill Capital to the former PM which suggests that he made Â£3.29m after selling a tranche of Greensill shares in 2019. David Cameron 'made $10m' before company's collapse As well as the shares, Mr Cameron is reported to have received a salary of $1m (Â£720,000) a year as a part-time adviser. The programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (Â£504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary. In total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work. Mr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter. Australian banker Lex Greensill originally worked for David Cameron at No 10 in the early 2010s Mr Cameron has been accused of trying to exploit private contacts with former government colleagues, for his own benefit. The former PM used private channels,externalto lobby ministers and former colleagues. He and his staff sent45 emails, texts and WhatsApp messagesconcerning Greensill between 5 March and 26 June 2020. Among these were nine WhatsApp messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and 12 text messages to Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury's top civil servant. The Bank of England haspublished correspondence,externalshowing that Mr Cameron had contacted senior officials several times, in an unsuccessful attempt to win their support. Along with Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019to discuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. A report last month by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said that while no lobbying rules were broken, Mr Cameron's actions showed there was a ""good case for strengthening them"", with the current ones offering ""insufficient strength"". It also said that the Treasury was right to reject the former PM's proposals, but it ""should have encouraged"" him into ""more formal lines of communication as soon as it had identified his personal financial incentives"". ACabinet Office reviewcommissioned by Boris Johnson also criticised Mr Cameron, and said he had understated his relationship with Greensill when lobbying the Treasury. However, it said that ""his actions were not unlawful"". Several other reviews are investigating matters related to lobbying and Greensill. Responding to the Treasury Committee report, Mr Cameron admitted that he should have used more formal channels, but said he had worked for Greensill primarily because he thought the firm could help small businesses during an economic crisis. However, Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner said the fact that Mr Cameron had been cleared of breaking rules proved ""that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose"". Current rules,externalstate that ""on leaving office, ministers will be prohibited from lobbying government for two years"". Before accepting new jobs, former ministers are supposed to inform a body called the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). Acoba advises civil servants and politicians on what they can and can't do after leaving public service. However, although former ministers are required to contact Acoba, they are not obliged to act on its advice. Acoba's head, Lord Pickles, has called for ex-ministers who work as lobbyiststo go on a register for up to 10 years to ensure ""transparency"", The company's collapse earlier this year was triggered after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans Greensill was making. Greensill was theprincipal financial backer of Liberty Steel, which employs 3,000 people in England, Scotland and Wales. Talks are now underwayto try to secure Liberty's future.

North and Midlands 'leading jobs recovery',"Britain's jobs growth is being led by cities and towns in the North and Midlands, according to a report. Hiring has gathered pace since lockdown started to ease, but the growth is unevenly spread, joint research by the Centre of Cities think-tank and jobs site Indeed found. Barnsley and Mansfield have seen the biggest rises in job vacancies, while Aberdeen and Belfast had the lowest. The study analysed vacancies in 63 cities and large towns. It found that in some parts of the country job postings now exceed their pre-pandemic level. Nine cities or towns now have more job vacancies than before the pandemic, led by Barnsley (+21%), Mansfield (20%) and Stoke (17%). Other places where postings have recovered least are led by Aberdeen (-53%), Belfast (-39%) and Crawley (-39%). Towns and cities in south east England figured heavily among places at the bottom of the recovery list. London is among the areas showing the slowest recovery, with job postings in the capital still 26% below their pre-pandemic level. Under-35s bearing brunt of jobs crisis 'Finding work feels impossible for my generation' UK outlook 'uncertain' despite vaccine, says Bank Elena Magrini, senior analyst at the Centre for Cities, said: ""Places reliant on tourism, aviation and office workers have been particularly hard hit and still have high shares of people who are unemployed or on furlough."" Crawley, for example, is home to Gatwick Airport, which has been hard hit by job cuts due to the coronavirus collapse in air travel. Ms Magrini added that despite the patchy recovery, there are reasons for optimism. ""Once we have reopened the economy, policy makers need to focus on building back better - growing the economy by creating better paid, higher skilled jobs for people right across the country,"" she said. The improving picture in the North and Midlands was partly driven by the mix of available jobs. Recoveries have been strongest in areas with a greater pre-pandemic share of postings in occupations related to the production and distribution of goods, such as manufacturing, driving and stocking, as well as essential services like healthcare, social care and education. On the other hand, places with a higher share of pre-pandemic job opportunities in food and beverage services and hospitality and tourism are lagging behind. Pawel Adrjan, head of EMEA research at Indeed, said: ""Cities and towns in the North and Midlands have been buoyed by rising manufacturing, distribution, healthcare and education jobs. But at the same time areas reliant on hospitality, tourism and higher paying jobs that can be performed from home have seen only sluggish growth. ""We've seen how quickly the jobs market reacts to policy and public health announcements and policy makers will hope the eventual unwinding of Covid-19 restrictions will help level up the jobs recovery.""

Son helped billionaire father hide divorce money,"Tatiana Akhmedova says her ex-husband tried to drive a wedge between her and her son The son of a Russian billionaire helped his father hide millions of pounds from his mother after a divorce settlement, a London High Court judge has ruled. Tatiana Akhmedova, who is Russian but lives in London, should have received Â£453m following a ruling in 2017. But having only received Â£5m, she sued her ex-husband, accusing him of trying to conceal his wealth. She also sued her eldest son who she said had been his father's ""lieutenant"" and actively assisted his schemes. Ruling in Ms Akhmedova's favour, Mrs Justice Knowles quoted Tolstoy, saying: ""All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. ""With apologies to Tolstoy, the Akhmedov family is one of the unhappiest ever to have appeared in my courtroom."" Tycoon wins $436m superyacht in divorce Ex-wife gets Â£453m divorce payout Judges heard that Farkhad Akhmedov, a 65-year-old businessman, had not ""voluntarily"" paid a penny of the divorce settlement -thought to be the biggest award of its kind made in the UK. They heard that he transferred a superyacht, the Luna, worth around Â£340m, and an art collection worth around Â£110m into the ownership of trusts in Liechtenstein. In a WhatsApp message disclosed during legal proceedings, Mr Akhmedov told his son that he would ""burn"" all of his wealth rather than give it to her. Temur replied, saying he agreed, adding that she ""didn't deserve"" a penny. Farkhad Akhmedov was sued by his ex-wife, along with his son Temur In her judgment at the High Court in London on Wednesday, Mrs Justice Knowles ordered Farkhad Akhmedov, and a network of companies he had used to hide his wealth, to hand over hundreds of millions of pounds to his ex-wife. The judge also said very large sums had been transferred to Temur, a London trader, and concluded he must pay his mother around Â£75 million. The judge said Temur was an ""untruthful and unsatisfactory witness who lied in respect of various aspects of his evidence"". ""Temur has learned well from his father's past conduct and has done and said all he could to prevent his mother receiving a penny of the matrimonial assets,"" she said. ""I find that he is a dishonest individual who will do anything to assist his father, no doubt because he is utterly dependent on his father for financial support."" In a statement, Ms Akhmedova said that her ex-husband's behaviour had ""left a trail of destruction and pain in his wake"" and had attempted to drive a ""wedge"" between her and her son. She added: ""Today's judgement is the inevitable conclusion given Farkhad's failure to behave honourably in the first instance."" Farkhad Akhmedov said: ""Entirely predictably, given its original wrong and misguided judgment, the London court has ruled in favour of visiting 'the sins' of the father on an innocent and loyal son."" A spokesman for his son said: ""Like millions of young people, Temur has been caught up in the break-up of his parents' marriage. He never sought to take sides or get involved but inevitably found himself sucked into the vortex of a bitter family dispute. ""His subsequent actions were only ever motivated by his desire to end the war between his parents.""

UK's Â£500m humanitarian aid cuts a 'tragic blow',"Charities said countries ""ravaged"" by disease, war and poverty were among those losing aid Cuts to humanitarian aid by the UK are a ""tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people"", 200 charities said in a joint statement. Organisations including Save the Children and Oxfam said humanitarian assistance was being reduced by more than Â£500m. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the changes reflected a ""strategic shift"" in UK aid spending. He also said the Â£18m aid budget given to China will be reduced to Â£900,000. Following the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis,the chancellor cut the foreign aid budgetfrom 0.7% to 0.5% of total national income - a reduction of around Â£4bn. The Foreign Office controls 80% of aid spending - Â£8bn - and the priorities were set out by Mr Raab in a written statement. More than Â£1bn will be spent on Covid and global health, Â£500m towards tackling climate change and Â£400m on getting girls into education. Charity warns UK aid to see 63% cut in funding UK's foreign aid spending cut by Â£2.9bn Aid cut likely to last for 'foreseeable future' Mr Raab said it was a ""challenging financial climate"" due to Covid-19, but said the government had sought ""maximum strategic coherence, impact and value for taxpayers' money"". But aid charities said even the priority areas were receiving less than before, and Â£500m less was being spent on humanitarian aid. The 200 charities, which also include Christian Aid and Care International, said: ""Today's announcement is a tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people the UK once supported, and for the UK's reputation as a trusted development partner. ""The government has not even spared countries ravaged by humanitarian crisis, disease, war and poverty."" Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, accused the government of ""making cuts with no consideration for the human harm they will cause"" after reducing aid in Yemen, ""the world's biggest humanitarian crisis"". The government announced it was cutting foreign aid last November but it has still to say precisely where the axe will fall. Charities are waiting anxiously to see which programmes will lose funding, and which will survive. But we are getting some indications from government now about its priorities: climate change, Covid and global health, girls' education, supporting open societies, trade and economic development and so on. The numbers announced by the Foreign Office allow charities to calculate how much less will be spent on each area than before. That will help them plan. What these numbers will not do is diminish the controversy. Ministers argue the decision to cut aid has been made, it is time to decide how best to make it happen. But aid charities and many MPs - including a goodly number of Conservatives - still oppose the cuts and are working to stop them. Plans for a legal challenge are being considered. Critics say the government can't ignore a legally binding targetto spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. The FCDO reckons it can make the cuts without holding a vote to change the law. Campaigners might want a judge to decide who is right. For now, the government is pressing ahead with cuts it says are needed to keep the Treasury in funds for other priorities. Of the Â£8bn, the Foreign Office will give more than Â£3bn to multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank. Half of all UK bilateral aid will be spent in Africa, a third in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia. The remaining humanitarian aid budget, focused on countries most at risk of famine such as Yemen, Syria, Somalia and South Sudan, is Â£906m. Mr Raab also announced he would cut Foreign Office aid to China by 95%, to Â£900,000. But other parts of government, such as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, give more aid to China and have yet to say if they will cut their payments too. Charity warns UK aid to see 63% cut in funding Archbishop Welby warns against foreign aid cuts Aid cut likely to last for 'foreseeable future' UK's foreign aid spending cut by Â£2.9bn Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction Warning on gas prices as cold snap hits supplies UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

Man with no licence led police on 110mph chase,"The 25-minute pursuit ended when Hercules lost control and crashed into a ditch A man who never held a driving licence fled from police he wrongly believed were after him in a 110mph car chase. Tracy Hercules, 22, sped away when he saw a patrol car approach with its blue lights and siren on. The officers, who had been heading to an unrelated call, gave chase, pursuing Hercules for 25 minutes until he crashed into a ditch. Hercules, who admitted dangerous driving, was jailed for eight months at Lincoln Crown Court. Edna Leonard, prosecuting, told the court the defendant had pulled out in front of the police car near Spalding, Lincolnshire, on 8 March. He then drove at speeds of up to 110mph (177km/h) in a 60mph limit area in a bid to get away, the court was told. ""He twice went through red traffic lights and caused other drivers to take evasive action to avoid a collision,"" Ms Leonard said. ""At one point he smashed into a traffic bollard while turning right and damaged his vehicle. ""Smoke was coming from the tyres, but Hercules continued driving at high speed through Baston [village] at 60mph in a 30-limit area, causing fear to two pedestrians,"" she told the court. Police later deployed a stinger, but the defendant drove through it, again travelling at speed before losing control and ending up in a ditch, the prosecutor added. Hercules emerged uninjured and was arrested. Recorder Charles Falk, passing sentence, told him: ""This was seriously bad driving. ""You put your life in danger, the lives of police officers in danger and the lives of members of the public in danger."" Hercules, of Wellington Way, Market Deeping, admitted charges of dangerous driving, having no licence or insurance and possession of cannabis. He was also issued with a 22-month driving ban.

"Chanel loses EU court battle over Huawei logoThe EU General Court ruled that the differences between the firms' logos ""are significant"".Business","Fashion label Chanel has lost an EU court battle with Chinese technology firm Huawei over its famous logo. Judges ruled in favour of Huawei, which had sought an EU-wide trademark for a logo it wanted to use, but the fashion house said it was too similar. The EU General Court in Luxembourg ruled on Wednesday that the logos ""share some similarities but their visual differences are significant"". It found that Chanel's logo had more rounded curves and thicker lines. In 2017, the Chinese technology firm had applied for EU trademark protection for a logo it would use for computer hardware. French firm Chanel opposed the bid, arguing the two vertical intertwining semi-circles were too similar to its protected logo, which it uses to sell make-up, perfumes, clothing and accessories. Bentley v Bentley: Car firm loses appeal against trademark ruling Herefordshire 'little guy' flat after Bridgestone row Hugo Boss drops Scouse slogan trademark action Two years ago, the EU Intellectual Property Office dismissed Chanel's objection, saying there was no similarity and the public were not likely to be confused by the two. Chanel then challenged the ruling at the General Court, which dismissed the appeal on Wednesday. ""The figurative marks at issue are not similar. The marks must be compared as applied for and registered, without altering their orientation,"" the tribunal of judges said. ""In particular, Chanel's marks have more rounded curves, thicker lines and a horizontal orientation, whereas the orientation of the Huawei mark is vertical. Consequently, the General Court concludes that the marks are different,"" it said. The latest decision can also be appealed to the European Court of Justice. Chanel declined to comment on the ruling.

Terror attacker shouted 'I'm going to blow you up',"Darryn Frost pursued Khan on to London Bridge armed with a narwhal tusk which he had taken from a wall A former prisoner sprayed a fire extinguisher to try and stop a terror attacker who was shouting he would ""blow you all up"", an inquest heard. John Crilly described how he tackled Usman Khan, who was armed with knives and what appeared to be a suicide belt. Khan killed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones and attacked others at Fishmongers' Hall on 29 November 2019. Another witness said he thought ""everyone was dead"" after later hearing what he thought was the belt exploding. Mr Crilly, who attended a prisoner education conference at the venue, was one of three men who tried to tackle Khan, another of them armed with a narwhal tusk taken from inside. He knew Jack Merritt through the Learning Together programme. Recalling the moment he came face to face with an armed Khan inside the building, he said: ""He had two big knives on his hands, there was no missing them."" Hall porter 'stabbed terror attacker with spear' Terror witness thought killer was 'play-fighting' Office manager begged terrorist not to stab her The inquests into the deaths of Ms Jones, 23, and Mr Merritt, 25, heard Mr Crilly describe Khan as ""shouting and jumping about like a loon. He was going nuts, shouting Allahu Akbar"". ""As I got closer I could see the [suicide] belt, pretty clearly. Like a black bodybuilder-belt with bits stuck to it, bits of iron, bits of silver, a contraption,"" he said. Former prisoner John Crilly described how he tackled Usman Khan at Fishmongers' Hall Answering Jonathan Hough QC, counsel to the inquiry, Mr Crilly described how he tried to ""distract"" Khan and ""call his bluff"". ""I was hoping it [the belt] was fake. He started shouting and saying things like: 'I'm going to blow you all up,' so I said 'blow it then'. ""He said, 'I'm waiting for the police'."" Mr Crilly said he tried without success to stop Khan using a series of makeshift weapons including an ornamental chair, before he picked up a fire extinguisher to tackle the armed suspect. Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed by Usman Khan during the conference on rehabilitating offenders He continued: ""I just sprayed him with it, it seemed to have an effect on him - like, blinded him. ""He started running through the foam so I thought I'd have to back off and spray him again."" Mr Crilly was among the three men who followed as Khan went outside onto London Bridge. ""He looked back and would try and stab one of us. The three of us would be swapping places,"" he said. He described how he first hit Khan in the head with the extinguisher and then ""grabbed his hands and tried to wrestle the knife off him"". The Guildhall heard Khan had been wearing a fake suicide vest Darryn Frost, a communications manager within the Prison and Probation Service, was also at the event and told the jury hearing ""screams"" was his ""call to action"". He said he grabbed a narwhal tusk from the wall and ran towards another delegate, Steve Gallant, who appeared to be trying to keep Khan ""at bay"" with ""an old mahogany chair"". He explained how after he hit Khan in the stomach with the tusk, he passed it to Mr Gallant and went to grab another one before chasing the terrorist out of the hall. Once on London Bridge, Mr Frost again struck the attacker with the tusk as he, Mr Crilly and Mr Gallant, fought with Khan. ""As he ran towards me I thrust it into him. I don't think he expected to be struck by this. The force of it made him kind of buckle over,"" he said. He described how Mr Crilly then used the fire extinguisher again and an unarmed Mr Gallant forced Khan to the ground. Usman Khan had been jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange ""I dropped the narwhal tusk and jumped onto the assailant,"" he explained. Mr Frost told the inquests when police arrived and told people to leave Khan, he continued to hold him down as he did not want him to be shot. He said police again shouted for him to run away but ""they didn't know how he had a bomb and that he had threatened to set it off when police arrived, so I refused to move. I wouldn't leave Khan alone."" Once he had finally been pulled away by an officer Mr Frost said he ""three cracks and an echo"", which he thought was the bomb going off. ""I thought then that everyone was dead,"" he said. Mr Gallant, then an inmate at HMP Springhill, told the inquests Khan had ""moved towards me, pulled back his coat, and showed me his bomb. ""It looked fake, I chose to ignore it,"" he said. He described how he first used a narwhal tusk to ""whack"" the terrorist and then hurled a chair. Once on London Bridge, Mr Gallant said he ""somehow"" managed to grab Khan and hold him to the ground. The former prisoner added he ""waited for my moment"" to let go of Khan once police had arrived. ""I heard some shots. And then I turned and I saw Usman, ""I thought I had seen him reach to his belt or the middle of his body, try to get up, then he was shot again and Tasered,"" he said.

TikTok loophole sees users post gore and porn,"TikTok is banning users who are posting pornographic and violent videos as their profile pictures to circumvent moderation, in a unique viral trend. BBC News alerted the app to the ""Don't search this up,"" craze, which has accumulated nearly 50 million views. TikTok has also banned the hashtags used to promote the offending profiles and is deleting the videos. Users say the trend is encouraging pranksters to post the most offensive or disgusting material they can find. BBC News has seen clips of hardcore pornography shared as profile pictures on the app, as well as an Islamic State group video of the murder of Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh, burned to death in a cage in 2015. Tom, a teenager from Germany, whose surname we have agreed not to use, first contacted BBC News about the trend. He said: ""I've seen gore and hardcore porn and I'm really concerned about this because so many kids use TikTok. ""I find it especially worrying that there are posts with millions of views specifically pointing out these profiles, yet it takes ages for TikTok to act."" Tom added he had reported multiple users to the app for posting the offensive profile-picture videos. On the platform users can put videos as their profile pictures, rather than a still image. Videos about the trend are being posted in English and Spanish languages on the app. The shocking videos are being posted as user profile pictures to circumvent moderation systems The offending accounts are often named with a random jumble of letters and words and have no actual TikTok videos uploaded to them apart from inside the profile box. Some of the accounts have tens of thousands of followers waiting for the profile picture to be changed to something shocking. Regular users are able to find these accounts by watching otherwise mundane TikTok videos advertising usernames people should ""search up"" to find the most shocking clips. And these videos are being recommended by the TikTok algorithm on the app's main For You Page. The offending accounts are being advertised with viral videos challenging people to ""search them up"" Experts say the trend is unique and highlights an unknown vulnerability in TikTok. ""TikTok has a rather positive reputation when it comes to trust and safety so I would not fault them for not having moderation policies and tools for a toxic phenomenon they were not aware of,""  Roi Carthy, from social-media moderation company L1ght, said. ""Clearly TikTok is working to stop this trend - but for users, as always, vigilance is key. ""TikTok fans should be conscious of the risks on the platform and parents should make an effort to learn what new apps their children are using, along with the content and human dynamics they are exposed to."" How did TikTok grow to 800 million users? Body-editing apps âtrigger eating disordersâ TikTok alters virtual gifts policy after BBC probe TikTok is one of the world's fastest growing apps, with an estimated 700 million monthly active users around the world. A spokesman for the company said: ""We have permanently banned accounts that attempted to circumvent our rules via their profile photo and we have disabled hashtags including #dontsearchthisup. ""Our safety team is continuing their analysis and we will continue to take all necessary steps to keep our community safe."" Disabling a hashtag meant the term could not be found in search or created again, TikTok added. Its moderation teams are also understood to be analysing and removing similar copycat terms being used for the trend. BBC News tried to speak to one user who posted an explicit video to their profile but did not receive a response.

House sales and prices see early spring surgeUK property transactions in March hit the highest monthly level since modern records began in 2005.BusinessComments,"House sales and property prices recorded an early spring surge amid government moves to stimulate the housing market. Data fromHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC),externalshows that UK property transactions in March hit the highest monthly level since modern records began in 2005. The housing market has been relatively immune to the Covid crisis as people reconsider where they want to live. Official data also shows average UK house prices rose 8.6% in a year. There were 180,690 UK property sales in March, the non-seasonally adjusted HMRC figures show, which was more than double the number in March last year and 50% higher than February. How Covid has changed where we want to live Home movers 'have a spring in their step' When does the stamp duty holiday extension end? Stamp duty holidays across the UK were set to finish at the end of March, but announcements - including in the Budget on 4 March - extended these deadlines in England, Wales and Northern Ireland into the summer. A new guarantee scheme for low-deposit mortgages in the UK was also announced in the Budget. Thesehome loans are now available. ""What will be interesting to see is whether this growth is sustainable or simply a reaction to the stamp duty holiday. The next three months will give us a better indication of this,"" said Gareth Lewis, commercial director at property lender MT Finance. ""As much as this latest lockdown in particular has been hard, it is encouraging that people have not hunkered down and retreated but carried on with their plans to move."" That demand for moving home will not be cheered by many first-time buyers who have now seen property prices record their highest annual growth rate in more than six years. TheOffice for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalaverage house prices increased over the year to the end of February in England to Â£268,000 (up 8.7%), in Wales to Â£180,000 (up 8.4%), in Scotland to Â£162,000 (up 8%) and in Northern Ireland to Â£148,000 (up 5.3%).

Club owners apologise for Super League plan,"Man Utd's Joel Glazer and Liverpool owner John W Henry have apologised to fans Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer says the club ""apologise unreservedly for the unrest"" caused by the proposed European Super League. The rare public comment from the American came after Liverpool owner John W Henry apologised to supporters. United, Liverpool and four other Premier League sideswithdrewfrom the ESL on Tuesday after a backlash. ""We failed to show enough respect for its deep-rooted traditions,"" Glazer said in an open letter to fans. The 50-year-old admitted efforts ""in seeking to create a more stable foundation for the game"" did not honour the conventions of promotion and relegation within the wider football pyramid. ""For that we are sorry,"" he said. ""This is the world's greatest football club and we apologise unreservedly for the unrest caused during these past few days. ""Manchester United has a rich heritage and we recognise our responsibility to live up to its great traditions and values."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone said: ""It is rare indeed for Glazer to speak about United. He has done one interview with MUTV at the time of the takeover in 2005 - and that is it."" European Super League Q&A: Why it failed - and will clubs try again? Glazer said they will work to ""rebuild relationships"" across football ""with a view to working together on solutions to the long-term challenges facing the football pyramid"". ""We also realise that we need to better communicate with you, our fans, because you will always be at the heart of the club,"" he continued. The Duke of Cambridge, who is president of the Football Association, said in a tweet that he is pleased that football supporters' opposition to the ESL had been ""heard and listened to"".

Earlier on Wednesday, Henry took sole responsibility for the ""unnecessary negativity"", saying: ""In this endeavour I've let you down. ""The project put forward was never going to stand without the support of the fans. ""Over these 48 hours you were very clear that it would not stand. We heard you. I heard you."" Ferran Soriano, chief executive of Premier League leaders Manchester City - another of the English clubs involved in the proposal - apologised in an email to the club's supporters. ""We failed to remind ourselves of the unbreakable link between the passion of our fans and the right to have the opportunity to earn success. It is a truth that is fundamental to the DNA of Manchester City and the board deeply regrets taking a decision that lost sight of the historic values of the club,"" he said. ""We made a mistake and we sincerely apologise to our fans for the disappointment, frustration and anguish caused by the last 72 hours."" This video can not be played Liverpool owner John W Henry apologises in message to fans In other developments on Wednesday: Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli admitted the project could not proceed after the Premier League clubs withdrew. AC Milan, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid followed suit, taking the total withdrawals to nine. Rival managers, chairmen and officials called for tighter regulations and possible punishments for the six English clubs. Before Liverpool's statement confirming the club's withdrawal, captain Jordan Henderson had said on social media his side's ""collective position"" was that they did not want the breakaway to go ahead. ""We don't like it and we don't want it to happen,"" read a message that was also posted by many fellow Liverpool players. All six Premier League teams withdraw from European Super League 'Big Six owners must beg for forgiveness after abysmal European Super League plan How football's volatile 72 hours unfolded Reds manager Jurgen Klopp and midfielder James Milner also voiced their opposition to the plans after their Premier League game at Leeds on Monday. In avideo released by Liverpool,,externalHenry also apologised to Klopp, the players and chief executive Billy Hogan, promising to do all he could to win back the supporters' trust. ""They have absolutely no responsibility for this disruption,"" added Henry. ""They were the most disrupted, and unfairly so. This is what hurts most. They love your club and work to make you proud every single day."" Manchester UnitedSupporters' Trust chief executive Duncan Drasdo told BBC Sport: ""Driven from the Manchester United owners, it has tarnished the club. It has been damaged and there's been huge damage to the relationship with owners at a lot of these clubs and in some cases irreparable and they will need to do something to try to turn that around. "" In a statement,Liverpoolsupporters group Spirit of Shankly said Henry's apology was a ""PR exercise"" that was ""too little, too late"". It added: ""We need a fundamental change in football governance. One that is fair for the whole football pyramid, not just the rapacious elite."" Former Liverpool winger John Barnes went as far as suggesting a salary cap needed to be introduced to ensure ""a level playing field"" for every team in the Premier League. The Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) say they have ""little or no confidence"" in the club's board after its involvement in the ESL and said the positions of chairman Bruce Buck and chief executive Guy Laurence were ""untenable"". In their statement CST also say Buck defended the Super League to fans during a forum on Monday evening. The club withdrew its plans to join the Super League 24 hours later after witnessing the negative reaction from supporters and fears about the reputational damage it could do to the club. But the CST statement said: ""We are disappointed that an apology has not been included in the statement. The legacy of our club was put at risk for what appears to have been solely for financial gain."" Southamptonboss Ralph Hasenhuttl said:  ""I think it was nearly the worst idea I ever heard. It underestimated the power of the fans and how much they love football and it is for everybody. We are all happy the first battle is won but I think it is not over yet. "" Crystal Palacechairman Steve Parish told BBC Breakfast the ESL plans were an ""attempted coup"" and added: ""What Uefa need to do is start looking after the game and stop pandering to these people and trying desperately to keep them inside the tent because they're going to be inside the tent now whatever happens."" Brightonchief executive Paul Barber said the rules needed to be ""tightened significantly"" to make sure this never happened again.

Ch Insp James Ratti says he is ""appealing to the better nature"" of local young people, and pleaded with those thinking of attending""to please reconsider and avoid doing so this weekend"". The UK government has announced it's setting up anew taskforce to investigate antiviral treatmentscoronavirus patients can take at home. It says the aim is to identify at least two effective treatments this year, in the form of pills, to help people fight off early Covid symptoms. Alongside Covid-19 vaccines, a number of drugs are being tested as possible treatments for people who already have the disease. Most of these are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus. So what work is being done to find treatments, and what other drugs have been trialled? Find out here. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been administered to more than seven million people in the US Problems including peeling paint and
loose debris have been found during inspections at a US plant in Baltimore
that makes coronavirus vaccines, the US Food and Drug Administration has said. Emergent Biosolutions, which owns the plant, stopped production at the plant recently, saying the
FDA had asked it to do so after an inspection. The FDA said its inspections were complete and in a report
detailed a long list of problems, including failure
to train personnel to avoid cross contamination of Covid-19
vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca,
which were made at the site. The inspection, carried out between 12 and 20 April,
found the building was not of the suitable size or design to
facilitate cleaning, maintenance or proper operations. Reuters, which reported the news, said Emergent was not immediately available for comment. Johnson & Johnson said it would ensure all of the FDA's observations were addressed ""promptly and comprehensively"". No vaccine manufactured at the plant has been distributed
for use in the US.  Australia has been one of the world's success stories in its fight against Covid-19, but frustration is growing over its delayed vaccination rollout. The country has been slower than most others to immunise its population, with some high-risk groups crying out for protection. Last month, it fell 85% short of its own target - and the lack of clarity around the process has been criticised. Supply shortages and delivery problems have been blamed for the delays. And while steps have been taken to speed up the programme - such as mass immunisation hubs and investment in local production - the government is seeing its success so far in battling Covid tarnished by its sluggish vaccination effort. We look here at what's gone wrong with Australia's vaccine rollout. A cupcake maker that supplies major supermarket chains has had an outbreak of Covid at its factory. The Cake Crew says 42 members of staff have tested positive for the virus at the production facility in Bala, Gwynedd, in North Wales. The firm employs 330 people making over a million cupcakes a week. It said those identified and their contacts were now self-isolating. A joint incident response team includes the company, health board officials and Public Health Wales, and both Gwynedd and Shropshire councils. Here's the full story. Leo Varadkar said it would be ""unfortunate"" if Dublin cannot host games for the delayed Euros Dublin looks set to miss out on hosting matches at the delayed Euro 2020 this summer after the Irish government conceded it does not expect to meet Uefa's demand of filling stadiums to 25% capacity. The tournament is due to be hosted in 12 cities across Europe from June, with Uefa set to make a decision on Munich, Bilbao and Dublin on Friday. Those three cities have been unable to guarantee spectator attendance. ""We think June is too soon,"" says Irish deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar. ""I think if they continue to insist on [having 25% of the stadium full], it'll be hard for it to go ahead quite frankly, which is unfortunate."" While the Republic of Ireland has one of Europe's lowest incidence rates of Covid-19, the government plans to reopen sectors very gradually with most shops due to stay shut until at least May and hotels potentially only opening in June. Read more  A lorry carrying the vaccines entered Idlib via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey The first batch of coronavirus vaccines has arrived in opposition-held
north-western Syria. Some 54,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine supplied
through the global Covax facility have arrived in Idlib province today via
the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. Health authorities in both opposition- and government-controlled
areas of the north-west have initially requested enough vaccines to cover 20%
of their populations, or 855,000 people, via Covax. Phase one of the roll-out is expected to begin in early
May and will include medical personnel and people aged over 60 with high-risk health
conditions. More than 20,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 640 deaths
have been reported in north-western Syria since the pandemic started.
Infections are now reported to be on the rise again, after a lull. Idlib is the last stronghold of the rebel and jihadist
groups that have been trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad since 2011.
An estimated 2.7 million displaced people, including a million children, are
living there, many of them in dire conditions in camps. There has been a relative calm in the region since March
2020, when Russia, Assadâs ally, and Turkey, the oppositionâs main backer,
brokered a ceasefire to halt a government offensive. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has today announced it hasadministered more than 200 million vaccine doses,external. After the US, which has delivered 213 million doses, it is the country with the second highest number of vaccinations in the
world. China isaiming to vaccinate 40% of the country's population by the end of June, and has in recent
days been strengthening calls for eligible recipients to get
vaccinated amid concerns that at its current pace of between three and four million a day, it
will not reach that target. Media have repeatedly said the country remains at risk of a domestic outbreak - via infected people entering the country from overseas - unless vaccination is accelerated. Outlets observe the number of new Covid-19
cases worldwide has been rising for eight consecutive weeks. Today, however, the National Health Commission's spokesperson has commented that in China, ""some people have reported that it has been difficult to make an appointment
for a second dose"". On Sina Weibo,
China's version of Facebook or Twitter, users are talking about how that
has been their experience, withcommenters saying that they've still not been notified about when they will receive a second dose,external, or have simply been told a second appointment is currently
not available. It is more
likely this is due to staff shortages than vaccine shortages. China is one
of the world's largest vaccine producers, andit says it has the capacity to provide five billion doses annually,external. The daily figures also show 10,775,817 people have now received both doses of the coronavirus vaccine - an increase of 350,027 compared with yesterday. Some 33,139,742 people have received one dose - an increase of 107,622. The data also shows a further 192 patients have been admitted into hospital. A further 22 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. A further 2,396 cases have been recorded. On Tuesday there were 33 deaths and 2,524 cases. Fitness fans took part in millions of workouts in the week after lockdown restrictions eased in England. The PureGym chain says more than one million workouts took place across its 240 sites to have reopened - but says it suffered ""awful"" losses during the pandemic. David Lloyd Leisure has also told the BBC footfall in its clubs in England has been ""extremely positive"" Huw Edwards, chief executive of industry body UK Active, says the number of people heading back to gyms proves ""how essential these facilities are to our communities and how greatly they've been missed"". ""However, our members suffered huge losses during lockdown and were closed during their busiest months, so thousands of facilities still require greater financial and regulatory support in order to recover,"" he says.Read more on this story here. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin German Chancellor Angela Merkelâs national lockdown law has been passed by parliament. The law forces the country's regions back into tough lockdown once infections exceed a certain level. But the move is controversial because regions say they are being overruled, and the debate was heated. Some opposition politicians say the measures - such as a night-time curfew - are too harsh and will undermine support. Outside on the streets, protesters have been even angrier. Some demonstrators were far-right activists or conspiracy theorists.
Most have refused to wear masks or adhere to distancing rules, so police ordered the protesters to disperse. But a majority of politicians believe tougher measures are needed - and polls show that most voters agree. That's because infection rates have been rising.
Germany hasn't been hit as hard as some other European countries, but scientists warn that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed if tougher measures are not introduced. Tomorrow, the law will be discussed by the Germany's Bundesrat, or upper house, and could be enforced next week. The link between obesity and Covid-19 is a ""wake-up"" call for the nation, a health minister says. Lord Bethell has told peers British people are ""carrying too much weight"" and this is a factor in the pandemic. He has been responding to calls at question time in the Lords to do more to tackle obesity. Lord Bethell says the World Obesity Federation's Covid-19 report makes ""stark reading"" for the UK. ""It's clear that excess weight is one of the few modifiable factors that contribute to severe symptoms of Covid and, very sadly in some cases, to death,"" he says. ""This is a wake-up call. Britain is clearly carrying too much weight. ""That is why the government is committed to helping the country reduce obesity and get fit and healthy."" For the opposition, Baroness Thornton says there have been 14 government obesity strategies since 1992 and, despite 689 policies, obesity rates have risen. Lady Thornton says another major indicator is deprivation, with healthy foods three times more expensive per calorie than less healthy foods. One in five UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, with more than two-and-a-half million second doses delivered in the past seven days, latest figures show. Some 10.8 million people have now received both jabs - the equivalent of 20.5% of the adult population. Wales is estimated to have given two doses to just under a quarter of adults (24.7%), ahead of Northern Ireland (20.5%), England (20.3%) and Scotland (19.1%). The figures are for vaccinations reported by the UK's health agencies up to and including yesterday, 20 April, and reflect the pace at which second doses have been ramped up across the country during the past month. Second doses of Covid-19 vaccines must follow within 12 weeks of the first, meaning the millions of people who received their initial jab in January and early February have recently had a follow-up dose, or are due to get the jab shortly. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawihas tweeted,external: ""Another strong day vaccinating yesterday. We keep going, 1 in 5 adults are now protected with two doses."" Restrictions on weddings have been eased as part of England's lockdown exit plans, and will be relaxed in Scotland from Monday. So what are the rules now and how could they change as restrictions are further eased? Read the rules in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland here. German police have fired tear gas and made several arrests in Berlin as they try to control large crowds of people protesting against a proposed new lockdown law. Thousands of people gathered near the parliament building in the German capital, many without face masks, to demonstrate against a bill that would hand the government the power to override regional authorities and impose strict curfews in areas with high Covid cases. At least seven people were arrested as protesters clashed with officers, police say. Some German media outlets are reporting that as many as 8,000 protesters gathered ahead of the vote in the Bundestag - or the lower house of the German parliament - taking place today. More than 2,000 police officers have reportedly been deployed to the area. Public Health Scotland has said it ""cannot rule out"" a link between patients being discharged from hospital and Covid outbreaks in care homes. It found mortality was high, with Covid associated with 21.6% of deaths within 30 days of discharge to a care home. More than 5,000 patients were sent to care homes between 1 March and 31 May last year - many without a test. This report follows an earlier PHS study that was criticised for not being clear on its findings. The health body said the size of a care home was still the biggest factor in the risk of an outbreak.

Liverpool & Man Utd owners apologise for Super League plan,"Man Utd's Joel Glazer and Liverpool owner John W Henry have apologised to fans Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer says the club ""apologise unreservedly for the unrest"" caused by the proposed European Super League. The rare public comment from the American came after Liverpool owner John W Henry apologised to supporters. United, Liverpool and four other Premier League sideswithdrewfrom the ESL on Tuesday after a backlash. ""We failed to show enough respect for its deep-rooted traditions,"" Glazer said in an open letter to fans. The 50-year-old admitted efforts ""in seeking to create a more stable foundation for the game"" did not honour the conventions of promotion and relegation within the wider football pyramid. ""For that we are sorry,"" he said. ""This is the world's greatest football club and we apologise unreservedly for the unrest caused during these past few days. ""Manchester United has a rich heritage and we recognise our responsibility to live up to its great traditions and values."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone said: ""It is rare indeed for Glazer to speak about United. He has done one interview with MUTV at the time of the takeover in 2005 - and that is it."" European Super League Q&A: Why it failed - and will clubs try again? Glazer said they will work to ""rebuild relationships"" across football ""with a view to working together on solutions to the long-term challenges facing the football pyramid"". ""We also realise that we need to better communicate with you, our fans, because you will always be at the heart of the club,"" he continued. The Duke of Cambridge, who is president of the Football Association, said in a tweet that he is pleased that football supporters' opposition to the ESL had been ""heard and listened to"".

Earlier on Wednesday, Henry took sole responsibility for the ""unnecessary negativity"", saying: ""In this endeavour I've let you down. ""The project put forward was never going to stand without the support of the fans. ""Over these 48 hours you were very clear that it would not stand. We heard you. I heard you."" Ferran Soriano, chief executive of Premier League leaders Manchester City - another of the English clubs involved in the proposal - apologised in an email to the club's supporters. ""We failed to remind ourselves of the unbreakable link between the passion of our fans and the right to have the opportunity to earn success. It is a truth that is fundamental to the DNA of Manchester City and the board deeply regrets taking a decision that lost sight of the historic values of the club,"" he said. ""We made a mistake and we sincerely apologise to our fans for the disappointment, frustration and anguish caused by the last 72 hours."" This video can not be played Liverpool owner John W Henry apologises in message to fans In other developments on Wednesday: Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli admitted the project could not proceed after the Premier League clubs withdrew. AC Milan, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid followed suit, taking the total withdrawals to nine. Rival managers, chairmen and officials called for tighter regulations and possible punishments for the six English clubs. Before Liverpool's statement confirming the club's withdrawal, captain Jordan Henderson had said on social media his side's ""collective position"" was that they did not want the breakaway to go ahead. ""We don't like it and we don't want it to happen,"" read a message that was also posted by many fellow Liverpool players. All six Premier League teams withdraw from European Super League 'Big Six owners must beg for forgiveness after abysmal European Super League plan How football's volatile 72 hours unfolded Reds manager Jurgen Klopp and midfielder James Milner also voiced their opposition to the plans after their Premier League game at Leeds on Monday. In avideo released by Liverpool,,externalHenry also apologised to Klopp, the players and chief executive Billy Hogan, promising to do all he could to win back the supporters' trust. ""They have absolutely no responsibility for this disruption,"" added Henry. ""They were the most disrupted, and unfairly so. This is what hurts most. They love your club and work to make you proud every single day."" Manchester UnitedSupporters' Trust chief executive Duncan Drasdo told BBC Sport: ""Driven from the Manchester United owners, it has tarnished the club. It has been damaged and there's been huge damage to the relationship with owners at a lot of these clubs and in some cases irreparable and they will need to do something to try to turn that around. "" In a statement,Liverpoolsupporters group Spirit of Shankly said Henry's apology was a ""PR exercise"" that was ""too little, too late"". It added: ""We need a fundamental change in football governance. One that is fair for the whole football pyramid, not just the rapacious elite."" Former Liverpool winger John Barnes went as far as suggesting a salary cap needed to be introduced to ensure ""a level playing field"" for every team in the Premier League. The Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) say they have ""little or no confidence"" in the club's board after its involvement in the ESL and said the positions of chairman Bruce Buck and chief executive Guy Laurence were ""untenable"". In their statement CST also say Buck defended the Super League to fans during a forum on Monday evening. The club withdrew its plans to join the Super League 24 hours later after witnessing the negative reaction from supporters and fears about the reputational damage it could do to the club. But the CST statement said: ""We are disappointed that an apology has not been included in the statement. The legacy of our club was put at risk for what appears to have been solely for financial gain."" Southamptonboss Ralph Hasenhuttl said:  ""I think it was nearly the worst idea I ever heard. It underestimated the power of the fans and how much they love football and it is for everybody. We are all happy the first battle is won but I think it is not over yet. "" Crystal Palacechairman Steve Parish told BBC Breakfast the ESL plans were an ""attempted coup"" and added: ""What Uefa need to do is start looking after the game and stop pandering to these people and trying desperately to keep them inside the tent because they're going to be inside the tent now whatever happens."" Brightonchief executive Paul Barber said the rules needed to be ""tightened significantly"" to make sure this never happened again. When asked whether the six English clubs should be punished with points deductions, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that was ""certainly something the Premier League and Football Association need to look at"".

China's version of Facebook or Twitter, users are talking about how that
has been their experience, withcommenters saying that they've still not been notified about when they will receive a second dose,external, or have simply been told a second appointment is currently

likely this is due to staff shortages than vaccine shortages. China is one

Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin German Chancellor Angela Merkelâs national lockdown law has been passed by parliament. The law forces the country's regions back into tough lockdown once infections exceed a certain level. But the move is controversial because regions say they are being overruled, and the debate was heated. Some opposition politicians say the measures - such as a night-time curfew - are too harsh and will undermine support. Outside on the streets, protesters have been even angrier. Some demonstrators were far-right activists or conspiracy theorists.
Most have refused to wear masks or adhere to distancing rules, so police ordered the protesters to disperse. But a majority of politicians believe tougher measures are needed - and polls show that most voters agree. That's because infection rates have been rising.
Germany hasn't been hit as hard as some other European countries, but scientists warn that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed if tougher measures are not introduced. Tomorrow, the law will be discussed by the Germany's Bundesrat, or upper house, and could be enforced next week. The link between obesity and Covid-19 is a ""wake-up"" call for the nation, a health minister says. Lord Bethell has told peers British people are ""carrying too much weight"" and this is a factor in the pandemic. He has been responding to calls at question time in the Lords to do more to tackle obesity. Lord Bethell says the World Obesity Federation's Covid-19 report makes ""stark reading"" for the UK. ""It's clear that excess weight is one of the few modifiable factors that contribute to severe symptoms of Covid and, very sadly in some cases, to death,"" he says. ""This is a wake-up call. Britain is clearly carrying too much weight. ""That is why the government is committed to helping the country reduce obesity and get fit and healthy."" For the opposition, Baroness Thornton says there have been 14 government obesity strategies since 1992 and, despite 689 policies, obesity rates have risen. Lady Thornton says another major indicator is deprivation, with healthy foods three times more expensive per calorie than less healthy foods. One in five UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, with more than two-and-a-half million second doses delivered in the past seven days, latest figures show. Some 10.8 million people have now received both jabs - the equivalent of 20.5% of the adult population. Wales is estimated to have given two doses to just under a quarter of adults (24.7%), ahead of Northern Ireland (20.5%), England (20.3%) and Scotland (19.1%). The figures are for vaccinations reported by the UK's health agencies up to and including yesterday, 20 April, and reflect the pace at which second doses have been ramped up across the country during the past month. Second doses of Covid-19 vaccines must follow within 12 weeks of the first, meaning the millions of people who received their initial jab in January and early February have recently had a follow-up dose, or are due to get the jab shortly. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawihas tweeted,external: ""Another strong day vaccinating yesterday. We keep going, 1 in 5 adults are now protected with two doses.""

German police have fired tear gas and made several arrests in Berlin as they try to control large crowds of people protesting against a proposed new lockdown law. Thousands of people gathered near the parliament building in the German capital, many without face masks, to demonstrate against a bill that would hand the government the power to override regional authorities and impose strict curfews in areas with high Covid cases. At least seven people were arrested as protesters clashed with officers, police say. Some German media outlets are reporting that as many as 8,000 protesters gathered ahead of the vote in the Bundestag - or the lower house of the German parliament - taking place today. More than 2,000 police officers have reportedly been deployed to the area. Public Health Scotland has said it ""cannot rule out"" a link between patients being discharged from hospital and Covid outbreaks in care homes. It found mortality was high, with Covid associated with 21.6% of deaths within 30 days of discharge to a care home. More than 5,000 patients were sent to care homes between 1 March and 31 May last year - many without a test. This report follows an earlier PHS study that was criticised for not being clear on its findings. The health body said the size of a care home was still the biggest factor in the risk of an outbreak.

These charts show how hospitalisations have dropped and that second doses have become the main focus of the vaccination programme. Swansea beach Potential beach partygoers have been warned not to flout Covid-19 rules or they could face police action. South Wales Police says it is aware of messages on social media about a gathering on a Swansea beach.

Ch Insp James Ratti says he is ""appealing to the better nature"" of local young people, and pleaded with those thinking of attending""to please reconsider and avoid doing so this weekend"". The UK government has announced it's setting up anew taskforce to investigate antiviral treatmentscoronavirus patients can take at home. It says the aim is to identify at least two effective treatments this year, in the form of pills, to help people fight off early Covid symptoms. Alongside Covid-19 vaccines, a number of drugs are being tested as possible treatments for people who already have the disease. Most of these are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus. So what work is being done to find treatments, and what other drugs have been trialled? Find out here. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been administered to more than seven million people in the US Problems including peeling paint and
loose debris have been found during inspections at a US plant in Baltimore
that makes coronavirus vaccines, the US Food and Drug Administration has said. Emergent Biosolutions, which owns the plant, stopped production at the plant recently, saying the
FDA had asked it to do so after an inspection. The FDA said its inspections were complete and in a report
detailed a long list of problems, including failure
to train personnel to avoid cross contamination of Covid-19
vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca,
which were made at the site. The inspection, carried out between 12 and 20 April,
found the building was not of the suitable size or design to
facilitate cleaning, maintenance or proper operations. Reuters, which reported the news, said Emergent was not immediately available for comment. Johnson & Johnson said it would ensure all of the FDA's observations were addressed ""promptly and comprehensively"". No vaccine manufactured at the plant has been distributed
for use in the US.  Australia has been one of the world's success stories in its fight against Covid-19, but frustration is growing over its delayed vaccination rollout. The country has been slower than most others to immunise its population, with some high-risk groups crying out for protection. Last month, it fell 85% short of its own target - and the lack of clarity around the process has been criticised. Supply shortages and delivery problems have been blamed for the delays. And while steps have been taken to speed up the programme - such as mass immunisation hubs and investment in local production - the government is seeing its success so far in battling Covid tarnished by its sluggish vaccination effort. We look here at what's gone wrong with Australia's vaccine rollout. A cupcake maker that supplies major supermarket chains has had an outbreak of Covid at its factory. The Cake Crew says 42 members of staff have tested positive for the virus at the production facility in Bala, Gwynedd, in North Wales. The firm employs 330 people making over a million cupcakes a week. It said those identified and their contacts were now self-isolating. A joint incident response team includes the company, health board officials and Public Health Wales, and both Gwynedd and Shropshire councils. Here's the full story. Leo Varadkar said it would be ""unfortunate"" if Dublin cannot host games for the delayed Euros Dublin looks set to miss out on hosting matches at the delayed Euro 2020 this summer after the Irish government conceded it does not expect to meet Uefa's demand of filling stadiums to 25% capacity. The tournament is due to be hosted in 12 cities across Europe from June, with Uefa set to make a decision on Munich, Bilbao and Dublin on Friday. Those three cities have been unable to guarantee spectator attendance. ""We think June is too soon,"" says Irish deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar. ""I think if they continue to insist on [having 25% of the stadium full], it'll be hard for it to go ahead quite frankly, which is unfortunate."" While the Republic of Ireland has one of Europe's lowest incidence rates of Covid-19, the government plans to reopen sectors very gradually with most shops due to stay shut until at least May and hotels potentially only opening in June.

north-western Syria. Some 54,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine supplied
through the global Covax facility have arrived in Idlib province today via
the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. Health authorities in both opposition- and government-controlled
areas of the north-west have initially requested enough vaccines to cover 20%
of their populations, or 855,000 people, via Covax. Phase one of the roll-out is expected to begin in early
May and will include medical personnel and people aged over 60 with high-risk health
conditions. More than 20,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 640 deaths
have been reported in north-western Syria since the pandemic started.
Infections are now reported to be on the rise again, after a lull. Idlib is the last stronghold of the rebel and jihadist
groups that have been trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad since 2011.
An estimated 2.7 million displaced people, including a million children, are
living there, many of them in dire conditions in camps. There has been a relative calm in the region since March
2020, when Russia, Assadâs ally, and Turkey, the oppositionâs main backer,
brokered a ceasefire to halt a government offensive. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has today announced it hasadministered more than 200 million vaccine doses,external.

House sales and prices see early spring surge,"House sales and property prices recorded an early spring surge amid government moves to stimulate the housing market. Data fromHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC),externalshows that UK property transactions in March hit the highest monthly level since modern records began in 2005. The housing market has been relatively immune to the Covid crisis as people reconsider where they want to live. Official data also shows average UK house prices rose 8.6% in a year. There were 180,690 UK property sales in March, the non-seasonally adjusted HMRC figures show, which was more than double the number in March last year and 50% higher than February. How Covid has changed where we want to live Home movers 'have a spring in their step' When does the stamp duty holiday extension end? Stamp duty holidays across the UK were set to finish at the end of March, but announcements - including in the Budget on 4 March - extended these deadlines in England, Wales and Northern Ireland into the summer. A new guarantee scheme for low-deposit mortgages in the UK was also announced in the Budget. Thesehome loans are now available.

""As much as this latest lockdown in particular has been hard, it is encouraging that people have not hunkered down and retreated but carried on with their plans to move.""

What is the David Cameron lobbying row about?,"Former Prime Minister David Cameron made about Â£3.3m from shares in the collapsed finance company Greensill Capital, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest. Last month an MPs' report accused Mr Cameron of ""a significant lack of judgement"" in lobbying the government on behalf of the company, although it said he did not break any rules. In 2020, Mr Cameron tried to persuade ministers to allow Greensill - who employed him as an adviser - to join a scheme called the Corporate Covid Financing Facility (CCFF). This would have allowed the company to issue loans, insured by the government, to help firms through the pandemic. However, Mr Cameron - and the company's founder, Lex Greensill - were unsuccessful in their attempts. Greensill Capital collapsed this year, with the loss of 440 jobs, and possible billion-pound losses for investors. Mr Cameron has consistently declined to say how much he was being paid by Greensill, except that it was ""far more"" than his salary as PM. However, BBC's Panorama has obtained a letter from Greensill Capital to the former PM which suggests that he made Â£3.29m after selling a tranche of Greensill shares in 2019. David Cameron 'made $10m' before company's collapse As well as the shares, Mr Cameron is reported to have received a salary of $1m (Â£720,000) a year as a part-time adviser. The programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (Â£504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary. In total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work. Mr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter. Australian banker Lex Greensill originally worked for David Cameron at No 10 in the early 2010s Mr Cameron has been accused of trying to exploit private contacts with former government colleagues, for his own benefit. The former PM used private channels,externalto lobby ministers and former colleagues. He and his staff sent45 emails, texts and WhatsApp messagesconcerning Greensill between 5 March and 26 June 2020. Among these were nine WhatsApp messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and 12 text messages to Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury's top civil servant. The Bank of England haspublished correspondence,externalshowing that Mr Cameron had contacted senior officials several times, in an unsuccessful attempt to win their support. Along with Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019to discuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. A report last month by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said that while no lobbying rules were broken, Mr Cameron's actions showed there was a ""good case for strengthening them"", with the current ones offering ""insufficient strength"". It also said that the Treasury was right to reject the former PM's proposals, but it ""should have encouraged"" him into ""more formal lines of communication as soon as it had identified his personal financial incentives"". ACabinet Office reviewcommissioned by Boris Johnson also criticised Mr Cameron, and said he had understated his relationship with Greensill when lobbying the Treasury. However, it said that ""his actions were not unlawful"". Several other reviews are investigating matters related to lobbying and Greensill. Responding to the Treasury Committee report, Mr Cameron admitted that he should have used more formal channels, but said he had worked for Greensill primarily because he thought the firm could help small businesses during an economic crisis. However, Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner said the fact that Mr Cameron had been cleared of breaking rules proved ""that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose"". Current rules,externalstate that ""on leaving office, ministers will be prohibited from lobbying government for two years"". Before accepting new jobs, former ministers are supposed to inform a body called the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). Acoba advises civil servants and politicians on what they can and can't do after leaving public service. However, although former ministers are required to contact Acoba, they are not obliged to act on its advice. Acoba's head, Lord Pickles, has called for ex-ministers who work as lobbyiststo go on a register for up to 10 years to ensure ""transparency"", The company's collapse earlier this year was triggered after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans Greensill was making. Greensill was theprincipal financial backer of Liberty Steel, which employs 3,000 people in England, Scotland and Wales. Talks are now underwayto try to secure Liberty's future.

"Johnson 'makes no apology' in Dyson lobbying rowSir Keir Starmer accuses the PM of being at the centre of a government beset by ""sleaze"" at PMQs.UK Politics","This video can not be played Starmer: Is it right to change tax rules for Dyson? Boris Johnson said he made ""no apology for moving heaven and earth"" to get ventilators during the pandemic, amid a row over lobbying by Sir James Dyson. In text messages seen by the BBC, the prime minister promised to ""fix"" tax changes the entrepreneur wanted. Mr Johnson said any PM would have done the same in the circumstances, to secure ventilator supplies. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was part of a pattern of government ""sleaze"" centred on the prime minister. Trading verbal blows with Mr Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions, he claimed there was ""one rule for those who have the prime minister's phone number and another for everybody else"". Johnson told Dyson he would 'fix' tax issue What is lobbying? A brief guide Where is the line on lobbying government? The text messages were sent between Sir James and Mr Johnson in March last year, when coronavirus hit the UK. Sir James wanted to ensure that Dyson workers returning to the UK to help with the pandemic response were not penalised by the tax system. This happened after the governmentasked businesses - including Dyson - to helpsupply more ventilators, amid concern about a shortage of the equipment as coronavirus infections increased. In the House of Commons, Mr Johnson insisted he had done the ""right thing"", saying: ""I make absolutely no apology at all for shifting heaven and earth and doing everything I possibly could, as I think any prime minister would in those circumstances, to secure ventilators for the people of this country."" But Sir Keir compared the way Mr Johnson responded to Sir James' concerns with the government's treatment of steelworkers, nurses and three million self-employed people who have been left out of coronavirus support schemes. He claimed there was a ""pattern to this government"". ""Every day there are new allegations about this Conservative government: dodgy PPE deals; tax breaks for their mates; the health secretary owns shares in a company delivering NHS services,"" Sir Keir said. ""Sleaze, sleaze, sleaze, and it's all on his watch."" Mr Johnson took a swipe at Sir Keir, telling MPs: ""Captain Hindsight snipes continually from the sidelines. This government gets on with delivering on the people's priorities."" I understand Number 11 - the chancellor's team - were uneasy about what Sir James Dyson was asking for in his approach to them, and it's suggested they had quite deliberately not responded to his firm's requests before Sir James himself then texted the PM directly about the tax issue. I'm told Chancellor Rishi Sunak did not and has never had any personal contact with Sir James. When it comes to publication of texts, the Treasury set a precedent a few weeks ago, when it published Mr Sunak's texts to David Cameron about Greensill. At PMQs, the prime minister said he would ""share all the details with the House"". But one of the big issues with rules about how ministers are meant to behave is the proliferation of politics being done by text and WhatsApp. Whatever happened in the case between Boris Johnson and Sir James Dyson, the rules contained in the ministerial code don't really cover the reality of how people communicate now. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on Mr Johnson to reveal ""how many more Covid contracts he personally fixed"" and publish all personal exchanges on these contracts. The prime minister said there was ""absolutely nothing to conceal about this"" and that he was ""happy to share"" the details with MPs ""as indeed I have shared them with my officials immediately"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Johnson's text exchanges with Sir James had been ""referenced"" in correspondence sent by Sir James's company ""as evidence of a guarantee they believed they had been given"". The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson had abided by the ministerial code, governing conduct in office, and had ""informed officials in a timely manner"" after his contact with Sir James. He added that he did not know when the prime minister would publish his exchanges with Sir James. Who is the Ted Hastings of Westminster? What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? In March last year, the Department of Health feared the NHS in England could need as many as 20,000 additional ventilators on top of the 5,000 it had - along with an existing 900 to treat children. The prime minister is understood to have called Sir James on 13 March and asked him to participate. Dyson answered the call and said it spent Â£20m on developing its own design -though subsequently the company was not called upon to provide ventilators to the NHS. But the BBC has discovered that Sir James also raised his concerns with the Treasury, and later the prime minister, about rules that could see staff brought into the UK for the project needing to pay tax. In text exchanges seen by the BBC, the PM messaged Sir James saying: ""[Chancellor] Rishi [Sunak] says it is fixed!! We need you here."" When the businessman sought further reassurance for the tax status of the firm and ""senior individuals"", Mr Johnson replied: ""I am First Lord of the Treasury and you can take it that we are backing you to do what you need."" Two weeks later, Mr Sunak told a group of MPs that the tax status of people who came to the UK to provide specific help during the pandemic would not be affected. Sir James said he was ""hugely proud"" of his firm's response in ""the midst of a national emergency"", and that he would ""do the same again if asked"". He said: ""When the prime minister rang me to ask Dyson to urgently build ventilators, of course, I said yes. ""Our ventilator cost Dyson Â£20m, freely given to the national cause, and it is absurd to suggest that the urgent correspondence was anything other than seeking compliance with rules, as 450 Dyson people - in UK and Singapore - worked around the clock, seven days a week to build potentially life-saving equipment at a time of dire need. ""Mercifully, they were not required as medical understanding of the virus evolved. Neither Weybourne (Dyson's holding company) nor Dyson received any benefit from the project; indeed commercial projects were delayed, and Dyson voluntarily covered the Â£20 million of development costs."" Sir James also said his company had not claimed ""one penny"" from governments in any jurisdiction in relation to Covid.

Johnson told Dyson he would 'fix' tax issueThe prime minister and businessman sent text messages over plans for ventilators during the pandemic.UK Politics,"The BBC has seen text exchanges between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and businessman Sir James Dyson Boris Johnson assured Sir James Dyson his employees would not have to pay extra tax if they came to the UK to make ventilators during the pandemic. Sir James, whose firm is now based in Singapore, wrote to the Treasury to ask for no change in tax status for staff. But in text messages sent in March 2020 - seen by the BBC - Sir James then went directly to the PM, with Mr Johnson replying: ""I will fix it."" The government said it did everything it could to get the right equipment. And Sir James said it was ""absurd to suggest that the urgent correspondence was anything other than seeking compliance with rules"" and that his company did not receive ""any benefit from the project"". Labour called the revelations ""jaw-dropping"", with shadow business minister Lucy Powell telling the BBC: ""Frankly it stinks that a billionaire businessman can text the prime minister and get an immediate response and, apparently, an immediate change in policy."" What is lobbying? A brief guide Who is the Ted Hastings of Westminster? What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? In the exchanges, the PM messaged Sir James saying: ""[Chancellor] Rishi [Sunak] says it is fixed!! We need you here."" When the businessman sought further reassurance for the tax status of the firm and ""senior individuals"", the prime minister replied: ""I am First Lord of the Treasury and you can take it that we are backing you to do what you need."" Two weeks later, Mr Sunak told a group of MPs that the tax status of people who came to the UK to provide specific help during the pandemic would not be affected. The company later shared the texts with officials, but it is not clear if Mr Johnson flagged the exchanges with officials as the rules suggest he should. The messages have come to light amidan ongoing row over lobbying in Westminster. According to the ministerial code - a list of rules setting out the standards of conduct expected of ministers - ""a private secretary or official should be present for all discussions relating to government business"". And if a minister ""finds themselves discussing official business without an official present"" - such as at a social event or on holiday - ""any significant content should be passed back to the department as soon as possible after the event"". The code also says ministers ""must act and take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias"" and that they should ""act and take decisions in an open and transparent manner"". But there is widespread concern about informal contacts and lobbying between government and business after the revelations that former Prime Minister David Cameron sent texts to the chancellor and other ministers on behalf of the failed finance firm Greensill Capital. A number of inquiries are being carried out in light of the affair, including by No 10 itself and Commons select committees. Lobbying can be absolutely legitimate. It's part of how Westminster lives and breathes. Who would object to a small charity approaching its local MP to ask for help? There are thousands of different circumstances in which having those discussions is perfectly valid. Sir James was trying to respond to the urgent call for help at the start of the pandemic, when there was deep and genuine fear that the NHS simply wouldn't have the equipment to look after many thousands of patients at risk. But Dyson also, understandably perhaps, wanted to be clear about protecting its business from any extra costs or liabilities. (In the end remember, they lost money from the project.) And the prime minister was heavily involved in efforts to get hold of ventilators and in touch with many businesses as the pandemic took hold. But the rules that govern ministers' behaviour aren't just about what is being discussed, they are about how the conversations are had. Read more from Laura. When coronavirus hit the UK in March 2020, the governmentput out a call to businessesto take part in a ""national effort"" to increase the number of ventilators in the country. At the time, the Department of Health feared the NHS could need as many as 20,000 additional ventilators on top of the 5,000 it had - along with an existing 900 to treat children. The prime minister is understood to have called Sir James on 13 March and asked him to participate.

But the BBC has discovered that Sir James also raised his concerns with the Treasury, and later the prime minister, about rules that could see staff brought into the UK for the project needing to pay tax. Dyson's holding company, Weybourne Limited, wrote an official letter to the chancellor on 15 March 2020 asking him to make sure that HMRC would not change the tax status of companies or individuals who came to the UK to take part in the ventilator project. In the letter, it said: ""Dyson businesses are redeploying resource so that the nation's requirement for medical equipment can be met in the very near term during this period of the national emergency. ""The bulk of this work will be carried out in the UK and will require us to reassign senior individuals currently based outside the UK to work in this country."" It added: ""In this context we would be grateful for your confirmation that HMRC will be instructed not to take points against individual and corporate taxpayers that would otherwise affect their tax positions whilst deployed in the UK."" Dyson also said the measure ""should be publicised and should apply to all persons in the UK (such as non-resident health workers) who are working in the national interest"". When the Treasury did not reply to letter, Sir James raised the issue with Mr Johnson directly via text messages over the subsequent days. On 26 March 2020, the prime minister told Sir James: ""You can take it we are backing you to do what you need."" On 9 April, Mr Sunak confirmed to the Treasury Select Committee that the tax status of people who came to the country for Covid-related projects would not be affected. Dyson created the CoVent ventilator in the height of the pandemic Responding to the exchange, a government spokeswoman told the BBC: ""At the height of the pandemic, there were genuine fears that we would quickly run out of ventilators, leaving the NHS unable to treat patients and putting many lives at risk. ""As the public would expect, we did everything we could in extraordinary times to protect our citizens and get access to the right medical equipment."" Sir James said he was ""hugely proud"" of his firm's response in ""the midst of a national emergency"", and he would ""do the same again if asked"". He added: ""When the prime minister rang me to ask Dyson to urgently build ventilators, of course I said yes.

Sir James also said his company had not claimed ""one penny"" from governments in any jurisdiction, in relation to Covid. For Labour, Ms Powell said: ""It seems that this country only works for people who are rich enough and, frankly, donors to the Tory party, who have got the personal phone numbers of the chancellor or the prime minister."" But former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he found it ""hard to get worked up"" about the contact between Mr Johnson and Sir James, as it had happened ""in the middle of a pandemic"". The government had been ""asking James Dyson to start making ventilators"", he added, saying: ""There's got to be a certain degree of understanding if we are in the middle of a huge crisis like this."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Breakfast: ""In the middle of a national emergency, we had to move fast...that's what the prime minister did in this instance."" He added: ""This went through Parliament in a transparent way. There was an opportunity for MPs to be able to vote on it. And it was indeed a very temporary measure."" Broadly speaking, if you live and work in the UK or if your company is based here, then you have to pay taxes on what you earn to the government. But, if you do not live in the UK and your business is based abroad, you can only work here for a certain number of days before you and/or your company faces a tax bill. The system is known as the statutory residence test or SRT. For an individual who works abroad full-time, the limit is usually 90 days. However, during the pandemic, the government changed the rules so that days spent in the UK between 1 March 2020 and 1 June 2020 would not count in the 90 day tally if they were spent working on Covid projects - such as ventilators.

Solicitors face action over 'quick sale' scheme,"Philip Edwards used the firm to sell his property in Hawarden, Flintshire Two solicitors face disciplinary action over work on an allegedly fraudulent ""quick sale"" property scheme. Wolverhampton-based Kumari-Banga Solicitors' service to homeowners has been investigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). Twelve of their clients have been compensated after they sold homes through speedyproperty.co.uk, including one seller in Flintshire. A representative for the two solicitors said they did not wish to comment. Partners Meena Kumari and Teena Kumari Banga are facing a hearing of the Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT) over allegations they acted in conveyancing transactions they either knew, or should have known, were fraudulent. Meanwhile, West Midlands Police is continuing to investigate Speedy Property which, in adverts across newspapers and online, promised house sellers a fast-cash, quick-sale service. A number of people have been arrested and released pending further inquiries by the force's economic crime unit. BBC Wales reported in August 2017 how Philip Edwardsreceived only Â£68,000 from the Â£165,000 saleof his three-bedroom home in Hawarden, Flintshire, after selling through speedyproperty.co.uk. This video can not be played Speaking in 2017, Philip Edwards said he was ""mortified"" after incurring what he says is a Â£96,000 loss BBC Wales has been told the remaining proceeds of the sale were paid out to two firms which had connections to Speedy Property. Mr Edwards, who was suffering from cancer, only became aware of these payments on completion of the sale, for which he was represented by Kumari-Banga. 'Â£96k not paid out' by home sale firm He initially remained as a tenant in the house, which he inherited from his parents, but was evicted after falling behind with rent payments while in hospital. He eventually moved into sheltered accommodation with his wife and stepson. The SDT has confirmed Ms Kumari and Ms Kumari-Banga will face a hearing on 21 June, which is expected to last five days. They are alleged to have acted in conveyancing transactions they knew to be fraudulent, or which they should have known bore the ""hallmarks"" of fraud or money laundering. They are also accused of failing to carry out proper inquiries into these transactions, or to properly advise their clients or obtain informed consent about payments to third-party companies. Ms Kumari faces a further allegation of entering into a referral arrangement and receiving fee income from this work ""in circumstances which compromised her independence and that of her firm"". The allegations against both solicitors cover a period from 2013 to mid-2017, and their legal practice is subject to SRA conditions pending conclusion of the disciplinary hearing. The SRA's investigation focused on the solicitors' conduct in their conveyancing work for customers of the scheme. The SRA has so far paid out nearly Â£875,000 to a dozen former clients of the firm through its compensation fund. The fund is discretionary and makes grants to clients of law firms if their financial loss occurred while receiving legal services. It is not dependent on any finding of dishonesty on the part of a solicitor. Solicitor Nigel Cole said many of those affected by the case were ""very vulnerable"" Portsmouth solicitor Nigel Cole represented Philip Edwards and a number of other clients in their claim against Kumari-Banga. Mr Edwards was among six of his clients who received grants through the SRA's compensation fund earlier this year. ""I'm pleased that this is over for them and that they've finally received some money back for this,"" said Mr Cole. Mr Cole said previously that many of those affected by the case were ""very vulnerable,"" including elderly and infirm homeowners or those with serious illnesses. An SRA spokesman said: ""Some of Kumari-Banga's clients came to us having suffered financial hardship because of the firm's failure to account for their money. ""So far, we have made 12 payments from our compensation fund totalling nearly Â£875,000. ""Not every application will be successfulâ¦ there are certain criteria that need to be met. ""But a number of vulnerable people will have had their not-insubstantial funds returned to them."" In connection with Speedy Property, West Midlands Police said: ""Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of fraud and money laundering offences and have been released under investigation. ""A further 10 people have been voluntarily interviewed. The investigation is ongoing.""

Cherry trees planted in memory of Covid victims will flower each spring to mark the anniversary of the first UK lockdown in 2020 We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close for the day soon so here's a reminder of today's news: In the UK, one in five adults has had both doses of a coronavirus vaccine and experts say it is working ""very well"" in bringing down new infections. These charts show how hospitalisations have dropped and that second doses have become the main focus of the vaccination programme. Swansea beach Potential beach partygoers have been warned not to flout Covid-19 rules or they could face police action. South Wales Police says it is aware of messages on social media about a gathering on a Swansea beach. Six people from two households are currently able to meet outside in Wales, andfrom Saturday, this will changeto six people from six households. The force says it will be usingsection 35 dispersal orders,externaland adopting ""a far more robust approach"". Ch Insp James Ratti says he is ""appealing to the better nature"" of local young people, and pleaded with those thinking of attending""to please reconsider and avoid doing so this weekend"". The UK government has announced it's setting up anew taskforce to investigate antiviral treatmentscoronavirus patients can take at home. It says the aim is to identify at least two effective treatments this year, in the form of pills, to help people fight off early Covid symptoms. Alongside Covid-19 vaccines, a number of drugs are being tested as possible treatments for people who already have the disease. Most of these are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus. So what work is being done to find treatments, and what other drugs have been trialled? Find out here. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been administered to more than seven million people in the US Problems including peeling paint and
loose debris have been found during inspections at a US plant in Baltimore
that makes coronavirus vaccines, the US Food and Drug Administration has said. Emergent Biosolutions, which owns the plant, stopped production at the plant recently, saying the
FDA had asked it to do so after an inspection. The FDA said its inspections were complete and in a report
detailed a long list of problems, including failure
to train personnel to avoid cross contamination of Covid-19
vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca,
which were made at the site. The inspection, carried out between 12 and 20 April,
found the building was not of the suitable size or design to
facilitate cleaning, maintenance or proper operations. Reuters, which reported the news, said Emergent was not immediately available for comment. Johnson & Johnson said it would ensure all of the FDA's observations were addressed ""promptly and comprehensively"". No vaccine manufactured at the plant has been distributed
for use in the US.  Australia has been one of the world's success stories in its fight against Covid-19, but frustration is growing over its delayed vaccination rollout. The country has been slower than most others to immunise its population, with some high-risk groups crying out for protection. Last month, it fell 85% short of its own target - and the lack of clarity around the process has been criticised. Supply shortages and delivery problems have been blamed for the delays. And while steps have been taken to speed up the programme - such as mass immunisation hubs and investment in local production - the government is seeing its success so far in battling Covid tarnished by its sluggish vaccination effort. We look here at what's gone wrong with Australia's vaccine rollout. A cupcake maker that supplies major supermarket chains has had an outbreak of Covid at its factory. The Cake Crew says 42 members of staff have tested positive for the virus at the production facility in Bala, Gwynedd, in North Wales. The firm employs 330 people making over a million cupcakes a week. It said those identified and their contacts were now self-isolating. A joint incident response team includes the company, health board officials and Public Health Wales, and both Gwynedd and Shropshire councils. Here's the full story. Leo Varadkar said it would be ""unfortunate"" if Dublin cannot host games for the delayed Euros Dublin looks set to miss out on hosting matches at the delayed Euro 2020 this summer after the Irish government conceded it does not expect to meet Uefa's demand of filling stadiums to 25% capacity. The tournament is due to be hosted in 12 cities across Europe from June, with Uefa set to make a decision on Munich, Bilbao and Dublin on Friday. Those three cities have been unable to guarantee spectator attendance. ""We think June is too soon,"" says Irish deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar. ""I think if they continue to insist on [having 25% of the stadium full], it'll be hard for it to go ahead quite frankly, which is unfortunate."" While the Republic of Ireland has one of Europe's lowest incidence rates of Covid-19, the government plans to reopen sectors very gradually with most shops due to stay shut until at least May and hotels potentially only opening in June. Read more  A lorry carrying the vaccines entered Idlib via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey The first batch of coronavirus vaccines has arrived in opposition-held
north-western Syria. Some 54,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine supplied
through the global Covax facility have arrived in Idlib province today via
the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. Health authorities in both opposition- and government-controlled
areas of the north-west have initially requested enough vaccines to cover 20%
of their populations, or 855,000 people, via Covax. Phase one of the roll-out is expected to begin in early
May and will include medical personnel and people aged over 60 with high-risk health
conditions. More than 20,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 640 deaths
have been reported in north-western Syria since the pandemic started.
Infections are now reported to be on the rise again, after a lull. Idlib is the last stronghold of the rebel and jihadist
groups that have been trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad since 2011.
An estimated 2.7 million displaced people, including a million children, are
living there, many of them in dire conditions in camps. There has been a relative calm in the region since March
2020, when Russia, Assadâs ally, and Turkey, the oppositionâs main backer,
brokered a ceasefire to halt a government offensive. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has today announced it hasadministered more than 200 million vaccine doses,external. After the US, which has delivered 213 million doses, it is the country with the second highest number of vaccinations in the
world. China isaiming to vaccinate 40% of the country's population by the end of June, and has in recent
days been strengthening calls for eligible recipients to get
vaccinated amid concerns that at its current pace of between three and four million a day, it
will not reach that target. Media have repeatedly said the country remains at risk of a domestic outbreak - via infected people entering the country from overseas - unless vaccination is accelerated. Outlets observe the number of new Covid-19
cases worldwide has been rising for eight consecutive weeks. Today, however, the National Health Commission's spokesperson has commented that in China, ""some people have reported that it has been difficult to make an appointment
for a second dose"". On Sina Weibo,
China's version of Facebook or Twitter, users are talking about how that
has been their experience, withcommenters saying that they've still not been notified about when they will receive a second dose,external, or have simply been told a second appointment is currently
not available. It is more
likely this is due to staff shortages than vaccine shortages. China is one
of the world's largest vaccine producers, andit says it has the capacity to provide five billion doses annually,external. The daily figures also show 10,775,817 people have now received both doses of the coronavirus vaccine - an increase of 350,027 compared with yesterday. Some 33,139,742 people have received one dose - an increase of 107,622. The data also shows a further 192 patients have been admitted into hospital. A further 22 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. A further 2,396 cases have been recorded. On Tuesday there were 33 deaths and 2,524 cases. Fitness fans took part in millions of workouts in the week after lockdown restrictions eased in England. The PureGym chain says more than one million workouts took place across its 240 sites to have reopened - but says it suffered ""awful"" losses during the pandemic. David Lloyd Leisure has also told the BBC footfall in its clubs in England has been ""extremely positive"" Huw Edwards, chief executive of industry body UK Active, says the number of people heading back to gyms proves ""how essential these facilities are to our communities and how greatly they've been missed"". ""However, our members suffered huge losses during lockdown and were closed during their busiest months, so thousands of facilities still require greater financial and regulatory support in order to recover,"" he says.Read more on this story here. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin German Chancellor Angela Merkelâs national lockdown law has been passed by parliament. The law forces the country's regions back into tough lockdown once infections exceed a certain level. But the move is controversial because regions say they are being overruled, and the debate was heated. Some opposition politicians say the measures - such as a night-time curfew - are too harsh and will undermine support. Outside on the streets, protesters have been even angrier. Some demonstrators were far-right activists or conspiracy theorists.
Most have refused to wear masks or adhere to distancing rules, so police ordered the protesters to disperse. But a majority of politicians believe tougher measures are needed - and polls show that most voters agree. That's because infection rates have been rising.
Germany hasn't been hit as hard as some other European countries, but scientists warn that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed if tougher measures are not introduced. Tomorrow, the law will be discussed by the Germany's Bundesrat, or upper house, and could be enforced next week. The link between obesity and Covid-19 is a ""wake-up"" call for the nation, a health minister says. Lord Bethell has told peers British people are ""carrying too much weight"" and this is a factor in the pandemic. He has been responding to calls at question time in the Lords to do more to tackle obesity. Lord Bethell says the World Obesity Federation's Covid-19 report makes ""stark reading"" for the UK. ""It's clear that excess weight is one of the few modifiable factors that contribute to severe symptoms of Covid and, very sadly in some cases, to death,"" he says. ""This is a wake-up call. Britain is clearly carrying too much weight. ""That is why the government is committed to helping the country reduce obesity and get fit and healthy."" For the opposition, Baroness Thornton says there have been 14 government obesity strategies since 1992 and, despite 689 policies, obesity rates have risen. Lady Thornton says another major indicator is deprivation, with healthy foods three times more expensive per calorie than less healthy foods. One in five UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, with more than two-and-a-half million second doses delivered in the past seven days, latest figures show. Some 10.8 million people have now received both jabs - the equivalent of 20.5% of the adult population. Wales is estimated to have given two doses to just under a quarter of adults (24.7%), ahead of Northern Ireland (20.5%), England (20.3%) and Scotland (19.1%). The figures are for vaccinations reported by the UK's health agencies up to and including yesterday, 20 April, and reflect the pace at which second doses have been ramped up across the country during the past month. Second doses of Covid-19 vaccines must follow within 12 weeks of the first, meaning the millions of people who received their initial jab in January and early February have recently had a follow-up dose, or are due to get the jab shortly. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawihas tweeted,external: ""Another strong day vaccinating yesterday. We keep going, 1 in 5 adults are now protected with two doses."" Restrictions on weddings have been eased as part of England's lockdown exit plans, and will be relaxed in Scotland from Monday. So what are the rules now and how could they change as restrictions are further eased? Read the rules in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland here. German police have fired tear gas and made several arrests in Berlin as they try to control large crowds of people protesting against a proposed new lockdown law. Thousands of people gathered near the parliament building in the German capital, many without face masks, to demonstrate against a bill that would hand the government the power to override regional authorities and impose strict curfews in areas with high Covid cases. At least seven people were arrested as protesters clashed with officers, police say. Some German media outlets are reporting that as many as 8,000 protesters gathered ahead of the vote in the Bundestag - or the lower house of the German parliament - taking place today. More than 2,000 police officers have reportedly been deployed to the area. Public Health Scotland has said it ""cannot rule out"" a link between patients being discharged from hospital and Covid outbreaks in care homes. It found mortality was high, with Covid associated with 21.6% of deaths within 30 days of discharge to a care home. More than 5,000 patients were sent to care homes between 1 March and 31 May last year - many without a test. This report follows an earlier PHS study that was criticised for not being clear on its findings. The health body said the size of a care home was still the biggest factor in the risk of an outbreak.

Majority believes NI will leave UK within 25 yearsPeople on both sides of the Irish border were polled for centenary programme.Northern Ireland,"A majority of people on both sides of the Irish border believes Northern Ireland will have left the UK within 25 years, a poll suggests. Most respondents said they thought NI would still be part of the UK in 10 years time, but not in 25 years. In NI, 49% of people said if there was a border poll today they would vote to remain in the UK, with 43% backing a united Ireland and 8% undecided. The poll was commissioned by BBC NI's Spotlight programme. In the Republic of Ireland, where a vote would have to be held in parallel with any border poll in Northern Ireland, 51%  said they would vote for a United Ireland, 27% would vote for Northern Ireland to stay in the UK and 22% were not sure. You can watch a discussion exploring the issues raised and delving further into the results of the cross-border opinion poll on theBBC News NI websiteand the BBC iPlayer When asked if they thought NI woud be part of the UK in 10 years, 55% in NI and 59% in the Republic of Ireland said they thought it would be. But when asked if this would be the case in 25 years, 51% of people in NI and 54% in the Republic said NI would have left the UK. The poll also suggested that only 40% of people in Northern Ireland sawits formation 100 years agoas a cause for celebration. Most people on both sides of the Irish border believed there was a potential for a return to political violence in Northern Ireland, according to the poll. The poll was carried out over the Easter period when clashes were taking place in a number of areas across Northern Ireland, sparked by loyalist anger over the Northern Ireland trade protocol and the Police Service of Northern Ireland's handling of a republican funeral during the pandemic. Of those surveyed in Northern Ireland, 76% agreed with the proposition that ""the dispute over Northern Ireland's status remains unresolved and there is still a potential for violence in the future"". In the Republic, an even higher proportion, 87%, echoed that view. A total of 48% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters they want the controversial trade protocol introduced as part of the UK's EU Withdrawal Agreement scrapped, in line with demands from the DUP and other unionist parties, while 46% wanted the protocol to be retained. Unionists have claimed the protocol, which requires checks on goods moving across the Irish Sea from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, threatens the constitutional integrity of the UK. Interviewed for the Spotlight programme, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin insisted the protocol was not tearing the UK apart, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was working to ""sandpaper"" away what he described as the ""ludicrous barriers"" to trade across the Irish Sea. This video can not be played Boris Johnson pledges to end ""ludicrous barriers"" Between Great Britain and Northern Ireland In the Republic, a majority of those surveyed supported the Irish government's defence of the trade protocol, with 74% saying it should not be scrapped. Although within Northern Ireland a larger number of people rejected the trade protocol than backed it, the poll also provided an indication that a majority wants to retain some form of economic link with the EU. Some 56% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters that they wanted their assembly members (MLAs) to vote to stay within the EU Single Market when the matter is put to a vote at Stormont in three years' time. Only 38% indicated they wanted to leave the EU Single Market. In Northern Ireland 37% of people surveyed told the pollsters they would like to see a border poll within the next five years, whilst a further 29% want it to happen at some point after that. However the prime minister told the Spotlight programme that he cannot see any Northern Ireland secretary considering a border poll for a ""very, very long time to come"". The prime minister told BBC Northern Ireland that as ""a proud unionist"" he views the centenary of Northern Ireland's formation as a cause for celebration. However only 40% of the people surveyed agreed with the proposition that ""the formation of Northern Ireland 100 years ago was an achievement which should be celebrated"", while 45% disagreed with the statement. Outright celebration of the centenary turned out to be the least popular of five options included in the survey. In Northern Ireland, 48% agreed that the partition of Ireland and the creation of a land border 100 years ago was ""a negative development which should be regretted"". A total of 50% wanted to concentrate on current challenges such as the Covid pandemic rather than the centenary, whilst 61% backed marking Northern Ireland's formation in a neutral manner acknowledging the differing opinions on the subject. The same proportion, 61%, agreed with the statement ""Northern Ireland's history is not just about constitutional politics and the centenary should provide an opportunity to showcase its sporting, business, scientific and cultural achievements"". In the Republic, celebrating the formation of Northern Ireland was even more unpopular with just 12% agreeing with the proposition. The most popular options were marking this year's centenary in a neutral manner, which was favoured by 74% of those surveyed and regretting partition - a view 71% agreed with. The poll commissioned by BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme was carried out by the NI Pollsters LucidTalk and the Irish polling firm Ireland Thinks. In Northern Ireland polling was carried out online between 5 and 7 April and 2,845 responses were used for the analysis. In the Republic of Ireland polling took place between 6 and 9 April and 1,088 responses were analysed. A small amount of fieldwork was carried out in the Republic of Ireland on 10 April. The margin of error is +/- 2.5%.

Daily Mail owner sues Google over search results,"The owner of the Daily Mail newspaper and MailOnline website is suing Google over allegations the search engine manipulates search results. Associated Newspapers accuses Google of having too much control over online advertising and of downgrading links to its stories, favouring other outlets. It alleges Google ""punishes"" publishers in its rankings if they don't sell enough advertising space in its marketplace. Google called the claims ""meritless"". Associated Newspapers' concerns stem from its assessment that its coverage of the Royal Family in 2021 has been downplayed in search results. For example, it claims that British users searching for broadcaster Piers Morgan's comments on the Duchess of Sussex following an interview with Oprah Winfrey were more likely to see articles about Morgan produced by smaller, regional outlets. That is despite the Daily Mail writing multiple stories a day about his comments around that time and employing him as a columnist. Mail on Sunday must publish statement of Meghan copyright win Supreme Court declares Google's code copying fair The woman who took on Google and won Daily Mail editor emeritus Peter Wright told the BBC's Today programme that the search engine's alleged actions were ""anti-competitive"". He suggested that the Daily Mail's search visibility dropped after using online advertising techniques ""which were allowing us to divert advertising traffic away from Google to other ad exchanges, which paid better prices - and this was their punishment"". ""We think it's time to call this company out,"" he said. The Daily Mail's MailOnline site is one of the world's most-read websites. It has 75 million unique monthly visitors in the US alone, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in New York on Tuesday. A Google spokeswoman said: ""The Daily Mail's claims are completely inaccurate. ""The use of our ad tech tools has no bearing on how a publisher's website ranks in Google search. ""More generally, we compete in a crowded and competitive ad tech space where publishers have and exercise multiple options. The Daily Mail itself authorises dozens of ad tech companies to sell and manage their ad space, including Amazon, Verizon and more. We will defend ourselves against these meritless claims."" Separately, Google is facing antitrust lawsuits brought by the US Justice Department and attorneys general in several states. The technology giant has denied abusing its market power and has previously said the ad technology market is competitive.

Growing doubts over chip fat biofuel,"New research questions the environmental impact of rising imports of used cooking oil (UCO) into the UK and Europe. Chip fat and other oils are considered waste, so when they are used to make biodiesel it saves carbon emissions by displacing fossil oil. But such is the demand across Europe that imports now account for more than half of the UCO that's made into fuel. According tothe study,external, there's no way to prove these imports are sustainable. With no testing of what's coming in, experts believe it is also ripe for fraud. Used cooking oil imports may boost deforestation Consumers pose 'growing threat' to tropical forests Reducing emissions from transport is proving to be one of the toughest challenges for governments all over the world. There's not enough waste oil to meet demand in the UK and Europe They've encouraged the use of biofuels as an important means of curbing carbon from cars and lorries. Biofuels are normally a blend of fossil fuel and oil made from plants or vegetables. The fact that these crops can be re-grown and soak up more CO2 means they cancel out the carbon emitted when used in engines. Soy and palm oil were once widely used as components of biodiesel but this practice has been widely discredited because it encourages deforestation. So for the last decade or so, the use of used cooking oil has expanded massively as an alternative feedstock for fuel. Chip fat and other waste oils have become a key component of biodiesel with an effective industry springing up across Europe to collect and process the product. But with the amount of biodiesel made from UCO increasing by around 40% every year since 2014, there simply isn't enough chip fat to go around. Palm oil is often used for biodiesel, but has fallen out of favour because of increasing deforestation According to a report from the campaign groupTransport & Environment,external, more than half of the UCO used in Europe is imported. Their study suggests this is highly problematic when it comes to impacts on the environment. While UCO is considered a waste material in the UK, in China, Indonesia and Malaysia it has long been used to feed animals. The report raises the question of what people in these countries are replacing the UCO with, when it is exported. In 2019, Malaysia exported 90 million litres of UCO to the UK and Ireland. Figures for their exports to other European countries aren't available but the flow of UCO is likely to be similar. With a population of around 33 million, that's close to three litres per head of used oil that's collected and exported to the UK and Ireland alone. By comparison, Thailand, which has a population of 70 million people, managed to collect around five million litres of UCO in 2019. Rapeseed oil is often used as a source for biodiesel but it raises issues about using land for fuel ""Because we are buying it, they have less used cooking oil to use on the things that they were previously using it for,"" said Greg Archer with Transport & Environment. ""And they're just buying more virgin oil and that virgin oil is largely palm oil, because that's the cheapest oil available. ""So indirectly, we're just encouraging more deforestation in Southeast Asia."" Another major problem with UCO is the suspicion of fraud. Because of demand from Europe, the price of UCO is often higher than palm oil. The worry is that some unscrupulous traders are simply diluting shipments of UCO with palm. As oils of different types are mixed in bulk for transport, and no testing of the materials is carried out, some experts believe fraud is rife. Biodiesel has expanded rapidly across Europe with used cooking oil often used as a feedstock The suggestion of fraud anywhere along the chain of supply is rejected by the European Waste-to-Advanced Biofuels Association (EWABA), who say there are robust certification schemes in place. ""It is widely known that the European Commission has taken relevant steps to completely curb unsound market practices in biofuel markets,"" said Angel Alberdi, EWABA's secretary general. He says a new database being developed by the EU will ensure that trading, certification and sustainability data on all bio-liquids will have to be registered. ""The combination of revised certification schemes and the pan-EU track and trace database will ensure that no sustainability issues arise in the whole biofuels and bio-liquids supply chain,"" he told BBC News. Others in the field are concerned that the database idea, which was first mooted in 2018, may not be effective in stemming suspected fraud. The report from Transport & Environment points out that with shipping and aviation looking to decarbonise by using biofuels, demand for UCO could double over the next decade. ""Rising the demand beyond sustainable supply levels would increase these concerns, and risks of using 'fake' UCO, potentially leading to indirect impacts such as deforestation.""

Higher petrol prices drive up cost of living,"The UK inflation rate rose to 0.7% in the 12 months to March, up from 0.4% in February, pushed up by the increased cost of fuel, transport and clothes. The figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was slightly below economists' forecasts, with lower food prices offsetting other price rises. Fuel prices in March showed their biggest annual increase since January 2020, the ONS said. Inflation is forecast to rise further due to higher energy and oil prices. The Bank of England has forecast that inflation could reach 1.9% by the end of 2021, with other experts saying it will exceed 2% before the end of year. The March inflation figure would have been higher without a fall in food prices, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. What is the UK's inflation rate? Under-35s bearing brunt of jobs crisis UK outlook 'uncertain' despite vaccine, says Bank ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said: ""The rate of inflation increased with petrol prices rising and clothes recovering from the falls seen in February. ""However, food prices fell back on the year, as prices of some staples were lower than at the start of the pandemic."" Inflation had unexpectedly eased in February, in part because of the biggest annual fall in clothing and footwear costs since 2009. Discounting, which had been commonplace in February, eased somewhat in March, the ONS said, however it was still unseasonably high.

At the last big fiscal event, Chancellor Rishi Sunak let it be known that what keeps him awake at night is the risk that interest rates rise, making the public finances unsustainable. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has indicated a one percentage point rise in interest rates would add around Â£20bn to the cost of servicing the debt. So with consumer price inflation now heading back to its official target of 2% - some say as soon as next month - how much sleep should the chancellor lose? If you listen to those who spend their entire waking lives speculating about these things, interest rates swaps traders in the City, after looking at the inflation figures they're evenly split between those who think we'll have a rate rise by the end of 2022 and those who think it will take longer. But they're only pricing in a quarter of a percentage point, even then. By which time, if the OBR's forecasts are right, the budget deficit will be coming down, slowing the rise in debt as the economy grows. Right now it amounts to a calming message to Rishi: relax, Chancellor, and go back to sleep. ""Looking ahead, CPI inflation looks set to jump to about 1.7% in April, driven primarily by a large semi-annual increase in electricity and natural gas prices, as well as the anniversary of the collapse in oil prices at the start of the pandemic,"" he said. ""April's data also will be collected after shops reopened and hospitality businesses resumed outdoor service, so the inflation rates for clothing and food service activities probably will both rise.""

Netflix shares plunge amid fears virus boom is over,"About 3.98 million people signed up for Netflix between January and March Video-streaming giant Netflix has reported a slowdown in subscriber growth, sending its shares tumbling. About 3.98 million people signed up for Netflix between January and March, well short of the projected 6 million. The company said a lack of new shows may have contributed to the shortfall, adding that it expected this to recover as sequels to hit shows are released. Netflix shares fell 11% in after-hours trading to $489.28, wiping $25bn off the company's market capitalization. Byron Bay backlash over Netflix show plans Bridgerton gets third and fourth series on Netflix Netflix considers crackdown on password sharing The streaming service added 15.8 million new subscribers last year as Covid-19 forced people around the world to stay home. Much of that growth came in Asia, where Netflix added 9.3 million new subscribers in 2020, an increase of about 65% over the previous year. But the pandemic has proven a double-edged sword for Netflix, because it also disrupted its production pipeline. This video can not be played WATCH:  The BBC speaks exclusively to the author who wrote the books that inspired the Netflix series Bridgerton. ""These dynamics are also contributing to a lighter content slate in the first half of 2021, and hence, we believe slower membership growth,"" the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. The company projected poor customer growth ahead, with an additional 1 million new streaming customers in the second quarter, far short of the previously predicted 5 million. Netflix also faces increasingly stiff competition from new streaming services entering the market. Disney+, a much newer streaming service, already has 100 million subscribers, compared with Netflix's 207.6 million. Disney Plus racks up 50m subscribers in five months Even with sluggish customer growth, Netflix has reported revenues of $7.16bn and net income of $1.71bn. Netflix predicted stronger growth in the second half of the year when it releases new seasons of ""You,"" ""Money Heist,"" ""The Witcher"" and action movie ""Red Notice,"" among other titles. ""We had those ten years where we were growing smooth as silk,"" Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings said on a streamed earnings call, according to an AFP report.

All six English clubs leave European Super League,"Chelsea fans protested against their involvement in the European Super League outside Stamford Bridge All six Premier League teams involved in the European Super League (ESL) have now withdrawn from the competition. Manchester City were the first club to pull out after Chelsea had signalled their intent to do so by preparing documentation to withdraw. The other four sides - Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham - have all now followed suit. Italian side Inter Milan are also set to withdraw as they no longer wish to be involved with the project. BBC Sport understands bosses at the Serie A club are preparing for their exit following Tuesday night's dramatic developments. How football's volatile 48 hours unfolded The 12-team Super League, set up by the seven afore-mentioned teams and Spain's Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid and Italy's AC Milan and Juventus wasannounced on Sundayto widespread condemnation. ""Despite the announced departure of the English clubs, forced to take such decisions due to the pressure put on them, we are convinced our proposal is fully aligned with European law and regulations,"" the ESL said on Wednesday, adding it was ""convinced that the current status quo of European football needs to change"". In an interview with Italian newspaper la Repubblica, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli said the remaining clubs will ""press ahead"" and the project still had ""a 100% chance of being a success""., ""Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is insisting on the idea of keeping the group together to push for change,"" says Spanish football expert Guillem Balague. This video can not be played Liverpool owner John W Henry apologises in message to fans ""Barcelona say they agreed to the ESL, but only if the Season Ticket Holders Assembly approve it, which could be their way out."" Balague also says Atletico Madrid are meeting on Wednesday morning to review their position. 'Owners of big six must beg for forgiveness' Super League unravels; Woodward to resign - how dramatic evening unfolded Manchester City confirmed they have ""formally enacted the procedures to withdraw"" from the Super League. Liverpool said their involvement in the proposed breakaway league ""has been discontinued"". Manchester United said they had ""listened carefully to the reaction from our fans, the UK government and other key stakeholders"" in making their decision to not take part. Arsenal apologised in an open letter to their fans and said they had ""made a mistake"", adding they were withdrawing after listening to them and the ""wider football community"". Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the club regretted the ""anxiety and upset"" caused by the proposal. Chelsea confirmed they have ""begun the formal procedures for withdrawal from the group"" that they only joined ""late last week"". Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin welcomed the reversal, adding: ""I said yesterday that it is admirable to admit a mistake and these clubs made a big mistake. ""But they are back in the fold now and I know they have a lot to offer not just to our competitions but to the whole of the European game. ""The important thing now is that we move on, rebuild the unity that the game enjoyed before this and move forward together."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnsonposted on Twitter:,external""I welcome last night's announcement. This is the right result for football fans, clubs, and communities across the country. We must continue to protect our cherished national game."" Labour leader Keir Starmeradded,externalthat this ""must be a watershed moment, where we change our game to put fans first again"", while Liberal Democrats leader Ed Daveytweeted:,external""This must be the start of a fans-led football revolution."" In a statement, the European Super League said: ""Given the current circumstances we shall reconsider the most appropriate steps to reshape the project, always having in mind our goals of offering fans the best experience possible while enhancing solidarity payments for the entire football community."" English football's 'big six' were part of a group that announced plans to form the breakaway league, which they hoped to establish as a new midweek competition. It was condemned by fans, football authorities and government ministers in the UK and across Europe by Uefa and league associations. Around 1,000 fans gathered outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge groundbefore their game against Brighton on Tuesdayto protest at their club's involvement. Chelsea legend Petr Cech pleaded with fans to disperse outside the ground before their match against Brighton Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who was involved in the Super League discussions, hasannounced he will step downfrom his role at the end of 2021. Leading players at some of the six clubs signalled their disapproval of the planned breakaway league. Liverpool captainJordan Henderson said on social media,externalhis side's ""collective position"" is they do not want the Super League to take place. ""We don't like it and we don't want it to happen,"" read a message that was also posted by many fellow Liverpool players. After City confirmed their withdrawal, England winger Raheem Sterling posted: ""Ok bye."" Uefa had hoped to stave off the threat of a European Super League with a new 36-team Champions League, which wasagreed on Monday. In announcing their proposals for a Super League that would eventually comprise of 20 teams, the 12-club group said the Champions League reforms did not go far enough. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, who was named as the ESL's chairman, said the competitionwas set up ""to save football""because young people are ""no longer interested"" in the game because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". None of the Spanish and Italian sides have yet released a statement after the six Premier League teams pulled out. TheArsenalboard said they did not intend to ""cause such distress"" and that they joined the Super League because they ""did not want to be left behind"" and wanted to ensure the club's future. ""Our aim is always to make the right decisions for this great football club, to protect it for the future and to take us forward,"" they added. ""We didn't make the right decision here, which we fully accept."" Manchester Unitedsaid that they ""remain committed to working with others across the football community to come up with sustainable solutions to the long-term challenges facing the game"". Liverpoolsaid the club had ""received representations from various key stakeholders, both internally and externally"" before reaching their decision and thanked them for their ""valuable contributions"". Levy said thatTottenhamfelt it was ""important"" to take part in ""a possible new structure that sought to better ensure financial fair play and financial sustainability whilst delivering significantly increased support for the wider football pyramid"". He added: ""We should like to thank all those supporters who presented their considered opinions."" Chelseasaid that after having had ""time to consider the matter fully"" they had decided that their ""continued participation in these plans would not be in the best interests of the club, our supporters or the wider football community"".

BAME inequalities remain in Covid vaccine uptake,"The number of BAME people getting their vaccines has been broken down in Public Health Wales figures Inequalities remain between the number of black, Asian, and minority ethnic people having the Covid vaccine and white people. Uptake for BAME people is at least 10% lower in almost every age group, latest data from Public Health Wales shows. The largest difference was in adults aged 55-59, where 77% of BAME people have received one dose, compared to 89% of white people. Ray Singh, of Race Council Cymru (RCC), said there was ""still hesitancy"". The gap in uptake hasnarrowed slightly since February, but large inequalities remain across the board. When the first statistics were released showing a discrepancy between vaccine uptake in ethnic groups, Mr Singh, RCC's chairman, said it was a ""race against time, a question of life and death"". Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked How many have had a Covid vaccine in Wales? In response to the most recent figures, he said: ""There's a lot of work going on, but there's still hesitancy in certain groups. Still there is a lot of work to be done. ""The various bodies are now quite proactively getting involved in moving this forward, like the Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black African doctors' associations, and church leaders and so forth. ""Many don't have confidence in the service they've received, the way they have been treated in the past, so they have all these things they conjure up in their minds that 'this is not for us'. Ray Singh has received both doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and urges other to do the same ""This is something that has to be tackled, it can't be left, because it is absolutely vital that everyone has the vaccine. ""People need to be approached by individuals that know them, as opposed to just telling them you've got to have the vaccine. There needs to be one on one involvement at this stage. ""I have had my second AstraZeneca jab, with no side effects. I did it to protect myself, my family, friends and work colleagues."" The gap between white and BAME groups is the smallest for adults aged 50-54 at 5.9%, but all other age groups range from 9.9% to 12%. While white people top the vaccine uptake numbers in every age group, there is substantial variation between different ethnic groups. This video can not be played Shamim Abbas  said despite Covid's devastating impact on her family, some relatives had been unsure about having their jabs Black people have the lowest vaccination uptake across all age groups and, in the 55-59 age group, 68.3% have had a first dose of the vaccine compared to 89% of white people. This 20.7% gap is the largest in vaccine coverage between any age or demographic group. The data also shows a gap in vaccine coverage between those living in the most and least deprived areas, although these gaps are much less pronounced than gaps between ethnic groups. The gap from least deprived areas and most deprived areas ranges from 2.4% in adults aged 75-79, to 7.6% in adults aged 50-54. Dr Gillian Richardson, Wales' deputy chief medical officer for vaccines, said: ""It is vitally important all aspects of equity are considered throughout our vaccination programme. ""Our aim is to ensure every person is able to understand about the vaccines on offer and face no barriers like culture, faith concerns or languages, and so that any barriers to access are removed and anxieties addressed."" She added that the slight fall in the gap ""has been achieved via a wide variety of engagement events, webinars in various languages, roundtables, Q&A events where people can 'ask the experts'.

Ex-officer Derek Chauvin guilty of Floyd murder,"This video can not be played Watch the moment Derek Chauvin learnt his fate A US jury has found a former police officer guilty of murder over the death of African-American George Floyd on a Minneapolis street last year. Derek Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. The widely watched footage sparked worldwide protests against racism and excessive use of force by police. Chauvin was found guilty on three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. His bail was immediately revoked and he was placed in custody. Sentencing is likely to happen in two months, and Chauvin could spend decades in jail. In Minnesota, second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Third-degree murder is punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Second-degree manslaughter is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Chauvin is expected to appeal against the verdict. The murder that drove America to the brink 'This is monumental. This is historic' Five key moments from the trial Police officers have rarely been convicted - if they are charged at all - for deaths that occur in custody, and the verdict in this trial has been widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future. Three other officers are due to face trial later this year on aiding-and-abetting charges. The 12-member jury took less than a day to reach their verdict, which followed a highly-charged, three-week trial that left Minneapolis on edge. Several hundred people cheered outside the court as the verdict was announced. The Floyd family's lawyer, Ben Crump, said it marked a ""turning point in history"" for the US. This video can not be played Relief and tears in a hair salon: 'Finally we can breathe' ""Painfully earned justice has finally arrived,"" he tweeted. ""[It] sends a clear message on the need for accountability of law enforcement."" The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris called the Floyd family after the verdict.  Mr Biden was heard saying that ""at least now there is some justice"". This video can not be played Biden on Chauvin verdict: 'Our work isn't done' In nationally televised remarks shortly afterwards, Mr Biden said: ""Systemic racism is a stain on the whole nation's soul."" Meanwhile, Ms Harris urged lawmakers to pass the George Floyd bill aimed at reforming policing in the US. The Minneapolis police federation, a not-for-profit organisation representing police, said they respected the jury's decision. ""We also want to reach out to the community and still express our deep remorse for their pain, as we feel it every day as well. There are no winners in this case,"" the federation said. According to reports, one of the most likely avenues of appeal is the huge publicity given to the case, with the defence team arguing that this might have influenced the jury. Also, Presiding Judge Peter Cahill said on Monday that public comments by Democrat Congresswoman Maxine Waters could be grounds for an appeal. Over the weekend, Ms Waters had urged protesters to ""stay on the street"" and ""get more confrontational"" if Chauvin was acquitted. On hearing the verdict, people were screaming and cheering, and a little girl in a pink coat held up a tiny fist, in jubilation. ""It's a good day in Minneapolis,"" says 21-year-old Kenneth Nwachi. ""It's a blessing."" Activists say justice has been done, and they will feel as though a weight has been lifted from their shoulders. Their relief is shared by many in the city, a place that has been on edge for months. It is a landmark case for police use of force against black people, and the verdict marks a significant break with the past. Few officers are charged with manslaughter or murder, and fewer still are convicted. But protesters say the calls for justice for George Floyd do not stop after this verdict. The 46-year-old bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store in South Minneapolis on the evening of 25 May 2020. A shop assistant believed he had used a counterfeit $20 note and called the police after Mr Floyd refused to give the cigarettes back. When police arrived, they ordered Mr Floyd out of his parked car and handcuffed him. A struggle ensued when officers tried to put a screaming Mr Floyd in their squad car. They wrestled him to the ground and pinned him under their weight. Security was ramped up in Minneapolis ahead of the verdict Chauvin pressed his knee into the back of Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, as the suspect and several bystanders pleaded for his life. As he was being restrained, Mr Floyd said more than 20 times that he could not breathe, pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"". When the ambulance arrived, Mr Floyd was motionless. He was pronounced dead about an hour later. During Chauvin's trial, the jury heard from 45 witnesses and saw several hours of video footage. Some of the most powerful testimony came from eyewitnesses. Several broke down in tears as they watched graphic footage of the incident and described feeling ""helpless"" as events unfolded. Mr Floyd's girlfriend of three years and his younger sibling also took the stand. Expert witnesses on behalf of the state testified that Mr Floyd died from a lack of oxygen due to the manner of restraint employed by Chauvin and his colleagues. Chauvin himself chose not to testify, invoking his right to not incriminate himself with his responses. Manslaughter is when someone unintentionally causes another person's death. In second-degree murder, the act that led to someone's death could have been intentional or unintentional. The maximum sentence for this charge is 40 years in prison. Third-degree murder means that an individual has acted in a way that endangered one or more people, ending in death. Twelve jurors were tasked with deciding if Chauvin would face time in jail or be acquitted. The jury remained anonymous and unseen throughout the trial, but its demographics skewed younger, more white and more female. After both sides presented closing arguments on Monday, the jury was isolated in a hotel with no outside contact so they could deliberate on a verdict, a process known as sequestration. Jurors had to agree on a unanimous verdict and were told they could not return home until they had made their decision. The moment Chauvin learnt his fate.

Growing doubts over 'chip fat' biofuel,"New research questions the environmental impact of rising imports of used cooking oil (UCO) into the UK and Europe. Chip fat and other oils are considered waste, so when they are used to make biodiesel it saves carbon emissions by displacing fossil oil. But such is the demand across Europe that imports now account for more than half of the UCO that's made into fuel. According tothe study,external, there's no way to prove these imports are sustainable. With no testing of what's coming in, experts believe it is also ripe for fraud. Used cooking oil imports may boost deforestation Consumers pose 'growing threat' to tropical forests Reducing emissions from transport is proving to be one of the toughest challenges for governments all over the world. There's not enough waste oil to meet demand in the UK and Europe They've encouraged the use of biofuels as an important means of curbing carbon from cars and lorries. Biofuels are normally a blend of fossil fuel and oil made from plants or vegetables. The fact that these crops can be re-grown and soak up more CO2 means they cancel out the carbon emitted when used in engines. Soy and palm oil were once widely used as components of biodiesel but this practice has been widely discredited because it encourages deforestation. So for the last decade or so, the use of used cooking oil has expanded massively as an alternative feedstock for fuel. Chip fat and other waste oils have become a key component of biodiesel with an effective industry springing up across Europe to collect and process the product. But with the amount of biodiesel made from UCO increasing by around 40% every year since 2014, there simply isn't enough chip fat to go around. Palm oil is often used for biodiesel, but has fallen out of favour because of increasing deforestation According to a report from the campaign groupTransport & Environment,external, more than half of the UCO used in Europe is imported. Their study suggests this is highly problematic when it comes to impacts on the environment. While UCO is considered a waste material in the UK, in China, Indonesia and Malaysia it has long been used to feed animals. The report raises the question of what people in these countries are replacing the UCO with, when it is exported. In 2019, Malaysia exported 90 million litres of UCO to the UK and Ireland. Figures for their exports to other European countries aren't available but the flow of UCO is likely to be similar. With a population of around 33 million, that's close to three litres per head of used oil that's collected and exported to the UK and Ireland alone. By comparison, Thailand, which has a population of 70 million people, managed to collect around five million litres of UCO in 2019. Rapeseed oil is often used as a source for biodiesel but it raises issues about using land for fuel ""Because we are buying it, they have less used cooking oil to use on the things that they were previously using it for,"" said Greg Archer with Transport & Environment. ""And they're just buying more virgin oil and that virgin oil is largely palm oil, because that's the cheapest oil available. ""So indirectly, we're just encouraging more deforestation in Southeast Asia."" Another major problem with UCO is the suspicion of fraud. Because of demand from Europe, the price of UCO is often higher than palm oil. The worry is that some unscrupulous traders are simply diluting shipments of UCO with palm. As oils of different types are mixed in bulk for transport, and no testing of the materials is carried out, some experts believe fraud is rife. Biodiesel has expanded rapidly across Europe with used cooking oil often used as a feedstock The suggestion of fraud anywhere along the chain of supply is rejected by the European Waste-to-Advanced Biofuels Association (EWABA), who say there are robust certification schemes in place. ""It is widely known that the European Commission has taken relevant steps to completely curb unsound market practices in biofuel markets,"" said Angel Alberdi, EWABA's secretary general. He says a new database being developed by the EU will ensure that trading, certification and sustainability data on all bio-liquids will have to be registered. ""The combination of revised certification schemes and the pan-EU track and trace database will ensure that no sustainability issues arise in the whole biofuels and bio-liquids supply chain,"" he told BBC News. Others in the field are concerned that the database idea, which was first mooted in 2018, may not be effective in stemming suspected fraud. The report from Transport & Environment points out that with shipping and aviation looking to decarbonise by using biofuels, demand for UCO could double over the next decade. ""Rising the demand beyond sustainable supply levels would increase these concerns, and risks of using 'fake' UCO, potentially leading to indirect impacts such as deforestation.""

"Rising fuel costs push cost of living higherThe cost of living rose to 0.7% in March, from 0.4% in February, as fuel, transport and clothes prices increased.Business","The UK inflation rate rose to 0.7% in the 12 months to March, up from 0.4% in February, pushed up by the increased cost of fuel, transport and clothes. The figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was slightly below economists' forecasts, with lower food prices offsetting other price rises. Fuel prices in March showed their biggest annual increase since January 2020, the ONS said. Inflation is forecast to rise further due to higher energy and oil prices. The Bank of England has forecast that inflation could reach 1.9% by the end of 2021, with other experts saying it will exceed 2% before the end of year. The March inflation figure would have been higher without a fall in food prices, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. What is the UK's inflation rate? Under-35s bearing brunt of jobs crisis UK outlook 'uncertain' despite vaccine, says Bank ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said: ""The rate of inflation increased with petrol prices rising and clothes recovering from the falls seen in February. ""However, food prices fell back on the year, as prices of some staples were lower than at the start of the pandemic."" Inflation had unexpectedly eased in February, in part because of the biggest annual fall in clothing and footwear costs since 2009. Discounting, which had been commonplace in February, eased somewhat in March, the ONS said, however it was still unseasonably high. Pantheon's chief UK economist, Samuel Tombs, believes the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) will reach the Bank of England's 2% target rate as early as May. At the last big fiscal event, Chancellor Rishi Sunak let it be known that what keeps him awake at night is the risk that interest rates rise, making the public finances unsustainable. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has indicated a one percentage point rise in interest rates would add around Â£20bn to the cost of servicing the debt. So with consumer price inflation now heading back to its official target of 2% - some say as soon as next month - how much sleep should the chancellor lose? If you listen to those who spend their entire waking lives speculating about these things, interest rates swaps traders in the City, after looking at the inflation figures they're evenly split between those who think we'll have a rate rise by the end of 2022 and those who think it will take longer. But they're only pricing in a quarter of a percentage point, even then. By which time, if the OBR's forecasts are right, the budget deficit will be coming down, slowing the rise in debt as the economy grows. Right now it amounts to a calming message to Rishi: relax, Chancellor, and go back to sleep. ""Looking ahead, CPI inflation looks set to jump to about 1.7% in April, driven primarily by a large semi-annual increase in electricity and natural gas prices, as well as the anniversary of the collapse in oil prices at the start of the pandemic,"" he said. ""April's data also will be collected after shops reopened and hospitality businesses resumed outdoor service, so the inflation rates for clothing and food service activities probably will both rise."" And Paul Craig, at Quilter Investors, said that with the UK economy opening from lockdown, inflation had reached a turning point. ""Price growth is now on an upward trajectory, and should remain so for some time to come,"" he warned. ""From here, inflation may tick markedly higher if the steady drip of consumer spending morphs into a waterfall as lockdown restrictions are lifted and households spend some of their accumulated pandemic savings."" Clothes prices are back on the rise, after having fallen sharply in February. Inflation fell in the early months of lockdown last year, with petrol hitting as low as 106.2p per litre in May. The ONS said on Tuesday that pump prices hit 123.7p a litre in March. Domestic energy bills are also rising. Regulator Ofgem's price cap on household bills rose from the beginning of this month. Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""The big question is whether the economic recovery, combined with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will start to foster a more sustained, inflationary trend that has the potential to get out of hand."" But he added: ""This risk isn't likely to come home to roost anytime soon, with unemployment expected to rise later this year, thereby acting as a drag on rising wages.""

Cherry trees planted in memory of Covid victims will flower each spring to mark the anniversary of the first UK lockdown in 2020 We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close for the day soon so here's a reminder of today's news: In the UK, one in five adults has had both doses of a coronavirus vaccine and experts say it is working ""very well"" in bringing down new infections. These charts show how hospitalisations have dropped and that second doses have become the main focus of the vaccination programme. Swansea beach Potential beach partygoers have been warned not to flout Covid-19 rules or they could face police action. South Wales Police says it is aware of messages on social media about a gathering on a Swansea beach. Six people from two households are currently able to meet outside in Wales, andfrom Saturday, this will changeto six people from six households. The force says it will be usingsection 35 dispersal orders,externaland adopting ""a far more robust approach"". Ch Insp James Ratti says he is ""appealing to the better nature"" of local young people, and pleaded with those thinking of attending""to please reconsider and avoid doing so this weekend"". The UK government has announced it's setting up anew taskforce to investigate antiviral treatmentscoronavirus patients can take at home. It says the aim is to identify at least two effective treatments this year, in the form of pills, to help people fight off early Covid symptoms. Alongside Covid-19 vaccines, a number of drugs are being tested as possible treatments for people who already have the disease. Most of these are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus. So what work is being done to find treatments, and what other drugs have been trialled? Find out here. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been administered to more than seven million people in the US Problems including peeling paint and
loose debris have been found during inspections at a US plant in Baltimore
that makes coronavirus vaccines, the US Food and Drug Administration has said. Emergent Biosolutions, which owns the plant, stopped production at the plant recently, saying the
FDA had asked it to do so after an inspection. The FDA said its inspections were complete and in a report
detailed a long list of problems, including failure
to train personnel to avoid cross contamination of Covid-19
vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca,
which were made at the site. The inspection, carried out between 12 and 20 April,
found the building was not of the suitable size or design to
facilitate cleaning, maintenance or proper operations. Reuters, which reported the news, said Emergent was not immediately available for comment. Johnson & Johnson said it would ensure all of the FDA's observations were addressed ""promptly and comprehensively"". No vaccine manufactured at the plant has been distributed
for use in the US.  Australia has been one of the world's success stories in its fight against Covid-19, but frustration is growing over its delayed vaccination rollout. The country has been slower than most others to immunise its population, with some high-risk groups crying out for protection. Last month, it fell 85% short of its own target - and the lack of clarity around the process has been criticised. Supply shortages and delivery problems have been blamed for the delays. And while steps have been taken to speed up the programme - such as mass immunisation hubs and investment in local production - the government is seeing its success so far in battling Covid tarnished by its sluggish vaccination effort. We look here at what's gone wrong with Australia's vaccine rollout. A cupcake maker that supplies major supermarket chains has had an outbreak of Covid at its factory. The Cake Crew says 42 members of staff have tested positive for the virus at the production facility in Bala, Gwynedd, in North Wales. The firm employs 330 people making over a million cupcakes a week. It said those identified and their contacts were now self-isolating. A joint incident response team includes the company, health board officials and Public Health Wales, and both Gwynedd and Shropshire councils. Here's the full story. Leo Varadkar said it would be ""unfortunate"" if Dublin cannot host games for the delayed Euros Dublin looks set to miss out on hosting matches at the delayed Euro 2020 this summer after the Irish government conceded it does not expect to meet Uefa's demand of filling stadiums to 25% capacity. The tournament is due to be hosted in 12 cities across Europe from June, with Uefa set to make a decision on Munich, Bilbao and Dublin on Friday. Those three cities have been unable to guarantee spectator attendance. ""We think June is too soon,"" says Irish deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar. ""I think if they continue to insist on [having 25% of the stadium full], it'll be hard for it to go ahead quite frankly, which is unfortunate."" While the Republic of Ireland has one of Europe's lowest incidence rates of Covid-19, the government plans to reopen sectors very gradually with most shops due to stay shut until at least May and hotels potentially only opening in June. Read more  A lorry carrying the vaccines entered Idlib via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey The first batch of coronavirus vaccines has arrived in opposition-held
north-western Syria. Some 54,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine supplied
through the global Covax facility have arrived in Idlib province today via
the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. Health authorities in both opposition- and government-controlled
areas of the north-west have initially requested enough vaccines to cover 20%
of their populations, or 855,000 people, via Covax. Phase one of the roll-out is expected to begin in early
May and will include medical personnel and people aged over 60 with high-risk health
conditions. More than 20,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 640 deaths
have been reported in north-western Syria since the pandemic started.
Infections are now reported to be on the rise again, after a lull. Idlib is the last stronghold of the rebel and jihadist
groups that have been trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad since 2011.
An estimated 2.7 million displaced people, including a million children, are
living there, many of them in dire conditions in camps. There has been a relative calm in the region since March
2020, when Russia, Assadâs ally, and Turkey, the oppositionâs main backer,
brokered a ceasefire to halt a government offensive. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has today announced it hasadministered more than 200 million vaccine doses,external. After the US, which has delivered 213 million doses, it is the country with the second highest number of vaccinations in the
world. China isaiming to vaccinate 40% of the country's population by the end of June, and has in recent
days been strengthening calls for eligible recipients to get
vaccinated amid concerns that at its current pace of between three and four million a day, it
will not reach that target. Media have repeatedly said the country remains at risk of a domestic outbreak - via infected people entering the country from overseas - unless vaccination is accelerated. Outlets observe the number of new Covid-19
cases worldwide has been rising for eight consecutive weeks. Today, however, the National Health Commission's spokesperson has commented that in China, ""some people have reported that it has been difficult to make an appointment
for a second dose"". On Sina Weibo,
China's version of Facebook or Twitter, users are talking about how that
has been their experience, withcommenters saying that they've still not been notified about when they will receive a second dose,external, or have simply been told a second appointment is currently
not available. It is more
likely this is due to staff shortages than vaccine shortages. China is one
of the world's largest vaccine producers, andit says it has the capacity to provide five billion doses annually,external. The daily figures also show 10,775,817 people have now received both doses of the coronavirus vaccine - an increase of 350,027 compared with yesterday. Some 33,139,742 people have received one dose - an increase of 107,622. The data also shows a further 192 patients have been admitted into hospital. A further 22 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. A further 2,396 cases have been recorded. On Tuesday there were 33 deaths and 2,524 cases. Fitness fans took part in millions of workouts in the week after lockdown restrictions eased in England. The PureGym chain says more than one million workouts took place across its 240 sites to have reopened - but says it suffered ""awful"" losses during the pandemic. David Lloyd Leisure has also told the BBC footfall in its clubs in England has been ""extremely positive"" Huw Edwards, chief executive of industry body UK Active, says the number of people heading back to gyms proves ""how essential these facilities are to our communities and how greatly they've been missed"". ""However, our members suffered huge losses during lockdown and were closed during their busiest months, so thousands of facilities still require greater financial and regulatory support in order to recover,"" he says.Read more on this story here. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin German Chancellor Angela Merkelâs national lockdown law has been passed by parliament. The law forces the country's regions back into tough lockdown once infections exceed a certain level. But the move is controversial because regions say they are being overruled, and the debate was heated. Some opposition politicians say the measures - such as a night-time curfew - are too harsh and will undermine support. Outside on the streets, protesters have been even angrier. Some demonstrators were far-right activists or conspiracy theorists.
Most have refused to wear masks or adhere to distancing rules, so police ordered the protesters to disperse. But a majority of politicians believe tougher measures are needed - and polls show that most voters agree. That's because infection rates have been rising.
Germany hasn't been hit as hard as some other European countries, but scientists warn that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed if tougher measures are not introduced. Tomorrow, the law will be discussed by the Germany's Bundesrat, or upper house, and could be enforced next week. The link between obesity and Covid-19 is a ""wake-up"" call for the nation, a health minister says. Lord Bethell has told peers British people are ""carrying too much weight"" and this is a factor in the pandemic. He has been responding to calls at question time in the Lords to do more to tackle obesity. Lord Bethell says the World Obesity Federation's Covid-19 report makes ""stark reading"" for the UK. ""It's clear that excess weight is one of the few modifiable factors that contribute to severe symptoms of Covid and, very sadly in some cases, to death,"" he says. ""This is a wake-up call. Britain is clearly carrying too much weight. ""That is why the government is committed to helping the country reduce obesity and get fit and healthy."" For the opposition, Baroness Thornton says there have been 14 government obesity strategies since 1992 and, despite 689 policies, obesity rates have risen. Lady Thornton says another major indicator is deprivation, with healthy foods three times more expensive per calorie than less healthy foods. One in five UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, with more than two-and-a-half million second doses delivered in the past seven days, latest figures show. Some 10.8 million people have now received both jabs - the equivalent of 20.5% of the adult population. Wales is estimated to have given two doses to just under a quarter of adults (24.7%), ahead of Northern Ireland (20.5%), England (20.3%) and Scotland (19.1%). The figures are for vaccinations reported by the UK's health agencies up to and including yesterday, 20 April, and reflect the pace at which second doses have been ramped up across the country during the past month. Second doses of Covid-19 vaccines must follow within 12 weeks of the first, meaning the millions of people who received their initial jab in January and early February have recently had a follow-up dose, or are due to get the jab shortly. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawihas tweeted,external: ""Another strong day vaccinating yesterday. We keep going, 1 in 5 adults are now protected with two doses."" Restrictions on weddings have been eased as part of England's lockdown exit plans, and will be relaxed in Scotland from Monday. So what are the rules now and how could they change as restrictions are further eased? Read the rules in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland here. German police have fired tear gas and made several arrests in Berlin as they try to control large crowds of people protesting against a proposed new lockdown law. Thousands of people gathered near the parliament building in the German capital, many without face masks, to demonstrate against a bill that would hand the government the power to override regional authorities and impose strict curfews in areas with high Covid cases. At least seven people were arrested as protesters clashed with officers, police say. Some German media outlets are reporting that as many as 8,000 protesters gathered ahead of the vote in the Bundestag - or the lower house of the German parliament - taking place today. More than 2,000 police officers have reportedly been deployed to the area. Public Health Scotland has said it ""cannot rule out"" a link between patients being discharged from hospital and Covid outbreaks in care homes. It found mortality was high, with Covid associated with 21.6% of deaths within 30 days of discharge to a care home. More than 5,000 patients were sent to care homes between 1 March and 31 May last year - many without a test. This report follows an earlier PHS study that was criticised for not being clear on its findings. The health body said the size of a care home was still the biggest factor in the risk of an outbreak.

Ch Insp James Ratti says he is ""appealing to the better nature"" of local young people, and pleaded with those thinking of attending""to please reconsider and avoid doing so this weekend"". The UK government has announced it's setting up anew taskforce to investigate antiviral treatmentscoronavirus patients can take at home. It says the aim is to identify at least two effective treatments this year, in the form of pills, to help people fight off early Covid symptoms. Alongside Covid-19 vaccines, a number of drugs are being tested as possible treatments for people who already have the disease. Most of these are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus. So what work is being done to find treatments, and what other drugs have been trialled? Find out here. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been administered to more than seven million people in the US Problems including peeling paint and
loose debris have been found during inspections at a US plant in Baltimore
that makes coronavirus vaccines, the US Food and Drug Administration has said. Emergent Biosolutions, which owns the plant, stopped production at the plant recently, saying the
FDA had asked it to do so after an inspection. The FDA said its inspections were complete and in a report
detailed a long list of problems, including failure
to train personnel to avoid cross contamination of Covid-19
vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca,
which were made at the site. The inspection, carried out between 12 and 20 April,
found the building was not of the suitable size or design to
facilitate cleaning, maintenance or proper operations. Reuters, which reported the news, said Emergent was not immediately available for comment. Johnson & Johnson said it would ensure all of the FDA's observations were addressed ""promptly and comprehensively"". No vaccine manufactured at the plant has been distributed
for use in the US.  Australia has been one of the world's success stories in its fight against Covid-19, but frustration is growing over its delayed vaccination rollout. The country has been slower than most others to immunise its population, with some high-risk groups crying out for protection. Last month, it fell 85% short of its own target - and the lack of clarity around the process has been criticised. Supply shortages and delivery problems have been blamed for the delays. And while steps have been taken to speed up the programme - such as mass immunisation hubs and investment in local production - the government is seeing its success so far in battling Covid tarnished by its sluggish vaccination effort. We look here at what's gone wrong with Australia's vaccine rollout. A cupcake maker that supplies major supermarket chains has had an outbreak of Covid at its factory. The Cake Crew says 42 members of staff have tested positive for the virus at the production facility in Bala, Gwynedd, in North Wales. The firm employs 330 people making over a million cupcakes a week. It said those identified and their contacts were now self-isolating. A joint incident response team includes the company, health board officials and Public Health Wales, and both Gwynedd and Shropshire councils. Here's the full story. Leo Varadkar said it would be ""unfortunate"" if Dublin cannot host games for the delayed Euros Dublin looks set to miss out on hosting matches at the delayed Euro 2020 this summer after the Irish government conceded it does not expect to meet Uefa's demand of filling stadiums to 25% capacity. The tournament is due to be hosted in 12 cities across Europe from June, with Uefa set to make a decision on Munich, Bilbao and Dublin on Friday. Those three cities have been unable to guarantee spectator attendance. ""We think June is too soon,"" says Irish deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar. ""I think if they continue to insist on [having 25% of the stadium full], it'll be hard for it to go ahead quite frankly, which is unfortunate."" While the Republic of Ireland has one of Europe's lowest incidence rates of Covid-19, the government plans to reopen sectors very gradually with most shops due to stay shut until at least May and hotels potentially only opening in June. Read more  A lorry carrying the vaccines entered Idlib via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey The first batch of coronavirus vaccines has arrived in opposition-held
north-western Syria. Some 54,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine supplied
through the global Covax facility have arrived in Idlib province today via
the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. Health authorities in both opposition- and government-controlled
areas of the north-west have initially requested enough vaccines to cover 20%
of their populations, or 855,000 people, via Covax. Phase one of the roll-out is expected to begin in early
May and will include medical personnel and people aged over 60 with high-risk health
conditions. More than 20,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 640 deaths
have been reported in north-western Syria since the pandemic started.
Infections are now reported to be on the rise again, after a lull. Idlib is the last stronghold of the rebel and jihadist
groups that have been trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad since 2011.
An estimated 2.7 million displaced people, including a million children, are
living there, many of them in dire conditions in camps. There has been a relative calm in the region since March
2020, when Russia, Assadâs ally, and Turkey, the oppositionâs main backer,
brokered a ceasefire to halt a government offensive. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has today announced it hasadministered more than 200 million vaccine doses,external. After the US, which has delivered 213 million doses, it is the country with the second highest number of vaccinations in the
world. China isaiming to vaccinate 40% of the country's population by the end of June, and has in recent
days been strengthening calls for eligible recipients to get
vaccinated amid concerns that at its current pace of between three and four million a day, it
will not reach that target. Media have repeatedly said the country remains at risk of a domestic outbreak - via infected people entering the country from overseas - unless vaccination is accelerated. Outlets observe the number of new Covid-19
cases worldwide has been rising for eight consecutive weeks. Today, however, the National Health Commission's spokesperson has commented that in China, ""some people have reported that it has been difficult to make an appointment
for a second dose"". On Sina Weibo,
China's version of Facebook or Twitter, users are talking about how that
has been their experience, withcommenters saying that they've still not been notified about when they will receive a second dose,external, or have simply been told a second appointment is currently
not available. It is more
likely this is due to staff shortages than vaccine shortages. China is one
of the world's largest vaccine producers, andit says it has the capacity to provide five billion doses annually,external. The daily figures also show 10,775,817 people have now received both doses of the coronavirus vaccine - an increase of 350,027 compared with yesterday. Some 33,139,742 people have received one dose - an increase of 107,622. The data also shows a further 192 patients have been admitted into hospital. A further 22 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. A further 2,396 cases have been recorded. On Tuesday there were 33 deaths and 2,524 cases. Fitness fans took part in millions of workouts in the week after lockdown restrictions eased in England. The PureGym chain says more than one million workouts took place across its 240 sites to have reopened - but says it suffered ""awful"" losses during the pandemic. David Lloyd Leisure has also told the BBC footfall in its clubs in England has been ""extremely positive"" Huw Edwards, chief executive of industry body UK Active, says the number of people heading back to gyms proves ""how essential these facilities are to our communities and how greatly they've been missed"". ""However, our members suffered huge losses during lockdown and were closed during their busiest months, so thousands of facilities still require greater financial and regulatory support in order to recover,"" he says.Read more on this story here. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin German Chancellor Angela Merkelâs national lockdown law has been passed by parliament. The law forces the country's regions back into tough lockdown once infections exceed a certain level. But the move is controversial because regions say they are being overruled, and the debate was heated. Some opposition politicians say the measures - such as a night-time curfew - are too harsh and will undermine support. Outside on the streets, protesters have been even angrier. Some demonstrators were far-right activists or conspiracy theorists.
Most have refused to wear masks or adhere to distancing rules, so police ordered the protesters to disperse. But a majority of politicians believe tougher measures are needed - and polls show that most voters agree. That's because infection rates have been rising.
Germany hasn't been hit as hard as some other European countries, but scientists warn that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed if tougher measures are not introduced. Tomorrow, the law will be discussed by the Germany's Bundesrat, or upper house, and could be enforced next week. The link between obesity and Covid-19 is a ""wake-up"" call for the nation, a health minister says. Lord Bethell has told peers British people are ""carrying too much weight"" and this is a factor in the pandemic. He has been responding to calls at question time in the Lords to do more to tackle obesity. Lord Bethell says the World Obesity Federation's Covid-19 report makes ""stark reading"" for the UK. ""It's clear that excess weight is one of the few modifiable factors that contribute to severe symptoms of Covid and, very sadly in some cases, to death,"" he says. ""This is a wake-up call. Britain is clearly carrying too much weight. ""That is why the government is committed to helping the country reduce obesity and get fit and healthy.""

Johnny Mercer resigns as defence ministerThe Tory MP criticises the scope of a law designed to protect veterans from unfounded prosecutions.,"Tory MP Johnny Mercer says he was ""forced"" to resign as a defence minister over the treatment of veterans who served in Northern Ireland. No 10 confirmed his exit on Tuesday - ahead of the Overseas Operations Bill returning to the Commons on Wednesday. The new law is designed to protect veterans from unfounded prosecutions. But British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland will be excluded from the bill. Mr Mercer called that a ""red line"" for him staying in government. In response, Boris Johnson said the government was ""committed to doing more over the coming months, including for those who have served in Northern Ireland"". Military prosecution bill to exclude NI veterans Row over Tory pledge to protect NI veterans A No 10 spokesperson said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""accepted"" Mr Mercer's resignation and thanked him for his service as a minister. But posting a resignation letter on Twitter immediately afterwards, Mr Mercer said he had been ""relieved of my responsibilities in government"". The MP - who is a former Army captain - wrote that the government had ""abandoned people in a way I simply cannot reconcile"" in allowing ""endless investigations"" into historic killings to continue. He added: ""Veterans are being sectioned, drinking themselves to death and dying well before their time, simply because the UK government cannot find the moral strength or courage we asked of them in bringing peace to Northern Ireland in finding a political solution to stop these appalling injustices."" Plans were announced last year by the government torestrict the number of Troubles killings which could be fully investigatedunder a new approach where ""new, compelling evidence"" would be required. But the Overseas Operations Bill would go further for other veterans, such as those who served in Iraq or Afghanistan, proposing a five-year limit on criminal prosecutions. Six former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are currently facing prosecution. In 2019, the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland said of 32 ""legacy cases"" it had ruled on since 2012, 17 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five were connected to the Army. In his letter, Mr Mercer said ""no discernible efforts have been made"" to introduce similar legislation to cover Northern Ireland veterans, despite previous pledges, adding: ""I can see no prospect of this changing."" Boris Johnson says the Overseas Operations Bill will address ""vexatious"" claims against veterans The Tory MP said he was ""deeply proud of my predecessors who served in Northern Ireland"", adding they were ""not second-class veterans"" and deserved ""the protection of the Overseas Operations Bill like everyone else"". No 10 later shared a letter from the PM to Mr Mercer, thanking him for ""highlighting the importance of legislating to protect our Armed Forces against vexatious and repeated claims"". Mr Johnson wrote: ""The conclusion of the enactment of the Overseas Operations Bill is a crucial part of that, addressing veterans who have served overseas. ""But we are committed to doing more over the coming months, including for those who have served in Northern Ireland."" While the government has not moved on Mr Mercer's calls, it has changed course over another contentious part of the bill, ahead of the debate on Wednesday. The law had come under fierce criticism by human rights groups, former military commanders and lawyers for including a ""presumption against prosecution"" after the five-year time frame for the most serious of crimes - namely torture, genocide and crimes against humanity. Labour's Lord Roberts brought an amendment to the bill in the House of Lords to ensure the rule does not apply for those actions, which won the support of peers. And now, ahead of the debate, the Ministry of Justice has conceded to the amendment, promising to exclude torture, genocide and crimes against humanity from the rule. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""Whilst we maintain nothing in this bill prevents those accused of breaking the law from being prosecuted, we have listened to concerns, and in order to send a powerful message to the international community, amendments will be made to the Overseas Operations Bill."" However, the department confirmed it would seek to overturn three other amendments agreed by peers earlier this month.

"Breaking|Breaking newsUK inflation rate rises to 0.7% in MarchThe cost of living was pushed higher by the increasing prices of clothes, fuel and transport.Business","The UK inflation rate rose to 0.7% in the 12 months to March, up from 0.4% in February, pushed up by the increased cost of fuel, transport and clothes. The figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was slightly below economists' forecasts, with lower food prices offsetting other price rises. Fuel prices in March showed their biggest annual increase since January 2020, the ONS said. Inflation is forecast to rise further due to higher energy and oil prices. The Bank of England has forecast that inflation could reach 1.9% by the end of 2021, with other experts saying it will exceed 2% before the end of year. The March inflation figure would have been higher without a fall in food prices, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. What is the UK's inflation rate? Under-35s bearing brunt of jobs crisis UK outlook 'uncertain' despite vaccine, says Bank ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said: ""The rate of inflation increased with petrol prices rising and clothes recovering from the falls seen in February. ""However, food prices fell back on the year, as prices of some staples were lower than at the start of the pandemic."" Inflation had unexpectedly eased in February, in part because of the biggest annual fall in clothing and footwear costs since 2009. Discounting, which had been commonplace in February, eased somewhat in March, the ONS said, however it was still unseasonably high. Pantheon's chief UK economist, Samuel Tombs, believes the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) will reach the Bank of England's 2% target rate as early as May. At the last big fiscal event, Chancellor Rishi Sunak let it be known that what keeps him awake at night is the risk that interest rates rise, making the public finances unsustainable. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has indicated a one percentage point rise in interest rates would add around Â£20bn to the cost of servicing the debt. So with consumer price inflation now heading back to its official target of 2% - some say as soon as next month - how much sleep should the chancellor lose? If you listen to those who spend their entire waking lives speculating about these things, interest rates swaps traders in the City, after looking at the inflation figures they're evenly split between those who think we'll have a rate rise by the end of 2022 and those who think it will take longer. But they're only pricing in a quarter of a percentage point, even then. By which time, if the OBR's forecasts are right, the budget deficit will be coming down, slowing the rise in debt as the economy grows. Right now it amounts to a calming message to Rishi: relax, Chancellor, and go back to sleep. ""Looking ahead, CPI inflation looks set to jump to about 1.7% in April, driven primarily by a large semi-annual increase in electricity and natural gas prices, as well as the anniversary of the collapse in oil prices at the start of the pandemic,"" he said. ""April's data also will be collected after shops reopened and hospitality businesses resumed outdoor service, so the inflation rates for clothing and food service activities probably will both rise."" And Paul Craig, at Quilter Investors, said that with the UK economy opening from lockdown, inflation had reached a turning point. ""Price growth is now on an upward trajectory, and should remain so for some time to come,"" he warned. ""From here, inflation may tick markedly higher if the steady drip of consumer spending morphs into a waterfall as lockdown restrictions are lifted and households spend some of their accumulated pandemic savings."" Clothes prices are back on the rise, after having fallen sharply in February. Inflation fell in the early months of lockdown last year, with petrol hitting as low as 106.2p per litre in May. The ONS said on Tuesday that pump prices hit 123.7p a litre in March. Domestic energy bills are also rising. Regulator Ofgem's price cap on household bills rose from the beginning of this month. Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""The big question is whether the economic recovery, combined with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will start to foster a more sustained, inflationary trend that has the potential to get out of hand."" But he added: ""This risk isn't likely to come home to roost anytime soon, with unemployment expected to rise later this year, thereby acting as a drag on rising wages."" Meanwhile, the Retail Price Index (RPI), used to calculate train ticket price rises and student loan interest, rose from 1.4% to 1.5%.

Netflix shares plunge as subscribers switch off,"About 3.98 million people signed up for Netflix between January and March Video-streaming giant Netflix has reported a slowdown in subscriber growth, sending its shares tumbling. About 3.98 million people signed up for Netflix between January and March, well short of the projected 6 million. The company said a lack of new shows may have contributed to the shortfall, adding that it expected this to recover as sequels to hit shows are released. Netflix shares fell 11% in after-hours trading to $489.28, wiping $25bn off the company's market capitalization. Byron Bay backlash over Netflix show plans Bridgerton gets third and fourth series on Netflix Netflix considers crackdown on password sharing The streaming service added 15.8 million new subscribers last year as Covid-19 forced people around the world to stay home. Much of that growth came in Asia, where Netflix added 9.3 million new subscribers in 2020, an increase of about 65% over the previous year. But the pandemic has proven a double-edged sword for Netflix, because it also disrupted its production pipeline. This video can not be played WATCH:  The BBC speaks exclusively to the author who wrote the books that inspired the Netflix series Bridgerton. ""These dynamics are also contributing to a lighter content slate in the first half of 2021, and hence, we believe slower membership growth,"" the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. The company projected poor customer growth ahead, with an additional 1 million new streaming customers in the second quarter, far short of the previously predicted 5 million. Netflix also faces increasingly stiff competition from new streaming services entering the market. Disney+, a much newer streaming service, already has 100 million subscribers, compared with Netflix's 207.6 million. Disney Plus racks up 50m subscribers in five months Even with sluggish customer growth, Netflix has reported revenues of $7.16bn and net income of $1.71bn. Netflix predicted stronger growth in the second half of the year when it releases new seasons of ""You,"" ""Money Heist,"" ""The Witcher"" and action movie ""Red Notice,"" among other titles. ""We had those ten years where we were growing smooth as silk,"" Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings said on a streamed earnings call, according to an AFP report.

TikTok sued for billions over children's data,"TikTok is facing a legal challenge from former children's commissioner for England Anne Longfield over how it collects and uses children's data. The claim is being filed on behalf of millions of children in the UK and EU who have used the hugely popular video-sharing app. If successful, the children affected could each be owed thousands of pounds. TikTok said the case was without merit and it would fight it. Lawyers will allege that TikTok takes children's personal information, including phone numbers, videos, exact location and biometric data,  without sufficient warning, transparency or the necessary consent required by law, and without children or parents knowing what is being done with that information. In response, the video-sharing app said: ""Privacy and safety are top priorities for TikTok and we have robust policies, processes and technologies in place to help protect all users, and our teenage users in particular. We believe the claims lack merit and intend to vigorously defend the action."" TikTok has more than 800 million users worldwide and parent firm ByteDance made billions in profits last year, with the vast majority of that coming via advertising revenue. The claim is being launched on behalf of all children who have used TikTok since 25 May 2018, regardless of whether they have an account or their privacy settings. Children not wishing to be represented can opt out. Ms Longfield told the BBC she was focusing on TikTok because, while all social media platforms collected information, TikTok had ""excessive"" data collection policies. ""TikTok is a hugely popular social media platform that has helped children keep in touch with their friends during an incredibly difficult year. However, behind the fun songs, dance challenges and lip-sync trends lies something far more sinister."" She alleges the firm is ""a data collection service that is thinly veiled as a social network"" which has ""deliberately and successfully deceived parents"". She added that those parents have a ""right to know"" what private information is being collected via TikTok's ""shadowy data collection practices"". The case is being represented by law firm Scott and Scott. Partner Tom Southwell said he believed the information collected by TikTok represents ""a severe breach of UK and EU data protection law"". ""TikTok and ByteDance's advertising revenue is built on the personal information of its users, including children. Profiting from this information without fulfilling its legal obligations, and its moral duty to protect children online, is unacceptable."" The case is not without precedent. In 2019, the Chinese firm was given a record $5.7m fine by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for mishandling children's data. The firm has been fined in South Korea over how it collects children's data, and in the UK, it has been investigated by  the Information Commissioner's Office. That action revolved around Musical.ly, which was incorporated into TikTok, knowingly hosting content published by users under the age of 13. TikTok was ordered to delete the data and set up an age verification system. According to Ofcom, 44% of eight to 12-year-olds in the UK use TikTok, despite its policies forbidding under-13s on the platform. The  legal action against TikTok was first brought by an anonymous 12-year-old girl last year, supported by Ms Longfield. At the time, Ms Longfield said she was waiting to see the result of another case before proceeding with suing TikTok. The case in question was brought by Which? director Richard Lloyd on behalf of four million iPhone users who, he alleges, were illegally tracked by Google. Despite being launched in 2017, the case has still not had the go-ahead and is due to be heard by the Supreme Court soon. ""It could be difficult for similar cases to succeed if the Supreme Court dismisses Mr Lloyd's ability to bring his claim,"" said Richard Leedham, partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya.

UK ticket-holder wins Â£59m EuroMillions jackpot,"A lucky UK-ticket holder has won the jackpot prize of Â£59m in the EuroMillions draw. Tuesday's winning numbers were 5, 17, 28, 41 and 46 with the Lucky Star numbers 10 and 11. The winner correctly matched all five of the EuroMillions numbers as well as the two Lucky Star numbers. Camelot's Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at the National Lottery, said it was ""amazing news"" that someone had scooped the top prize. What do lottery winners spend their money on? What do you do with Â£170m? I won the lottery at 22, here's what happened next He said it was the second UK EuroMillions jackpot winner this month, after a another ticket-holder scooped the 122m jackpot on 2 April. That anonymous player became the UK's fifth biggest National Lottery winner and the win would put them in the top 1,000 on the Sunday Times rich list 2020. EuroMillionsputs the odds of winning the jackpot,externalat around 1 in 139,838,160. Last month, an 80-year-old manbagged more than Â£100,000in the draw after forgetting his glasses and being unable to pick his regular numbers. Denis Fawsitt would normally use family birthdays for his weekly ticket, but as he could not see, went for a lucky dip instead. Ann Fawsitt said she had a small sherry and her husband Denis had a drop of whisky to celebrate the win He and his wife Ann, 75, said they were planning to make over their Derbyshire home and garden with the Â£116,124 winnings. The highest amount ever won on EuroMillions was â¬210m (Â£180m), which was taken home by a Swiss player in February this year. One couple from Northern Ireland, who won Â£115m in the EuroMillions lottery two years agohave already given away more than halfto loved ones. Another couple who won Â£1m in the draw last monthsaid they would be able tobuy a bigger home to help them care for their youngest son who has scoliosis. Tickets for EuroMillions are sold in nine countries - the UK, France, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Irish Republic, Portugal and Switzerland - with ticket-holders in all those countries trying to win a share of the same jackpot each week.

Ex-officer Derek Chauvin guilty of Floyd murderDerek Chauvin knelt on the neck of African-American George Floyd for over nine minutes last May.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Watch the moment Derek Chauvin learnt his fate A US jury has found a former police officer guilty of murder over the death of African-American George Floyd on a Minneapolis street last year. Derek Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. The widely watched footage sparked worldwide protests against racism and excessive use of force by police. Chauvin was found guilty on three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. His bail was immediately revoked and he was placed in custody. Sentencing is likely to happen in two months, and Chauvin could spend decades in jail. In Minnesota, second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Third-degree murder is punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Second-degree manslaughter is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Chauvin is expected to appeal against the verdict. The murder that drove America to the brink 'This is monumental. This is historic' Five key moments from the trial Police officers have rarely been convicted - if they are charged at all - for deaths that occur in custody, and the verdict in this trial has been widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future. Three other officers are due to face trial later this year on aiding-and-abetting charges. The 12-member jury took less than a day to reach their verdict, which followed a highly-charged, three-week trial that left Minneapolis on edge. Several hundred people cheered outside the court as the verdict was announced. The Floyd family's lawyer, Ben Crump, said it marked a ""turning point in history"" for the US. This video can not be played Relief and tears in a hair salon: 'Finally we can breathe' ""Painfully earned justice has finally arrived,"" he tweeted. ""[It] sends a clear message on the need for accountability of law enforcement."" The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris called the Floyd family after the verdict.  Mr Biden was heard saying that ""at least now there is some justice"". This video can not be played Biden on Chauvin verdict: 'Our work isn't done' In nationally televised remarks shortly afterwards, Mr Biden said: ""Systemic racism is a stain on the whole nation's soul."" Meanwhile, Ms Harris urged lawmakers to pass the George Floyd bill aimed at reforming policing in the US. The Minneapolis police federation, a not-for-profit organisation representing police, said they respected the jury's decision. ""We also want to reach out to the community and still express our deep remorse for their pain, as we feel it every day as well. There are no winners in this case,"" the federation said. According to reports, one of the most likely avenues of appeal is the huge publicity given to the case, with the defence team arguing that this might have influenced the jury. Also, Presiding Judge Peter Cahill said on Monday that public comments by Democrat Congresswoman Maxine Waters could be grounds for an appeal. Over the weekend, Ms Waters had urged protesters to ""stay on the street"" and ""get more confrontational"" if Chauvin was acquitted. On hearing the verdict, people were screaming and cheering, and a little girl in a pink coat held up a tiny fist, in jubilation. ""It's a good day in Minneapolis,"" says 21-year-old Kenneth Nwachi. ""It's a blessing."" Activists say justice has been done, and they will feel as though a weight has been lifted from their shoulders. Their relief is shared by many in the city, a place that has been on edge for months. It is a landmark case for police use of force against black people, and the verdict marks a significant break with the past. Few officers are charged with manslaughter or murder, and fewer still are convicted. But protesters say the calls for justice for George Floyd do not stop after this verdict. The 46-year-old bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store in South Minneapolis on the evening of 25 May 2020. A shop assistant believed he had used a counterfeit $20 note and called the police after Mr Floyd refused to give the cigarettes back. When police arrived, they ordered Mr Floyd out of his parked car and handcuffed him. A struggle ensued when officers tried to put a screaming Mr Floyd in their squad car. They wrestled him to the ground and pinned him under their weight. Security was ramped up in Minneapolis ahead of the verdict Chauvin pressed his knee into the back of Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, as the suspect and several bystanders pleaded for his life. As he was being restrained, Mr Floyd said more than 20 times that he could not breathe, pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"". When the ambulance arrived, Mr Floyd was motionless. He was pronounced dead about an hour later. During Chauvin's trial, the jury heard from 45 witnesses and saw several hours of video footage. Some of the most powerful testimony came from eyewitnesses. Several broke down in tears as they watched graphic footage of the incident and described feeling ""helpless"" as events unfolded. Mr Floyd's girlfriend of three years and his younger sibling also took the stand. Expert witnesses on behalf of the state testified that Mr Floyd died from a lack of oxygen due to the manner of restraint employed by Chauvin and his colleagues. Chauvin himself chose not to testify, invoking his right to not incriminate himself with his responses. Manslaughter is when someone unintentionally causes another person's death. In second-degree murder, the act that led to someone's death could have been intentional or unintentional. The maximum sentence for this charge is 40 years in prison. Third-degree murder means that an individual has acted in a way that endangered one or more people, ending in death. Twelve jurors were tasked with deciding if Chauvin would face time in jail or be acquitted. The jury remained anonymous and unseen throughout the trial, but its demographics skewed younger, more white and more female. After both sides presented closing arguments on Monday, the jury was isolated in a hotel with no outside contact so they could deliberate on a verdict, a process known as sequestration. Jurors had to agree on a unanimous verdict and were told they could not return home until they had made their decision. The moment Chauvin learnt his fate.
