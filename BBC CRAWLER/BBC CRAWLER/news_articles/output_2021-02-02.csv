Scottish schools to start phased return this month,"Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since December Scotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 February as schools start a phased reopening. The move will include all pupils in P1-P3 as well as pre-school children. There will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. A final decision will be taken on the partial reopening in a fortnight. Further details of the next phase of the gradual return to schools will also be set out at that point, alongside a timescale for the return of in-person learning for colleges and universities. Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, questioned why the first minister had not mentioned any need for P1-P3 pupils to socially distance, and said it wanted to see the scientific evidence to justify the approach. Live reaction to the lockdown review Scotland 'needs to go faster' on vaccinations How soon will children return to school? Covid: Are teachers more at risk of dying? The union added: ""Clearly, any school return remains contingent upon continued progress on community suppression of the virus and that is not a given so we need to see infection levels coming down substantially before the return date can be confirmed."" All of the country's other lockdown restrictions will remain in place until at least the end of the month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. But she said she was ""cautiously optimistic"" that some gradual easing of the rules could be possible from early March. The first minister also announced that travellers coming to Scotland from any countrymay be asked to quarantine in a hotel- which goes further than systems announced in the rest of the UK. Business groups have called on the Scottish government to provide firms with a route map out of lockdown. Two new mass vaccinations centres opened this week in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to join the existing facility in Glasgow Ms Sturgeon said the government intended to allow ""small increases"" in existing provision for children and young people with significant additional support needs from 22 February. And she said there would be a ""significant expansion"" of testing in schools and nurseries in the coming weeks, with tests available for both staff and senior secondary pupils. The first minister said older pupils will only be able to return after 22 February to ensure practical work important to achieving qualifications is completed. Only between 5% and 8% of a secondary school's pupil roll will be able to be present at any one time. Ms Sturgeon also stressed that the schools announcement was dependent on the virus continuing to be suppressed. Only a small number of secondary pupils will be able to go to school at one time Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since the Christmas holidays, with learning being done at home and online. Health experts have warned that the country risks facing a ""lost generation"" unless a way can be found to get young people back to some sort of normality. Interim Scottish Labour leader Jackie Baillie said that most children will have missed more than half a year of normal, in-person schooling as she called for greater investment to be put in place ""for some time to come"" to help them catch up. And the Scottish Conservatives accused the government of failing to get the proper digital support in place for home learning, which it said would further widen the attainment gap between wealthier and less well off pupils. The current stay-at-home lockdown, like the last one, is a long slog. It will last what's left of the winter. But as we move into spring, change is coming. Plans to re-open nurseries and schools from 22 February for the youngest children will not only restore their full time education but will allow some parents to resume work. However, the phased return of schools could add to the burden some families have to carry. If, for instance, you have a young child to get to school and an older pupil to organise for online learning at home, that could be harder to manage than either having both at home or both in school. It is not clear how quickly full time schooling will resume for all age groups. It will be another fortnight before the first minister sets out how wider restrictions might be eased from the beginning of March. It is already clear that process will be gradual and that some measures like social distancing, wearing face coverings and avoiding international travel will not be lifted anytime soon. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that she wanted to see children back in full-time, face to face education as quickly as possible. And she said she was acutely aware of the wider health, developmental and social harms being experienced by young people while they were not in school, and of the pressure school closures was putting on working parents and family life. But she said the current state of the pandemic and the need to protect the country as much as possible from the virus meant that her options for reopening schools were limited. She added: ""The judgment the Cabinet arrived at this morning, based on the advice of our expert advisers, is that if we all agree to abide with the lockdown restrictions for a bit longer - so that our progress in suppressing the virus continues - we can begin a phased, albeit gradual, return to school from 22 February."" All of mainland Scotland and some islands are currently under the country's toughest level four restrictions, with non-essential shops closed and strict travel rules in force. And there has been growing concern in recent days that Scotland's vaccination programme islagging behind the rest of the UK. The country had vaccinated the lowest percentage of its adult population - 13.4% - of all of the four UK nations by Tuesday. Will Scotland have enough time to meet jabs target? The figure for England stood at 18.4% while it was 17% in Wales and 15.6% in Northern Ireland. The UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has written to Ms Sturgeon offering the help of the English health department and the Ministry of Defence to accelerate the rollout in Scotland. Mr Jack said: ""I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as  closely as possible."" A further 34,881 people were given their first does of the vaccine in Scotland since Monday, the highest daily total so far. The country will need to average about 40,000 a day if it is to hit its target of vaccinating everyone over the age of 70 and the extremely clinically vulnerable by the end of next week. It brings the total number of people to have received the vaccine in Scotland, which has about a twelfth of the UK population, to 610,778. The UK as a whole had vaccinated just over 9.6 million people by Tuesday. Prevalence of the virus in Scotland has fallen since the level four restrictions were imposed Covid-19 prevalence in Scotland has fallen under the lockdown regulations from 302 per 100,000 in the week ending 8 January to 136 per 100,000 last week. Test positivity has also reduced to an average of 6.6% in the seven days up to 29 January - still higher than the 5% that the World Health Organisation considers to be indicative of an outbreak being under control. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Pressure on our NHS continues to be severe. The number of Covid patients being treated in hospital remains around 30% above the high point of the first wave last April. ""However, hospital admissions in this wave appear to have peaked on January 12. They have now stabilised and are starting to reduce, albeit slowly.""

Government defeated in Lords on Trade BillPeers back an amendment giving the High Court the right to rule on whether genocide has taken place.,"Protests against China's alleged abuse of the Muslim Uighur community The government has been defeated in the House of Lords on its post-Brexit Trade Bill, with peers backing a move to stop the UK doing deals with countries that abuse human rights. They supported an amendment giving the High Court the right to determine if genocide has been committed. If it decided it had, the government would then have to hold a debate to set out what it proposed to do. Ministers say they are are committed to working with Parliament on a solution. The House of Lords has been considering the Trade Bill for a second time after MPs overturned a series of changes peers made in January. Ministers narrowly see off MPs' revolt on genocide Will the UK refuse trade deals over human rights? The legislation enables the UK to strike new trade deals with countries after leaving the EU. But there is concern over the human rights records of current and potential trading partners,including China and its treatment of the Uighur people. The government says it has spoken out strongly against human rights abuses in China and around the world. Crossbench peer Lord Alton, who brought forward the amendment, said it was time ""to speak and to act"". Under his plans, the High Court would be given the right to make a preliminary judgement on genocide and ministers would then be obliged to have a debate in Parliament if such human rights abuses were found to have occurred. Ministers would have to set out what they planned to do ""within a reasonable time"". Speaking in the debate, Lord Alton said it was an attempt to ""impose a limitation"" on ministers where genocide was shown to have taken place. Peers backed his amendment by 359 votes to 188. The government also lost votes on two other amendments. One by Conservative Lord Lansley would give Parliament the opportunity to set negotiating terms for trade deals. The other, by Labour's Lord Collins, would compel ministers to report on human rights before trade deals are considered. Investment minister Lord Grimstone insisted that ""trade does not have to come at the expense of human rights"". He said genocide was ""notoriously hard to prove"", but the government had ""some sympathy"" with calls to give Parliament a greater role to scrutinise where there were ""credible concerns"". Lord Grimstone indicated that, if a parliamentary select committee published a report on genocide and sought a debate, the government would facilitate one, adding that human rights abuses could not be ""swept under the carpet"". But many Conservative backbench MPs are uneasy at the government's approach. In January, the government narrowly avoided defeat in the Commons when 33 of them voted to outlaw trade deals with countries judged to have committed genocide. The Trade Bill will now return to the Commons for MPs to vote on the amendments, in the latest series of parliamentary back-and-forth between the two Houses, known as ping-pong.

Vaccine numbers rise as Scotland tries to go faster,"Scotland has vaccinated a lower percentage of its adult population than any other UK nation Almost 35,000 people received their first dose of the Covid vaccine on Monday, the highest daily figure since the programme began. It marked the first day in which mass vaccination centres were open in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow. The jump in figures came after concerns that just 9,628 people had the jab in Scotland on Sunday. Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, told BBC Scotland ""we do need to be doing it faster"". He said Sundays had been ""a bit tricky"" for the vaccine programme because many GP surgeries were closed. The figure was the lowest since the Scottish government started publishing daily vaccine statistics. Will Scotland have enough time to meet jabs target? FM to announce outcome of Covid lockdown review When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Scottish Secretary Alister Jack later wrote to the first minister on behalf of the UK government to offer ""any support or assistance we can give you to accelerate your rollout programme"". Mr Jack said this included further requests for military assistance and mutual aid between health services. His letter concluded: ""I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as closely as possible."" Scotland, which has about a twelfth of the UK population, has now vaccinated just over 610,000 people while the UK tally stands at about 9.6 million. Scotland has vaccinated the lowest percentage of its population aged 16 and over - 13.45% - of all of the four UK nations. The equivalent figure for England was 18.39%, Wales was 16.98% and Northern Ireland was 15.59%. In order to be equal to its population share, Scotland should have vaccinated another 200,000 people. In her Covid statement at Holyrood, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland had initially concentrated on making sure there was a depth of uptake in the clinically most vulnerable groups such as elderly care home residents. She said the challenge now was to increase the breadth of the overall numbers. In response, Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives at Holyrood, said the Scottish government's vaccination programme was ""slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK"". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Scotland needed to be ""ambitious"" with its vaccination programme and said there was no need to ditch the rest of the rollout while care homes and other vulnerable groups were prioritised. Ms Sturgeon said ""legitimate questions"" were being asked about the slow rollout but she stood by the approach that was taken. The Scottish government insists that it remains on track to meet its target of having vaccinated everyone over the age of 70 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable by 15 February. But many people aged over 70 have not yet received an appointment letter, with 21% of those aged between 75 and 79 having been vaccinated by Tuesday. Scotland now needs to be vaccinating about 40,000 people per day to meet the target - with Tuesday's total of 34,881 being the highest it has managed in a single day so far. Opposition parties have accused First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of being ""in denial"" about the pace of the vaccine rollout in Scotland. Prof Leitch said the plan had been for most over-80s to be vaccinated in their local GP surgery so they would not have to travel greater distances and where they would know the staff. He acknowledged that many GP surgeries did not open on Sundays, and that ""some people think this was not the right thing to do"". He said the vaccination teams had been ""asked to have another look at that"". Prof Leitch told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""We agree we do need to be doing it faster. ""That is why now, as we have gone down a level to people who are a little bit more mobile - the 70 years olds, the over-75s - they are now being done in big vaccination centres or semi-big vaccination centres."" He also predicted that the opening of the new mass vaccination centres in Edinburgh and Aberdeen earlier this week, alongside the existing facility in Glasgow, meant that ""many, many more"" people would be vaccinated this weekend. The latest figures show 83% of people over the age of 80 have now had their first jab, although the first minister said the figure was likely to be closer to 90% as there were fewer people in the age group than they had thought and the figures are being ""refined"". The daily figures show 98% of older care home residents and 88% of care home staff have been given their first dose. The Scottish government says the opening of two new mass vaccination centres this week will allow it to hit its targets Prof Leitch said: ""We'll finish the over-80s this week, apart from a few stragglers who are maybe a bit doubtful or don't want done or were Covid positive. ""So not 100% but we'll get to just as many as we can by this Friday, and we've started the 70 to 79 year olds and we're beginning to send letters out to those who are over 65 and those who are vulnerable."" He admitted that it was ""hard"" for people in Scotland to hear that vaccination numbers were higher in England, but insisted that it was ""not a race"" - and pointed out that the death rate and prevalence of the virus in Scotland was still lower than in England. Prof Leitch added: ""It is a race against the virus, not a race against my colleagues and I want England to be vaccinated as fast as they can possibly do it and I also want Wales and Northern Ireland to be vaccinated.

Scotch whisky reports Â£500m loss after US tariffs,"Losses to Scotch whisky exports have reached Â£500m as a result of tariffs imposed by the US, according to an industry body. New figures suggest single malt exports have fallen by more than a third since a 25% tariff was imposed in 2019. It was among measures introduced by the USin retaliation against EU subsidies given to aircraft maker Airbus. The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) described the current situation as ""unsustainable"". It also said distillers were ""continuing to pay the price for an aerospace dispute that has nothing to do"" with them. SWA chief executive Karen Betts said: ""Since tariffs were put in place, our exports to the US have fallen by 35%, amounting to over half a billion pounds in lost exports. ""This is being borne by large and small producers alike, who are losing sales and market share in what has been for decades the industry's largest and most valuable market, which they may never now recover."" American drinkers have shifted to spirits in a big way while told to ""shelter in place"" - their equivalent of lockdown. With beer consumption hit, most spirits have seen a big boost, led by tequila. Diageo, the spirits giant, deployed its marketing jargon last week to observe the US market has seen ""strong activations in the at-home occasion"". Whiskies have shared in the activation, except for Scotch, and that's in its biggest export market, where single malts have grown strongly. Those 25% tariffs targeted at Scotch malt have made Irish, Canadian and US alternatives relatively cheaper and helped their sales. It might be that single malt drinkers shift to premium blends, which don't carry the tariff. That would help explain Diageo results, published last week and covering July to December last year, showing malts down 33% on the previous year, while its Johnnie Walker blended range was up 11%. But an industry source says it's not like that for smaller distillers, finding that distributors in the USA have a reduced thirst for Scotch, if any of it - malt or blended - arrives with a price hike. Scotch distillers fear the shift will be very hard to claw back. Removing tariffs will not see Scotch bounce back overnight. This proves a point they've made for years, that Scotch whisky has competitors, who can quickly grab market share. Ms Betts added that it is hard for Scotch whisky producers to understand why the UK government is ""unwilling"" to comply with World Trade Organisation rules on aerospace subsidies. She said: ""Distillers are suffering terrible losses and still the government, after 16 years of unsuccessful litigation, is unprepared to take the necessary steps to ensure subsidies comply with the UK's international obligations."" Last month, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used a newspaper column to call on the UK Government to negotiate with the new US administration of President Joe Biden. As well as calling for the immediate suspension of tariffs, the SWA wants more support for the industry given the difficult trading conditions as a result of Brexit and the Covid pandemic. A Department for International Trade spokesman said: ""The Secretary of State for International Trade has led intensive talks with the US to get these unfair tariffs on UK exports removed. ""We will continue to push hard for a resolution that works for the whole of the UK - including our brilliant Scotch whisky producers. ""We have a clear strategy in place to de-escalate the dispute and we will work with the new US administration at the earliest opportunity to find a solution."" Scotland's trade minister Ivan McKee MSP said: ""The damaging impact of these tariffs on businesses and communities is being felt across Scotland and is increasing, as the SWA's figures make clear. ""Scottish producers have suffered enough for something that has nothing to do with them and cannot wait any longer.""

Salmond inquiry will not publish women's messages,"The Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government's handling of harassment claims against Alex Salmond will not publish messages it received in evidence from the Crown Office. MSPs said the messages were between women seeking ""confidential support"" and were not relevant to its work. They added that they did not want to cause distress to the women involved. But the women whose messages were shared with the committee said it was an invasion of their privacy. In 2018, Mr Salmond took legal action against the Scottish government over its handling of two internal harassment complaints against him. The government eventually conceded its investigation had been ""unlawful"" and was ordered to pay the former first minister Â£500,000 in legal costs. The Holyrood inquiry was set up to examine what went wrong. Last month the committee used its legal powers to demand the release of documents from the Crown Office. These included text or WhatsApp communications between SNP officials and government staff, which were uncovered as part of the police investigation into Mr Salmond. The former first minister wascleared of all 13 charges of sexual assaultafter a two-week trial last year. Convener Linda Fabiani said the text messages were not relevant Last week, prosecutors confirmed they hadhanded over ""material"" to the committeeand asked its members to consider whether it was in the public interest to publish the material. The committee's convenor, SNP MP Linda Fabiani, said on Tuesday that the committee had reviewed the material and unanimously agreed that the private communications would not be published. ""These communications included numerous chains of private messages between different women in what we are clear were safe spaces for confidential support,"" she said. ""The committee is clear that publication and further consideration of this material is not relevant to the committee's work or necessary to fulfil its remit."" Ms Fabiani added that the committee ""will not do anything that may cause further unnecessary distress to any women"". A statement from the women said they were ""deeply disappointed"" that the texts had been requested and passed on, and that they were ""actively considering further options"". ""What the Crown provided are personal communications between friends who supported each other during a traumatic time,"" they said. They said comments made by members of the committee had caused ""considerable distress"". Their statement said a group chat was ""simply a support group for women who had already shared their experiences with the police"" and that the messages showed there was no conspiracy. And they added: ""The bullying and intimidation of complainers through use of their private and personal communications must end now."" The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said it takes its responsibilities towards and victims and witnesses seriously. A spokeswoman added: ""COPFS was compelled to provide certain information to comply with a statutory notice, but asked the committee to carefully consider if it would be appropriate and in the public interest to publish the material provided."" Mr Salmond looks set to appear before the inquiry on 9 February, while his successor as first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is expected to give evidence the following week.

Government defeated in Lords on Trade Bill,"Protests against China's alleged abuse of the Muslim Uighur community The government has been defeated in the House of Lords on its post-Brexit Trade Bill, with peers backing a move to stop the UK doing deals with countries that abuse human rights. They supported an amendment giving the High Court the right to determine if genocide has been committed. If it decided it had, the government would then have to hold a debate to set out what it proposed to do. Ministers say they are are committed to working with Parliament on a solution. The House of Lords has been considering the Trade Bill for a second time after MPs overturned a series of changes peers made in January. Ministers narrowly see off MPs' revolt on genocide Will the UK refuse trade deals over human rights? The legislation enables the UK to strike new trade deals with countries after leaving the EU. But there is concern over the human rights records of current and potential trading partners,including China and its treatment of the Uighur people. The government says it has spoken out strongly against human rights abuses in China and around the world. Crossbench peer Lord Alton, who brought forward the amendment, said it was time ""to speak and to act"". Under his plans, the High Court would be given the right to make a preliminary judgement on genocide and ministers would then be obliged to have a debate in Parliament if such human rights abuses were found to have occurred. Ministers would have to set out what they planned to do ""within a reasonable time"". Speaking in the debate, Lord Alton said it was an attempt to ""impose a limitation"" on ministers where genocide was shown to have taken place. Peers backed his amendment by 359 votes to 188. The government also lost votes on two other amendments. One by Conservative Lord Lansley would give Parliament the opportunity to set negotiating terms for trade deals. The other, by Labour's Lord Collins, would compel ministers to report on human rights before trade deals are considered. Investment minister Lord Grimstone insisted that ""trade does not have to come at the expense of human rights"". He said genocide was ""notoriously hard to prove"", but the government had ""some sympathy"" with calls to give Parliament a greater role to scrutinise where there were ""credible concerns"". Lord Grimstone indicated that, if a parliamentary select committee published a report on genocide and sought a debate, the government would facilitate one, adding that human rights abuses could not be ""swept under the carpet"". But many Conservative backbench MPs are uneasy at the government's approach. In January, the government narrowly avoided defeat in the Commons when 33 of them voted to outlaw trade deals with countries judged to have committed genocide. The Trade Bill will now return to the Commons for MPs to vote on the amendments, in the latest series of parliamentary back-and-forth between the two Houses, known as ping-pong.

Jeff Bezos to step down as Amazon chief executive,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is to step down as chief executive of the e-commerce giant that he started in his garage nearly 30 years ago. He will become executive chairman, a move he said would give him ""time and energy"" to focus on his other ventures. Mr Bezos,who has a fortune of almost $200bn,external, will be replaced by Andy Jassy, who currently leads Amazon's cloud computing business. The change will take place in the second half of 2021, the company said. ""Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it's consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it's hard to put attention on anything else,"" Mr Bezos said in aletter to Amazon staff,externalon Tuesday. ""As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions."" ""I've never had more energy, and this isn't about retiring. I'm super passionate about the impact I think these organisations can have,"" he added. Mr Bezos, 57, has led Amazon since its start as an online bookshop in 1994. The firm now employs 1.3 million people globally and has its hand in everything from package delivery and streaming video to cloud services and advertising. He's amassed a fortune of $196.2bn,according to Forbes' list of billionaires.,external, making him the world's richest man. However, Bloomberg's billionaire index puts Tesla boss Elon Musk just ahead of him. Amazon saw its already explosive growth skyrocket last year, as the pandemic prompted a surge in online shopping. Andy Jassy has been with Amazon since 1997 The firm reported $386bn (Â£283bn) in sales in 2020, up 38% from 2019. Profits almost doubled, rising to $21.3bn. In announcing the plans, Mr Bezos said he would continue to focus on new products and initiatives. ""When you look at our financial results, what you're actually seeing are the long-run cumulative results of invention,"" he said. ""Right now I see Amazon at its most inventive ever, making it an optimal time for this transition."" The shake-up comes as Mr Bezos has developed an increasingly public profile. He has endured a public divorce, become a target for labour and inequality activists, and poured his wealth into other businesses, such as space exploration firm Blue Origin and the Washington Post newspaper. Amazon also faces increasing scrutiny from regulators, who have questioned its monopoly power. And its dominance in cloud computing is being increasingly challenged by other tech firms, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube. Amazon settles claims it pocketed drivers' tips How Bezos built Amazon's data machine Mr Bezos's decision to hand over the day-to-day operation of the company came as a surprise. But investors appeared unfazed, with little change in the firm's share price in after-hours trade. In a call with analysts to discuss the firm's financial results, Amazon chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said: ""Jeff is not leaving, he is getting a new job... The board is super active and important in Amazon's success story.""Â This video can not be played Five things to know about Amazon boss Jeff Bezos Mr Jassy, a Harvard graduate, has been with Amazon since 1997 and helped develop Amazon Web Services, which has long been seen as the profit engine of the company. The division provides cloud computing and storage for governments and companies including McDonald's and Netflix. ""Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence,"" Mr Bezos said. Sophie Lund-Yates, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was ""no accident"" that Amazon is tapping the head of the cloud business to lead the company. This is a real surprise. But you have to remember that Jeff Bezos himself is worth nearly $200bn. And when you're that rich imagine what you can do. Jeff Bezos has some pretty lofty ambitions outside of Amazon. His Blue Origin company wants to ""build a road to space"". He's also sunk $10bn into Earth Fund, designed to help combat the effects of climate change. Oh, and he also owns the Washington Post. How will Amazon cope? Well, importantly, he's not leaving. As executive chair and founder he'll still exercise huge power over the company. However, stepping back will inevitably mean less influence. His replacement - Andy Jassy - has been running Amazon Web Services, Amazon's booming cloud business division. His rise to the top underscores how important this business has become to Amazon. Another top executive, Jeff Wilke, who led the firm's consumer business, announced his retirement last year. Amazon Web Services ""continued to shine in [its most recent] quarter, and now accounts for a more meaningful chunk of sales. The potential here is huge, and the scalable benefits that come with it should have ears pricking up,"" she said. Overall sales at the company rose 44% in the last three months of the year to $125.6bn, boosted in part by renewed lockdowns in some parts of the world as well as a later date for the firm's ""Prime Day"", when the firm drives sales with a slew of discounts. Amazon Web Services saw sales rise 28% to $12.7bn. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, wrote on Twitter that the ""huge"" announcement showed how central cloud services are to Amazon's business. But she added that she did not think Bezos was ""done making an impact on the future of the company"". Critics of the firm reacted to the announcement similarly. ""Do not be fooled by Amazon. Jeff Bezos is still in a position of immense power as executive chair,"" said Public Citizen, a US-based consumer rights activist group.

Real Wolf of Wall Street warns of GameStop losses,"This video can not be played ""Shares look great on the way up, but painful on the way down"" Amateur investors swept up in the trading frenzy surrounding US retailer GameStop ""could lose everything"", the former stock broker who inspired the Wolf of Wall Street film has warned. Jordan Belfort, who was jailed for market manipulation in 1999, said such investments could be ""great on the way up, but painful on the way down"". GameStop shares surged 700% last week as amateurs, inspired by tips shared on social media, piled into the stock. But they have dropped sharply since. Shares fell 63% on Tuesday to $81 - a far cry from last week's record of almost $350. Mr Belfort said he sympathised with the small-time traders drawn to GameStop, many of whom wanted to turn the tables on big Wall Street firms. But he told the BBC: ""You must be so careful because eventually these stocks are going to come crashing back down to earth. ""If you are looking at this as a way to make your living, you'll have to catch a falling knife on the way down. I would urge people to take their chips off the table."" Real 'Wolf of Wall Street' offers investor knowhow Real Wolf of Wall Street sues film studio for $300m The trading frenzy began in late January, when small-time investors began buying up shares in GameStop, a loss-making video games retailer. Many Wall Street hedge funds - known as ""short sellers"" - had bet against the firm, meaning they stood to make money if its stock fell, but lose heavily if it rose. But amateurs, inspired by posts on Reddit and Youtube, realised they could drive up the price if they bought en masse, inflicting losses on the big players and making gains for themselves. The excitement also encompassed other stocks such as AMC and Nokia,while the price of silver has seen intense speculation. Mr Belfort said the trading had taken on a political tone, with investors seeking ""justice"" against Wall Street firms they perceived had behaved unethically. He added: ""All of a sudden there is a way for people to communicate on message boards like Reddit, there's a way for them to trade instantly on platforms like Robinhood. ""You put those two things together with the power of social media and bam - just like that the little guy got the best of the big institutions."" However, he said there was a risk of people getting swept away in the excitement, noting that those with little understanding of stocks were now buying GameStop shares. ""Be aware of being the last person on the bandwagon, that is really the danger here."" Mr Belfort, who is now an author and motivational speaker, defrauded investors of $200m in the 1980s and 90s and is still paying restitution to his victims. His memoir was the inspiration for Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street film in 2013, but he sued the film's producers for fraud and breach of contract last year claiming $300m in compensation. Mr Belfort alleged Red Granite Productions - whose co-founder Riza Aziz was arrested on suspicion of money laundering last year - lied about being ""legitimately funded"" when he sold the rights to his story. The company's lawyer described the lawsuit as ""desperate and supremely ironic"".

Scottish schools to start phased return this monthThe country's youngest primary and nursery pupils are likely to return to the classroom from 22 February.Scotland,"Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since December Scotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 February as schools start a phased reopening. The move will include all pupils in P1-P3 as well as pre-school children. There will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. A final decision will be taken on the partial reopening in a fortnight. Further details of the next phase of the gradual return to schools will also be set out at that point, alongside a timescale for the return of in-person learning for colleges and universities. Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, questioned why the first minister had not mentioned any need for P1-P3 pupils to socially distance, and said it wanted to see the scientific evidence to justify the approach. Live reaction to the lockdown review Scotland 'needs to go faster' on vaccinations How soon will children return to school? Covid: Are teachers more at risk of dying? The union added: ""Clearly, any school return remains contingent upon continued progress on community suppression of the virus and that is not a given so we need to see infection levels coming down substantially before the return date can be confirmed."" All of the country's other lockdown restrictions will remain in place until at least the end of the month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. But she said she was ""cautiously optimistic"" that some gradual easing of the rules could be possible from early March. The first minister also announced that travellers coming to Scotland from any countrymay be asked to quarantine in a hotel- which goes further than systems announced in the rest of the UK. Business groups have called on the Scottish government to provide firms with a route map out of lockdown. Two new mass vaccinations centres opened this week in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to join the existing facility in Glasgow Ms Sturgeon said the government intended to allow ""small increases"" in existing provision for children and young people with significant additional support needs from 22 February. And she said there would be a ""significant expansion"" of testing in schools and nurseries in the coming weeks, with tests available for both staff and senior secondary pupils. The first minister said older pupils will only be able to return after 22 February to ensure practical work important to achieving qualifications is completed. Only between 5% and 8% of a secondary school's pupil roll will be able to be present at any one time. Ms Sturgeon also stressed that the schools announcement was dependent on the virus continuing to be suppressed. Only a small number of secondary pupils will be able to go to school at one time Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since the Christmas holidays, with learning being done at home and online. Health experts have warned that the country risks facing a ""lost generation"" unless a way can be found to get young people back to some sort of normality. Interim Scottish Labour leader Jackie Baillie said that most children will have missed more than half a year of normal, in-person schooling as she called for greater investment to be put in place ""for some time to come"" to help them catch up. And the Scottish Conservatives accused the government of failing to get the proper digital support in place for home learning, which it said would further widen the attainment gap between wealthier and less well off pupils. The current stay-at-home lockdown, like the last one, is a long slog. It will last what's left of the winter. But as we move into spring, change is coming. Plans to re-open nurseries and schools from 22 February for the youngest children will not only restore their full time education but will allow some parents to resume work. However, the phased return of schools could add to the burden some families have to carry. If, for instance, you have a young child to get to school and an older pupil to organise for online learning at home, that could be harder to manage than either having both at home or both in school. It is not clear how quickly full time schooling will resume for all age groups. It will be another fortnight before the first minister sets out how wider restrictions might be eased from the beginning of March. It is already clear that process will be gradual and that some measures like social distancing, wearing face coverings and avoiding international travel will not be lifted anytime soon. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that she wanted to see children back in full-time, face to face education as quickly as possible. And she said she was acutely aware of the wider health, developmental and social harms being experienced by young people while they were not in school, and of the pressure school closures was putting on working parents and family life. But she said the current state of the pandemic and the need to protect the country as much as possible from the virus meant that her options for reopening schools were limited. She added: ""The judgment the Cabinet arrived at this morning, based on the advice of our expert advisers, is that if we all agree to abide with the lockdown restrictions for a bit longer - so that our progress in suppressing the virus continues - we can begin a phased, albeit gradual, return to school from 22 February."" All of mainland Scotland and some islands are currently under the country's toughest level four restrictions, with non-essential shops closed and strict travel rules in force. And there has been growing concern in recent days that Scotland's vaccination programme islagging behind the rest of the UK. The country had vaccinated the lowest percentage of its adult population - 13.4% - of all of the four UK nations by Tuesday. Will Scotland have enough time to meet jabs target? The figure for England stood at 18.4% while it was 17% in Wales and 15.6% in Northern Ireland. The UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has written to Ms Sturgeon offering the help of the English health department and the Ministry of Defence to accelerate the rollout in Scotland. Mr Jack said: ""I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as  closely as possible."" A further 34,881 people were given their first does of the vaccine in Scotland since Monday, the highest daily total so far. The country will need to average about 40,000 a day if it is to hit its target of vaccinating everyone over the age of 70 and the extremely clinically vulnerable by the end of next week. It brings the total number of people to have received the vaccine in Scotland, which has about a twelfth of the UK population, to 610,778. The UK as a whole had vaccinated just over 9.6 million people by Tuesday. Prevalence of the virus in Scotland has fallen since the level four restrictions were imposed Covid-19 prevalence in Scotland has fallen under the lockdown regulations from 302 per 100,000 in the week ending 8 January to 136 per 100,000 last week. Test positivity has also reduced to an average of 6.6% in the seven days up to 29 January - still higher than the 5% that the World Health Organisation considers to be indicative of an outbreak being under control. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Pressure on our NHS continues to be severe. The number of Covid patients being treated in hospital remains around 30% above the high point of the first wave last April. ""However, hospital admissions in this wave appear to have peaked on January 12. They have now stabilised and are starting to reduce, albeit slowly.""

Scottish schools to start phased return this monthThe country's youngest primary and nursery pupils are likely to return to the classroom from 22 February.,"Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since December Scotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 February as schools start a phased reopening. The move will include all pupils in P1-P3 as well as pre-school children. There will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. A final decision will be taken on the partial reopening in a fortnight. Further details of the next phase of the gradual return to schools will also be set out at that point, alongside a timescale for the return of in-person learning for colleges and universities. Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, questioned why the first minister had not mentioned any need for P1-P3 pupils to socially distance, and said it wanted to see the scientific evidence to justify the approach. Live reaction to the lockdown review Scotland 'needs to go faster' on vaccinations How soon will children return to school? Covid: Are teachers more at risk of dying? The union added: ""Clearly, any school return remains contingent upon continued progress on community suppression of the virus and that is not a given so we need to see infection levels coming down substantially before the return date can be confirmed."" All of the country's other lockdown restrictions will remain in place until at least the end of the month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. But she said she was ""cautiously optimistic"" that some gradual easing of the rules could be possible from early March. The first minister also announced that travellers coming to Scotland from any countrymay be asked to quarantine in a hotel- which goes further than systems announced in the rest of the UK. Business groups have called on the Scottish government to provide firms with a route map out of lockdown. Two new mass vaccinations centres opened this week in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to join the existing facility in Glasgow Ms Sturgeon said the government intended to allow ""small increases"" in existing provision for children and young people with significant additional support needs from 22 February. And she said there would be a ""significant expansion"" of testing in schools and nurseries in the coming weeks, with tests available for both staff and senior secondary pupils. The first minister said older pupils will only be able to return after 22 February to ensure practical work important to achieving qualifications is completed. Only between 5% and 8% of a secondary school's pupil roll will be able to be present at any one time. Ms Sturgeon also stressed that the schools announcement was dependent on the virus continuing to be suppressed. Only a small number of secondary pupils will be able to go to school at one time Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since the Christmas holidays, with learning being done at home and online. Health experts have warned that the country risks facing a ""lost generation"" unless a way can be found to get young people back to some sort of normality. Interim Scottish Labour leader Jackie Baillie said that most children will have missed more than half a year of normal, in-person schooling as she called for greater investment to be put in place ""for some time to come"" to help them catch up. And the Scottish Conservatives accused the government of failing to get the proper digital support in place for home learning, which it said would further widen the attainment gap between wealthier and less well off pupils. The current stay-at-home lockdown, like the last one, is a long slog. It will last what's left of the winter. But as we move into spring, change is coming. Plans to re-open nurseries and schools from 22 February for the youngest children will not only restore their full time education but will allow some parents to resume work. However, the phased return of schools could add to the burden some families have to carry. If, for instance, you have a young child to get to school and an older pupil to organise for online learning at home, that could be harder to manage than either having both at home or both in school.

"EU shellfish import ban permanent, industry told","The EU has told British fishermen they are indefinitely banned from selling live mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops to its member states. As the UK is now a separate country, it is not allowed to transport the animals to the EU unless they have already been treated in purification plants. But the industry says it does not have enough tanks ready and the process can slow exports, making them less viable. The government promised to continue to ""raise the issue"" with the EU. Fishing boats 'gathering dust' as exports halt Fishing firms protest over post-Brexit disruption Bottom trawling ban for key UK fishing sites Since 1 January, UK firms have been able to send only pre-purified, ready-to-eat shellfish - accompanied by an export health certificate - to buyers in the EU's 27 member states. Until this year, they could be purified - with contaminantsremoved in clean seawater tanks,external- after they reached their destination. UK shellfish catches were valued at Â£393m in 2019. Only those landed in ""class A"" waters - the very cleanest - can currently be transported from the UK to the EU without the need for purification beforehand. But most UK waters are not in that category. The UK government previously said it thought the restrictions on exports ofbivalve molluscs,external- such as mussels, clams, cockles, scallops and oysters - wouldend on 21 April.,external This was because Brussels was ""expected"" to change its rules on that date to allow unpurified shellfish in from non-member states. But it has emerged -as first reported by Politics Home,external- that the European Commission wrote to leading UK companies on 13 and 19 January to tell them the current arrangement would be in place indefinitely. This has increased fears for the future of businesses and staff, amid concerns that purified shellfish go off quicker than unpurified ones, making them harder to transport. ""The issue with shellfish is that they are highly perishable, so there are many risks associated with delays,"" Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, told the BBC. ""We are really in a high-risk category compared with other kinds of exports."" He added that ""nothing"" had changed, in terms of the EU's rules, but firms who had thought they were going to were feeling ""very frustrated"". A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: ""We will continue to raise the issue of live bivalve molluscs not ready for human consumption with the EU, to ensure the trade can continue securely."" Ministers would work to reach an ""appropriate solution"", they added.

Calls for Suu Kyi release after Myanmar army coup,"Aung San Suu Kyi is still in detention after the military coup Calls are growing for the release of Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi a day after the army seized power in the south-east Asian nation. Ms Suu Kyi, who led the country's elected government, has not been seen since she was detained by the military. MPs who were confined in their accommodation in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, have now been told they can leave. But there are signs of defiance, including a medical staff strike and pot-banging in the main city Yangon. The military took power in the early hours of Monday and declared a year-long state of emergency after accusing Ms Suu Kyi's party of fraud over its recent election win. All you need to know about the coup Her National League for Democracy (NLD) demanded her immediate release on Tuesday. It has also called upon the military to accept the results of the November election, which saw the NLD win more than 80% of the votes. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces until 2011, when a nominally civilian government was sworn in. The morning after the coup, the country remained calm. Streets were quiet, with troops patrolling all major cities and a night-time curfew in force. The communications systems which had been disrupted on Monday had returned by Tuesday morning, with phone and internet connections running again. Growing up under Myanmar's military rule Military coup likely to damage Myanmar's economy Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? But as night fell on Tuesday, car horns and the banging of cooking pots could be heard in the streets of Yangon in a sign of protest. A campaign of civil disobedience appeared to be gathering steam with doctors working in government hospitals saying they would stop work from Wednesday to push for Ms Suu Kyi's release. Some medics are resorting to wearing symbols in silent protest. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At least one doctor has quit in protest, saying ""such coups cannot be tolerated at all"". Dr Naing Htoo Aung, a 47-year-old anaesthesiologist at Mongywa Hospital in Sagaing Region, told BBC Burmese: ""I resigned because I couldn't work under a military dictator who did not care about the country and the people. This is the best response I can give to them."" A soldier standing guard outside a temple in Yangon One 25-year-old resident, who asked not to be named, told the BBC: ""Waking up to learn your world has been completely turned upside down overnight was not a new feeling, but a feeling that I thought that we had moved on from, and one that I never thought we'd be forced to feel again."" More than 100 MPs, who were blockaded in their accommodation by troops in the capital Nay Pyi Taw, have now been told they are free to leave, BBC Burmese has learned. Power has been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Eleven ministers and deputies, including those in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs, have been replaced. In the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing repeated that the takeover had been ""inevitable"" after the military made allegations of electoral fraud. By Nyein Chan Aye, BBC Burmese, Yangon This city of more than five million people is trying to get back to normal but has yet to digest the previous day's events. The streets are quieter than usual this morning and security forces are deployed at major points. Panic buying has stopped and telecommunications services are back. Private banks are resuming their services after temporarily closing down on Monday. Many people are withdrawing cash to brave the uncertain times ahead. In Nay Pyi Taw, troops with tanks and trucks still surround the country's parliament. It has been a bloodless coup so far, but the impact could be severe at a time of economic downturn amid the Covid pandemic. The political turmoil, with possible international sanctions and foreign investment now uncertain, has left people frustrated and angry. There have been no official statements on Ms Suu Kyi's exact whereabouts since she was detained in pre-dawn raids on Monday. But unnamed sources from within the NLD have said both she and President Win Myint were being held under house arrest. ""We were informed not to worry. However we are worrying. It would be a relief if we could see photos of them at home,"" the MP told news agency AFP, on condition of anonymity. Many of the other detained lawmakers are also still held in their government housing in the capital, with one member of the NLD describing it as ""an open-air detention centre"". Ms Suu Kyi - who spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010 - has urged her supporters to ""protest against the coup"" in a letter written before she was detained. It warned the military's actions would put the country back under a dictatorship. She was barred from becoming president because she has children born to a foreign national. But since the NLD's decisive election victory in 2015 she has been widely seen as de facto leader. How the military disrupted the internet Who is the general behind the coup? This video can not be played Myanmar coup: What's happened so far? Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in south-east Asia which shares borders with India, China and Thailand, among others. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011. Nearly all expressions of dissent were banned and accusations of severe human rights abuses led to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. Her party won again by a landslide in the 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more. US President Joe Biden has threatened to reinstate sanctions on Myanmar. He said the military should not ""overrule the will of the people,external"". Along with the US, the United Nations, the UK and the EU have also condemned the military takeover. The US had removed sanctions over the past decade as Myanmar progressed towards democracy. Sanctions could theoretically be imposed on large companies linked to the military that deal in gems, clothing and have banking interests. They may also target individual generals. Other options include cutting aid, but there are concerns this could unfairly affect the wider population. Protests against the coup have been held outside Myanmar's embassies around the world It is unclear though how much effect the US warnings will have. The coup leaders will have expected sanctions and factored those into their plans. Toe Zaw Latt, Myanmar bureau chief of the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), a non-profit news organisation based outside of Myanmar, told the BBC that the military will know sanctions are an unavoidable consequence of their actions, adding that ""they don't care about Western sanctions"" and are more concerned ""about how China, Japan, South Korea respond"". Who is pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi? What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis ""The country enjoys Chinese protection and South East Asian markets,"" Myanmar expert Elliott Prasse-Freeman of the National University of Singapore explains. ""Hence I expect them to react to sanctions with a shrug, the price paid for reasserting power and assuaging the humiliation of losing to their democratic enemies in two consecutive elections."" China, which has previously opposed international intervention in Myanmar, urged all sides in the country to ""resolve differences"". China's Xinhua news agency described the changes as a ""cabinet reshuffle"". Other countries in the region, including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, have said it is an ""internal matter"".

EU condemns 'threats' against NI Brexit port staff,"The EU has condemned ""threats"" against staff making Brexit-related checks at Northern Ireland's ports, and told EU officials working in Northern Ireland not to attend their duties. On Monday,Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew staff from Brexit inspection duties over security fears. All parties have condemned the threats. A senior police officer said there was no evidence any of the main loyalist paramilitary groups were involved in the incidents. NI police have increased patrols and offered advice on shift patterns. They held talks with council staff after Brexit-related checks at NI ports were suspended amid security concerns. An industry source told BBC News NI lorries arriving on the boats into Belfast and Larne received a waiver on Tuesday and were directed straight out of the ports. After the local authority decided to withdraw its staff, Stormont announced it was suspending physical inspections of food consignments - particularly meat, fish and dairy products - at Larne and Belfast. Checks are being carried out on some goods arriving from the rest of the UK, as part of what unionists view as an economic border with Britain. Unionist politicians strongly oppose the part of the Brexit deal known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, which has led to the new controls. Signage has appeared at the Daera operation in Belfast Graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in recent days, referring to employees as ""targets"". Staff reported suspicious activity - including apparent attempts to gather personal information, such as vehicle number plates. Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan told the BBC there was no evidence to corroborate an anonymous claim that any of the main loyalist paramilitary groups were behind this. Mr Ewan said that ""individuals or small groups of people"" were involved in incidents of graffiti or intimidation. He said there was no evidence that car registrations of staff were being gathered, adding that there was nothing to suggest an attack on anyone was imminent. This video can not be played ACC Mark McEwan said there has been an increase in community tension over the NI protocol. What are the main loyalist paramilitary groups? The posts are run by Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera), led by official vets. Daera stopping the physical checks is a significant move as it means the posts are not operating as they are supposed to. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has 12 environmental health officers, and several senior officials, working at Larne harbour. The gates were closed at the Daera site at Duncrue Street on Tuesday A number of lorries were redirected away from a border control post near Belfast's Docks according  BBC News NI's Michael Fitzpatrick at the scene earlier on Tuesday. The vehicles were stopped on the main road outside the Daera site on Duncrue Street by Border Force officers on Tuesday morning and redirected elsewhere. No activity was taking place within the facility and the main gate into the site remained closed. Border Control Posts (BCPs) were built at Larne harbour, and two other facilities in Northern Ireland,as a consequence of Brexit. They are facilities for inspecting food and live animals when they arrive from other parts of the UK. Things remained quiet at this site in Larne on Tuesday At the end of the Brexit transition on 1 January, Northern Ireland remained in the single market for goods. The rest of the UK did not, so some products entering Northern Ireland from GB must be checked on entry. The EU has particularly strict rules on food and animals, requiring all those products to enter through a BCP. On Friday, unionist parties accused the EU of hypocrisy after it sought to trigger a Brexit safeguard to control the export of coronavirus vaccines into NI. The protocol, which is part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, is designed to allow the free movement of goods from the EU into NI, and prevent the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland. Unionist parties are opposed to it because they argue it poses a risk to the stability of the union by placing a border down the Irish Sea. They have also cited difficulties for trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, arguing the protocol will damage the local economy. Article 16 is essentially a safeguard that would allow the UK or EU to act unilaterally if measures imposed as a result of the protocol are deemed to be causing ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". Food products such as meat, milk and fish now need to be certified by vetswhen moving from GB to NI. This certification is being phased in for retailers but already applies in full for food service and catering firms. When the certificates are issued the lorry trailer is supposed to be sealed. The developments at Larne are being seen within the context of what the PSNI stated publicly last week - there are signs of growing tensions created by the Brexit protocol within some sections of the community. The PSNI had discussions about the safety of port staff. There is nothing at this stage which points to a loyalist paramilitary grouping being behind what is going on. The mood within loyalism is said to be one of discontent, but sources are not suggesting the direction of travel is protests, civil disobedience or violent acts. One source said the focus must be on a concerted unionist push politically against the Irish Sea border. There has been political unity in condemnation of the threats. Stormont's new Agriculture Minister Gordon Lyons of the DUP said there was ""no justification"" for the threats. Speaking in the assembly, Mr Lyons said his department was planning to receive a further risk assessment from the PSNI. He said he could not provide assembly members with a timeline as to when he expected to receive the report. He said: ""This is a time for calm heads, there's a huge degree of anger and we should all be aware of that. ""But that's no excuse for the threats and intimidation we have seen. What we have now are the real consequences of the protocol being felt."" The DUP has saidit intends to send a ""strong signal"" to the Irish government by stopping north-south activitiesrelated to the NI Protocol. It has drafted a five-point plan it says is needed to address the ""growing crisis"" over the Irish Sea border. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin condemned the ""intimidatory tactics"". ""It's a very sinister and ugly development and, obviously, we will be doing everything we possibly can to assist and defuse the situation,"" he said. Sinn FÃ©in MLA Gerry Kelly called on police to make arrests, if the evidence was there. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UUP leader Steve Aiken said the threats ""are completely unacceptable"" and added that the ""growing anger over the Irish Sea Border and the impact on our economy, businesses and society must be recognised"" by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU Commission. Justice Minister Naomi Long tweeted that ""those responsible for this need to be taken off the streets"". ""Those whipping up tension need to dial down the rhetoric,"" the Alliance Party leader added. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said there needs to be more political leadership shown by unionists to ""tone down"" tensions. He said that the first priority is to establish if workers are safe to return to their jobs through discussions with the PSNI and trade unions. ""If we can establish that they are safe then I think there will be no choice but to get back to work."" Checks are being carried out on some goods arriving from the rest of the UK Mayor of Larne Peter Johnston, of the DUP, said tensions had been building for some time. ""Sadly, these threats and this behaviour is not just an overnight thing,"" he told Radio Foyle. ""We won't be putting our staff back into that position until the risk assessment comes back to say that it's safe to do so."" The European Commission's spokesperson said the EU ""condemned very strongly any threat of violence"". ""We understand decisions taken by the NI authorities to temporarily suspend a certain number of checks for the transfer of goods, it is obvious for us the first and utmost priority is the safety of people,"" said Eric Mamer. EU and UK government officials will hold a virtual meeting with Stormont's first and deputy first ministers on Wednesday. PSNI officials held talks with Mid and East Antrim council and Daera officials to discuss the threats, which ACC McEwan described as ""constructive"". The council has said it will carry out a full risk assessment with the PSNI, Food Standards Agency and Daera. Victor Chestnutt, the President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said he was concerned that the supply of food may be affected by the suspension of checks. He told BBC News NI: ""Some of our food companies bring in ingredients from the UK mainland. If they needed checks and those checks are not done, is that going to be held at the port or is that going to be released? ""Trade needs to flow and flow freely.

Which areas will have mass testing?,"Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found. This is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage. Increased testing and enhanced contact tracing iscarried out in very specific locations,external- local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets. Some of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not haveCovid symptoms. The testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.

Army medics are helping with vaccinations in some areas where the Delta variant is spreading Scientists have identified a number of ""variants of concern"" - these arenewly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. Also, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines. The Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. This involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis. It is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result. The lateral flow test This also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid.

Prosperity comes at 'devastating' cost to natureLandmark review calls for fundamental change in our approach to economics to stem nature loss.Science & EnvironmentComments,"Our demands on nature are untenable, the report says A landmark review has called for transformational change in our economic approach to nature. The long-awaited review by Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta, of the University of Cambridge, says prosperity has come at a ""devastating"" cost to the natural world. The report proposes recognising nature as an asset and reconsidering our measures of economic prosperity. It is expected to set the agenda on government policy going forward. At its heart is the idea that sustainable economic growth requires a different measure than Gross Domestic Product (GDP). ""Truly sustainable economic growth and development means recognising that our long-term prosperity relies on rebalancing our demand of nature's goods and services with its capacity to supply them,"" Prof Dasgupta said in a statement. ""It also means accounting fully for the impact of our interactions with nature across all levels of society."" Covid-19 has shown us what can happen when we don't do this, he added. ""Nature is our home. Good economics demands we manage it better."" Nature's emergency in five graphics Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' Nature isn't costed into economic decision-making, the report says The Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity was commissioned by the UK Treasury in 2019, the first time a national finance ministry has authorised a full assessment of the economic importance of nature. The report, which has been compared with the influential 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, sets out the ways in which we should account for nature in economics and decision-making. Recommendations include: Making food and energy systems sustainable through technological innovations and policies that change prices and behavioural norms Investing in programmes that provide community-based family planning Expanding and improving access to protected areas Implementing large-scale and widespread investment in nature-based solutions to address biodiversity loss Introducing natural capital into national accounting systems. Should we pay nations to protect ecosystems on which we all rely? Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed the review. The UK is co-hosting COP26 - this year's UN climate meeting - and also holds the presidency of this year's G7. Mr Johnson said: ""We are going to make sure the natural world stays right at the top of the global agenda."" Sir David Attenborough, who wrote the foreword to the review, said: ""This comprehensive and immensely important report shows us how, by bringing economics and ecology face-to-face, we can help to save the natural world and, in doing so, save ourselves."" The 600-page review argues that losses in biodiversity are undermining the productivity, resilience and adaptability of nature. This is in turn putting economies, livelihoods and well-being at risk. Commenting on the review, Jennifer Morris, of conservation non-profit The Nature Conservancy, described it as a ""clarion call"" to world leaders. ""We must tackle the nature crisis in conjunction with the climate emergency for the sake of our economies, livelihoods, and wellbeing - and those of future generations,"" she said. The review has been published at the beginning of a critical year for tackling the climate change and extinction crises. Policymakers are looking ahead to the UN Biodiversity Conference COP15 in Kunming, China, closely followed by the UN Climate Change Summit (COP26) in Glasgow in late 2021. Biodiversity is declining faster than at any time in human history. Since 1970, there has been on average almost a 70% decline in the populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. It is thought that one million animal and plant species  - almost a quarter of the global total - are threatened with extinction. Why is the US rejoining the Paris climate agreement? Wildlife in 'catastrophic decline', report warns Environmental objectives should be aligned along entire global supply chains, the report says The idea of being able to put a price on nature divides opinion, but accounting for the economic value of nature is increasingly guiding policy. While some argue that the assumption the natural world has no value is baked into current business models, others have doubts over whether an ecosystem can be accurately represented by financial models. Katie Kedward, economist at University College London's (UCL) Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, argues that there are conceptual problems in trying to capture the complexities of nature in financial terms. She told BBC News: ""There are significant uncertainties in estimating nature loss in monetary terms and given the uncertainties involved price-based tools can't be used as a replacement to more important steps to restore nature."" The review is the result of an 18-month independent global assessment on the economics of biodiversity, led by Prof Dasgupta. HM Treasury has said it will examine the review's findings and respond formally in due course. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Breaking|Breaking newsScottish schools to start phased return this monthThe country's youngest primary and nursery pupils are likely return to the classroom from 22 February.Scotland,"Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since December Scotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 February as schools start a phased reopening. The move will include all pupils in P1-P3 as well as pre-school children. There will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. A final decision will be taken on the partial reopening in a fortnight. Further details of the next phase of the gradual return to schools will also be set out at that point, alongside a timescale for the return of in-person learning for colleges and universities. Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, questioned why the first minister had not mentioned any need for P1-P3 pupils to socially distance, and said it wanted to see the scientific evidence to justify the approach. Live reaction to the lockdown review Scotland 'needs to go faster' on vaccinations How soon will children return to school? Covid: Are teachers more at risk of dying? The union added: ""Clearly, any school return remains contingent upon continued progress on community suppression of the virus and that is not a given so we need to see infection levels coming down substantially before the return date can be confirmed."" All of the country's other lockdown restrictions will remain in place until at least the end of the month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. But she said she was ""cautiously optimistic"" that some gradual easing of the rules could be possible from early March. The first minister also announced that travellers coming to Scotland from any countrymay be asked to quarantine in a hotel- which goes further than systems announced in the rest of the UK. Business groups have called on the Scottish government to provide firms with a route map out of lockdown. Two new mass vaccinations centres opened this week in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to join the existing facility in Glasgow Ms Sturgeon said the government intended to allow ""small increases"" in existing provision for children and young people with significant additional support needs from 22 February. And she said there would be a ""significant expansion"" of testing in schools and nurseries in the coming weeks, with tests available for both staff and senior secondary pupils. The first minister said older pupils will only be able to return after 22 February to ensure practical work important to achieving qualifications is completed. Only between 5% and 8% of a secondary school's pupil roll will be able to be present at any one time. Ms Sturgeon also stressed that the schools announcement was dependent on the virus continuing to be suppressed. Only a small number of secondary pupils will be able to go to school at one time Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since the Christmas holidays, with learning being done at home and online. Health experts have warned that the country risks facing a ""lost generation"" unless a way can be found to get young people back to some sort of normality. Interim Scottish Labour leader Jackie Baillie said that most children will have missed more than half a year of normal, in-person schooling as she called for greater investment to be put in place ""for some time to come"" to help them catch up. And the Scottish Conservatives accused the government of failing to get the proper digital support in place for home learning, which it said would further widen the attainment gap between wealthier and less well off pupils. The current stay-at-home lockdown, like the last one, is a long slog. It will last what's left of the winter. But as we move into spring, change is coming. Plans to re-open nurseries and schools from 22 February for the youngest children will not only restore their full time education but will allow some parents to resume work. However, the phased return of schools could add to the burden some families have to carry. If, for instance, you have a young child to get to school and an older pupil to organise for online learning at home, that could be harder to manage than either having both at home or both in school. It is not clear how quickly full time schooling will resume for all age groups. It will be another fortnight before the first minister sets out how wider restrictions might be eased from the beginning of March. It is already clear that process will be gradual and that some measures like social distancing, wearing face coverings and avoiding international travel will not be lifted anytime soon. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that she wanted to see children back in full-time, face to face education as quickly as possible. And she said she was acutely aware of the wider health, developmental and social harms being experienced by young people while they were not in school, and of the pressure school closures was putting on working parents and family life. But she said the current state of the pandemic and the need to protect the country as much as possible from the virus meant that her options for reopening schools were limited. She added: ""The judgment the Cabinet arrived at this morning, based on the advice of our expert advisers, is that if we all agree to abide with the lockdown restrictions for a bit longer - so that our progress in suppressing the virus continues - we can begin a phased, albeit gradual, return to school from 22 February."" All of mainland Scotland and some islands are currently under the country's toughest level four restrictions, with non-essential shops closed and strict travel rules in force. And there has been growing concern in recent days that Scotland's vaccination programme islagging behind the rest of the UK. The country had vaccinated the lowest percentage of its adult population - 13.4% - of all of the four UK nations by Tuesday. Will Scotland have enough time to meet jabs target? The figure for England stood at 18.4% while it was 17% in Wales and 15.6% in Northern Ireland. The UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has written to Ms Sturgeon offering the help of the English health department and the Ministry of Defence to accelerate the rollout in Scotland. Mr Jack said: ""I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as  closely as possible."" A further 34,881 people were given their first does of the vaccine in Scotland since Monday, the highest daily total so far. The country will need to average about 40,000 a day if it is to hit its target of vaccinating everyone over the age of 70 and the extremely clinically vulnerable by the end of next week. It brings the total number of people to have received the vaccine in Scotland, which has about a twelfth of the UK population, to 610,778. The UK as a whole had vaccinated just over 9.6 million people by Tuesday. Prevalence of the virus in Scotland has fallen since the level four restrictions were imposed Covid-19 prevalence in Scotland has fallen under the lockdown regulations from 302 per 100,000 in the week ending 8 January to 136 per 100,000 last week. Test positivity has also reduced to an average of 6.6% in the seven days up to 29 January - still higher than the 5% that the World Health Organisation considers to be indicative of an outbreak being under control.

Calls for Suu Kyi release after Myanmar military coup,"Aung San Suu Kyi is still in detention after the military coup Calls are growing for the release of Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi a day after the army seized power in the south-east Asian nation. Ms Suu Kyi, who led the country's elected government, has not been seen since she was detained by the military. MPs who were confined in their accommodation in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, have now been told they can leave. But there are signs of defiance, including a medical staff strike and pot-banging in the main city Yangon. The military took power in the early hours of Monday and declared a year-long state of emergency after accusing Ms Suu Kyi's party of fraud over its recent election win. All you need to know about the coup Her National League for Democracy (NLD) demanded her immediate release on Tuesday. It has also called upon the military to accept the results of the November election, which saw the NLD win more than 80% of the votes. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces until 2011, when a nominally civilian government was sworn in. The morning after the coup, the country remained calm. Streets were quiet, with troops patrolling all major cities and a night-time curfew in force. The communications systems which had been disrupted on Monday had returned by Tuesday morning, with phone and internet connections running again. Growing up under Myanmar's military rule Military coup likely to damage Myanmar's economy Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? But as night fell on Tuesday, car horns and the banging of cooking pots could be heard in the streets of Yangon in a sign of protest. A campaign of civil disobedience appeared to be gathering steam with doctors working in government hospitals saying they would stop work from Wednesday to push for Ms Suu Kyi's release. Some medics are resorting to wearing symbols in silent protest. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At least one doctor has quit in protest, saying ""such coups cannot be tolerated at all"". Dr Naing Htoo Aung, a 47-year-old anaesthesiologist at Mongywa Hospital in Sagaing Region, told BBC Burmese: ""I resigned because I couldn't work under a military dictator who did not care about the country and the people. This is the best response I can give to them."" A soldier standing guard outside a temple in Yangon One 25-year-old resident, who asked not to be named, told the BBC: ""Waking up to learn your world has been completely turned upside down overnight was not a new feeling, but a feeling that I thought that we had moved on from, and one that I never thought we'd be forced to feel again."" More than 100 MPs, who were blockaded in their accommodation by troops in the capital Nay Pyi Taw, have now been told they are free to leave, BBC Burmese has learned. Power has been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Eleven ministers and deputies, including those in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs, have been replaced. In the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing repeated that the takeover had been ""inevitable"" after the military made allegations of electoral fraud. By Nyein Chan Aye, BBC Burmese, Yangon This city of more than five million people is trying to get back to normal but has yet to digest the previous day's events. The streets are quieter than usual this morning and security forces are deployed at major points. Panic buying has stopped and telecommunications services are back. Private banks are resuming their services after temporarily closing down on Monday. Many people are withdrawing cash to brave the uncertain times ahead. In Nay Pyi Taw, troops with tanks and trucks still surround the country's parliament. It has been a bloodless coup so far, but the impact could be severe at a time of economic downturn amid the Covid pandemic. The political turmoil, with possible international sanctions and foreign investment now uncertain, has left people frustrated and angry. There have been no official statements on Ms Suu Kyi's exact whereabouts since she was detained in pre-dawn raids on Monday. But unnamed sources from within the NLD have said both she and President Win Myint were being held under house arrest. ""We were informed not to worry. However we are worrying. It would be a relief if we could see photos of them at home,"" the MP told news agency AFP, on condition of anonymity. Many of the other detained lawmakers are also still held in their government housing in the capital, with one member of the NLD describing it as ""an open-air detention centre"". Ms Suu Kyi - who spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010 - has urged her supporters to ""protest against the coup"" in a letter written before she was detained. It warned the military's actions would put the country back under a dictatorship. She was barred from becoming president because she has children born to a foreign national. But since the NLD's decisive election victory in 2015 she has been widely seen as de facto leader. How the military disrupted the internet Who is the general behind the coup? This video can not be played Myanmar coup: What's happened so far? Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in south-east Asia which shares borders with India, China and Thailand, among others. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011. Nearly all expressions of dissent were banned and accusations of severe human rights abuses led to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. Her party won again by a landslide in the 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more. US President Joe Biden has threatened to reinstate sanctions on Myanmar. He said the military should not ""overrule the will of the people,external"". Along with the US, the United Nations, the UK and the EU have also condemned the military takeover. The US had removed sanctions over the past decade as Myanmar progressed towards democracy. Sanctions could theoretically be imposed on large companies linked to the military that deal in gems, clothing and have banking interests. They may also target individual generals. Other options include cutting aid, but there are concerns this could unfairly affect the wider population. Protests against the coup have been held outside Myanmar's embassies around the world It is unclear though how much effect the US warnings will have. The coup leaders will have expected sanctions and factored those into their plans. Toe Zaw Latt, Myanmar bureau chief of the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), a non-profit news organisation based outside of Myanmar, told the BBC that the military will know sanctions are an unavoidable consequence of their actions, adding that ""they don't care about Western sanctions"" and are more concerned ""about how China, Japan, South Korea respond"". Who is pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi? What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis ""The country enjoys Chinese protection and South East Asian markets,"" Myanmar expert Elliott Prasse-Freeman of the National University of Singapore explains. ""Hence I expect them to react to sanctions with a shrug, the price paid for reasserting power and assuaging the humiliation of losing to their democratic enemies in two consecutive elections."" China, which has previously opposed international intervention in Myanmar, urged all sides in the country to ""resolve differences"". China's Xinhua news agency described the changes as a ""cabinet reshuffle"". Other countries in the region, including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, have said it is an ""internal matter"".

Which areas will have mass testing for Covid variant?,"Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found. This is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage. Increased testing and enhanced contact tracing iscarried out in very specific locations,external- local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets. Some of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not haveCovid symptoms. The testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.

Army medics are helping with vaccinations in some areas where the Delta variant is spreading Scientists have identified a number of ""variants of concern"" - these arenewly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. Also, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines. The Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. This involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis. It is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result. The lateral flow test This also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid.

Into the wild: Could lynx return to Scotland?Three conservation charities are exploring public attitudes to bringing back the predator in the future.Highlands & Islands,"Hunting and habitat loss wiped out lynx in Britain between 500 and 1,000 years ago Hundreds of years after the last lynx died out in Britain, people in Scotland are being asked about whether the cats should be reintroduced. Eurasian lynx are the third largest predator in continental Europe after the brown bear and wolf. Their main prey are roe deer - a small deer that favours woodland. Lynx were once native to Britain but were driven to extinction 500 to 1,000 years ago due to hunting and habitat loss. Three charities - Scotland: The Big Picture, Trees for Life and Vincent Wildlife Trust - have come together to look into the potential of releasing lynx into the wild in Scotland. Last month the charities began a year-long ""extensive and impartial"" study to explore public attitudes to the idea, and to investigate the barriers to returning the animals to parts of the Cairngorms and Argyll. The study,Lynx to Scotland,external, will include consultation with rural communities and is separate from other lynx reintroduction projects. There are strong critics of the idea, with the National Farmers Union Scotland (NFUS) saying a return of the predator would be ""wholly unacceptable"" to its members. Roe deer are the main prey of lynx The three charities believe there are sound ecological reasons for bringing back lynx, an animal they describe as a ""shy and solitary"" woodland hunter, rarely glimpsed and not known to attack humans. They said previous research suggested the Scottish Highlands had sufficient habitat - and more than enough roe deer - to support about 400 wild lynx. Steve Micklewright, chief executive of Findhorn-based Trees for Life, said Scotland had more roe deer than any other European country. He said lynx could help control deer numbers in areas where their feeding harmed natural woodland regeneration. He said: ""By preying on roe deer, lynx would restore ecological processes that have been missing for centuries, and provide a free and efficient deer management service."" Herefordshire-based Vincent Wildlife Trust is leading the study. Jenny MacPherson, science and research programme manager at the trust, said: ""Reintroducing lynx would inevitably bring challenges."" She said the study would seek a range of perspectives to obtain ""meaningful conclusions"" about the level of support or tolerance for lynx, and the likely success of any future reintroduction. Peter Cairns, of Scotland: The Big Picture, said predators like lynx played a key part in healthy natural environments. He said: ""With a global biodiversity crisis, we have a responsibility to have open and constructive conversations around restoring key native species to the Scottish landscape - and science shows that apex predators like lynx play a vital ecological role in maintaining healthy living systems."" Scottish forest identified for lynx reintroduction Lynx forest plan rejected by government Lynx have been reintroduced to other parts of Europe, including Germany's Harz National Park in 2000. Ole Anders, who works on a project managing the park's small lynx population, said there had been discussions and debates about releasing the cats in the Harz mountains since the 1970s. He told BBC Scotland'sThe Nineinitial fears about their reintroduction had included lynx attacks on people and livestock. Mr Anders said no-one had been put risk by the animals, and farmers were compensated for the few livestock losses seen. He said: ""Forestry is the most important business (in the park) and there is not much farming, which is something of an advantage to introducing a large carnivore like the Eurasian lynx."" Mr Anders said some tourism businesses in the park had embraced the lynx and used images on their promotional material. NFUS is strongly opposed to the reintroduction of lynx But NFUS is strongly opposed to the reintroduction. It said an NFUS study trip to Norway in 2017 heard that Norwegian authorities paid out compensation on 20,000 sheep lost to predators, with lynx accounting for 21% of the losses. NFUS vice president, Martin Kennedy, said predation of livestock in Norway had been declining, but only because of the numbers of farmers who had given up stocking sheep. Mr Kennedy, a hill farmer from Highland Perthshire, added: ""The Norwegians told us that to reintroduce predators into our country would be an absolute catastrophe. ""Their experience has simply strengthened our resolve."" Angus MacFadyen, NFUS environment and land use committee chairman, said: ""NFU Scotland remains crystal clear that any proposals to re-introduce predators such as lynx are wholly unacceptable to Scottish farmers and crofters. ""The past three to four years have seen a long line of brazen and presumptuous claims from organisations about the imminent reintroduction of lynx to the UK."" The Scottish government hasno plans to reintroduce lynx,external.

Alcohol deaths hit record high during pandemic,"Deaths caused by alcohol hit a new high during the first nine months of 2020, provisional figures for England and Wales show. Between January and September, 5,460 deaths were registered with this cause - up 16% on the same months in 2019. It is the biggest toll recorded since records began in 2001. The high rates spanned the period during and after the first Covid lockdown, the Office for National Statistics figures show. It reached a peak of 12.8 deaths per 100,000 people in the first three months of 2020 and remained at this level through to September - higher than in any other time on record. As in past years, rates of male alcohol-specific deaths were twice those seen for women. Experts say the coronavirus pandemic will have had little effect on how the data was gathered and recorded. But it is not clear how much it may have contributed to the deaths. 'He drinks six bottles of wine a day' ONS spokesman Ben Humberstone said: ""Today's data shows that in the first three quarters of 2020, alcohol-specific deaths in England and Wales reached the highest level since the beginning of our data series, with April to September, during and after the first lockdown, seeing higher rates compared to the same period in previous years."" ""The reasons for this are complex and it will take time before the impact the pandemic has had on alcohol-specific deaths is fully understood."" John Slater, 63, sought help for his drinking a few years ago, saying dependency ""crept up on me gradually"" after taking an ill health pension and becoming a carer for relatives. ""I needed some way to be able to cope, to escape, and alcohol was it,"" he says. ""I wasn't all over the place, it started as a means to cope. I always used to spend time cooking a nice meal and would have a glass of wine, but one glass became two glasses which became three and then a bottle, two bottles, hidden bottles. Then you realise, oh hell, I have got a real problem here. ""Whenever I thought I had to cut my drinking down, I couldn't manage it and panicked and I went to the supermarket."" John, from Devon, says he was scared of being labelled an alcoholic. ""There's still an enormous amount of stigma around it,"" he says. ""It makes it really difficult for people to come forward."" He eventually found help via the programme Drink Wise Age Well which is runby charity We Are With You,,externalwhich he says offered a ""holistic"" approach and addressed his childhood trauma. He no longer drinks. ""It's not all about people having to go to rehab,"" says John. ""It's also about how our drinking increases when we are maybe isolated, or lonely, or become unemployed, or don't feel wanted or the burden of life increases."" Looking at today's figures about alcohol-related deaths, John says that without help, there was a chance he could have ""carried on sinking and drinking, and gradually unravelled"". The UK's Addiction Treatment Group said it knew first hand how many people have struggled with alcohol since the pandemic began. ""We must remember that what we're talking about here aren't just figures; they're people,"" said Nuno Albuquerque, head of treatment at the group. ""They're mums, dads, brothers, sisters, friends, colleagues and neighbours who have lost their lives to alcohol; a substance so widely accepted and almost encouraged in this country, but one so controlling, addictive and, ultimately, life-threatening.""

Prosperity comes at 'devastating' cost to nature,"Our demands on nature are untenable, the report says A landmark review has called for transformational change in our economic approach to nature. The long-awaited review by Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta, of the University of Cambridge, says prosperity has come at a ""devastating"" cost to the natural world. The report proposes recognising nature as an asset and reconsidering our measures of economic prosperity. It is expected to set the agenda on government policy going forward. At its heart is the idea that sustainable economic growth requires a different measure than Gross Domestic Product (GDP). ""Truly sustainable economic growth and development means recognising that our long-term prosperity relies on rebalancing our demand of nature's goods and services with its capacity to supply them,"" Prof Dasgupta said in a statement. ""It also means accounting fully for the impact of our interactions with nature across all levels of society."" Covid-19 has shown us what can happen when we don't do this, he added. ""Nature is our home. Good economics demands we manage it better."" Nature's emergency in five graphics Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' Nature isn't costed into economic decision-making, the report says The Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity was commissioned by the UK Treasury in 2019, the first time a national finance ministry has authorised a full assessment of the economic importance of nature. The report, which has been compared with the influential 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, sets out the ways in which we should account for nature in economics and decision-making. Recommendations include: Making food and energy systems sustainable through technological innovations and policies that change prices and behavioural norms Investing in programmes that provide community-based family planning Expanding and improving access to protected areas Implementing large-scale and widespread investment in nature-based solutions to address biodiversity loss Introducing natural capital into national accounting systems. Should we pay nations to protect ecosystems on which we all rely? Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed the review. The UK is co-hosting COP26 - this year's UN climate meeting - and also holds the presidency of this year's G7. Mr Johnson said: ""We are going to make sure the natural world stays right at the top of the global agenda."" Sir David Attenborough, who wrote the foreword to the review, said: ""This comprehensive and immensely important report shows us how, by bringing economics and ecology face-to-face, we can help to save the natural world and, in doing so, save ourselves."" The 600-page review argues that losses in biodiversity are undermining the productivity, resilience and adaptability of nature. This is in turn putting economies, livelihoods and well-being at risk. Commenting on the review, Jennifer Morris, of conservation non-profit The Nature Conservancy, described it as a ""clarion call"" to world leaders. ""We must tackle the nature crisis in conjunction with the climate emergency for the sake of our economies, livelihoods, and wellbeing - and those of future generations,"" she said. The review has been published at the beginning of a critical year for tackling the climate change and extinction crises. Policymakers are looking ahead to the UN Biodiversity Conference COP15 in Kunming, China, closely followed by the UN Climate Change Summit (COP26) in Glasgow in late 2021. Biodiversity is declining faster than at any time in human history. Since 1970, there has been on average almost a 70% decline in the populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. It is thought that one million animal and plant species  - almost a quarter of the global total - are threatened with extinction. Why is the US rejoining the Paris climate agreement? Wildlife in 'catastrophic decline', report warns Environmental objectives should be aligned along entire global supply chains, the report says The idea of being able to put a price on nature divides opinion, but accounting for the economic value of nature is increasingly guiding policy. While some argue that the assumption the natural world has no value is baked into current business models, others have doubts over whether an ecosystem can be accurately represented by financial models. Katie Kedward, economist at University College London's (UCL) Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, argues that there are conceptual problems in trying to capture the complexities of nature in financial terms. She told BBC News: ""There are significant uncertainties in estimating nature loss in monetary terms and given the uncertainties involved price-based tools can't be used as a replacement to more important steps to restore nature."" The review is the result of an 18-month independent global assessment on the economics of biodiversity, led by Prof Dasgupta. HM Treasury has said it will examine the review's findings and respond formally in due course. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

The story of the suspected gangster at the heart of boxing," By Darragh MacIntyre By Darragh MacIntyre It was the Gypsy King himself who revealed it all in a near joyous social media post last June. “I’m just after getting off the phone with Daniel Kinahan. He’s just informed me that the biggest fight in British boxing history has just been agreed. Get in there my boy!” The big fight was on. Terms had been agreed for the contest boxing fans wanted more than any other - Tyson Fury versus Anthony Joshua. Fury’s post was exultant. “Big thank you Dan for getting this deal over the line.” For British fight fans, it couldn’t have been better news. The two best heavyweight boxers in the world would fight it out to be the undisputed world champion. Boxing loves hype but it is almost impossible to overstate the significance of this contest. When it happens, it will be the biggest and most moneyed fight in British boxing history. Hundreds of millions of pounds will be in the mix for the fighters, promoters and broadcasters. And at the end of it, one of two British boxers will stand on top of the world, holding the belts once hoisted high by the likes of Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. But Tyson Fury hadn’t just given boxing fans the news they wanted to hear. He had also given up one of boxing’s darkest secrets. The man he thanked three times in his 55-second video, is alleged to be one of Europe’s top mobsters, whose cartel deals in drugs, guns and murder. That’s Tyson Fury’s adviser Daniel Kinahan. Three months later and I was talking to a former boxer outside the gym he runs in a major British city, for a BBC Panorama documentary. Social scientists would describe the neighbourhood as suffering from long-term economic decline. This man has worn a few hats in his time - most significantly as a part-time guardian to a number of young folk. I asked him what he thought of Tyson Fury’s news when he first heard it. “Delighted, delighted. Great news,” he says. But not because of the big fight. “I thought, ‘Finally they will have to deal with Daniel Kinahan,’” he says. “They will have to get rid of him from boxing. The police will deal with him. Everyone knows now.” But this day, he was totally disillusioned. Months had passed and nothing had changed. “Look up the street there,” he demands. “There’s teenage girls turning to prostitution to pay for their drug habit. Kids all around on drugs.” Although Daniel Kinahan has never been convicted, this man is all too aware of the Irishman’s reputation and that he has been named in court as the head of a drug cartel. The man I was meeting wanted to know why he should be trying to convince kids that boxing offered them a safe haven. How could he argue that boxing protected them from drugs, from gangs, from violence, when a man like Daniel Kinahan was at the top of the sport? My colleague Stephen Dempster and I had spent weeks trying to find people in boxing who would speak to us about Kinahan. This was at the start of a very unusual road trip that had begun with a conversation with a long-retired boxing fanatic in Belfast. He gave us one name. And a phone number. We followed his lead and got another name. And so it went. It was as if there was a secret association at the heart of professional boxing. All united on one point, Daniel Kinahan was a disaster for the fight game. “But please,” they all said, “don’t mention my name.” These people were big men mostly.  All of them had been around a few tough nuts in their time. And all of them were afraid of Daniel Kinahan, Tyson Fury’s main man. It was a little after two o’clock on Friday 5 February, 2016. Newspaper photographer Ernie Leslie was scanning the outside of the Regency Hotel in north Dublin. He was looking for signs of Daniel Kinahan, a man he knew as the alleged boss of a powerful drugs cartel. Leslie and Alan Sherry, a reporter colleague from Ireland’s Sunday World newspaper, thought there was a fair chance Kinahan would be about. His boxing management company, MGM, was hosting a big tournament - the Clash of the Clans - on Saturday. It was a joint promotion between Kinahan’s MGM and Frank Warren, one of the biggest names in British boxing. On this afternoon, the boxers were all taking part in a weigh-in at the hotel. Fans and supporters were in attendance. Leslie drove past the front of the hotel but there was no sign of Kinahan. “Then we spotted this guy we knew to be part of the gang. He was going from a car back to the hotel so we decided to park up and maybe get some shots of him and others at the end of the weigh in.” But inside the hotel murder and mayhem were imminent. The last fighter to be weighed-in was Gary Sweeney. Done. The Irishman turned to walk off stage and continue preparations for his first professional fight since he had turned pro under Daniel Kinahan and MGM. A camera phone captured what happened next. Panorama - Boxing and the Mob There’s a sudden explosion of noise. Screams of fear and panic, and at least one gunshot.  Sweeney, and everyone else, dash to get away and out. On the phone footage the voice of a terrified child can be heard: “Daddy help me!” That was Sweeney’s eight-year-old nephew, there to cheer on his Uncle Gary. Now they were all running for their lives. Minutes earlier, a middle-aged man wearing a distinctive flat cap had walked through the hotel linked arm-in-arm with what appeared to be a female companion. They were looking for Daniel Kinahan, with the aim of shooting him dead. Later, witnesses would say they made an odd couple. For starters the “female” was wearing a wig, and seemed to be having trouble walking in high-heeled boots. So when they appeared in the Regency suite, it didn’t take very long before people realised something was very off. That they were now both wielding handguns completed the picture. Three other gunmen arrived in the lobby of the hotel. They were dressed in the uniform of the Irish police Emergency Response Unit and carried what appeared to be Kalashnikov rifles.  Some of those fleeing from the weigh-in ran straight into them. One of them, David Byrne, regarded as a top criminal associate of Daniel Kinahan’s, was shot dead. Security cameras tracked the progress of all the gunmen as they began roaming the hotel, hunting Kinahan. Two more associates of Kinahan were shot and injured. But their quarry had escaped. Photographer Ernie Leslie had heard the first shot. “We were sitting in the car when we heard a loud “crack”. We looked at each other in shock. We couldn’t believe it. Then we saw people running, in a state of panic.” He spotted a man wearing a flat cap running towards a parked van. “It was instinct. I thought I could see something in his hand,” says Leslie. “I stopped the car and grabbed the camera. And just started to shoot away.” Reporter Alan Sherry noticed something else. A long-barrelled gun was pointing out of the van’s window. Then it was pointed directly at them. Leslie threw the car into reverse. The van drove off in the opposite direction. Without pausing to study the pictures, the photographer sent them to his news desk. What he didn’t know until his editor rang him was that he had captured not one, but two gunmen, leaving the scene. One photograph was crisp and clear. It showed “flat cap” with his gun, and running just ahead of him the “female”, also with a gun. Both faces were in sharp focus. Ernie Leslie (The Sunday World) Ernie Leslie (The Sunday World) “Flat cap” was quickly identified as Kevin Murray from Strabane in Northern Ireland. The 46-year-old, known to have ties with dissident Republicans, remnants of the IRA, was arrested. He didn’t face trial, though, because he was very ill with motor neurone disease, and died 18 months after the shooting. Irish police were convinced the “female” attacker was Dubliner Patrick Hutch. His brother Gary had once been Daniel Kinahan’s right-hand man. But they had fallen out, and Gary had been shot dead. The Hutch family blamed Kinahan. The Irish police had their motive. Hutch, then 24, was charged with murder but his trial collapsed two years ago and he remains a free man. Except that he, like other members of his family, now lives with a permanent death threat over him.  There was a time when heroin couldn’t be found in Dublin. Half a century ago, maybe. But by the time Daniel Kinahan’s father Christopher was dealing heroin in the 1980s, it had taken a grip in the city. “A particular group of criminals saw the market,” says Michael O’Sullivan, a former assistant commissioner in the Garda Síochána, the Irish police force. “They had contacts in the UK. They sought to make a lot of money, and introduced heroin into Dublin city around 1980.” Back in the day, Michael O’Sullivan was a drugs squad officer in Dublin. In 1986, he arrested Christopher Kinahan Snr for heroin dealing. “He was operating a safe flat, a luxury apartment which was the nerve centre for the distribution of heroin through most of Dublin city.” Christopher Kinahan’s own background was, as they say in Ireland, “respectable”. The family home in north Dublin is reported to have been the childhood home of an Irish prime minister. Past pupils at a school he attended include literary giant James Joyce. As Dublin crime reporter Nicola Tallant tells us, unlike those people who fall into crime for one reason or another, Christopher Kinahan Snr chose a life of crime. According to O’Sullivan, “he wasn't your average guy who took over a drugs operation. He was a bit smarter, a bit more strategically focused in thinking down the road as to the next move.” After his arrest, Kinahan was sentenced to six years in jail. Other shorter prison terms would follow in Ireland, Netherlands and Belgium. But all the while Kinahan was building up his list of contacts, growing what became known in law enforcement circles as the Kinahan Organised Crime Group (KOCG). By 2010, the KOCG had centred its operations on Marbella in southern Spain. Brothers Daniel and Christopher Jnr were now suspected to be helping their father run the family cartel. Daniel Kinahan was already sufficiently prominent to be name-checked in an American diplomatic cable sent from Sierra Leone to Washington DC. The cable, sent in November 2009, said UK police described him as “an Irish businessman involved in narcotrafficking throughout Europe,” who “may be interested inexpanding his network to West Africa.” In May 2010, Spanish authorities with the assistance of Irish, British and Dutch police, launched what appeared to be a decisive series of raids as part of a far-reaching investigation into the KOCG.  The three Kinahans and associates were arrested. Homes and expensive cars were seized, and it looked like it could be the end of the road for the Kinahan firm. The Irish media feasted on the details of the Spanish investigation. Journalists Stephen Breen and colleague Owen Conlon actually got their hands on a copy of the police files. Co-authors of  The Cartel, a study of the KOCG, they are among a group of dedicated Irish journalists who have been rigorously detailing the activities of the Kinahans. “Their money laundering networks were global and included over 500m euro worth of properties in northern Brazil,” Breen claimed to us. “Money was then being sent to Cyprus, to Lichtenstein, to Switzerland, to Panama, all to hide the cartel’s cash.” And the authorities had made up their mind about the eldest Kinahan brother, as Breen explains: “They identify Daniel Kinahan as having overall control of the day-to-day running of the cartel.” But Operation Shovel, as it was called, proved to have no real bite. It lasted 10 years and resulted in a handful of minor charges. None at all for Daniel, who has no convictions. Once upon a time, the extended Hutch family from north inner-city Dublin, and the Kinahans got along just fine. Irish police say Gerry Hutch, the boss of the Hutch clan, and Christopher Snr laundered cash, processed stolen cheques and generally helped each other out. But there were differences. Gerry Hutch is known as The Monk. Christopher Snr is known as the Dapper Don. Gerry Hutch did robberies. He frowned on drugs. Kinahan Snr couldn’t deal enough of them. Gary Hutch was Gerry’s nephew. Unfortunately, as things turned out, he chose to follow the crime model of Christopher Kinahan Snr, and not his uncle’s. Gary Hutch (The Irish Sun) He moved to Spain, close to Daniel Kinahan. Investigators there concluded: “He is Daniel’s right-hand man and transmits Daniel’s orders to members of a lower rank.” Then came the fallout. By 2014 Gary was suspected of being an informant. This may or may not be the catalyst for what happened next. Sure and certain facts are rare in the cartel world except when it comes to who has been shot, or who has been killed. Two years earlier, Kinahan had helped set up a boxing management company and gym in Marbella. His business partner and the face of the enterprise was Birmingham boxer Matthew Macklin. It was called Macklin’s Gym Marbella, or MGM. Kinahan’s interest in boxing went back to his Dublin days. He’s more than a fan of the sport and had been running his own gym in the Spanish city before he teamed up with Macklin and opened MGM in 2012. In Britain, most in the sport probably shared the view of boxing writer Tris Dixon: “I don't think anyone predicted how big and powerful it would become, and that it was the seed for what would happen in the years that followed.” For sure, well-known criminals used the gym. But MGM became known as a serious professional base for boxers. And it was successful. Talented young British and Irish fighters began training at MGM. Good financial terms were on offer and the best of facilities were on tap. Among the recruits was Tom Stalker, the captain of the successful British 2012 Olympic boxing team. The most powerful people in British boxing are promoters Eddie Hearn and Frank Warren. By the summer of 2014 both had visited and broken bread with Daniel Kinahan. These relationships would only become more important with time. Frank Warren and Daniel Kinahan MGM was quickly becoming a player in the boxing business. And despite its apparent attraction to well-known criminals, it seemed divorced from the out-workings of criminality. That was to change. First came the shooting that August of top boxing trainer Jamie Moore at Daniel Kinahan’s Spanish home. Moore, who’d been working at the Marbella gym, survived. But he wasn’t the intended target. It’s widely reported that the gunman had been hunting Daniel Kinahan himself. One month later. Another regular at the gym - reputed mobster Gerard Kavanagh - was shot. CCTV footage: Gerard Kavanagh, Estepona Spain, 2014 (The Irish Sun) Murderous violence was suddenly stalking MGM. And somewhere in the furious mix of paranoia, alleged drug dealing, drug taking and guns, someone resolved to kill Gary Hutch. Word was that he had organised the attempted hit on Daniel Kinahan. Reports suggest a deal to save his life had been drawn up between his family and the KOCG. If it had been, it didn’t hold. He was shot dead in Spain a year later. Gangland killings are not unusual, but those with any understanding of the criminal networks in Dublin knew this was different. There would be consequences. In Marbella, you might have thought the shadow of the gunmen would have obliterated MGM’s trajectory. Three shootings. Two murders. But you would be wrong. By the year’s end MGM and Daniel Kinahan could boast of two world champions, Liam Smith and Billy Joe Saunders. That success would breed further success. Kinahan had had big plans from the start. Jason Coghlan ran a legal centre in Marbella at the time. No stranger to crime himself, he had served time in jail for robbery. “Danny Kinahan is a personal friend of mine,” says Coghlan. “When he first started this gymnasium, he had a lot of dreams in his head that we couldn't even keep up with. He said: ‘I will make this the biggest boxing promotion gym in the world.’” But first came the Clash of the Clans.  Days after the Regency weigh-in shooting, the killings started in earnest. Taxi driver Eddie Hutch was shot dead - an execution thought to have been carried out by the Kinahan cartel. Irish police sources have said he was an innocent man. But he was a brother of Gerry Hutch, the man alleged to have organised the hotel hit. The Kinahan cartel was blamed for most of the killings that followed. For two years, a small section of Dublin city appeared under siege. A total of 18 people would die, most of whom were relatives or associates of the Hutch’s. The Kinahan cartel came under ferocious scrutiny from the Irish authorities. Dozens of gang members were jailed. None of the alleged leaders of the cartel faced charges but in the view of the police, their role was made clear. In 2018, the Irish High Court accepted police evidence that the KOCG was an international crime group and that its drug operations were controlled by Daniel Kinahan. Later, the Irish Special Criminal Court accepted that the KOCG was involved in drugs and weapons trafficking, money laundering and “execution style” murders to protect its interests. Meanwhile in Spain, the police concluded that Daniel Kinahan was involved in the murder of Gary Hutch, though they admitted they didn’t have the evidence to prove it. We have been told by police sources in the UK that the Kinahans are under investigation for suspected drug trafficking in Britain. We asked the US Drug Enforcement Agency about the activities of the Kinahan cartel. They told us: “We will not be able to comment on this because it is part of an ongoing investigation.” And while all that was happening with law enforcement, a revolution of sorts was reaching maturity in the boxing world - at MGM in particular. First in January 2017 came the news that Daniel Kinahan was officially standing down from the company. Mathew Macklin said the move followed the “bad publicity”. The company changed name, too, rebranded as MTK Global. Later that year the company got a new boss - Sandra Vaughan, a Scottish fake tan entrepreneur and long-time friend of Daniel Kinahan’s. After buying the business from Matthew Macklin, she was at pains to point out that Kinahan and MTK had “cut ties”. Except it’s not as simple as that. Step into the picture Tyson Fury. Fury had been in a bad place. After winning the world heavyweight title in 2015, he spent most of the following year in a tumult of drugs, drink and depression. He had to relinquish his titles, and his weight ballooned. But in 2017, he began a remarkable comeback - in Marbella, at MTK.  He slowly regained his fitness and his health. Daniel Kinahan was close by. Matt Christie, who edits British publication Boxing News, has kept a keen eye on Fury’s journey. “I think what is generally known, or generally accepted, is that Daniel Kinahan played a massive part in getting Tyson Fury out of the darkness, and offering him a route back to the sport of boxing.” We haven’t been told on what precise date Daniel Kinahan became Tyson Fury’s official “adviser”, but in November 2017, on Kinahan’s advice, Fury signed up with MTK. The Dubliner may not have had any formal connection with MTK but he was advising Tyson Fury and many other MTK boxers. He was even advising Vaughan, as she later confirmed. Daniel Kinahan and the company he founded were joined at the hip, if not on the dotted line. When he moved to Dubai, MTK Global followed – setting up its headquarters there in 2018.  Its stock was rising in world boxing. More and more fighters were joining up. Talent like Belfast’s Carl Frampton. In hushed and sometimes almost furtive conversations, managers and trainers across Britain and Ireland have complained bitterly to us about MTK’s increasing power in the game. Some had lost fighters to MTK. But only one was prepared to speak publicly. Barry McGuigan once strode across the boxing world as one of the most popular and talented fighters on the planet. When he retired, he became a boxing manager. He has now lost five boxers to MTK’s pulling power. “Me and my boys had invested 18 years of our lives in those five fighters that left,” he tells me. I put to him that his complaints could be dismissed as sour grapes. “That's a fair comment. But put yourself in my position. You invest financially in these kids. You take them on and then out of the blue they're unhappy and they're gone.” The fact is that MTK and Kinahan were hurtling to the very top of boxing. Helped in large part by the remarkable rejuvenation of Tyson Fury, who was winning over America with astonishing performances. And in March 2019, a crucial link up was made with Bob Arum, just about the most influential  player in US boxing. The big television money followed. A five-fight deal worth $100m capped them all. Bob Arum and Daniel Kinahan Officially, Kinahan had nothing to do with these deals. Remember MTK had cut its ties with him. There was no word about him even when Fury secured the world title again this time last year. But MTK was no longer a start-up. With more than 200 boxers on its books it was the biggest boxing management in Europe, maybe the world It looked set to be centrally involved in what many people are calling the biggest fight in British boxing history - Fury against Joshua. This was the moment, in the late spring and early summer of 2020 when it appears Daniel Kinahan decided to claim his place in the boxing limelight. Tyson Fury then did his act of acclimation, praising him for setting up the big fight. In the media swirl came interviews with promoters Eddie Hearn and Bob Arum. Arum gushed about Daniel Kinahan, calling him his “captain”. “I am not naive about Daniel and his past. As long as I understand that dealing in this area,  sport, they are honourable, they are smart and are not doing anything that is anyway devious or wrong, why wouldn't I deal with him? “ Hearn said: “He is the guy leading this Tyson Fury ship. Everyone knows, particularly in boxing, that he represents a number of high profile boxers, [and] has represented Tyson Fury for a number of years.” Hearn has worked with Kinahan for years. His company told Panorama he has no influence over the people boxers choose to have within their management team. MTK boss Sandra Vaughan, who had told the world that MTK had no ties with Kinahan, clarified the relationship with the alleged gangster. “I will always go to Daniel for advice,” she trumpeted. “Does he personally advise other high-profile people? Bob Arum?  He speaks to Frank [Warren]. He speaks to Eddie. “If anybody in the boxing world is doing any type of business in boxing and doesn’t speak to Daniel, or speak to someone that speaks to Daniel, they are telling lies”. Pat Leahy, now retired but who had previously had to police the fallout of the Regency shooting, puts it this way: “I think he was trying to launder his name. He was laundering his reputation.” If Kinahan had hoped his re-entry from the shade of boxing’s backrooms would herald a permanent place in the limelight, he had called it wrong. Questions were asked about him at Westminster and in the Irish parliament. It was announced he would no longer negotiate fights for Tyson Fury. Then MTK said he was stepping away from boxing. As Kinahan slipped back into the shadows, MTK maintained its growth. In recent months, it has started to sign up a host of American talent. American sports lawyer and former boxing manager Kurt Emhoff had also noted MTK’s growth: “They have a tonne of fighters, and now they're signing even more fighters but, where's the money coming from to finance this?” Barry McGuigan has the same question: “It takes millions and millions of dollars to do what MTK have done. Where is the money coming from to allow MTK to grow at such a ferocious rate?” Like other private companies, little information is available about its finances, but in the US courts, a boxing manager has accused MTK of using Daniel Kinahan’s drug money to buy up talent. The court filing in California alleges it is simply a front for the Kinahan drug cartel: “MTK receives funds directly or indirectly from Mr Kinahan, which are derived from racketeering activities such as drug trafficking and money laundering.” MTK says the lawsuit will be most vigorously challenged. The allegation of money laundering was in my mind eight weeks ago when I drove from New York to semi-rural Connecticut see a man called Bob Yalen. The American was appointed as the new chief executive of MTK over the summer. It was he who announced that Kinahan had left boxing. I knocked on his front door. No recording devices. No camera. I hoped this approach might encourage him to talk because he hadn’t responded to a letter we sent him in Dubai months earlier. There followed an extraordinary conversation. I had expected him to tell me to leave. But no, Yalen, dressed in casual house garb, talked with me on his doorstep for about 15 minutes. The biggest reveal – that Daniel Kinahan was still in boxing, and still very much associated with  MTK despite all public claims to the contrary. Yalen said he was in regular contact with Daniel Kinahan, as business required it. He revealed that Kinahan was still advising MTK boxers but couldn’t say if that included Tyson Fury. We asked Tyson Fury whether he’s still being advised by Daniel Kinahan - but he didn’t respond. When I pressed Yalen about where the money was coming from to fund the expansion of the company, he said that ""a big pot"" had been developed over the years. I asked him if that pot came from Daniel Kinahan's drug cartel dealings. He said, “No”. He said that Kinahan had been the “driving force” in MTK when Yalen first joined the company in 2018 but now Kinahan had “no involvement in the business officially”. Daniel Kinahan’s lawyers told the BBC he has “no criminal record or convictions”. They say the “wild allegations” about him being a crime boss “are false and have no evidential basis whatsoever”. He’s an independent adviser in boxing and has “exited the business of MTK”. MTK’s solicitors told us it has a “perfectly sustainable business” and has grown by “offering excellent managerial services….at a very competitive price.” They said “Mr Kinahan has never owned or controlled our client company”. He’s never provided funding “nor has been a director, shareholder, officer, employee or consultant”. They said, “It’s true Mr Kinahan does provide personal advice to a number of boxers managed by MTK Global”, as well as fighters at other companies. I wanted to know why Yalen had chosen to join MTK at all, when allegations about Kinahan were well known. “I asked the fighters and they spoke well of him,” he told me. “I’ve never seen anything to concern me.” It had been an astonishing meeting. In our terms, journalistically decisive. We now knew that Daniel Kinahan, the alleged head of a cartel which is suspected of involvement in murder, drugs and weapons trafficking and money laundering, is still at the heart of the boxing business. Maybe not at the top table, but you’d bet he’s in the room next door.

"'Nonsense' to keep slavery statues, says TV historian","TV historian David Olusoga claims it is ""palpable nonsense"" to say that removing controversial statues ""somehow impoverishes history"". Prof Olusoga says statues, such as those of slave traders, are not useful ways of teaching history or explaining the values of previous eras. Instead the historian argues they are a continuing public ""validation"" of people who did ""terrible things"". Prof Olusoga is to be an online school teacher himself this week. Pupils in the lockdown will be able to watch Prof Olusoga explaining the importance of the census to historians - ahead of the national census in March - and looking at how it can reveal changes of populations and hidden stories. The University of Manchester professor recently revealed one of his own hidden histories - that he had been at primary school in Gateshead with Paul Gascoigne and the former footballer had rescued Prof Olusoga and his sister from racist bullying. Barack Obama speaks to David Olusoga Marcus Rashford faces racism on social media Edward Colston statue pushed into harbour Statues get protection from 'baying mobs' The TV presenter, who had been born in Nigeria but moved to a council estate in north- east England, says the prejudice he faced in school was part of the ""Darwinian world of the 1970s playground"". Marcus Rashford faces the social media version of the prejudice of 1970s playgrounds, says the historian But the historian still sees its continuation in the abuse aimed atblack footballers such as Marcus Rashford. ""Racism in football just found a new outlet in the world of social media. If you look under that rock, it's there all the time. ""Marcus, because he so high profile and because we love to attack people who are doing good in this country, for reasons I've never quite understood, is the focus at the moment. But it's constant, it's always there,"" says the historian and author. His lesson about the census, made with the Office for National Statistics, is about the ""lascars"", sailors recruited from Asia to work on British ships, who often faced tough conditions for lower pay than their white counterparts. They were at the centre of a trading empire that was ""incredibly complicated, diverse and also unfair"". He says studying the British empire, in its strengths and weaknesses, is ""absolutely critical"" to understanding present-day Britain - in terms of the ""economy, culture, cuisine, as well the people who are living here"". But when it comes to issues such as examining links with the slave trade, he says there is a reluctance and a push towards ""distraction and deflection"" and ""various ways of saying 'We don't want to talk about that'."" David Olusoga won a Bafta award for his programme Britain's Forgotten Slave Owners He argues that debates about statues - such as the statue to slave trader Edward Colston that was pushed into the harbour in Bristol - should face up to the historical evidence of who is being commemorated. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick recently promised more safeguards to monuments, saying they are ""almost always best explained and contextualised,not taken and hidden away"". ""What has stood for generations should be considered thoughtfully, not removed on a whim or at the behest of a baying mob,"" said Mr Jenrick. Prof Olusoga says there has been particular hostility to suggestions there were enslaved black people in 18th Century Britain, as well as in the colonies. This seems to make people deeply ""uncomfortable"", says the presenter of the A House Through Time TV series. ""I think that's because we've created a moral firewall between what happened in Britain and what happened in the empire - with the idea that what happened in the empire doesn't really count."" Prof Olusoga also has concerns for future historians - and digital gaps in the historical record. He says the way politicians and decision-makers use messaging services like WhatsApp to share their private thoughts could leave future historians with much less understanding about how policies are being made. Historians should be ""enormously worried"" about ""politicians finding ways of not leaving records of their decisions in their debates"", says Prof Olusoga. ""That's fundamental to the workings of democracy."" He says written memos, notes, letters and emails have been ways into the thinking of politicians behind the scenes, that will not be available for an era of private, unrecorded messages. ""One of the most interesting things, if you study Churchill, is his notes in the margin,"" he says. ""I think politicians need to leave a record of their deliberations and their debates that lead them to the decisions they made - so they can be held accountable by historians."" Prof Olusoga's video lesson, Equality, representation and the census, part of the Census 2021 Let's Count primary school programme, will be on the Census 2021 YouTube channel, 11:00, 4 February.

"Buy now, pay later faces crackdown amid debt fearsThe financial regulator says it would be easy for customers to build up unseen debts of Â£1,000.BusinessComments","Fears over young shoppers' debts mean buy now, pay later firms such as Klarna will face more scrutiny by regulators. These services, offered through major retailers, allow people to split payments without paying interest and are used by millions of shoppers. But the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would be easy to build-up unseen debts of Â£1,000. Now it will regulate the sector, after the value of these services saw a near fourfold rise last year. Buy now, pay later services were used by five million people in the UK for total sales of Â£2.7bn in the last year. However, one in 10 people using them already had debt arrears elsewhere, a wide-ranging FCA review into credit services found. Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""By stepping in and regulating, we're making sure people are treated fairly and only offered agreements they can afford - the same protections you'd expect with other loans."" Chris Woolard, who ledthe FCA review recommending regulation,external, said that although buy now, pay later was convenient for some people, for others it was ""a really easy way to fall into problem debt"". This debt would not be seen by credit reference agencies and other lenders. Buy now, pay later 'growing fast' amid debt fears 'I got a Â£30 Klarna bill - but I've never used it' Under the new plans, providers would need to undertake affordability checks before lending and ensure customers were treated fairly, particularly those who are vulnerable or struggling with repayments. The government said it would legislate as soon as possible, following consultation. Alex Marsh, the UK head of Swedish company Klarna, accepted that ""now is the time for regulation"". He said the company worked with those who fell into debt, but ultimately missed payments could be forwarded to debt collectors. These firms allow people to choose - at an online or physical checkout - to pay for items in instalments or, in some cases, defer payments for up to 30 days. Large operators include Klarna, Clearpay, and LayBuy. They have proved popular with younger shoppers - particular by offering a cheaper way to try before buying or returning. Use of these services rose fast over the course of the pandemic. Estimates suggest Â£4 in every Â£100 currently spent in the UK uses buy now, pay later. Klarna's marketing campaigns featuring rapper and investor Snoop Dogg have centred on how ""smooth"" it makes the payment process Debt charities and campaigners have argued advertising via social media, often through influencers, has glamorised debt. They also suggest the services can make it too easy to fall into debt, and - while total debts are not huge - there are risks of unaffordable borrowing. These companies do not charge interest - instead charging a fee to the retailer and some charge late payment fees to consumers - and they argue they are more payment providers than credit firms. They have not fallen under the same level of regulation as other credit providers, such as credit card or loan companies who require FCA approval to lend and must conduct affordability checks. At present, anyone who has a complaint regarding a financial problem with a buy now, pay later firm is unable to take their case to the financial ombudsman for an independent adjudication. This should now change. Alice Tapper, who campaigned via social media for a change to the rules, said: ""It was the hundreds of people who shared their story with the campaign who made it painfully clear that the absence of regulation is at the expense of consumers, particularly those who are young and vulnerable."" But Gary Rohloff, managing director and co-founder of Laybuy, which has 400,000 UK users, said: ""We believe we are already in a good place when it comes to regulation. ""There needs to be a balance to protect consumers, but also make sure it retains the innovation and simplicity âthat consumers value."" Sophie Edwards is a follower of fashion, but it is a dedication that left her in debt. She spent thousands of pounds on clothes, using buy now, pay later services, but then found herself ""in a sticky situation"" when she was made redundant. ""I was using it for retail therapy, to make myself feel better,"" she said. ""It did not feel like real money. ""You can just go shopping on a Monday, a Tuesday and a Wednesday.""

NI police in talks over Brexit port 'threats',"The EU has condemned ""threats"" against staff making Brexit-related checks at Northern Ireland's ports, and told EU officials working in Northern Ireland not to attend their duties. On Monday,Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew staff from Brexit inspection duties over security fears. All parties have condemned the threats. A senior police officer said there was no evidence any of the main loyalist paramilitary groups were involved in the incidents. NI police have increased patrols and offered advice on shift patterns. They held talks with council staff after Brexit-related checks at NI ports were suspended amid security concerns. An industry source told BBC News NI lorries arriving on the boats into Belfast and Larne received a waiver on Tuesday and were directed straight out of the ports. After the local authority decided to withdraw its staff, Stormont announced it was suspending physical inspections of food consignments - particularly meat, fish and dairy products - at Larne and Belfast. Checks are being carried out on some goods arriving from the rest of the UK, as part of what unionists view as an economic border with Britain. Unionist politicians strongly oppose the part of the Brexit deal known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, which has led to the new controls. Signage has appeared at the Daera operation in Belfast Graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in recent days, referring to employees as ""targets"". Staff reported suspicious activity - including apparent attempts to gather personal information, such as vehicle number plates. Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan told the BBC there was no evidence to corroborate an anonymous claim that any of the main loyalist paramilitary groups were behind this. Mr Ewan said that ""individuals or small groups of people"" were involved in incidents of graffiti or intimidation. He said there was no evidence that car registrations of staff were being gathered, adding that there was nothing to suggest an attack on anyone was imminent. This video can not be played ACC Mark McEwan said there has been an increase in community tension over the NI protocol. What are the main loyalist paramilitary groups? The posts are run by Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera), led by official vets. Daera stopping the physical checks is a significant move as it means the posts are not operating as they are supposed to. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has 12 environmental health officers, and several senior officials, working at Larne harbour. The gates were closed at the Daera site at Duncrue Street on Tuesday A number of lorries were redirected away from a border control post near Belfast's Docks according  BBC News NI's Michael Fitzpatrick at the scene earlier on Tuesday. The vehicles were stopped on the main road outside the Daera site on Duncrue Street by Border Force officers on Tuesday morning and redirected elsewhere. No activity was taking place within the facility and the main gate into the site remained closed. Border Control Posts (BCPs) were built at Larne harbour, and two other facilities in Northern Ireland,as a consequence of Brexit. They are facilities for inspecting food and live animals when they arrive from other parts of the UK. Things remained quiet at this site in Larne on Tuesday At the end of the Brexit transition on 1 January, Northern Ireland remained in the single market for goods. The rest of the UK did not, so some products entering Northern Ireland from GB must be checked on entry. The EU has particularly strict rules on food and animals, requiring all those products to enter through a BCP. On Friday, unionist parties accused the EU of hypocrisy after it sought to trigger a Brexit safeguard to control the export of coronavirus vaccines into NI. The protocol, which is part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, is designed to allow the free movement of goods from the EU into NI, and prevent the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland. Unionist parties are opposed to it because they argue it poses a risk to the stability of the union by placing a border down the Irish Sea. They have also cited difficulties for trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, arguing the protocol will damage the local economy. Article 16 is essentially a safeguard that would allow the UK or EU to act unilaterally if measures imposed as a result of the protocol are deemed to be causing ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". Food products such as meat, milk and fish now need to be certified by vetswhen moving from GB to NI. This certification is being phased in for retailers but already applies in full for food service and catering firms. When the certificates are issued the lorry trailer is supposed to be sealed. The developments at Larne are being seen within the context of what the PSNI stated publicly last week - there are signs of growing tensions created by the Brexit protocol within some sections of the community. The PSNI had discussions about the safety of port staff. There is nothing at this stage which points to a loyalist paramilitary grouping being behind what is going on. The mood within loyalism is said to be one of discontent, but sources are not suggesting the direction of travel is protests, civil disobedience or violent acts. One source said the focus must be on a concerted unionist push politically against the Irish Sea border. There has been political unity in condemnation of the threats. Stormont's new Agriculture Minister Gordon Lyons of the DUP said there was ""no justification"" for the threats. Speaking in the assembly, Mr Lyons said his department was planning to receive a further risk assessment from the PSNI. He said he could not provide assembly members with a timeline as to when he expected to receive the report. He said: ""This is a time for calm heads, there's a huge degree of anger and we should all be aware of that. ""But that's no excuse for the threats and intimidation we have seen. What we have now are the real consequences of the protocol being felt."" The DUP has saidit intends to send a ""strong signal"" to the Irish government by stopping north-south activitiesrelated to the NI Protocol. It has drafted a five-point plan it says is needed to address the ""growing crisis"" over the Irish Sea border. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin condemned the ""intimidatory tactics"". ""It's a very sinister and ugly development and, obviously, we will be doing everything we possibly can to assist and defuse the situation,"" he said. Sinn FÃ©in MLA Gerry Kelly called on police to make arrests, if the evidence was there. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UUP leader Steve Aiken said the threats ""are completely unacceptable"" and added that the ""growing anger over the Irish Sea Border and the impact on our economy, businesses and society must be recognised"" by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU Commission. Justice Minister Naomi Long tweeted that ""those responsible for this need to be taken off the streets"". ""Those whipping up tension need to dial down the rhetoric,"" the Alliance Party leader added. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said there needs to be more political leadership shown by unionists to ""tone down"" tensions. He said that the first priority is to establish if workers are safe to return to their jobs through discussions with the PSNI and trade unions. ""If we can establish that they are safe then I think there will be no choice but to get back to work."" Checks are being carried out on some goods arriving from the rest of the UK Mayor of Larne Peter Johnston, of the DUP, said tensions had been building for some time. ""Sadly, these threats and this behaviour is not just an overnight thing,"" he told Radio Foyle. ""We won't be putting our staff back into that position until the risk assessment comes back to say that it's safe to do so."" The European Commission's spokesperson said the EU ""condemned very strongly any threat of violence"". ""We understand decisions taken by the NI authorities to temporarily suspend a certain number of checks for the transfer of goods, it is obvious for us the first and utmost priority is the safety of people,"" said Eric Mamer. EU and UK government officials will hold a virtual meeting with Stormont's first and deputy first ministers on Wednesday. PSNI officials held talks with Mid and East Antrim council and Daera officials to discuss the threats, which ACC McEwan described as ""constructive"". The council has said it will carry out a full risk assessment with the PSNI, Food Standards Agency and Daera. Victor Chestnutt, the President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said he was concerned that the supply of food may be affected by the suspension of checks. He told BBC News NI: ""Some of our food companies bring in ingredients from the UK mainland. If they needed checks and those checks are not done, is that going to be held at the port or is that going to be released? ""Trade needs to flow and flow freely. If we see more delays, it will add more cost and more problems."" Gove calls for extension of Brexit grace periods What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Female athletes 'harassed' while training outdoors,"This video can not be played Two people can now exercise outside together, after women raised safety concerns A number of female Welsh sprinters have been verbally abused by strangers as they train in public. They would normally be able to train at athletics tracks but those venues have been closed because of coronavirus restrictions. Former Wales 400m champion Rhiannon Linington-Payne said the behaviour was ""potential harassment"" and not banter. Welsh Athletics said it had started working with South Wales Police to tackle intimidating behaviour. Linington-Payne, 29, from Cardiff, said the language shouted was often offensive or derogatory towards women. ""I've had inappropriate comments about my figure, wolf-whistling, cars slowing down to stare... I've even had a beer can thrown at me,"" she said. ""The more it happens, the more it wears away at you"". Welsh athletes 'disadvantaged' by lockdown Athletics faces âhuge challengeâ to return Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Currently only individuals classified as elite athletes by Sport Wales and part of the Commonwealth Games programme can travel to and train at designated facilities. It means many athletes who represent Wales at a high level have been left training at home, alongside roads or in parks. ""It's actually quite ironic... I'm not allowed on the track for safety reasons, but I don't feel safe where I'm training now,"" added Great Britain and Wales sprinter Hannah Brier. Hannah Brier says she has been left feeling intimidated while out running alone The 22-year-old, from Neath, who competes in the 100m and 200m sprints trains six days a week, doing weights in her parents' kitchen or running reps alongside flat stretches of road. The masters student said one incident in the summer left her feeling ""intimidated"" as a man repeatedly drove past her, shouting and staring. Miss Brier was so concerned about her safety that she eventually called her dad to pick her up. The incident has left her choosing plainer and looser items of clothing to avoid attention. ""I find myself now going through my wardrobe and picking outfits that I think are not as flashy, not as revealing... I'm not going to get noticed if I wear all black,"" she added Last week the Welsh Government eased lockdown restrictions to allow an individual to meet one other person from another household to exercise in their local area. Lauren Williams says she has only started feeling unsafe recently First Minister Mark Drakeford said the decision was ""partly"" because they had heard from women that ""in the dark, cold and wet of January they don't feel safe going out to exercise alone"". A survey by England Athletics in 2017 found a third of female runners said they had been harassed while out running. More than 60% of the 2,000 women questioned said they felt anxious running alone, with personal safety their main concern. Lauren Williams, a 400m hurdler from Llanidloes, Powys, has had similar ""unnerving"" experiences while training in public spaces. ""Never before have I felt unsafe training but recently, I really have,"" she said. The 21-year-old said she had received comments on her clothes being ""too tight"", or her outfits being too revealing. ""I'm not going out to run to look good, I'm going to perform so it shouldn't matter,"" she added. The management student at Bath University added she does not have a choice other than to train to make next year's Commonwealth Games in Birmingham but she is worried this behaviour might put other women off exercising outdoors. ""It manifests itself everywhere even in a local park, the message has got to be it is not ok, the behaviour shouldn't be condoned,"" she said. Fellow athlete Linington-Payne agrees and has called for wider cultural change to stop this sort of behaviour. ""It goes deeper than sport,"" she said. ""It's just respect for other human beings and I'm shocked that there are people out there who still think it's appropriate to speak to someone like that."" In a statement, Welsh Athletics chief executive James Williams said the body's values promotes ""respect, togetherness and fun"" and everyone should be able ""to enjoy the sport in a safe and inclusive way"". The organisation has recently started working with South Wales Police to tackle intimidating behaviour and derogatory comments.

Scotland 'needs to go faster' on vaccinations,"Scotland has vaccinated a lower percentage of its adult population than any other UK nation Almost 35,000 people received their first dose of the Covid vaccine on Monday, the highest daily figure since the programme began. It marked the first day in which mass vaccination centres were open in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow. The jump in figures came after concerns that just 9,628 people had the jab in Scotland on Sunday. Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, told BBC Scotland ""we do need to be doing it faster"". He said Sundays had been ""a bit tricky"" for the vaccine programme because many GP surgeries were closed. The figure was the lowest since the Scottish government started publishing daily vaccine statistics. Will Scotland have enough time to meet jabs target? FM to announce outcome of Covid lockdown review When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Scottish Secretary Alister Jack later wrote to the first minister on behalf of the UK government to offer ""any support or assistance we can give you to accelerate your rollout programme"". Mr Jack said this included further requests for military assistance and mutual aid between health services. His letter concluded: ""I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as closely as possible."" Scotland, which has about a twelfth of the UK population, has now vaccinated just over 610,000 people while the UK tally stands at about 9.6 million. Scotland has vaccinated the lowest percentage of its population aged 16 and over - 13.45% - of all of the four UK nations. The equivalent figure for England was 18.39%, Wales was 16.98% and Northern Ireland was 15.59%. In order to be equal to its population share, Scotland should have vaccinated another 200,000 people. In her Covid statement at Holyrood, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland had initially concentrated on making sure there was a depth of uptake in the clinically most vulnerable groups such as elderly care home residents. She said the challenge now was to increase the breadth of the overall numbers. In response, Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives at Holyrood, said the Scottish government's vaccination programme was ""slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK"". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Scotland needed to be ""ambitious"" with its vaccination programme and said there was no need to ditch the rest of the rollout while care homes and other vulnerable groups were prioritised. Ms Sturgeon said ""legitimate questions"" were being asked about the slow rollout but she stood by the approach that was taken. The Scottish government insists that it remains on track to meet its target of having vaccinated everyone over the age of 70 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable by 15 February. But many people aged over 70 have not yet received an appointment letter, with 21% of those aged between 75 and 79 having been vaccinated by Tuesday. Scotland now needs to be vaccinating about 40,000 people per day to meet the target - with Tuesday's total of 34,881 being the highest it has managed in a single day so far. Opposition parties have accused First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of being ""in denial"" about the pace of the vaccine rollout in Scotland. Prof Leitch said the plan had been for most over-80s to be vaccinated in their local GP surgery so they would not have to travel greater distances and where they would know the staff. He acknowledged that many GP surgeries did not open on Sundays, and that ""some people think this was not the right thing to do"". He said the vaccination teams had been ""asked to have another look at that"". Prof Leitch told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""We agree we do need to be doing it faster. ""That is why now, as we have gone down a level to people who are a little bit more mobile - the 70 years olds, the over-75s - they are now being done in big vaccination centres or semi-big vaccination centres."" He also predicted that the opening of the new mass vaccination centres in Edinburgh and Aberdeen earlier this week, alongside the existing facility in Glasgow, meant that ""many, many more"" people would be vaccinated this weekend. The latest figures show 83% of people over the age of 80 have now had their first jab, although the first minister said the figure was likely to be closer to 90% as there were fewer people in the age group than they had thought and the figures are being ""refined"". The daily figures show 98% of older care home residents and 88% of care home staff have been given their first dose. The Scottish government says the opening of two new mass vaccination centres this week will allow it to hit its targets Prof Leitch said: ""We'll finish the over-80s this week, apart from a few stragglers who are maybe a bit doubtful or don't want done or were Covid positive. ""So not 100% but we'll get to just as many as we can by this Friday, and we've started the 70 to 79 year olds and we're beginning to send letters out to those who are over 65 and those who are vulnerable."" He admitted that it was ""hard"" for people in Scotland to hear that vaccination numbers were higher in England, but insisted that it was ""not a race"" - and pointed out that the death rate and prevalence of the virus in Scotland was still lower than in England. Prof Leitch added: ""It is a race against the virus, not a race against my colleagues and I want England to be vaccinated as fast as they can possibly do it and I also want Wales and Northern Ireland to be vaccinated.

Thanks over dying Covid couple 'overwhelms' nurse,"Scott Summerfield said letting the couple be together was ""the least we could do for them"" A dying Covid patient told medics he was ""in heaven"" when they rearranged a hospital ward so he could hold the hand of his wife who also had the virus. Nurse Scott Summerfield says he has been ""overwhelmed"" by public support after his tweet last week about the elderly couple's ""last few hours"". The unnamed pair, whom Mr Summerfield said had been together 67 years, have since died, he confirmed. They were cared for at Royal Stoke Hospital. The ""beautiful story"" of how they stayed together to the end has been shared on Twitter more than 19,000 times, receiving more than 220,000 likes. Mr Summerfield said: ""It is just a great example of the care we are giving to our patients and to share that with the world, really there is no better message.

Mr Summerfield, who works on elderly care Covid wards, said the couple had been in hospital for a few days when they began to deteriorate. ""We sort of decided there and then that we needed to get them together, it was the least we could do for them,"" he said.

"Scrap interest on student loans, say uni bosses","The government has announced a Â£50m package to support students The interest on student loans in England should be scrapped for 15 months, a group of universities says. The vice-chancellors of seven universities say this would cover the period from the first national lockdown until summer 2021. They say waiving the charge would ease the pressure on graduates. But the government said such a move would not help students in need amid the coronavirus pandemic as it announced a boost to hardship funding. Universities minister Michelle Donelan said the vice-chancellors' proposal wouldn't put cash into students' pockets to support them during the pandemic. She told BBC Breakfast that ""at least half of students don't actually pay back their student loan"", adding that the government's priority was helping ""those students most in need"". The government has announced an extra Â£50m for student hardship funds in England, on top of Â£20m agreed in December. No uni for poor white teens in 'left behind towns' Students plea to end 'unfair' rental contracts Covid tests at university find few positive cases In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the vice-chancellors say students are paying a heavy price in the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The opportunity and wealth gap between the young and old is already unacceptably large - and existing challenges are being amplified by the impact of the pandemic on students and their life chances,"" the letter says. It says the pandemic has placed ""unprecedented pressures on our students"", with demands for hardship funds increasing by over 100% in some universities. The letter is signed by seven vice-chancellors: Prof Anthony Forster from the University of Essex Prof Frances Corner from Goldsmiths, University of London Prof Karen Cox from the University of Kent Prof Paul Layzell from Royal Holloway, University of London Prof David Richardson from the University of East Anglia Prof Adam Tickell from the University of Sussex Prof Robert Van de Noort from the University of Reading They call for a reduction equivalent to waiving the interest rate on student loans for the 15 months from the first national lockdown in March 2020 to the end of this academic year. In England students are currently charged 5.6% on their student loans while they are studying,  based on the retail price index, plus 3% - this applies until the 5 April after they graduate and then varies depending on earnings. The letter comes as the government says students facing financial pressures due to the pandemic will have access to an additional Â£50m support fund. Ms Donelan said: ""We know that the pandemic, and the implications of the pandemic, has put extra pressure on students' finances."" Universities will be able to use the extra funding to help students facing loss of employment, additional costs for alternative accommodation or to support access to remote teaching amid Covid-19. The majority of university students in England have been told not to return to campus under the latest lockdown, sparking calls for rent rebates for term-time accommodation, and for tuition fee refunds. In December, the government announced a one-off fund of up to Â£20m to help students most in need of support in exceptional circumstances - this further Â£50m takes the total to Â£70m for this financial year. The funding will be distributed by the Office for Students (OfS) directly to universities, which will prioritise the students most in need. Many students have been calling for rent and tuition fee rebates Last week, a survey from the Office for National Statistics suggested that a growing proportion of university students were not happy with their academic experience - and nearly two in three had seen their mental health worsen. The University and College Union general secretary, Jo Grady, described the funding as a ""sticking plaster"". ""The government needs to go further and provide proper funding to avoid irreparable long-term damage to the sector's reputation,"" she said. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said the additional funding was a ""positive step"", but added: ""As the serious mental health impact of the pandemic continues to be felt, universities need further funding to alleviate the substantial increases in demand that university wellbeing and support services are experiencing."" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, said the funding was welcome. ""We intend to distribute it as swiftly as possible to benefit those who are most in need,"" she said. The independent consultancy London Economics (LE)  looked just at first year undergraduates, from England,  studying across the UK. The cost of writing off their interest, for that one cohort, for this academic year is estimated at roughly Â£33m, or a 0.3% increase in the cost to the government of funding this cohort. Maike Halterbeck, associate director at LE and a specialist in higher education fees and funding, said not much would be gained for students. ""In spite of its apparent attractiveness, this proposal wouldn't provide any benefit to the average graduate. ""Only the highest earning - predominantly male - graduates would derive a small benefit of a few hundred pounds. It would not affect female graduates, or lower earning male graduates"" LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Lesson support available on BBC Bitesize for every child, of every age, every day of the week BITESIZE DAILY ON BBC IPLAYER:Help is at hand for your homeschooling needs Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Brexit port checks suspended amid safety concerns,"The first lorries to cross the sea border arrived in NI on January 4 Checks on animal and food products at Larne and Belfast ports have been suspended amid concerns for staff safety. The Department of Agriculture said this was pending talks with the PSNI. This comes after Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew staff from Brexit inspection duties at Larne Port over security concerns. Graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in recent days. The mayor of Larne, the DUP's Peter Johnston, said the council decision had been taken due to ""menacing behaviour"" referencing growing tensions over theNI Protocol. The BBC understands the PSNI is due to meet Mid and East Antrim council and officials from  Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) on Tuesday morning to  discuss the threats to workers at Larne and Belfast ports. The Northern Ireland Executive will also discuss the latest developments. Police said they have increased patrols at Larne port and other ""points of entry"". ""The safety of staff working at points of entry is of the utmost importance to us,"" the PSNI tweeted. ""Where we have credible information we will share that with our partners and take appropriate action."" The BBC has asked the EU for comment on the withdrawal of staff and security fears. In its statement the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said: ""On the basis of information received today and, pending further discussions with the PSNI, Daera has decided in the interests of the wellbeing of staff to temporarily suspend physical inspections of products of animal origin at Larne and Belfast. ""The situation will be kept under review and in the meantime full documentary checks will continue to be carried out as usual."" Checks on animals and food products containing meat, fish, dairy or eggs are among those affected. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he had taken the decision to withdraw staff from the ports following consultation with staff. Allow Twitter content?

First Minister Arlene Foster said she ""utterly condemned"" the threats. Speaking on UTV, she said: ""I think it is utterly reprehensible that anyone who is going to their place of work should be threatened in this way."" Mrs Foster said she was on the phone with UK minister Michael Gove when she was told of the council's decision. ""I was able to inform him of the development this evening,"" she said, adding that the way to deal with the NI Protocol was through ""constitutional politics"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Parties must 'work together' over NI Protocol row PSNI monitoring 'growing unionist Brexit discontent' Earlier on Monday evening, Larne mayor Peter Johnston told a council meeting that staff assisting with checks had raised concerns about ""suspicious activity"". ""We have no option but to withdraw them [staff] in order to fulfil our duty of care,"" said Mr Johnston. He added that he would write to Mr Poots, who holds responsibility over the issue, to make him aware of the decision. In a statement, the council said there had been an ""upsurge in sinister behaviour"" in recent weeks, including graffiti describing port staff as ""targets"", and what appeared to be attempts to gather workers' personal information, including vehicle registration plates. The council said it will carry out a full risk assessment with the PSNI, Food Standards Agency and Daera. Before council's decision on Monday, there were 12 environmental health officers working at Larne Port, as well as several senior council officers. Sinn FÃ©in's group party leader, councillor James McKeown, said staff would only return when it was safe. ""There are simmering tensions within the local community at present and we will not stand by and let our staff be targeted when they are just doing their jobs."" SDLP councillor Eugene Reid said leaders had fallen short: ""The language used and tone of the discussion relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol has raised tensions and whipped up fear. ""It should be the role of all leaders to extract the poison from public dialogue, and I'm challenging everyone to do that."" East Antrim Sammy Wilson said the NI Protocol has to go - ""but politics is the way"". He said staff safety was paramount. ""All threats must be condemned and cross party support for withdrawal is welcome. ""Those parties who talked up the threat of violence during the negotiations need to reflect. Border Control Posts (BCPs) were built at Larne harbour, and two other facilities in NI as a consequence of Brexit. They are facilities for inspecting food and live animals when they arrive from other parts of the UK. At the end of the Brexit transition on 1 January 2021, Northern Ireland remained in the single market for goods. The rest of the UK did not, so some products entering Northern Ireland from GB must be checked on entry. The EU has particularly strict rules on food and animals, requiring all those products to enter through a BCP. Victor Chestnutt, the President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said he was concerned that the supply of food may be affected by the suspension of checks. He told BBC News NI: ""Some of our food companies bring in ingredients from the UK mainland. If they needed checks and those checks are not done, is that going to be held at the port or is that going to be released? ""Trade needs to flow and flow freely. If we see more delays, it will add more cost and more problems.""

Fashion industry warns it faces threat to survival,"Twiggy helped put the UK industry on the global map More than 400 figures from the UK fashion industry have signed an open letter to the prime minister warning that post-Brexit red tape and travel restrictions threaten their survival. Signatories, including Twiggy and Katharine Hamnett, say some firms are already relocating to the EU. They say the sector is worth Â£35bn to the UK and employs one million people. ""Yet we have been disregarded in this deal and our concerns overlooked,"" the letter to Boris Johnson says. The letter, to be presented on Tuesday morning, calls for a meeting with ministers because ""without urgent attention these issues will jeopardise the immediate and long term future of the sector"". They said the trade agreement, finalised on Christmas Eve just a week before the UK left the bloc's single market and customs union, had failed to deliver on promises of frictionless future trade. The sector's concerns echo those of other sectors, from music to fisheries, who argue the new bureaucratic regime is endangering the future of their industries. London Fashion Week is one of the global industry's most important events But the letter says the fashion industry contributes ""more to UK GDP than fishing, music, film and motor industries combined"". It highlights the compensation package offered to the fishing industry, saying: ""Fishing contributes as much to the UK economy as East London does from the fashion and textile industry, employing the same workforce as just one of the many high street retailers currently facing liquidation"". Brexit: How did the first month go? Brexit difficult for my firm - Samantha Cameron 'Brexit port delays mean our seafood is rotting' Model Yasmin Le Bon said the nature of the industry meant people had to be able to travel freely within the EU, often at short notice. ""I have been working continually in this industry for the past 37 years. It works in a very particular way, with jobs being confirmed literally at the last minute. I may get a call, make a decision and be at the airport within two hours. ""For once we need to be listened to and for the Government to work with us before it is too late,"" she said. Katharine Hamnett has long complained about the tax system's impact on the industry Designer Katharine Hamnett said many firms could be weeks away from going under. ""We need a radical overhaul of customs arrangements including VAT on all goods shipped into the EU by the end of February, or British brands will die,"" she said. Isabel Ettedgui, the chief executive of Connolly, the fashion brand that sells Scottish cashmere and manufactures leather goods in Spain, said the trade rules were turning the industry into a Brexit trading post. ""The result could be the possible closure of a 185-year-old company that holds the Royal Warrant,"" she said. Last week Samantha Cameron, wife of former prime minister David - who called the 2016 Brexit referendum - said her fashion business wasfinding post-Brexit trading with the EU ""challenging and difficult"". A government spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with businesses in the fashion industry to ensure they get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe, and seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world's fastest growing markets."" ""We are aware that some businesses are facing challenges with specific aspects of our new trading relationship with the EU. To this end, we are operating export helplines, running webinars with policy experts and offering businesses support via our network of 300 international trade advisers. This is on top of the millions we have invested to expand the customs intermediaries sector."" Brexit difficult for my firm - Samantha Cameron Brexit: How did the first month go?

We're getting self-harming 10-year-olds in A&E,"A child's bandaged hand (stock image) The pandemic has had a deep impact on children, who are arriving in A&E in greater numbers and at younger ages after self-harming or taking overdoses, writes Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary. Children are a lost tribe in the pandemic. While they remain (for the most part) perplexingly immune to the health consequences of Covid-19, their lives and daily routines have been turned upside down. Fromsurveys and interviews carried out for the Born in Bradford study,external, we know that they are anxious, isolated and bored, and we see the tip of this iceberg of mental ill health in the hospital. Children in mental health crisis used to be brought to A&E about twice a week. Since the summer it's been more like once or twice a day. Some as young as 10 have cut themselves, taken overdoses, or tried to asphyxiate themselves. There was even one child aged eight. Lockdown ""massively exacerbates any pre-existing mental health issues - fears, anxieties, feelings of disconnection and isolation,"" says A&E consultant Dave Greenhorn. While Bradford has been in lockdown longer than some other parts of the country, there is no reason to believe this is a local problem. Dave says fellow A&E consultants he's spoken to in Scotland, Portsmouth and Northern Ireland all report a significant increase in mental health attendances - among all age groups, children as well as adults. The devastating toll of the pandemic on children BBC Teach: Children's Mental Health Week Own It: Look after your child's mental health in lockdown Self-harming ""used to be the mind-set of older teenagers but we are seeing much younger children doing this now"" says Ruth Tolley, a matron on the paediatric ward where children are taken if it is not safe for them to return home. It may then take the combined efforts of several nurses to prevent further self-harm on the ward. Eating disorders are also on the rise, says paediatrician Helen Jepp. So are overdoses - where children take their parents' medication, or their own - and cases where children rush out of the house and behave recklessly or dangerously on the street. A child psychiatrist who works with Bradford's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) says the caseload fell at the start of the pandemic then returned to normal levels. For him what's new is not the quantity but the severity of the work. ""We have been seeing more intense distress,"" he says. ""Young people are in a worse state than usual."" Consultant Dave Greenhorn describes a recent evening in A&E. It's a busy one - there are 94 people in the department, including a pale-looking teenage boy, lying quietly in a cubicle. Dave asks if he's OK, but there is no answer and no eye contact. The notes show that the boy has attended the Emergency Department every other day for two weeks. Before now he has taken small overdoses and told staff he wants to die. He has a child and adolescent psychiatrist and support worker but there is no firm diagnosis of mental illness. One of the problems is that lockdown has prevented everyone from accessing their own safety valves. The boy has previously mentioned that he misses going out with his friends. Now he's stuck at home, and so are other members of his family. Unable to get away for a few hours peace, the mum says she's at the end of her tether and can't deal with her son at home on this particular night. Dave's attempts to coax the boy to talk to him are unsuccessful, so he makes sure the youngster has some juice and a sandwich and asks the nurses to keep trying to get him to engage when they have a minute - though they rarely do. On previous admissions to the paediatric ward the boy has been hard to look after, so it's been agreed he shouldn't be sent there, but he doesn't want to go to an adult ward. In the end he spends the night in A&E. The pandemic has underlined for all to see just how important school is for children. Education is only part of it. There is also the social life, and children benefit from routine, boundaries and adult authority figures outside the home. Teachers are also experts at spotting problems such as anxiety and self-harm that has taken place at home. A lot of referrals would normally arise in this way. For older children, school is the framework that will enable them to reach university or employment, and some struggle when it appears to give way. Seema [not her real name] attempted suicide and started self-harming when exams were cancelled last summer. ""We tried very hard for our exams - you're taught that your entire future revolves around these exams, but that crumbles right in front of you and it's really shocking. It has a huge impact,"" she says. ""I felt like stabbing myselfâ¦ I was in a constant state of anxiety."" Now 17, she is doing a lot better, though she still misses contact with teachers and friends, and would like schools to organise online groups for students to socialise, not just meet for lessons. Her family hasn't been able to understand her problem, but she has now been getting help. Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio. Listen to theCoronavirus Front Line, on the BBC World Service Or read the previous online diary entry:Karen caught Covid - and took it home Find all the diary entries on the BBC Radio 4 website One crucial beneficial change that has come out of this epidemic of mental ill-health is that professionals from all the different agencies in Bradford have come together to support the children in their time of crisis. Gone are the delays in referrals between different teams - the health service and social services are acting as one. ""Covid has brought services closer together,"" says paediatric ward matron Ruth Tolley. ""We needed an urgent meeting with the safeguarding team and various other agencies and we were able to pull that meeting together in two hours - getting people together and getting a plan, that is really positive."" Paediatrician Helen Jepps agrees. She got a call about a teenager one morning, logged on and saw that a number of teams were already discussing the case - social workers, Camhs and voluntary organisations. ""It feels a real privilege at the moment to have that close contact,"" she says. But this is little consolation for the damage that is being done to children's lives. The past 10 months of lockdown and school closures may have seemed unending for parents, but for a 10-year-old it will have felt like a lifetime. Their youth is being stolen from them.

"Buy now, pay later faces crackdown amid debt fearsThe financial regulator says it would be easy for customers to build up unseen debts of Â£1,000.","Fears over young shoppers' debts mean buy now, pay later firms such as Klarna will face more scrutiny by regulators. These services, offered through major retailers, allow people to split payments without paying interest and are used by millions of shoppers. But the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would be easy to build-up unseen debts of Â£1,000. Now it will regulate the sector, after the value of these services saw a near fourfold rise last year. Buy now, pay later services were used by five million people in the UK for total sales of Â£2.7bn in the last year. However, one in 10 people using them already had debt arrears elsewhere, a wide-ranging FCA review into credit services found. Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""By stepping in and regulating, we're making sure people are treated fairly and only offered agreements they can afford - the same protections you'd expect with other loans."" Chris Woolard, who ledthe FCA review recommending regulation,external, said that although buy now, pay later was convenient for some people, for others it was ""a really easy way to fall into problem debt"". This debt would not be seen by credit reference agencies and other lenders. Buy now, pay later 'growing fast' amid debt fears 'I got a Â£30 Klarna bill - but I've never used it' Under the new plans, providers would need to undertake affordability checks before lending and ensure customers were treated fairly, particularly those who are vulnerable or struggling with repayments. The government said it would legislate as soon as possible, following consultation. Alex Marsh, the UK head of Swedish company Klarna, accepted that ""now is the time for regulation"". He said the company worked with those who fell into debt, but ultimately missed payments could be forwarded to debt collectors. These firms allow people to choose - at an online or physical checkout - to pay for items in instalments or, in some cases, defer payments for up to 30 days. Large operators include Klarna, Clearpay, and LayBuy. They have proved popular with younger shoppers - particular by offering a cheaper way to try before buying or returning. Use of these services rose fast over the course of the pandemic. Estimates suggest Â£4 in every Â£100 currently spent in the UK uses buy now, pay later. Klarna's marketing campaigns featuring rapper and investor Snoop Dogg have centred on how ""smooth"" it makes the payment process Debt charities and campaigners have argued advertising via social media, often through influencers, has glamorised debt. They also suggest the services can make it too easy to fall into debt, and - while total debts are not huge - there are risks of unaffordable borrowing. These companies do not charge interest - instead charging a fee to the retailer and some charge late payment fees to consumers - and they argue they are more payment providers than credit firms. They have not fallen under the same level of regulation as other credit providers, such as credit card or loan companies who require FCA approval to lend and must conduct affordability checks. At present, anyone who has a complaint regarding a financial problem with a buy now, pay later firm is unable to take their case to the financial ombudsman for an independent adjudication. This should now change. Alice Tapper, who campaigned via social media for a change to the rules, said: ""It was the hundreds of people who shared their story with the campaign who made it painfully clear that the absence of regulation is at the expense of consumers, particularly those who are young and vulnerable."" But Gary Rohloff, managing director and co-founder of Laybuy, which has 400,000 UK users, said: ""We believe we are already in a good place when it comes to regulation. ""There needs to be a balance to protect consumers, but also make sure it retains the innovation and simplicity âthat consumers value.""

Calls for Suu Kyi release as Myanmar lawmakers held,"Aung San Suu Kyi is still in detention after the military coup Calls are growing for the release of Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi a day after the army seized power in the south-east Asian nation. Ms Suu Kyi, who led the country's elected government, has not been seen since she was detained by the military. MPs who were confined in their accommodation in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, have now been told they can leave. But there are signs of defiance, including a medical staff strike and pot-banging in the main city Yangon. The military took power in the early hours of Monday and declared a year-long state of emergency after accusing Ms Suu Kyi's party of fraud over its recent election win. All you need to know about the coup Her National League for Democracy (NLD) demanded her immediate release on Tuesday. It has also called upon the military to accept the results of the November election, which saw the NLD win more than 80% of the votes. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces until 2011, when a nominally civilian government was sworn in. The morning after the coup, the country remained calm. Streets were quiet, with troops patrolling all major cities and a night-time curfew in force. The communications systems which had been disrupted on Monday had returned by Tuesday morning, with phone and internet connections running again. Growing up under Myanmar's military rule Military coup likely to damage Myanmar's economy Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? But as night fell on Tuesday, car horns and the banging of cooking pots could be heard in the streets of Yangon in a sign of protest. A campaign of civil disobedience appeared to be gathering steam with doctors working in government hospitals saying they would stop work from Wednesday to push for Ms Suu Kyi's release. Some medics are resorting to wearing symbols in silent protest. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At least one doctor has quit in protest, saying ""such coups cannot be tolerated at all"". Dr Naing Htoo Aung, a 47-year-old anaesthesiologist at Mongywa Hospital in Sagaing Region, told BBC Burmese: ""I resigned because I couldn't work under a military dictator who did not care about the country and the people. This is the best response I can give to them."" A soldier standing guard outside a temple in Yangon One 25-year-old resident, who asked not to be named, told the BBC: ""Waking up to learn your world has been completely turned upside down overnight was not a new feeling, but a feeling that I thought that we had moved on from, and one that I never thought we'd be forced to feel again."" More than 100 MPs, who were blockaded in their accommodation by troops in the capital Nay Pyi Taw, have now been told they are free to leave, BBC Burmese has learned. Power has been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Eleven ministers and deputies, including those in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs, have been replaced. In the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing repeated that the takeover had been ""inevitable"" after the military made allegations of electoral fraud. By Nyein Chan Aye, BBC Burmese, Yangon This city of more than five million people is trying to get back to normal but has yet to digest the previous day's events. The streets are quieter than usual this morning and security forces are deployed at major points. Panic buying has stopped and telecommunications services are back. Private banks are resuming their services after temporarily closing down on Monday. Many people are withdrawing cash to brave the uncertain times ahead. In Nay Pyi Taw, troops with tanks and trucks still surround the country's parliament. It has been a bloodless coup so far, but the impact could be severe at a time of economic downturn amid the Covid pandemic. The political turmoil, with possible international sanctions and foreign investment now uncertain, has left people frustrated and angry. There have been no official statements on Ms Suu Kyi's exact whereabouts since she was detained in pre-dawn raids on Monday. But unnamed sources from within the NLD have said both she and President Win Myint were being held under house arrest. ""We were informed not to worry. However we are worrying. It would be a relief if we could see photos of them at home,"" the MP told news agency AFP, on condition of anonymity. Many of the other detained lawmakers are also still held in their government housing in the capital, with one member of the NLD describing it as ""an open-air detention centre"". Ms Suu Kyi - who spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010 - has urged her supporters to ""protest against the coup"" in a letter written before she was detained. It warned the military's actions would put the country back under a dictatorship. She was barred from becoming president because she has children born to a foreign national. But since the NLD's decisive election victory in 2015 she has been widely seen as de facto leader. How the military disrupted the internet Who is the general behind the coup? This video can not be played Myanmar coup: What's happened so far? Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in south-east Asia which shares borders with India, China and Thailand, among others. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011. Nearly all expressions of dissent were banned and accusations of severe human rights abuses led to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. Her party won again by a landslide in the 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more. US President Joe Biden has threatened to reinstate sanctions on Myanmar. He said the military should not ""overrule the will of the people,external"". Along with the US, the United Nations, the UK and the EU have also condemned the military takeover. The US had removed sanctions over the past decade as Myanmar progressed towards democracy. Sanctions could theoretically be imposed on large companies linked to the military that deal in gems, clothing and have banking interests. They may also target individual generals. Other options include cutting aid, but there are concerns this could unfairly affect the wider population. Protests against the coup have been held outside Myanmar's embassies around the world It is unclear though how much effect the US warnings will have. The coup leaders will have expected sanctions and factored those into their plans. Toe Zaw Latt, Myanmar bureau chief of the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), a non-profit news organisation based outside of Myanmar, told the BBC that the military will know sanctions are an unavoidable consequence of their actions, adding that ""they don't care about Western sanctions"" and are more concerned ""about how China, Japan, South Korea respond"". Who is pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi? What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis ""The country enjoys Chinese protection and South East Asian markets,"" Myanmar expert Elliott Prasse-Freeman of the National University of Singapore explains. ""Hence I expect them to react to sanctions with a shrug, the price paid for reasserting power and assuaging the humiliation of losing to their democratic enemies in two consecutive elections."" China, which has previously opposed international intervention in Myanmar, urged all sides in the country to ""resolve differences"". China's Xinhua news agency described the changes as a ""cabinet reshuffle"". Other countries in the region, including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, have said it is an ""internal matter"".

Fashion industry sends post-Brexit warning to PM,"Twiggy helped put the UK industry on the global map More than 400 figures from the UK fashion industry have signed an open letter to the prime minister warning that post-Brexit red tape and travel restrictions threaten their survival. Signatories, including Twiggy and Katharine Hamnett, say some firms are already relocating to the EU. They say the sector is worth Â£35bn to the UK and employs one million people. ""Yet we have been disregarded in this deal and our concerns overlooked,"" the letter to Boris Johnson says. The letter, to be presented on Tuesday morning, calls for a meeting with ministers because ""without urgent attention these issues will jeopardise the immediate and long term future of the sector"". They said the trade agreement, finalised on Christmas Eve just a week before the UK left the bloc's single market and customs union, had failed to deliver on promises of frictionless future trade. The sector's concerns echo those of other sectors, from music to fisheries, who argue the new bureaucratic regime is endangering the future of their industries. London Fashion Week is one of the global industry's most important events But the letter says the fashion industry contributes ""more to UK GDP than fishing, music, film and motor industries combined"". It highlights the compensation package offered to the fishing industry, saying: ""Fishing contributes as much to the UK economy as East London does from the fashion and textile industry, employing the same workforce as just one of the many high street retailers currently facing liquidation"". Brexit: How did the first month go? Brexit difficult for my firm - Samantha Cameron 'Brexit port delays mean our seafood is rotting' Model Yasmin Le Bon said the nature of the industry meant people had to be able to travel freely within the EU, often at short notice. ""I have been working continually in this industry for the past 37 years. It works in a very particular way, with jobs being confirmed literally at the last minute. I may get a call, make a decision and be at the airport within two hours. ""For once we need to be listened to and for the Government to work with us before it is too late,"" she said. Katharine Hamnett has long complained about the tax system's impact on the industry Designer Katharine Hamnett said many firms could be weeks away from going under. ""We need a radical overhaul of customs arrangements including VAT on all goods shipped into the EU by the end of February, or British brands will die,"" she said. Isabel Ettedgui, the chief executive of Connolly, the fashion brand that sells Scottish cashmere and manufactures leather goods in Spain, said the trade rules were turning the industry into a Brexit trading post. ""The result could be the possible closure of a 185-year-old company that holds the Royal Warrant,"" she said. Last week Samantha Cameron, wife of former prime minister David - who called the 2016 Brexit referendum - said her fashion business wasfinding post-Brexit trading with the EU ""challenging and difficult"". A government spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with businesses in the fashion industry to ensure they get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe, and seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world's fastest growing markets."" ""We are aware that some businesses are facing challenges with specific aspects of our new trading relationship with the EU. To this end, we are operating export helplines, running webinars with policy experts and offering businesses support via our network of 300 international trade advisers. This is on top of the millions we have invested to expand the customs intermediaries sector."" Brexit difficult for my firm - Samantha Cameron Brexit: How did the first month go?

Brexit food checks suspended at ports,"The first lorries to cross the sea border arrived in NI on January 4 Checks on animal and food products at Larne and Belfast ports have been suspended amid concerns for staff safety. The Department of Agriculture said this was pending talks with the PSNI. This comes after Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew staff from Brexit inspection duties at Larne Port over security concerns. Graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in recent days. The mayor of Larne, the DUP's Peter Johnston, said the council decision had been taken due to ""menacing behaviour"" referencing growing tensions over theNI Protocol. The BBC understands the PSNI is due to meet Mid and East Antrim council and officials from  Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) on Tuesday morning to  discuss the threats to workers at Larne and Belfast ports. The Northern Ireland Executive will also discuss the latest developments. Police said they have increased patrols at Larne port and other ""points of entry"". ""The safety of staff working at points of entry is of the utmost importance to us,"" the PSNI tweeted. ""Where we have credible information we will share that with our partners and take appropriate action."" The BBC has asked the EU for comment on the withdrawal of staff and security fears. In its statement the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said: ""On the basis of information received today and, pending further discussions with the PSNI, Daera has decided in the interests of the wellbeing of staff to temporarily suspend physical inspections of products of animal origin at Larne and Belfast. ""The situation will be kept under review and in the meantime full documentary checks will continue to be carried out as usual."" Checks on animals and food products containing meat, fish, dairy or eggs are among those affected. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he had taken the decision to withdraw staff from the ports following consultation with staff. Allow Twitter content?

First Minister Arlene Foster said she ""utterly condemned"" the threats. Speaking on UTV, she said: ""I think it is utterly reprehensible that anyone who is going to their place of work should be threatened in this way."" Mrs Foster said she was on the phone with UK minister Michael Gove when she was told of the council's decision. ""I was able to inform him of the development this evening,"" she said, adding that the way to deal with the NI Protocol was through ""constitutional politics"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Parties must 'work together' over NI Protocol row PSNI monitoring 'growing unionist Brexit discontent' Earlier on Monday evening, Larne mayor Peter Johnston told a council meeting that staff assisting with checks had raised concerns about ""suspicious activity"". ""We have no option but to withdraw them [staff] in order to fulfil our duty of care,"" said Mr Johnston. He added that he would write to Mr Poots, who holds responsibility over the issue, to make him aware of the decision. In a statement, the council said there had been an ""upsurge in sinister behaviour"" in recent weeks, including graffiti describing port staff as ""targets"", and what appeared to be attempts to gather workers' personal information, including vehicle registration plates. The council said it will carry out a full risk assessment with the PSNI, Food Standards Agency and Daera. Before council's decision on Monday, there were 12 environmental health officers working at Larne Port, as well as several senior council officers. Sinn FÃ©in's group party leader, councillor James McKeown, said staff would only return when it was safe. ""There are simmering tensions within the local community at present and we will not stand by and let our staff be targeted when they are just doing their jobs."" SDLP councillor Eugene Reid said leaders had fallen short: ""The language used and tone of the discussion relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol has raised tensions and whipped up fear. ""It should be the role of all leaders to extract the poison from public dialogue, and I'm challenging everyone to do that."" East Antrim Sammy Wilson said the NI Protocol has to go - ""but politics is the way"". He said staff safety was paramount. ""All threats must be condemned and cross party support for withdrawal is welcome. ""Those parties who talked up the threat of violence during the negotiations need to reflect. Border Control Posts (BCPs) were built at Larne harbour, and two other facilities in NI as a consequence of Brexit. They are facilities for inspecting food and live animals when they arrive from other parts of the UK. At the end of the Brexit transition on 1 January 2021, Northern Ireland remained in the single market for goods. The rest of the UK did not, so some products entering Northern Ireland from GB must be checked on entry. The EU has particularly strict rules on food and animals, requiring all those products to enter through a BCP. Victor Chestnutt, the President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said he was concerned that the supply of food may be affected by the suspension of checks. He told BBC News NI: ""Some of our food companies bring in ingredients from the UK mainland. If they needed checks and those checks are not done, is that going to be held at the port or is that going to be released? ""Trade needs to flow and flow freely.

Doctor: We're getting self-harming 10-year-olds in A&E,"A child's bandaged hand (stock image) The pandemic has had a deep impact on children, who are arriving in A&E in greater numbers and at younger ages after self-harming or taking overdoses, writes Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary. Children are a lost tribe in the pandemic. While they remain (for the most part) perplexingly immune to the health consequences of Covid-19, their lives and daily routines have been turned upside down. Fromsurveys and interviews carried out for the Born in Bradford study,external, we know that they are anxious, isolated and bored, and we see the tip of this iceberg of mental ill health in the hospital. Children in mental health crisis used to be brought to A&E about twice a week. Since the summer it's been more like once or twice a day. Some as young as 10 have cut themselves, taken overdoses, or tried to asphyxiate themselves. There was even one child aged eight. Lockdown ""massively exacerbates any pre-existing mental health issues - fears, anxieties, feelings of disconnection and isolation,"" says A&E consultant Dave Greenhorn. While Bradford has been in lockdown longer than some other parts of the country, there is no reason to believe this is a local problem. Dave says fellow A&E consultants he's spoken to in Scotland, Portsmouth and Northern Ireland all report a significant increase in mental health attendances - among all age groups, children as well as adults. The devastating toll of the pandemic on children BBC Teach: Children's Mental Health Week Own It: Look after your child's mental health in lockdown Self-harming ""used to be the mind-set of older teenagers but we are seeing much younger children doing this now"" says Ruth Tolley, a matron on the paediatric ward where children are taken if it is not safe for them to return home. It may then take the combined efforts of several nurses to prevent further self-harm on the ward. Eating disorders are also on the rise, says paediatrician Helen Jepp. So are overdoses - where children take their parents' medication, or their own - and cases where children rush out of the house and behave recklessly or dangerously on the street. A child psychiatrist who works with Bradford's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) says the caseload fell at the start of the pandemic then returned to normal levels. For him what's new is not the quantity but the severity of the work. ""We have been seeing more intense distress,"" he says. ""Young people are in a worse state than usual."" Consultant Dave Greenhorn describes a recent evening in A&E. It's a busy one - there are 94 people in the department, including a pale-looking teenage boy, lying quietly in a cubicle. Dave asks if he's OK, but there is no answer and no eye contact. The notes show that the boy has attended the Emergency Department every other day for two weeks. Before now he has taken small overdoses and told staff he wants to die. He has a child and adolescent psychiatrist and support worker but there is no firm diagnosis of mental illness. One of the problems is that lockdown has prevented everyone from accessing their own safety valves. The boy has previously mentioned that he misses going out with his friends. Now he's stuck at home, and so are other members of his family. Unable to get away for a few hours peace, the mum says she's at the end of her tether and can't deal with her son at home on this particular night. Dave's attempts to coax the boy to talk to him are unsuccessful, so he makes sure the youngster has some juice and a sandwich and asks the nurses to keep trying to get him to engage when they have a minute - though they rarely do. On previous admissions to the paediatric ward the boy has been hard to look after, so it's been agreed he shouldn't be sent there, but he doesn't want to go to an adult ward. In the end he spends the night in A&E. The pandemic has underlined for all to see just how important school is for children. Education is only part of it. There is also the social life, and children benefit from routine, boundaries and adult authority figures outside the home. Teachers are also experts at spotting problems such as anxiety and self-harm that has taken place at home. A lot of referrals would normally arise in this way. For older children, school is the framework that will enable them to reach university or employment, and some struggle when it appears to give way. Seema [not her real name] attempted suicide and started self-harming when exams were cancelled last summer. ""We tried very hard for our exams - you're taught that your entire future revolves around these exams, but that crumbles right in front of you and it's really shocking. It has a huge impact,"" she says. ""I felt like stabbing myselfâ¦ I was in a constant state of anxiety."" Now 17, she is doing a lot better, though she still misses contact with teachers and friends, and would like schools to organise online groups for students to socialise, not just meet for lessons. Her family hasn't been able to understand her problem, but she has now been getting help. Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio. Listen to theCoronavirus Front Line, on the BBC World Service Or read the previous online diary entry:Karen caught Covid - and took it home Find all the diary entries on the BBC Radio 4 website One crucial beneficial change that has come out of this epidemic of mental ill-health is that professionals from all the different agencies in Bradford have come together to support the children in their time of crisis. Gone are the delays in referrals between different teams - the health service and social services are acting as one. ""Covid has brought services closer together,"" says paediatric ward matron Ruth Tolley. ""We needed an urgent meeting with the safeguarding team and various other agencies and we were able to pull that meeting together in two hours - getting people together and getting a plan, that is really positive."" Paediatrician Helen Jepps agrees. She got a call about a teenager one morning, logged on and saw that a number of teams were already discussing the case - social workers, Camhs and voluntary organisations. ""It feels a real privilege at the moment to have that close contact,"" she says. But this is little consolation for the damage that is being done to children's lives. The past 10 months of lockdown and school closures may have seemed unending for parents, but for a 10-year-old it will have felt like a lifetime. Their youth is being stolen from them.

Plan for extra cash to remove unsafe cladding,"The government is planning to provide substantial extra funding to stave off a growing rebellion over the costs of fixing unsafe cladding, BBC Newsnight has been told. Thousands of flat owners face large bills for fire safety work prompted by the Grenfell Tower fire that killed 72 people. At least 35 Conservative MPs have signed an amendment to ensure the cost of does not fall on homeowners. The funding could amount to billions. Housing Minister Chris Pincher said the government would announce a financial solution ""very shortly"". He urged MPs to withdraw their amendment - warning it would slow down progress of the government's Fire Safety Bill, currently going through Parliament. Newsnight has learned that an announcement is expected within weeks as negotiations between the housing ministry and Treasury are reaching a conclusion. The government has decided to allocate extra funding, possibly running into billions of pounds, to speed up the removal of unsafe cladding. Fire-cladding costs 'are taking over our lives' New body to ban dangerous building materials No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs The deal is intended to create a lasting solution to the issue, and involves input from developers, the insurance industry , mortgage providers and leaseholders. The 2017 Grenfell Tower fire exposed the dangers of unsafe cladding and triggered fire-safety renovations across the country. The government has set up a Â£1.6bn building safety fund to pay for the removal of the kind of cladding used on Grenfell Tower. However other fire-safety defects, such as missing fire breaks, are not covered by the scheme. And a report by MPs has said the money allocated for fixing dangerous cladding is insufficient. On Monday, MPs debated a Labour motion calling for the government ""to protect leaseholders and taxpayers from the cost by pursuing those responsible for the cladding crisis"". The Conservative leadership asked its MPs to abstain, so the motion passed unopposed but the result is not binding on the government. Speaking earlier in the day, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused ministers of offering ""half-baked solutions"" and called for a national cladding taskforce to be established. Hana Imaan, a resident of Brindley House in Birmingham, told BBC Two's Newsnight that her service charge had gone up by Â£500 a month, in addition to higher insurance costs. She said the rise was ""financially crippling"" and described the stress of increased bills as ""phenomenal"". Malcolm Tarling of the Association of British Insurers said: ""No insurance company wants to saddle leaseholders with significantly higher bills but the reality is that insurance is priced on risk and until we speed up the removal of combustible cladding from buildings these costs are going to continue."" ""We are the first to say this is unacceptable,"" he added. Fire-cladding costs 'are taking over our lives' Cladding crisis: 'Delays could bankrupt us' New body to ban dangerous building materials No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Buy now, pay later firms face tighter controls","Fears over young shoppers' debts mean buy now, pay later firms such as Klarna will face more scrutiny by regulators. These services, offered through major retailers, allow people to split payments without paying interest and are used by millions of shoppers. But the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would be easy to build-up unseen debts of Â£1,000. Now it will regulate the sector, after the value of these services saw a near fourfold rise last year. Buy now, pay later services were used by five million people in the UK for total sales of Â£2.7bn in the last year. However, one in 10 people using them already had debt arrears elsewhere, a wide-ranging FCA review into credit services found. Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""By stepping in and regulating, we're making sure people are treated fairly and only offered agreements they can afford - the same protections you'd expect with other loans."" Chris Woolard, who ledthe FCA review recommending regulation,external, said that although buy now, pay later was convenient for some people, for others it was ""a really easy way to fall into problem debt"". This debt would not be seen by credit reference agencies and other lenders. Buy now, pay later 'growing fast' amid debt fears 'I got a Â£30 Klarna bill - but I've never used it' Under the new plans, providers would need to undertake affordability checks before lending and ensure customers were treated fairly, particularly those who are vulnerable or struggling with repayments. The government said it would legislate as soon as possible, following consultation. Alex Marsh, the UK head of Swedish company Klarna, accepted that ""now is the time for regulation"". He said the company worked with those who fell into debt, but ultimately missed payments could be forwarded to debt collectors. These firms allow people to choose - at an online or physical checkout - to pay for items in instalments or, in some cases, defer payments for up to 30 days. Large operators include Klarna, Clearpay, and LayBuy. They have proved popular with younger shoppers - particular by offering a cheaper way to try before buying or returning. Use of these services rose fast over the course of the pandemic. Estimates suggest Â£4 in every Â£100 currently spent in the UK uses buy now, pay later. Klarna's marketing campaigns featuring rapper and investor Snoop Dogg have centred on how ""smooth"" it makes the payment process Debt charities and campaigners have argued advertising via social media, often through influencers, has glamorised debt. They also suggest the services can make it too easy to fall into debt, and - while total debts are not huge - there are risks of unaffordable borrowing. These companies do not charge interest - instead charging a fee to the retailer and some charge late payment fees to consumers - and they argue they are more payment providers than credit firms. They have not fallen under the same level of regulation as other credit providers, such as credit card or loan companies who require FCA approval to lend and must conduct affordability checks. At present, anyone who has a complaint regarding a financial problem with a buy now, pay later firm is unable to take their case to the financial ombudsman for an independent adjudication. This should now change. Alice Tapper, who campaigned via social media for a change to the rules, said: ""It was the hundreds of people who shared their story with the campaign who made it painfully clear that the absence of regulation is at the expense of consumers, particularly those who are young and vulnerable."" But Gary Rohloff, managing director and co-founder of Laybuy, which has 400,000 UK users, said: ""We believe we are already in a good place when it comes to regulation. ""There needs to be a balance to protect consumers, but also make sure it retains the innovation and simplicity âthat consumers value."" Sophie Edwards is a follower of fashion, but it is a dedication that left her in debt. She spent thousands of pounds on clothes, using buy now, pay later services, but then found herself ""in a sticky situation"" when she was made redundant. ""I was using it for retail therapy, to make myself feel better,"" she said. ""It did not feel like real money. ""You can just go shopping on a Monday, a Tuesday and a Wednesday."" This video can not be played Before the FCA stepped in, the BBC highlighted buy now, pay later firms in this report She found herself still needing to pay back hundreds of pounds when she lost her regular pay. ""That does not sound like a lot, but with no income, it really is."" She paid the debt off, and has decided since never to use buy now, pay later services. The Woolard Review - the wider report into the credit sector which recommended the changes - made a string of proposals to assist those facing financial difficulty, particularly as a result of pandemic. Among the recommendations were: More funding for free debt advice services as the UK recovers from the coronavirus crisis Sustained support for people struggling to keep up with payments owing to the Covid fall-out Reform of regulation in the community lending and credit union sector, to offer alternatives to expensive short-term debt A review of repeat lending that could leave borrowers in difficulty ""New ways of borrowing and the impact of the pandemic are changing the market, with billions of pounds now in unregulated transactions and millions of consumers at greater risk of financial difficulty,"" Mr Woolard said.

Into the wild: Could lynx return to Scotland?,"Hunting and habitat loss wiped out lynx in Britain between 500 and 1,000 years ago Hundreds of years after the last lynx died out in Britain, people in Scotland are being asked about whether the cats should be reintroduced. Eurasian lynx are the third largest predator in continental Europe after the brown bear and wolf. Their main prey are roe deer - a small deer that favours woodland. Lynx were once native to Britain but were driven to extinction 500 to 1,000 years ago due to hunting and habitat loss. Three charities - Scotland: The Big Picture, Trees for Life and Vincent Wildlife Trust - have come together to look into the potential of releasing lynx into the wild in Scotland. Last month the charities began a year-long ""extensive and impartial"" study to explore public attitudes to the idea, and to investigate the barriers to returning the animals to parts of the Cairngorms and Argyll. The study,Lynx to Scotland,external, will include consultation with rural communities and is separate from other lynx reintroduction projects. There are strong critics of the idea, with the National Farmers Union Scotland (NFUS) saying a return of the predator would be ""wholly unacceptable"" to its members. Roe deer are the main prey of lynx The three charities believe there are sound ecological reasons for bringing back lynx, an animal they describe as a ""shy and solitary"" woodland hunter, rarely glimpsed and not known to attack humans. They said previous research suggested the Scottish Highlands had sufficient habitat - and more than enough roe deer - to support about 400 wild lynx. Steve Micklewright, chief executive of Findhorn-based Trees for Life, said Scotland had more roe deer than any other European country. He said lynx could help control deer numbers in areas where their feeding harmed natural woodland regeneration. He said: ""By preying on roe deer, lynx would restore ecological processes that have been missing for centuries, and provide a free and efficient deer management service."" Herefordshire-based Vincent Wildlife Trust is leading the study. Jenny MacPherson, science and research programme manager at the trust, said: ""Reintroducing lynx would inevitably bring challenges."" She said the study would seek a range of perspectives to obtain ""meaningful conclusions"" about the level of support or tolerance for lynx, and the likely success of any future reintroduction. Peter Cairns, of Scotland: The Big Picture, said predators like lynx played a key part in healthy natural environments. He said: ""With a global biodiversity crisis, we have a responsibility to have open and constructive conversations around restoring key native species to the Scottish landscape - and science shows that apex predators like lynx play a vital ecological role in maintaining healthy living systems."" Scottish forest identified for lynx reintroduction Lynx forest plan rejected by government Lynx have been reintroduced to other parts of Europe, including Germany's Harz National Park in 2000. Ole Anders, who works on a project managing the park's small lynx population, said there had been discussions and debates about releasing the cats in the Harz mountains since the 1970s. He told BBC Scotland'sThe Nineinitial fears about their reintroduction had included lynx attacks on people and livestock. Mr Anders said no-one had been put risk by the animals, and farmers were compensated for the few livestock losses seen. He said: ""Forestry is the most important business (in the park) and there is not much farming, which is something of an advantage to introducing a large carnivore like the Eurasian lynx."" Mr Anders said some tourism businesses in the park had embraced the lynx and used images on their promotional material. NFUS is strongly opposed to the reintroduction of lynx But NFUS is strongly opposed to the reintroduction. It said an NFUS study trip to Norway in 2017 heard that Norwegian authorities paid out compensation on 20,000 sheep lost to predators, with lynx accounting for 21% of the losses. NFUS vice president, Martin Kennedy, said predation of livestock in Norway had been declining, but only because of the numbers of farmers who had given up stocking sheep. Mr Kennedy, a hill farmer from Highland Perthshire, added: ""The Norwegians told us that to reintroduce predators into our country would be an absolute catastrophe. ""Their experience has simply strengthened our resolve."" Angus MacFadyen, NFUS environment and land use committee chairman, said: ""NFU Scotland remains crystal clear that any proposals to re-introduce predators such as lynx are wholly unacceptable to Scottish farmers and crofters. ""The past three to four years have seen a long line of brazen and presumptuous claims from organisations about the imminent reintroduction of lynx to the UK."" The Scottish government hasno plans to reintroduce lynx,external.

Female athletes 'harassed' while training outdoorsOne athlete says she had a beer can thrown at her while training in public.Wales,"This video can not be played Two people can now exercise outside together, after women raised safety concerns A number of female Welsh sprinters have been verbally abused by strangers as they train in public. They would normally be able to train at athletics tracks but those venues have been closed because of coronavirus restrictions. Former Wales 400m champion Rhiannon Linington-Payne said the behaviour was ""potential harassment"" and not banter. Welsh Athletics said it had started working with South Wales Police to tackle intimidating behaviour. Linington-Payne, 29, from Cardiff, said the language shouted was often offensive or derogatory towards women. ""I've had inappropriate comments about my figure, wolf-whistling, cars slowing down to stare... I've even had a beer can thrown at me,"" she said. ""The more it happens, the more it wears away at you"". Welsh athletes 'disadvantaged' by lockdown Athletics faces âhuge challengeâ to return Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Currently only individuals classified as elite athletes by Sport Wales and part of the Commonwealth Games programme can travel to and train at designated facilities. It means many athletes who represent Wales at a high level have been left training at home, alongside roads or in parks. ""It's actually quite ironic... I'm not allowed on the track for safety reasons, but I don't feel safe where I'm training now,"" added Great Britain and Wales sprinter Hannah Brier. Hannah Brier says she has been left feeling intimidated while out running alone The 22-year-old, from Neath, who competes in the 100m and 200m sprints trains six days a week, doing weights in her parents' kitchen or running reps alongside flat stretches of road. The masters student said one incident in the summer left her feeling ""intimidated"" as a man repeatedly drove past her, shouting and staring. Miss Brier was so concerned about her safety that she eventually called her dad to pick her up. The incident has left her choosing plainer and looser items of clothing to avoid attention. ""I find myself now going through my wardrobe and picking outfits that I think are not as flashy, not as revealing... I'm not going to get noticed if I wear all black,"" she added Last week the Welsh Government eased lockdown restrictions to allow an individual to meet one other person from another household to exercise in their local area. Lauren Williams says she has only started feeling unsafe recently First Minister Mark Drakeford said the decision was ""partly"" because they had heard from women that ""in the dark, cold and wet of January they don't feel safe going out to exercise alone"". A survey by England Athletics in 2017 found a third of female runners said they had been harassed while out running. More than 60% of the 2,000 women questioned said they felt anxious running alone, with personal safety their main concern. Lauren Williams, a 400m hurdler from Llanidloes, Powys, has had similar ""unnerving"" experiences while training in public spaces. ""Never before have I felt unsafe training but recently, I really have,"" she said. The 21-year-old said she had received comments on her clothes being ""too tight"", or her outfits being too revealing. ""I'm not going out to run to look good, I'm going to perform so it shouldn't matter,"" she added. The management student at Bath University added she does not have a choice other than to train to make next year's Commonwealth Games in Birmingham but she is worried this behaviour might put other women off exercising outdoors. ""It manifests itself everywhere even in a local park, the message has got to be it is not ok, the behaviour shouldn't be condoned,"" she said. Fellow athlete Linington-Payne agrees and has called for wider cultural change to stop this sort of behaviour. ""It goes deeper than sport,"" she said. ""It's just respect for other human beings and I'm shocked that there are people out there who still think it's appropriate to speak to someone like that."" In a statement, Welsh Athletics chief executive James Williams said the body's values promotes ""respect, togetherness and fun"" and everyone should be able ""to enjoy the sport in a safe and inclusive way"".

"Scrap interest on student loans, say uni bossesCall to wipe interest on student loans in England for 15 months, as ministers offer Â£50m support fund.Family & Education","The government has announced a Â£50m package to support students The interest on student loans in England should be scrapped for 15 months, a group of universities says. The vice-chancellors of seven universities say this would cover the period from the first national lockdown until summer 2021. They say waiving the charge would ease the pressure on graduates. But the government said such a move would not help students in need amid the coronavirus pandemic as it announced a boost to hardship funding. Universities minister Michelle Donelan said the vice-chancellors' proposal wouldn't put cash into students' pockets to support them during the pandemic. She told BBC Breakfast that ""at least half of students don't actually pay back their student loan"", adding that the government's priority was helping ""those students most in need"". The government has announced an extra Â£50m for student hardship funds in England, on top of Â£20m agreed in December. No uni for poor white teens in 'left behind towns' Students plea to end 'unfair' rental contracts Covid tests at university find few positive cases In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the vice-chancellors say students are paying a heavy price in the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The opportunity and wealth gap between the young and old is already unacceptably large - and existing challenges are being amplified by the impact of the pandemic on students and their life chances,"" the letter says. It says the pandemic has placed ""unprecedented pressures on our students"", with demands for hardship funds increasing by over 100% in some universities. The letter is signed by seven vice-chancellors: Prof Anthony Forster from the University of Essex Prof Frances Corner from Goldsmiths, University of London Prof Karen Cox from the University of Kent Prof Paul Layzell from Royal Holloway, University of London Prof David Richardson from the University of East Anglia Prof Adam Tickell from the University of Sussex Prof Robert Van de Noort from the University of Reading They call for a reduction equivalent to waiving the interest rate on student loans for the 15 months from the first national lockdown in March 2020 to the end of this academic year. In England students are currently charged 5.6% on their student loans while they are studying,  based on the retail price index, plus 3% - this applies until the 5 April after they graduate and then varies depending on earnings. The letter comes as the government says students facing financial pressures due to the pandemic will have access to an additional Â£50m support fund. Ms Donelan said: ""We know that the pandemic, and the implications of the pandemic, has put extra pressure on students' finances."" Universities will be able to use the extra funding to help students facing loss of employment, additional costs for alternative accommodation or to support access to remote teaching amid Covid-19. The majority of university students in England have been told not to return to campus under the latest lockdown, sparking calls for rent rebates for term-time accommodation, and for tuition fee refunds. In December, the government announced a one-off fund of up to Â£20m to help students most in need of support in exceptional circumstances - this further Â£50m takes the total to Â£70m for this financial year. The funding will be distributed by the Office for Students (OfS) directly to universities, which will prioritise the students most in need. Many students have been calling for rent and tuition fee rebates Last week, a survey from the Office for National Statistics suggested that a growing proportion of university students were not happy with their academic experience - and nearly two in three had seen their mental health worsen. The University and College Union general secretary, Jo Grady, described the funding as a ""sticking plaster"". ""The government needs to go further and provide proper funding to avoid irreparable long-term damage to the sector's reputation,"" she said. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said the additional funding was a ""positive step"", but added: ""As the serious mental health impact of the pandemic continues to be felt, universities need further funding to alleviate the substantial increases in demand that university wellbeing and support services are experiencing."" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, said the funding was welcome. ""We intend to distribute it as swiftly as possible to benefit those who are most in need,"" she said. The independent consultancy London Economics (LE)  looked just at first year undergraduates, from England,  studying across the UK. The cost of writing off their interest, for that one cohort, for this academic year is estimated at roughly Â£33m, or a 0.3% increase in the cost to the government of funding this cohort. Maike Halterbeck, associate director at LE and a specialist in higher education fees and funding, said not much would be gained for students. ""In spite of its apparent attractiveness, this proposal wouldn't provide any benefit to the average graduate. ""Only the highest earning - predominantly male - graduates would derive a small benefit of a few hundred pounds. It would not affect female graduates, or lower earning male graduates"" LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Lesson support available on BBC Bitesize for every child, of every age, every day of the week BITESIZE DAILY ON BBC IPLAYER:Help is at hand for your homeschooling needs Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Buy now, pay later firms face tighter controlsThe financial regulator says it would be easy for customers to build up unseen debts of Â£1,000.Business","Fears over young shoppers' debts mean buy now, pay later firms such as Klarna will face more scrutiny by regulators. These services, offered through major retailers, allow people to split payments without paying interest and are used by millions of shoppers. But the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would be easy to build-up unseen debts of Â£1,000. Now it will regulate the sector, after the value of these services saw a near fourfold rise last year. Buy now, pay later services were used by five million people in the UK for total sales of Â£2.7bn in the last year. However, one in 10 people using them already had debt arrears elsewhere, a wide-ranging FCA review into credit services found. Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""By stepping in and regulating, we're making sure people are treated fairly and only offered agreements they can afford - the same protections you'd expect with other loans."" Chris Woolard, who ledthe FCA review recommending regulation,external, said that although buy now, pay later was convenient for some people, for others it was ""a really easy way to fall into problem debt"". This debt would not be seen by credit reference agencies and other lenders. Buy now, pay later 'growing fast' amid debt fears 'I got a Â£30 Klarna bill - but I've never used it' Under the new plans, providers would need to undertake affordability checks before lending and ensure customers were treated fairly, particularly those who are vulnerable or struggling with repayments. The government said it would legislate as soon as possible, following consultation. Alex Marsh, the UK head of Swedish company Klarna, accepted that ""now is the time for regulation"". He said the company worked with those who fell into debt, but ultimately missed payments could be forwarded to debt collectors. These firms allow people to choose - at an online or physical checkout - to pay for items in instalments or, in some cases, defer payments for up to 30 days. Large operators include Klarna, Clearpay, and LayBuy. They have proved popular with younger shoppers - particular by offering a cheaper way to try before buying or returning. Use of these services rose fast over the course of the pandemic. Estimates suggest Â£4 in every Â£100 currently spent in the UK uses buy now, pay later. Klarna's marketing campaigns featuring rapper and investor Snoop Dogg have centred on how ""smooth"" it makes the payment process Debt charities and campaigners have argued advertising via social media, often through influencers, has glamorised debt. They also suggest the services can make it too easy to fall into debt, and - while total debts are not huge - there are risks of unaffordable borrowing. These companies do not charge interest - instead charging a fee to the retailer and some charge late payment fees to consumers - and they argue they are more payment providers than credit firms. They have not fallen under the same level of regulation as other credit providers, such as credit card or loan companies who require FCA approval to lend and must conduct affordability checks. At present, anyone who has a complaint regarding a financial problem with a buy now, pay later firm is unable to take their case to the financial ombudsman for an independent adjudication. This should now change. Alice Tapper, who campaigned via social media for a change to the rules, said: ""It was the hundreds of people who shared their story with the campaign who made it painfully clear that the absence of regulation is at the expense of consumers, particularly those who are young and vulnerable."" But Gary Rohloff, managing director and co-founder of Laybuy, which has 400,000 UK users, said: ""We believe we are already in a good place when it comes to regulation. ""There needs to be a balance to protect consumers, but also make sure it retains the innovation and simplicity âthat consumers value."" Sophie Edwards is a follower of fashion, but it is a dedication that left her in debt. She spent thousands of pounds on clothes, using buy now, pay later services, but then found herself ""in a sticky situation"" when she was made redundant. ""I was using it for retail therapy, to make myself feel better,"" she said. ""It did not feel like real money. ""You can just go shopping on a Monday, a Tuesday and a Wednesday."" This video can not be played Before the FCA stepped in, the BBC highlighted buy now, pay later firms in this report She found herself still needing to pay back hundreds of pounds when she lost her regular pay. ""That does not sound like a lot, but with no income, it really is."" She paid the debt off, and has decided since never to use buy now, pay later services. The Woolard Review - the wider report into the credit sector which recommended the changes - made a string of proposals to assist those facing financial difficulty, particularly as a result of pandemic. Among the recommendations were: More funding for free debt advice services as the UK recovers from the coronavirus crisis Sustained support for people struggling to keep up with payments owing to the Covid fall-out Reform of regulation in the community lending and credit union sector, to offer alternatives to expensive short-term debt A review of repeat lending that could leave borrowers in difficulty ""New ways of borrowing and the impact of the pandemic are changing the market, with billions of pounds now in unregulated transactions and millions of consumers at greater risk of financial difficulty,"" Mr Woolard said.

Female athletes 'harassed' while training outdoorsOne athlete says she had a beer can thrown at her while training in public.,"This video can not be played Two people can now exercise outside together, after women raised safety concerns A number of female Welsh sprinters have been verbally abused by strangers as they train in public. They would normally be able to train at athletics tracks but those venues have been closed because of coronavirus restrictions. Former Wales 400m champion Rhiannon Linington-Payne said the behaviour was ""potential harassment"" and not banter. Welsh Athletics said it had started working with South Wales Police to tackle intimidating behaviour. Linington-Payne, 29, from Cardiff, said the language shouted was often offensive or derogatory towards women. ""I've had inappropriate comments about my figure, wolf-whistling, cars slowing down to stare... I've even had a beer can thrown at me,"" she said. ""The more it happens, the more it wears away at you"". Welsh athletes 'disadvantaged' by lockdown Athletics faces âhuge challengeâ to return Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Currently only individuals classified as elite athletes by Sport Wales and part of the Commonwealth Games programme can travel to and train at designated facilities. It means many athletes who represent Wales at a high level have been left training at home, alongside roads or in parks. ""It's actually quite ironic... I'm not allowed on the track for safety reasons, but I don't feel safe where I'm training now,"" added Great Britain and Wales sprinter Hannah Brier. Hannah Brier says she has been left feeling intimidated while out running alone The 22-year-old, from Neath, who competes in the 100m and 200m sprints trains six days a week, doing weights in her parents' kitchen or running reps alongside flat stretches of road. The masters student said one incident in the summer left her feeling ""intimidated"" as a man repeatedly drove past her, shouting and staring. Miss Brier was so concerned about her safety that she eventually called her dad to pick her up. The incident has left her choosing plainer and looser items of clothing to avoid attention. ""I find myself now going through my wardrobe and picking outfits that I think are not as flashy, not as revealing... I'm not going to get noticed if I wear all black,"" she added Last week the Welsh Government eased lockdown restrictions to allow an individual to meet one other person from another household to exercise in their local area. Lauren Williams says she has only started feeling unsafe recently First Minister Mark Drakeford said the decision was ""partly"" because they had heard from women that ""in the dark, cold and wet of January they don't feel safe going out to exercise alone"". A survey by England Athletics in 2017 found a third of female runners said they had been harassed while out running. More than 60% of the 2,000 women questioned said they felt anxious running alone, with personal safety their main concern. Lauren Williams, a 400m hurdler from Llanidloes, Powys, has had similar ""unnerving"" experiences while training in public spaces. ""Never before have I felt unsafe training but recently, I really have,"" she said. The 21-year-old said she had received comments on her clothes being ""too tight"", or her outfits being too revealing. ""I'm not going out to run to look good, I'm going to perform so it shouldn't matter,"" she added. The management student at Bath University added she does not have a choice other than to train to make next year's Commonwealth Games in Birmingham but she is worried this behaviour might put other women off exercising outdoors. ""It manifests itself everywhere even in a local park, the message has got to be it is not ok, the behaviour shouldn't be condoned,"" she said. Fellow athlete Linington-Payne agrees and has called for wider cultural change to stop this sort of behaviour. ""It goes deeper than sport,"" she said. ""It's just respect for other human beings and I'm shocked that there are people out there who still think it's appropriate to speak to someone like that."" In a statement, Welsh Athletics chief executive James Williams said the body's values promotes ""respect, togetherness and fun"" and everyone should be able ""to enjoy the sport in a safe and inclusive way"".

South Africa lifts alcohol ban as Covid rules ease,"The government argued the alcohol bans were needed to alleviate the pressure on the healthcare system South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has eased some restrictions imposed due to coronavirus, including lifting an unpopular ban on alcohol sales. Beaches will reopen and limited religious gatherings will be allowed. The announcement came as Mr Ramaphosa hailed the arrival of the first shipment of vaccines - one million AstraZeneca doses - as a chance to ""turn the tide"" on Covid-19. South Africa has had the most Covid infections and deaths on the continent. More than 1.4 million people have contracted the virus since the pandemic began, and 44,164 are known to have lost their lives,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external. Why has South Africa not started vaccinating? Many countries have banned travel from South Africa in an effort to stop the spread of the highly infectious 501Y.V2 variant, which is believed to have originated there and which is suspected to be more resistant to vaccines. The country will remain in what is termed a level 3 lockdown, but a number of restrictions that had been in place will end. Retail outlets can now sell alcohol between 10:00 and 18:00 from Monday to Thursday, and licensed outlets can serve drinks on-site from 10:00 to 22:00, when they must close. The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Global coronavirus tracker: Cases, deaths and vaccinations Curfew hours will now be 23:00 to 04:00. South Africans have faced three alcohol bans since the pandemic hit last March, the last was imposed on 28 December. Health workers, as here in Pretoria, will get the first vaccine doses The government argues it was necessary to alleviate the pressure on the healthcare system. The bans have not been popular among many in the public and the liquor industry said millions of jobs were at risk. Announcing the latest changes, Mr Ramaphosa said: ""I want to call on all of us to drink responsibly so that we do not experience a spike in trauma cases or an increase in infections due to reckless behaviour."" In additional relaxations of rules, 50 people can now worship indoors and 100 outdoors. Beaches, rivers, parks and swimming pools will reopen. Mr Ramaphosa said the peak of the second wave of the virus had now passed, and that ""the average rate of new infections has been steadily coming down over the last three weeks"". Workers unload the first vaccine shipment to arrive in South Africa He said: ""These changes have been made possible by the significant reduction in Covid-19 hospital admissions across all provinces, reducing the pressure on beds and hospital personnel."" Earlier, he had travelled to OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg to welcome the arrival of the Oxford-AstraZeneca doses, produced by the Serum Institute of India. ""The arrival of these vaccines contains the promise that we can turn the tide on this disease that has caused so much devastation and hardship in our country and across the world,"" he said. The one million doses will be given to healthcare workers, although no date has been set for the start of the roll-out, and the number is still short of that needed just for the country's 1.25 million health workers. The country says it has negotiated access to more than 50 million doses and has set a target of inoculating 40 million people, two-thirds of the population, this year. Mr Ramaphosa pledged to ""leave no stone unturned"" to reach herd immunity. This video can not be played Which face covering is best to wear?

Ministers face growing rebellion over cladding,"The government is planning to provide substantial extra funding to stave off a growing rebellion over the costs of fixing unsafe cladding, BBC Newsnight has been told. Thousands of flat owners face large bills for fire safety work prompted by the Grenfell Tower fire that killed 72 people. At least 35 Conservative MPs have signed an amendment to ensure the cost of does not fall on homeowners. The funding could amount to billions. Housing Minister Chris Pincher said the government would announce a financial solution ""very shortly"". He urged MPs to withdraw their amendment - warning it would slow down progress of the government's Fire Safety Bill, currently going through Parliament. Newsnight has learned that an announcement is expected within weeks as negotiations between the housing ministry and Treasury are reaching a conclusion. The government has decided to allocate extra funding, possibly running into billions of pounds, to speed up the removal of unsafe cladding. Fire-cladding costs 'are taking over our lives' New body to ban dangerous building materials No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs The deal is intended to create a lasting solution to the issue, and involves input from developers, the insurance industry , mortgage providers and leaseholders. The 2017 Grenfell Tower fire exposed the dangers of unsafe cladding and triggered fire-safety renovations across the country. The government has set up a Â£1.6bn building safety fund to pay for the removal of the kind of cladding used on Grenfell Tower. However other fire-safety defects, such as missing fire breaks, are not covered by the scheme. And a report by MPs has said the money allocated for fixing dangerous cladding is insufficient. On Monday, MPs debated a Labour motion calling for the government ""to protect leaseholders and taxpayers from the cost by pursuing those responsible for the cladding crisis"". The Conservative leadership asked its MPs to abstain, so the motion passed unopposed but the result is not binding on the government. Speaking earlier in the day, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused ministers of offering ""half-baked solutions"" and called for a national cladding taskforce to be established. Hana Imaan, a resident of Brindley House in Birmingham, told BBC Two's Newsnight that her service charge had gone up by Â£500 a month, in addition to higher insurance costs. She said the rise was ""financially crippling"" and described the stress of increased bills as ""phenomenal"". Malcolm Tarling of the Association of British Insurers said: ""No insurance company wants to saddle leaseholders with significantly higher bills but the reality is that insurance is priced on risk and until we speed up the removal of combustible cladding from buildings these costs are going to continue."" ""We are the first to say this is unacceptable,"" he added.

General behind Myanmar's coup,"The 64-year-old general has spent his entire career in the influential military Min Aung Hlaing rose steadily through the ranks of the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's powerful military, but as commander-in-chief for the past decade he also wielded significant political influence before the 1 February coup. He successfully maintained the Tatmadaw's power even as Myanmar transitioned to democracy, but received international condemnation and sanctions for his alleged role in the military's attacks of ethnic minorities. As Myanmar returns to military rule under his leadership, Min Aung Hlaing now looks set to extend his power and shape the country's immediate future. Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi The 64-year-old general has spent his entire career in the influential military, which he joined as a cadet. A former law student at Yangon University, he entered the Defence Services Academy on his third attempt in 1974. The relatively unassuming infantryman kept getting regular promotions and moved up the ladder, eventually becoming commander of the Bureau of Special Operations-2 in 2009. Myanmar has the second-largest army in South East Asia In this role, he oversaw operations in north-eastern Myanmar, which led to tens of thousands of ethnic minority refugees fleeing the eastern Shan province and the Kokang region, along the Chinese border. Despite allegations of murder, rape and arson against his troops, Min Aung Hlaing continued to rise and in August 2010 he became joint chief of staff. Less than a year later, he was tapped for the military's top post ahead of more senior generals, succeeding long-time leader Than Shwe as commander-in-chief in March 2011. When Min Aung Hlaing became military chief, blogger and writer Hla Oo - who said they had known each other in childhood - described him as ""a battle-hardened warrior of brutal Burmese Army"", but also called him a ""serious scholar and gentleman"". Min Aung Hlaing began his tenure as military chief as Myanmar transitioned to democracy in 2011 after decades of military rule, but remained keen on maintaining the Tatmadaw's power. His political influence and social media presence increased as the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) led the government. In 2016, when Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) came to power, he seemingly adapted to the change by working and appearing at public events with her. Min Aung Hlaing was once happy to work with Aung San Suu Kyi Despite the change, he ensured the Tatmadaw continued to hold 25% of parliamentary seats and crucial security-related cabinet portfolios, while resisting the NLD's attempts to amend the constitution and limit military power. In 2016 and 2017, the military intensified a crackdown on the Rohingya ethnic minority in the northern Rakhine state, leading to many Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar. The military chief was condemned internationally for the alleged ""genocide"", and in August 2018 the UN Human Rights Council said: ""Myanmar's top military generals, including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States."" Following the council's statement, Facebook deleted his account, along with those of other individuals and organisations who it said had ""committed or enabled serious human rights abuses in the country"". The US sanctioned him twice - in 2019 for his alleged role in ""ethnic cleansing"" and human rights violations, and in July 2020 the UK also imposed sanctions on him. The November 2020 general election saw a landslide win for the NLD, according to official figures, but in subsequent months the Tatmadaw and military-backed USDP repeatedly disputed the results. The USDP made allegations of widespread electoral fraud. Those claims were dismissed by the election commission ahead of a planned parliament session on 1 February to confirm the new government. Speculation of a coup grew amid the stand-off between the government and the armed forces. On 27 January Min Aung Hlaing warned that ""the constitution shall be abolished, if not followed"", citing example of previous military coups in 1962 and 1988. His office seemingly reversed this stance by 30 January, saying that the media had misinterpreted military officials' words about abolishing the constitution. However, on the morning of 1 February, the Tatmadaw detained State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other senior leaders, and declared a year-long state of emergency. This video can not be played The early morning arrest of regional MP Pa Pa Han was live streamed on Facebook by her husband Min Aung Hlaing assumed all state power for this period in his capacity as commander-in-chief, and immediately prioritised the alleged electoral irregularities. A meeting of the National Defence and Security Council led by him said it would investigate the fraud claims and hold new elections, effectively invalidating the NLD's win. This video can not be played How did this peace icon end up at a genocide trial? Min Aung Hlaing was originally due to step down as commander-in-chief after reaching the retirement age of 65 in July this year, but has now given himself at least another year in power - and potentially longer - with Myanmar's apparent return to military rule. As Myanmar faces an uncertain future with the state of emergency, he has cemented his power and taken charge of the country.

Brexit food checks suspended at NI ports,"The first lorries to cross the sea border arrived in NI on January 4 Checks on animal and food products at Larne and Belfast ports have been suspended amid concerns for staff safety. The Department of Agriculture said this was pending talks with the PSNI. This comes after Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew staff from Brexit inspection duties at Larne Port over security concerns. Graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in recent days. The mayor of Larne, the DUP's Peter Johnston, said the council decision had been taken due to ""menacing behaviour"" referencing growing tensions over theNI Protocol. The BBC understands the PSNI is due to meet Mid and East Antrim council and officials from  Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) on Tuesday morning to  discuss the threats to workers at Larne and Belfast ports. The Northern Ireland Executive will also discuss the latest developments. Police said they have increased patrols at Larne port and other ""points of entry"". ""The safety of staff working at points of entry is of the utmost importance to us,"" the PSNI tweeted. ""Where we have credible information we will share that with our partners and take appropriate action."" The BBC has asked the EU for comment on the withdrawal of staff and security fears. In its statement the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said: ""On the basis of information received today and, pending further discussions with the PSNI, Daera has decided in the interests of the wellbeing of staff to temporarily suspend physical inspections of products of animal origin at Larne and Belfast. ""The situation will be kept under review and in the meantime full documentary checks will continue to be carried out as usual."" Checks on animals and food products containing meat, fish, dairy or eggs are among those affected. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he had taken the decision to withdraw staff from the ports following consultation with staff. Allow Twitter content?

First Minister Arlene Foster said she ""utterly condemned"" the threats. Speaking on UTV, she said: ""I think it is utterly reprehensible that anyone who is going to their place of work should be threatened in this way."" Mrs Foster said she was on the phone with UK minister Michael Gove when she was told of the council's decision. ""I was able to inform him of the development this evening,"" she said, adding that the way to deal with the NI Protocol was through ""constitutional politics"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Parties must 'work together' over NI Protocol row PSNI monitoring 'growing unionist Brexit discontent' Earlier on Monday evening, Larne mayor Peter Johnston told a council meeting that staff assisting with checks had raised concerns about ""suspicious activity"". ""We have no option but to withdraw them [staff] in order to fulfil our duty of care,"" said Mr Johnston. He added that he would write to Mr Poots, who holds responsibility over the issue, to make him aware of the decision. In a statement, the council said there had been an ""upsurge in sinister behaviour"" in recent weeks, including graffiti describing port staff as ""targets"", and what appeared to be attempts to gather workers' personal information, including vehicle registration plates. The council said it will carry out a full risk assessment with the PSNI, Food Standards Agency and Daera. Before council's decision on Monday, there were 12 environmental health officers working at Larne Port, as well as several senior council officers. Sinn FÃ©in's group party leader, councillor James McKeown, said staff would only return when it was safe. ""There are simmering tensions within the local community at present and we will not stand by and let our staff be targeted when they are just doing their jobs."" SDLP councillor Eugene Reid said leaders had fallen short: ""The language used and tone of the discussion relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol has raised tensions and whipped up fear. ""It should be the role of all leaders to extract the poison from public dialogue, and I'm challenging everyone to do that."" East Antrim Sammy Wilson said the NI Protocol has to go - ""but politics is the way"". He said staff safety was paramount. ""All threats must be condemned and cross party support for withdrawal is welcome. ""Those parties who talked up the threat of violence during the negotiations need to reflect. Border Control Posts (BCPs) were built at Larne harbour, and two other facilities in NI as a consequence of Brexit. They are facilities for inspecting food and live animals when they arrive from other parts of the UK. At the end of the Brexit transition on 1 January 2021, Northern Ireland remained in the single market for goods. The rest of the UK did not, so some products entering Northern Ireland from GB must be checked on entry. The EU has particularly strict rules on food and animals, requiring all those products to enter through a BCP. Victor Chestnutt, the President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said he was concerned that the supply of food may be affected by the suspension of checks. He told BBC News NI: ""Some of our food companies bring in ingredients from the UK mainland. If they needed checks and those checks are not done, is that going to be held at the port or is that going to be released? ""Trade needs to flow and flow freely.

Non-essential shops to reopen in Jersey,"The reopening of non-essential retail was delayed due to concerns over coronavirus cases Shops in Jersey will reopen on Wednesday after original plans were delayed by a week. It was hoped non-essential retail would reopen on 27 January, but concerns over a cluster of coronavirus cases saw that date pushed back. On Monday there were 94 active cases of coronavirus on the island three of which were in hospital. Hairdressers are also set to reopen on 10 February, said Chief Minister John Le Fondre. The government would reconsider restrictions on working from home and the re-opening of ""some hospitality services"" on 24 February, he said. A hospitality circuit-breaker, forcing all pubs and restaurants to close, has been in place since 4 December. Mr Le Fondre said there had been a reduction the number of hospital patients with Covid-19. He said a ""safe and measured"" relaxation of restrictions would prevent a spike in cases. A ""significant proportion"" of over 80s had been vaccinated and over 70s could now book appointments. The government was on target to vaccinate all over-50s and high-risk islanders by the end of March. He said a ""bright spring is in sight"" if people followed guidelines.

Brexit food checks suspended at NI portsStaff are withdrawn from Larne and Belfast ports and police increase patrols due to security concerns.Northern Ireland,"The first lorries to cross the sea border arrived in NI on January 4 Checks on animal and food products at Larne and Belfast ports have been suspended amid concerns for staff safety. The Department of Agriculture said this was pending talks with the PSNI. This comes after Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew staff from Brexit inspection duties at Larne Port over security concerns. Graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in recent days. The mayor of Larne, the DUP's Peter Johnston, said the council decision had been taken due to ""menacing behaviour"" referencing growing tensions over theNI Protocol. The BBC understands the PSNI is due to meet Mid and East Antrim council and officials from  Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) on Tuesday morning to  discuss the threats to workers at Larne and Belfast ports. The Northern Ireland Executive will also discuss the latest developments. Police said they have increased patrols at Larne port and other ""points of entry"". ""The safety of staff working at points of entry is of the utmost importance to us,"" the PSNI tweeted. ""Where we have credible information we will share that with our partners and take appropriate action."" The BBC has asked the EU for comment on the withdrawal of staff and security fears.

US threatens sanctions over Myanmar military coup,"Aung San Suu Kyi is still in detention after the military coup Calls are growing for the release of Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi a day after the army seized power in the south-east Asian nation. Ms Suu Kyi, who led the country's elected government, has not been seen since she was detained by the military. MPs who were confined in their accommodation in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, have now been told they can leave. But there are signs of defiance, including a medical staff strike and pot-banging in the main city Yangon. The military took power in the early hours of Monday and declared a year-long state of emergency after accusing Ms Suu Kyi's party of fraud over its recent election win. All you need to know about the coup Her National League for Democracy (NLD) demanded her immediate release on Tuesday. It has also called upon the military to accept the results of the November election, which saw the NLD win more than 80% of the votes. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces until 2011, when a nominally civilian government was sworn in. The morning after the coup, the country remained calm. Streets were quiet, with troops patrolling all major cities and a night-time curfew in force. The communications systems which had been disrupted on Monday had returned by Tuesday morning, with phone and internet connections running again. Growing up under Myanmar's military rule Military coup likely to damage Myanmar's economy Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? But as night fell on Tuesday, car horns and the banging of cooking pots could be heard in the streets of Yangon in a sign of protest. A campaign of civil disobedience appeared to be gathering steam with doctors working in government hospitals saying they would stop work from Wednesday to push for Ms Suu Kyi's release. Some medics are resorting to wearing symbols in silent protest. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At least one doctor has quit in protest, saying ""such coups cannot be tolerated at all"". Dr Naing Htoo Aung, a 47-year-old anaesthesiologist at Mongywa Hospital in Sagaing Region, told BBC Burmese: ""I resigned because I couldn't work under a military dictator who did not care about the country and the people. This is the best response I can give to them."" A soldier standing guard outside a temple in Yangon One 25-year-old resident, who asked not to be named, told the BBC: ""Waking up to learn your world has been completely turned upside down overnight was not a new feeling, but a feeling that I thought that we had moved on from, and one that I never thought we'd be forced to feel again."" More than 100 MPs, who were blockaded in their accommodation by troops in the capital Nay Pyi Taw, have now been told they are free to leave, BBC Burmese has learned. Power has been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Eleven ministers and deputies, including those in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs, have been replaced. In the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing repeated that the takeover had been ""inevitable"" after the military made allegations of electoral fraud. By Nyein Chan Aye, BBC Burmese, Yangon This city of more than five million people is trying to get back to normal but has yet to digest the previous day's events. The streets are quieter than usual this morning and security forces are deployed at major points. Panic buying has stopped and telecommunications services are back. Private banks are resuming their services after temporarily closing down on Monday. Many people are withdrawing cash to brave the uncertain times ahead. In Nay Pyi Taw, troops with tanks and trucks still surround the country's parliament. It has been a bloodless coup so far, but the impact could be severe at a time of economic downturn amid the Covid pandemic. The political turmoil, with possible international sanctions and foreign investment now uncertain, has left people frustrated and angry. There have been no official statements on Ms Suu Kyi's exact whereabouts since she was detained in pre-dawn raids on Monday. But unnamed sources from within the NLD have said both she and President Win Myint were being held under house arrest. ""We were informed not to worry. However we are worrying. It would be a relief if we could see photos of them at home,"" the MP told news agency AFP, on condition of anonymity. Many of the other detained lawmakers are also still held in their government housing in the capital, with one member of the NLD describing it as ""an open-air detention centre"". Ms Suu Kyi - who spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010 - has urged her supporters to ""protest against the coup"" in a letter written before she was detained. It warned the military's actions would put the country back under a dictatorship. She was barred from becoming president because she has children born to a foreign national. But since the NLD's decisive election victory in 2015 she has been widely seen as de facto leader. How the military disrupted the internet Who is the general behind the coup? This video can not be played Myanmar coup: What's happened so far? Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in south-east Asia which shares borders with India, China and Thailand, among others. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011. Nearly all expressions of dissent were banned and accusations of severe human rights abuses led to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. Her party won again by a landslide in the 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more. US President Joe Biden has threatened to reinstate sanctions on Myanmar. He said the military should not ""overrule the will of the people,external"". Along with the US, the United Nations, the UK and the EU have also condemned the military takeover. The US had removed sanctions over the past decade as Myanmar progressed towards democracy. Sanctions could theoretically be imposed on large companies linked to the military that deal in gems, clothing and have banking interests. They may also target individual generals. Other options include cutting aid, but there are concerns this could unfairly affect the wider population. Protests against the coup have been held outside Myanmar's embassies around the world It is unclear though how much effect the US warnings will have. The coup leaders will have expected sanctions and factored those into their plans. Toe Zaw Latt, Myanmar bureau chief of the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), a non-profit news organisation based outside of Myanmar, told the BBC that the military will know sanctions are an unavoidable consequence of their actions, adding that ""they don't care about Western sanctions"" and are more concerned ""about how China, Japan, South Korea respond"". Who is pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi? What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis ""The country enjoys Chinese protection and South East Asian markets,"" Myanmar expert Elliott Prasse-Freeman of the National University of Singapore explains. ""Hence I expect them to react to sanctions with a shrug, the price paid for reasserting power and assuaging the humiliation of losing to their democratic enemies in two consecutive elections."" China, which has previously opposed international intervention in Myanmar, urged all sides in the country to ""resolve differences"". China's Xinhua news agency described the changes as a ""cabinet reshuffle"". Other countries in the region, including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, have said it is an ""internal matter"".

The general behind Myanmar's coup,"The 64-year-old general has spent his entire career in the influential military Min Aung Hlaing rose steadily through the ranks of the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's powerful military, but as commander-in-chief for the past decade he also wielded significant political influence before the 1 February coup. He successfully maintained the Tatmadaw's power even as Myanmar transitioned to democracy, but received international condemnation and sanctions for his alleged role in the military's attacks of ethnic minorities. As Myanmar returns to military rule under his leadership, Min Aung Hlaing now looks set to extend his power and shape the country's immediate future. Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi The 64-year-old general has spent his entire career in the influential military, which he joined as a cadet. A former law student at Yangon University, he entered the Defence Services Academy on his third attempt in 1974. The relatively unassuming infantryman kept getting regular promotions and moved up the ladder, eventually becoming commander of the Bureau of Special Operations-2 in 2009. Myanmar has the second-largest army in South East Asia In this role, he oversaw operations in north-eastern Myanmar, which led to tens of thousands of ethnic minority refugees fleeing the eastern Shan province and the Kokang region, along the Chinese border. Despite allegations of murder, rape and arson against his troops, Min Aung Hlaing continued to rise and in August 2010 he became joint chief of staff. Less than a year later, he was tapped for the military's top post ahead of more senior generals, succeeding long-time leader Than Shwe as commander-in-chief in March 2011. When Min Aung Hlaing became military chief, blogger and writer Hla Oo - who said they had known each other in childhood - described him as ""a battle-hardened warrior of brutal Burmese Army"", but also called him a ""serious scholar and gentleman"". Min Aung Hlaing began his tenure as military chief as Myanmar transitioned to democracy in 2011 after decades of military rule, but remained keen on maintaining the Tatmadaw's power. His political influence and social media presence increased as the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) led the government. In 2016, when Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) came to power, he seemingly adapted to the change by working and appearing at public events with her. Min Aung Hlaing was once happy to work with Aung San Suu Kyi Despite the change, he ensured the Tatmadaw continued to hold 25% of parliamentary seats and crucial security-related cabinet portfolios, while resisting the NLD's attempts to amend the constitution and limit military power. In 2016 and 2017, the military intensified a crackdown on the Rohingya ethnic minority in the northern Rakhine state, leading to many Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar. The military chief was condemned internationally for the alleged ""genocide"", and in August 2018 the UN Human Rights Council said: ""Myanmar's top military generals, including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States."" Following the council's statement, Facebook deleted his account, along with those of other individuals and organisations who it said had ""committed or enabled serious human rights abuses in the country"". The US sanctioned him twice - in 2019 for his alleged role in ""ethnic cleansing"" and human rights violations, and in July 2020 the UK also imposed sanctions on him. The November 2020 general election saw a landslide win for the NLD, according to official figures, but in subsequent months the Tatmadaw and military-backed USDP repeatedly disputed the results. The USDP made allegations of widespread electoral fraud. Those claims were dismissed by the election commission ahead of a planned parliament session on 1 February to confirm the new government. Speculation of a coup grew amid the stand-off between the government and the armed forces. On 27 January Min Aung Hlaing warned that ""the constitution shall be abolished, if not followed"", citing example of previous military coups in 1962 and 1988. His office seemingly reversed this stance by 30 January, saying that the media had misinterpreted military officials' words about abolishing the constitution.
