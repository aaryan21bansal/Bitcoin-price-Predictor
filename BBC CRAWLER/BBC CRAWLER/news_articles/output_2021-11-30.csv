"Boy, six, 'knew his dad was going to kill him'","The court previously heard Arthur Labinjo-Hughes appeared to be drained and weak on the days before he died A six-year-old boy was fearful his father would kill him months before his death, a court has heard. Thomas Hughes and partner Emma Tustin are on trial accused of murdering his son Arthur Labinjo-Hughes last June. In a closing speech at Coventry Crown Court, Ms Tustin's defence said the boy was routinely assaulted by Mr Hughes at their Solihull home and had told others his ""dad was going to kill him"". Both of the accused, who deny murder, also face child cruelty allegations. Emma Tustin and Thomas Hughes are both charged with murdering his son Arthur died after sustaining an ""unsurvivable"" head injury on 16 June 2020 while in the sole care of Ms Tustin at her home on Cranmore Road in Shirley, Solihull. Despite medical evidence suggesting there was no way Arthur could have self-inflicted his fatal injuries, Ms Tustin, 32, maintained she was not responsible. She haspleaded guilty to two counts of child crueltywhich accused her of intimidation and assaults. She denies a third count alleging she poisoned Arthur with salt-laced drinks and meals. Representing her, Mary Prior told the court ""she let that little boy suffer and she accepts that, and she will pay a heavy price for that"". Arthur was fatally injured at Ms Tustin's home on Cranmore Road in Shirley Closing her case, Ms Prior said the defendant had been painted as manipulative. She said Arthur had been struggling after his biological mother was jailed for a killing in 2019, and was said to be anxious, clingy and experiencing nightmares. Ms Prior added Mr Hughes, 29, ignored advice from doctors and Arthur's school not to punish him and to treat him with kindness and understanding but he did not share this advice with Ms Tustin. Since he was five - before Mr Hughes and Ms Tustin struck up a relationship - Arthur had expressed concerns his father was going to kill him, Ms Prior told the court. She said the boy had expressed this to his wider family, his doctor and his school ""for well over a year and nobody listened"". The court previously heard Mr Hughes made a number of threats towards his son, including to ""put him six feet under"", and had also sent Ms Tustin messages such as ""just end him"". CCTV captured Arthur sleeping downstairs in the living room Although he was not present for the alleged fatal assault on Arthur, prosecutors argue Mr Hughes is equally culpable as he ""encouraged"" violence against his son, as well as dealing out beatings himself. Mr Hughes faces the same child cruelty counts as his co-defendant. Despite his not-guilty pleas, his counsel said he was ""not suggesting for a second he's anything other than guilty"" for the counts relating to intimidation and assault. His defence argued Ms Tustin carried out assaults on Arthur in secret from Mr Hughes; assaults which escalated towards the end of Arthur's life. Bernard Richmond told jurors Ms Tustin was ""a predator"" and Arthur her prey, ""because he had something she wanted - Thomas Hughes"". He said she drove a wedge between Mr Hughes and Arthur and would ""bombard"" him with messages about the child's alleged behaviour. Mr Richmond said Mr Hughes was ""stupid"" but not a murderer. There was ""nothing to suggest"" he had given Ms Tustin permission to harm his son, Mr Richmond added. The trial continues.

Booster offer for England's adults by end of January,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he wanted to increase vaccination capacity across the UK Covid booster jabs will be offered to everyone in England who is eligible by the end of January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Mr Johnson said the government would be ""throwing everything"" at the campaign so everyone can get a third jab. People will be invited to book a booster three months after their second vaccine dose. The rollout was expanded in response to the emerging Omicron variant, which could be more infectious than Delta. A total of 22 cases of the new variant have so far been confirmed in the UK - 13 in England and nine cases inScotland linked to a single event. The prime minister said booster doses will be given at 1,500 community pharmacy sites and extra hospital hubs in England. He added 400 military personnel will be on hand to help the NHS alongside ""the fantastic jabs army of volunteers"". ""There'll be temporary vaccination centres popping up like Christmas trees,"" he told a Downing Street press conference. When can I get my booster jab? What Covid rules are being toughened? Where do I have to wear a mask now? Earlier, Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency - the body which replaced Public Health England - suggested people should limit unnecessary socialising in the run-up to Christmas, saying: ""If we all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the variant at bay"". But the prime minister disagreed, saying government guidance remains the same - but that people should ""take sensible precautions"" like washing hands and wearing masks. Asked whether people should cancel Christmas parties and nativity plays, Mr Johnson said: ""We don't want people to cancel such events, and we think that overwhelmingly the best thing for kids is to be in schools."" He said instead, they were taking a ""balanced and proportionate"" approach, and while he thought it extremely unlikely that another lockdown would be required, he was ruling nothing out. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said getting vaccinated would ""give ourselves the best chance of a Christmas with our loved ones"". Boris Johnson later made a speech at a festive food and drink market being held in Downing Street Almost 18 million people in the UK have already had a booster jab. A further 14 million more adults have now become eligible for one in England alone, Mr Johnson said. On Monday, the government's vaccines advisers saidboosters would be offered to all over-18sin the UK with the minimum gap between the second dose and booster reduced from six to three months. Mr Johnson urged people to wait to be contacted by the health service before booking their booster, saying: ""Even if you have had your second jab over three months ago and you are now eligible, please don't try and book until the NHS says it is your turn."" Jabs will be prioritised according to age, with the NHS working down the list in five-year bands as before, he said. As well as expanding the booster jabs programme, the government has strengthened other Covid rules in response to concern over the new variant. Face coverings are once again compulsory in places like shops and on public transport in England, and contacts of suspected Omicron cases are now required to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status. And as of Tuesday morning, anyone coming to the UK must self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test, taken within 48 hours of arrival. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the measures, but said he had written to the prime minister urging him to ""go further"" by introducing ""vital"" testing for everyone before they travel. He said: ""They need urgently to put that additional measure in place... a PCR test is not a substitute for a pre-departure test."" The end of January target is ambitious, but certainly achievable. Crucially there is plentiful supply of vaccines - the challenge is increasing the rate at which the NHS can give jabs. Currently just over two million booster doses a week are being given in England. At that rate it would take until the start of spring to vaccinate all eligible adults. The PM can only set these targets for England but ministers in devolved nations have also committed to ramping up boosters The challenge therefore is to get up to the levels of vaccination seen in the spring when around four million doses a week were being administered. Some of the infrastructure that was in place in those early days has been dismantled. Many GPs and their teams have returned to their day jobs. A third of the mass vaccination centres have closed. Pharmacies have stepped in to offer more jabs, but they are constrained in how many they can do by lack of staff. Extra support for them will be vital. So will the hospital vaccination sites - there's more than 200 of them but only 30 currently vaccinate members of the public. NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said she was aiming to free up capacity to allow hospitals, GP surgeries and pharmacies to give more booster jabs. She said NHS staff were working at ""breakneck speed"" to expand the vaccine programme, which was already at its ""most complex phase"" and now faced the biggest change to eligibility so far. Northern Ireland has announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Scotland and Wales have said their booster programmes will be ramped up, but are yet to lay out the full details. A further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday, while another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.

Epstein pilot testifies that he flew Prince Andrew,"Mr Visoski flew for Epstein for over 25 years Paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein's long-time pilot has testified at the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell that he flew VIPs to luxury locations worldwide. Larry Visoski, the first witness in Ms Maxwell's sex-trafficking trial, recalled flying Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Kevin Spacey. Ms Maxwell denies the charges and says she is being used as a scapegoat for Epstein, who died in prison in 2019. But prosecutors argue the pair were ""partners in crime"" in sex abuse. Testimony given in court on Tuesday included harrowing details of the alleged abuse. Ms Maxwell has been in a US jail since her arrest last year, and faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted. Prosecutors say the British socialite, who also has US and French citizenship, recruited and groomed underage girls for her long-term companion Epstein to abuse. Asked to describe Ms Maxwell's standing in Epstein's operations, Mr Visoski described her as ""the number two"". ""Epstein was the big number one,"" he told the New York court on Tuesday. Mr Visoski served as Epstein's pilot for over 25 years. During his testimony, prosecutors showed the jurors photographs of Epstein's properties. He testified that he had never seen any sexual activity during trips, although the cockpit door was always kept closed during flights on the plane nicknamed the ""Lolita Express"". He also recalled flying Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who says she was sexually assaulted by Prince Andrew. The Queen's 61-year-old second son has consistently denied the allegation. Asked if he remembered Ms Giuffre, Mr Visoski said: ""Yes. A shorter woman with dirty blonde hair. She didn't look young. I mean, whatever you decipher is the definition of young. But she was a woman in my category."" What are the accusations against Prince Andrew? Asked to describe Ms Maxwell's relationship to Epstein he said it was ""more personal than business"". ""I wouldn't characterise it as romantic,"" he added. Another woman testifying under the pseudonym ""Jane"" told the court that Ms Maxwell had frequently been in the room with her when she had sexual relations with Epstein while just 14 years old. Jane told the court she had met Epstein and Ms Maxwell while attending summer camp in Michigan 1994. He was introduced to her as a wealthy donor who offered scholarships to pupils. Epstein had promised to fund her education but instead abused her, prosecutors said. She testified that her father had died one year earlier from cancer and her family was struggling financially at the time. In graphic detail, she described her alleged abuse and said that Ms Maxwell, who she said was present for much of it, was ""very casual"" about the encounters. Jane said that Ms Maxwell would talk to her about sex, and that she soon began visiting Epstein's home every week or two. She said she was first sexually abused when they were having a discussion about her future. She said that Epstein led her from his office to his pool house, then pulled down his pants and started masturbating. ""I was frozen in fear, I had never seen a penis before,"" the witness said. ""I was terrified and felt gross and like I felt ashamed."" It was not long after that she was first sexually abused by Ms Maxwell, she testified, saying it took place at Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida. Jane said that the defendant and Epstein had her follow them to his bedroom. They took their clothes off and ""started sort of fondling each other and kind of casually giggling"", she said. ""I was just standing there and he asked me to take my top off and then their hands [were] everywhere and Jeffrey proceeded to masturbate and Ghislaine was rubbing him and kissing him and fondling,"" she continued. She added that she travelled with Epstein and Ms Maxwell about 10 times, mainly between his homes in New York and New Mexico while she was between the ages of 14 and 16. Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Panorama: The Prince and the Epstein Scandal Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Jane also described ""orgies"" with other participants, and described feeling pain during the alleged encounters. Both Epstein and Ms Maxwell would brag about their connections, including the famous people that they knew, she said. Jane is the first of four accusers expected to testify at trial. Ms Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sex trafficking and other crimes. The allegations at trial cover the period 1994 to 2004. Prosecutors allege Ms Maxwell was a ""right-hand"" partner for Epstein, helping to groom vulnerable teenage girls as young as 14 for abuse at his luxurious residences. They described her as ""the lady of the house"" who ""helped normalise abusive sexual conduct"".

"Frustration mounts as thousands still without powerOne couple in their 80s say they feel ""completely abandoned"" as they enter their fifth day without power.Scotland","Engineers have continued efforts to restore power Thousands of people in Scotland still have no power in their homes after Storm Arwen caused ""catastrophic"" damage to the electricity network. Residents in parts of the rural north-east of Scotland, Perthshire, Angus and southern and central Scotland are still awaiting reconnection. Some have told BBC Scotland they are struggling to get reliable updates from their energy providers. One man in his 80s said he and his wife felt ""completely abandoned"". Energy provider SSEN said that as of 21:00 on Tuesday,power had been returned to more than 118,000 customers, but 9,500 remained without,external, with Aberdeenshire remaining the worst affected. Scottish Power Energy Networks - which covers the southern part of the country - said it expected 1,000 properties to be without power overnight in the Borders after reconnecting about 1,000 Borders homes on Tuesday, along with 300 in Dumfries and Galloway. The energy firms have apologised to those affected. Power lines were brought down by trees, including in Ballater Further bad news came as the Met Office advised there was a risk of potential for wet, cold and windy conditions over the next 24 hours, including northerly winds of up to 60mph. It said damage could occur where trees and property had been destabilised by the winds during Storm Arwen. Sepa has also warned of the potential for high tides and overtopping on the east coast at high tide - around midday on Wednesday. The flood barriers in Eyemouth will be deployed as a result. Nicola Sturgeon tweeted on Tuesday afternoon saying those facing the ""almost intolerable"" situation would receive help as soon as possible. Allow Twitter content?

Kirsten Bax, who lives near Thornhill in Dumfries and Galloway, said it was the worst incident she could remember. ""We live in the country, we quite often get power cuts over the winter and it is usually one night or two nights,"" she said. ""This is now the fourth night and it is the worst I have ever had and I have been living here for 30 years, it is ridiculous. ""You can't get in touch with Scottish Power, or SP Energy Networks - on the fault line you get an answering machine or something. ""You can't speak to a person to actually say what is going on on the ground."" Lena Rose said it was the worst she could remember Lena Rose, 70, from Sauchen in Aberdeenshire, said: ""We've been here 40 years, it's never been as bad as this. Now it's six nights coming up. ""We've got the coal fire and camping stove, so we can boil water and keep ourselves warm. We're just living in the living room, you can't have a shower. It's frustrating."" Thousands spend fourth night without power 'We can't go another night without power' Brian Allanson, who lives near Lockerbie, said he was originally told power would return at 16:00 on Saturday but it has been repeatedly put back. ""You can't speak to a human being, the broadband's down here, we can't get any information, we are absolutely isolated,"" he said. ""My wife and I - we are both in our mid 80s - we feel as though we have just been completely abandoned."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Aberdeenshire, all 170 schools remained closed on Tuesday as safety was assessed. Rest centres were open again in Banff, Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Stonehaven, Ellon, Inverurie, Westhill, Portlethen, Huntly and Turriff. Jane Grieve, who lives in Kincardine O'Neil, told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandher power went off just before 18:00 on Friday. ""We found an old phone in our garage and plugged it into the wall, managed two calls and then it dropped out. We could have been on Mars,"" she said. ""A lot of people lost their water as well. We were lucky at least we had water. ""We went to bed four times in freezing cold, wearing a hat, pairs of socks, large jumper. ""We occasionally get power cuts, I think this has been the longest in my life. This is on a new scale. Hundreds of trees have gone over. It's felt a wee bit like Armageddon."" This was the scene in the Dunecht area on Tuesday SSEN said it always endeavoured to give accurate times to customers so they could plan and prepare. ""Given the extreme nature of Storm Arwen and the extensive damage to the electricity it has been difficult for us to give these estimates with real clarity and we'd like to apologise to customers who have seen their times pushed out,"" the firm said. ""As we work to restore the remaining homes without power, we now have a clearer picture of what we need to deal with and the restoration times provided now are as accurate as they can be."" It said Friday's storm had caused ""catastrophic damage"", three times greater than that caused by the Beast from the East in 2018 SP Energy Networks said its staff were working ""tirelessly"" to reconnect power quickly and safely. ""We apologise to all of our customers who have continued to have been affected by the damage caused by Storm Arwen, we understand the stress and inconvenience this has caused many households and we appreciate everyone's patience whilst we continue to try to resolve the ongoing issues on the power network,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Storm Arwen has caused some of the worst damage we have experienced in over 15 years and far worse than the previous weather events. In many areas, the damage has been severe due to fallen trees and other wind-blown debris and engineers are also dealing road closures and access challenges making some of our repairs even harder. ""We are offering affected customers hot food and drinks and hotels for anyone who needs this and have fitted generators to customers most in need. We have also been visiting customers to support where individual needs are being identified. Please rest assured we are doing everything we can to reconnect those still off supply as quickly and as safely as we can."" Deputy First Minister John Swinney updated the Scottish Parliament on the government's response to the storm. He said: ""To give a sense of the scale of his event, Storm Arwen has been a more significant event than the Beast from the East in 2018, requiring a complexity of response that we have not seen for a number of years."" He added: ""My expectation is that most of the remaining customers' supply will be restored today. ""But I regret, for some of the more complex cases, supply is unlikely to be restored until later in the week."" Mr Swinney added that a full review of the preparations made for the storm would be undertaken in a bid to learn any lessons from the way it was handled.

Dutch release Omicron quarantine couple,"Carolina Pimenta and her partner are now waiting to be released from a tuberculosis hospital A couple who were moved into forced isolation in a Dutch hospital after they walked out of a Covid-19 hotel have been told they can now leave. Carolina Pimenta tested positive for Covid-19 after landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on a flight from South Africa on Friday. She was arrested by military police on Sunday night on a plane about to take off for Spain. The couple have now been told prosecutors have decided not to pursue the case. Ms Pimenta and her partner AndrÃ©s Sanz were among 624 passengers who arrived in Amsterdam from South Africa hours after a Dutch ban on flights came into force linked to the discovery of the Omicron variant. Sixty-one of those travellers tested positive for Covid-19, and further sequencing has found at least 14 of them are carrying the new strain. It has since emerged that the new variant was present in the Netherlands even earlier than thought, in samples taken on 19 and 23 November. For AndrÃ©s Sanz and his girlfriend the holiday trip turned sour on their return to Europe Carolina, a Portuguese bio-chemical researcher who turns 28 in a few days, was among the 61 who tested positive, while her Spanish partner was negative. She had already had a negative PCR test before the flight. They wanted to stay together so both were transferred into quarantine at the Ramada Hotel, a 10-minute drive from the terminal. But Carolina was convinced she had returned a false-positive so she asked local health authority staff for another test. How can I tell I have Omicron? Omicron variant in Netherlands earlier than thought Fearing impact of new variant measures She told the BBC that staff from the local health authority, on duty in a room near the hotel reception, had suggested her partner borrow a bike and cycle to the supermarket to buy a lateral flow antigen test. As a close contact of a person who recently tested positive he was supposed to be isolating too. The couple allege they showed the negative results to Dutch police and local health team on site, insisting they were told, ""If I were you I would go."" They then caught a taxi back to the airport and used negative PCR tests they took before boarding their flight from South Africa to get on a plane to Spain. North Holland police spokesman Willem Gijtenbeek told the BBC that until that specific point they had had no jurisdiction to hold or detain anyone for breaking quarantine. ""However, when the couple left the hotel, the head of Kennermerland security area took legal measures because of the threat to public health and ordered their mandatory isolation,"" he explained. The local Kennemerland health authority denied the couple had been given permission to leave the hotel. The problem, a spokesperson said, was that quarantine was voluntary but the couple still had a responsibility to remain in isolation. When the passengers arrived from South Africa they were held for several hours for Covid tests After the couple left the hotel, the local mayor of Haarlemmermeer, Marianne Schuurmans, arranged for the couple to be held under an emergency order, and that changed the status of their quarantine to enforced. Military police promptly boarded the plane and arrested Carolina. ""It's shameful as a Dutch person to see how they have been treated,"" Bart Maes, the couple's lawyer, told the BBC. The Netherlands imposed an extended partial lockdown at the weekend and is one of several European countries struggling to contain record numbers of coronavirus infections. Faced with a shortage of intensive care beds, the government has imposed a 17:00 closure of bars, restaurants and most shops. But Mr Maes, who has also campaigned against the Dutch Corona vaccine passport, believes everyone involved in the couple's case should be ashamed. ""It's bureaucracy all over, no-one knows what anyone else is doing, everyone is blaming everyone else."" Mr Sanz has not tested positive. Other than the positive test on arrival, Carolina Pimenta has taken two PCR tests and two antigen tests, all of which returned negative. The couple were moved to a tuberculosis hospital in the northern town of Haren, where they were told they had to remain in quarantine until five days after Carolina's positive PCR test at Schiphol on Friday. ""We went on a dream holiday in Africa and now we are living a nightmare. We are watching the world say we are criminals with a story that is just a lie,"" she complained. Their lawyer told the BBC on Tuesday evening that the hospital had told him they were were being released. The case had been handed to the public prosecutor, who had decided not to seek an extension to their isolation, he explained. ""We're free!"" Carolina Pimenta said in a message to the BBC. They would now travel to the Spanish consulate ahead of being flown on to Spain, her lawyer told the BBC. To him it's absurd that, for someone suspected of being a super-spreader, the researcher is left to mix in a room with hundreds of passengers and then moved all over the country, meeting consular staff and lawyers.

Greece to fine over-60s who refuse Covid vaccine,"Greece will be the first country in the EU to target a specific age group Greece is to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for people aged 60 and over. Fines of â¬100 (Â£85) will be imposed at monthly intervals from mid-January on those who refuse, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said. The money will go towards the Greek health system, which is struggling with a surge in hospital admissions. About 63% of Greece's 11-million population is fully vaccinated, but data show more than 520,000 people over 60 are yet to get the jab. ""Greeks over the age of 60... must book their appointment for a first jab by January 16,"" the premier said in a statement to the cabinet. ""Their vaccination is henceforth compulsory."" The measure is still to be put to a parliamentary vote, he said, but lawmakers are widely expected to approve it. While countries have made vaccines mandatory for health workers and other high-risk workers, Greece will become the first in the EU to target a specific age group. Austria has announced that compulsory Covid vaccinations will start in February. Syriza, Greece's main opposition party, called the new measures punitive and financially excessive. Mr Mitsotakis said the decision had ""tortured"" him but he felt a ""heavy responsibility in standing next to those most vulnerable, even if it might fleetingly displease them"".

Some supermarkets will not enforce mask wearing,"The Co-op has become the latest supermarket chain to say it will not enforce new mask wearing rules to avoid their staff being abused by customers. Mask rules were brought back in on Tuesday after concerns about the Omicron coronavirus variant. Supermarkets are taking a light touch approach with Tesco, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland not challenging customers. Industry body The British Retail Consortium said it is up to police to enforce face mask rules, not retailers. Co-op policy director Paul Gerrard told Radio 5 Live that while Co-op would put up signs to remind people to wear masks, staff would not refuse to serve customers who were not wearing one. ""We have seen throughout the pandemic that the enforcement of social distancing rules has been a flashpoint for enormous levels of violence and abuse against my colleagues, and we will not put our colleagues at risk,"" he said. There was a rise in violence towards shop workers before the pandemic, and that rise has continued, he said. ""It's not just the frequency, it's the violence and the seriousness of it,"" Mr Gerrard said. ""Every day, in the 2,600 Co-op shops, ten of my colleagues will be physically attacked."" ""Five of them will be attacked with a weapon - it could be a syringe, it could be a knife, it could be a hammer - and that's not unusual to the Co-op."" Tesco will just be putting signs up to remind customers about face mask rules, the BBC understands. Aldi and Lidl are also understood to have no plans for staff to challenge customers, although they will also be putting up posters. Where do you have to wear masks now? How are Covid rules being tightened? Sainsbury's said it will have ""greeters and security guards at the front of our supermarkets"" to remind people to wear masks. Morrisons is expected to have staff checking face mask wearing at the front of the shops, and hand out masks to customers that have forgotten them. Asda has also said it will hand out masks to customers who have forgotten to bring them. Iceland boss Richard Walker told the BBC's Radio Four Today programme on Tuesday that it supported the reintroduction of face masks, but said it would be unfair to ask staff to confront people not wearing masks. ""They are already working under significant pressure, especially as we hit the busiest trading month of the year."" ""I won't be putting my staff at any risk of confrontation or abuse,"" he said. Mr Walker said in the first lockdown from March to May last year, incidents of verbal abuse dropped from more than 50 incidents a week to five a week after staff were told not to challenge customers. From Tuesday, in England face coverings must now be worn in shops, shopping centres, in transport hubs and on public transport,according to government guidance,external. There are different rules inNorthern Ireland,external,Scotland,externalandWales,external, but they are broadly similar. In England, theDepartment for Transport said,externalpeople should wear face coverings in ""crowded and enclosed areas where you come into contact with people you do not usually meet"". People who don't wear masks on public transport can get fined Â£200 and upwards,it tweeted,external. The National Police Chiefs' Council says police forces will ""continue to enforce coronavirus regulations where it is necessary to do so"" and will support transport and retail staff in ensuring people wear face coverings. Assistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill says officers will respond to incidents where ""individuals are violent or abusive towards staff or members of the public"" and will be more visible in towns and shopping centres. The BRC said in February this year that one retailer had reported that when reminding customers to shop alone, they were confronted and shouted at by an individual, who returned to the store later that afternoon ""brandishing an axe [and] â¦ threatening the store team with it"". A shopworker at another retailer asked a couple to put on face coverings. They left the store, only to return hours later when they began ""coughing on staff, insisting they had coronavirus, which made the staff feel distressed."" Another said staff had been ""threatened with a syringeâ¦ [because a shoplifter] was stealing cheese and said if I didn't get out of the way he would stab me."" Incidents of physical violence increased by two thirds at the time, the BRC said, with flashpoints mainly being around coronavirus rules.

No investigation into Cox over Commons office use,"This video can not be played Video shows Sir Geoffrey Cox's work for British Virgin Islands inquiry Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Cox says he will not be investigated over accusations he used his Commons office for legal work. MPs cannot use public resources, including parliamentary offices, for ""personal or financial benefit"". But the former Attorney General was pictured in September in a virtual meeting representing the British Virgin Islands government, from what appeared to be his Commons office. Labour had reported it to the Standards Commissioner. Sir Geoffrey said there would be no further action, confirming to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the Commissioner, Kathryn Stone, had declined to open an investigation. The BBC understand Ms Stone decided there was insufficient evidence to justify an inquiry, believing the rules on the use of parliamentary offices should be operated with ""a sense of proportion"". A spokeswoman for the commissioner said Ms Stone does not comment on the conduct of individual MPs outside the information published on her website and reports published at the end of an investigation.â¯ Cox under fire over office use for Caribbean work PM says MPs must be visible in constituencies Which MPs have second jobs? Sir Geoffrey came under fire for his work outside the Commons as a lawyer amid the row over MPs' second jobs,in light of the row over former MP Owen Paterson. The Register of Members' Interests showed the 61-year-old MP for Torridge and West Devon made almost Â£900,000 last year working as a barrister, including travelling to the British Virgin Islands during lockdown to advise its government on a corruption inquiry. A picture of him carrying out this work that emerged earlier this month appeared to show him in his Commons office, while a clip of the meeting also appeared to show him leave his desk after a division bell went off - a signal for MPs to go and vote. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said Sir Geoffrey appeared to be in ""brazen breach of the rules"" and called for an investigation. But a statement on behalf of Sir Geoffrey was posted on his website after, saying: ""He does not believe that he breached the rules but will of course accept the judgement of the Parliamentary Commissioner or of the Committee [on Public Standards] on the matter."" Sir Geoffrey has insisted he only participated in the inquiry from his office once. A wider argument broke out around second jobs over the following days, withLabour setting out plans to end all external work for MPs- unless it had a public service element. At the same time, the government saidit planned to ban MPs working as paid consultants or lobbyists, and won a vote in the Commons backing its proposals. But steps for implementing the recommendations were not set out. On Monday, the MPs' Standards Committeealso recommended a ban on providing paid parliamentary advice or consultancy services, among a broader overhaul of the code of conduct.

Mandatory masks: 'We worry people won't come in',"Sisters Katie Pitts and Karen Caton fear customers might not come into their shop if they have to put on a mask Face coverings have become mandatory again in shops and on public transport in England as a precaution against the new Omicron variant of coronavirus. But shopkeepers are concerned that this could have a serious impact on their businesses, at a time when violence and verbal abuse against retail and hospitality staff is at an all-time high. Here's what people in the sector had to say. Katie Pitts, co-owner of Leeds-based fashion boutique The Dressing Room, is worried that frustration over the pandemic might affect consumers' spending behaviour this Christmas. ""We've got a lot of lovely customers who have helped us through a tough time, but people are a bit frustrated,"" she says. ""We're a non-essential retailer, so if they don't feel like wearing a mask, they might not come in."" Although The Dressing Room has a website, 70% of all sales still come from footfall to the store, as customers prefer to try clothing on before they buy, says Ms Pitt. So far, no customers have declined to wear masks and Ms Pitts hopes it stays that way. ""It's not a discussion we want to have, it's not our rule, it's a rule we have to go by,"" she says. Where do you have to wear masks now? Nigel Bourne has had to ask people to leave his shop because they refused to wear a mask Nigel Bourne, the owner of Sussex-based cookware retailer Rye Cookshop, tells the BBC face covering rules should ""never have gone out in the first place"". He says he wishes the government would ""be stronger on advertising"" how people should wear masks, having experienced some customers wearing them wrongly. The shop owner, based in Rye, East Sussex, says he hasn't had to call the police over people not wearing masks as no-one has been abusive. But he has had to ask people to leave his shop. ""It's hard work all the policing of it. We do it for ourselves and for other people. I do not want to work in a shop where people are not wearing their masks properly. ""If the law says you have got to wear it, wear it."" The guidance over how face coverings will be enforced in shops and on public transport will be set out in due course, the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC. The National Police Chiefs' Council says police forces will ""continue to enforce coronavirus regulations where it is necessary to do so"" and will support transport and retail staff in ensuring people wear face coverings. It is unclear whether penalties for those who refuse to wear masks without good reason will change. Previously, people faced a Â£200 fine which was reduced to Â£100 if paid within 14 days. The fine doubled for each subsequent offence and could go up to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. Assistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill says officers will respond to incidents where ""individuals are violent or abusive towards staff or members of the public"" and will be more visible in towns and shopping centres. According to theOffice for National Statistics,external, 85% of adults said they had worn a face covering outside their home in the past seven days, with 70% saying they wore one often or always while shopping. However, just 18% of people shopping said that everyone or almost everyone they saw was wearing a face covering. Supermarket chain Iceland says it will not be policing whether customers are wearing face masks. Iceland's managing director Richard Walker told the BBC's Today programme that while staff and customer safety was a priority, he did not want to put his staff at ""risk of confrontation or abuse"". ""I think over 90% of retail staff have been threatened, assaulted or abused in the last 12 months and we alone have had over 4,000 incidents of reported verbal abuse each year,"" he said. During the first coronavirus lockdown from March-May last year, the number of incidents rose to more than 50 incidents a week, he added. ""Since staff were told not to challenge customers, that figure dropped tenfold to five a week,"" said Mr Walker. ""So I think if the government want it to happen, they must step in to help businesses like us and police the wearing of masks."" While many consumers follow mask-wearing rules, violence and verbal abuse against retail workers is at an all-time high According to consumer expert Kate Hardcastle, business owners are particularly worried about experiencing abuse, particularly when it comes to enforcing social distancing rules. ""Small businesses say they have felt intimidated - one told me they feel they can't operate in their store by themselves. ""They feel they have to have another presence there as support, in case something happens."" Retailers are concerned about damaging the relationship with their customers, says Ms Hardcastle, at a time when they can't really afford for anything else to go wrong. ""Not only is it unpleasant to deal with, but a lot of shop owners are experiencing recruitment issues. It's not going to entice someone to go into a retail career if they have to cope with ongoing abuse,"" she says. But most of all, Ms Hardcastle says businesses are really ""terrified"" of being ordered by the government to close again. Rebecca Morter, chief executive of Lone Design Club, wants to avoid having to close her business again this Christmas Rebecca Morter, chief executive of sustainable fashion shop Lone Design Club, says she has encountered a couple of customers who don't want to follow Covid rules on masks and social distancing in the past. She agrees with Ms Hardcastle that retailers are most concerned about being forced to close again. ""Anything that helps prevent the new variant and keep the virus spreading is a good thing,"" she says. ""I understand that some people disagree, but we really, really don't want to go into another lockdown, so for us it's important that everyone follows the rules so we can stay open."" Manchester shopping mall the Trafford Centre told the BBC it would be deploying staff to hand out free masks and encouraging shoppers to wear face coverings unless they are exempt. Doug Russell, health and safety officer at shop workers' union Usdaw, says it is ""extremely regrettable"" that the government didn't keep existing rules on masks in place as the country reopened. Yet workers had no power to make customers wear them anyway, he adds, and that is unlikely to change this time. The fact the issue ""attracted so much aggression by a minority of people"" is a ""social bafflement"", adds Mr Russell. He says the new rules are inevitably going to lead to more ""clashes"" between shop workers and small groups of people who refuse to wear masks. ""Shop workers have been at the forefront all the way throughout the pandemic."" Shoppers asked to respect new mandatory mask rules Where do I still need to wear a mask?

As we near the end of our coverage, here's a quick reminder of today's main headlines:  A couple who were moved into forced isolation in a Dutch hospital after they walked out of a Covid-19 hotel have been told they can now leave. Carolina Pimenta tested positive for Covid-19 after landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on a flight from South Africa on Friday. She was arrested by military police on Sunday night on a plane about to take off for Spain. The couple have now been told prosecutors have decided not to pursue the case. Read the full story of what happened to them here. Some supermarkets in England say they won't be enforcing new face mask rules, instead they'll use a lighter touch. Icelandtells the BBC its staff will not ask customers to wear masks so they don't have to face abuse. Tesco, the largest UK supermarket chain, will just be putting up signs to remind customers about face mask rules, the BBC understands.

As we reported earlier, Greece is making vaccines mandatory for anyone aged 60 and over from next year, and those who do not comply will face a â¬100 (Â£85) fine each month until they do so. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis said it was predominantly those over 60 who died of Covid, and that only 60,000 of the more than 500,000 unvaccinated citizens in that age group had got their first jab this month. ""I have no doubt that this political decision will save human lives. Because vaccination becomes more than just compulsory. It saves lives. It is necessary for health. It is necessary for the whole society. ""The funds collected by the fines will be given to our hospitals. It is not a punishment. I would say it is a health fee. An incentive for precaution, a life boost.  And I think it is also an act of justice for the people who are vaccinated. It is not acceptable for some people to be deprived of the health services they need because others stubbornly refuse to do the obvious Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greek Prime Minister He also added he had been âtorturedâ by the decision, but that he felt âa heavy responsibilityâ towards the most vulnerable, âeven if it might fleetingly displease themâ. Minister Darragh O'Brien confirmed the new rules will initially last for two weeks Turning to developments outside of the UK now, the Irish government will require all international travellers to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test prior to their arrival in the country, regardless of their vaccination status. The country's Housing Minister, Darragh O'Brien, told reporters passengers will be required to have taken a
lab-conducted antigen test no more than 48 hours before
travelling or a PCR test within 72 hours of arrival. O'Brien said restrictions will initially apply for a two-week period. The rules will apply to travellers arriving from Great Britain, but not to those crossing the border with Northern Ireland. Ireland's Department of Transport is in discussions with airlines and ferry companies to ensure the tests are checked before people board flights or ferries to the country. The move follows the UK government's decision to exclude Ireland and other Common Travel Area countries from similar rules it implemented for international arrivals on Saturday. Ireland is currently examining 11 suspected cases of the Omicron variant. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said it is likely the
new variant is already present in the country. In Northern Ireland, Covid-19 vaccination hubs have opened to help meet demand for booster doses, the health minister says. Robin Swann says the aim is to ""bring booster doses to all eligible age groups as quickly as possible"". Northern Irelandhas had the lowest uptake of the booster shot in the UK. Swann is urging the public not to ""be put off getting their first, second or booster doses due toconcerns or speculation about the Omicron variant"". This video can not be played The BBC's Philippa Roxby and Ione Wells answer your questions on the new Covid variant. After the UK government's latest update on coronavirus and booster jabs, BBC health correspondent Philippa Roxby and political correspondent Ione Wells answer your questions. The UK's Covid booster vaccine programme is being expanded amid concerns about the new Omicron variant. The government has set a target to offer all eligible adults in England the chance to book a booster by the end of January. A second vaccine dose will be offered to children aged 12-15. When can I get my booster? When you are contacted will depend on your age and whether you are in an at-risk group. Vulnerable people will be contacted first, then over-40s and older people, then younger age groups. However, people are being asked not to contact the NHS about their booster jab, and wait to be invited. Across England, jabs will be rolled out at 1,500 community pharmacies, extra hospital hubs and pop-up vaccination sites. ScotlandandWaleshave yet to finalise details of how boosters will be given out. Northern Ireland has announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Read morehere. A further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday. The average number of daily confirmed cases has bounced around since mid-July and was rising again through November, but has dipped in recent days. Another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported. The number of daily deaths has been falling steadily through November. As weâve been
reporting, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is trying to establish where
exactly in the UK the Omicron variant is. It's confirmed 22 cases have been detected, but as we've been reporting, the variant is likely to be transmitting in the community, so that number will grow. Earlier, we told you the Local
Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said that two cases had been detected in
Nottingham. However, it has since clarified that the cityhas only one case on recordâ a student, who has been self-isolating since they were infected. Here's a breakdown of cases in England confirmed by the UKHSA: And as weâve also
reported,there are 9 cases in Scotland. Five are in Lanarkshire and four are in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. This video can not be played PM: All adults to be offered a Covid booster by end of January Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the government's target is for all adults to be offered a Covid booster by the end of January, with temporary vaccination centres to be opened up, as at other stages of the vaccine roll-out. Reality Check At the Downing Street briefing just now,
Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We've delivered more booster doses
than any other country, with the exception of the USA and China."" Heâs
right in terms of thetotal number of booster doses,externalgiven. China has given 66 million, the US
has given 40 million and the UK is in third place with 18 million, according to
Our World in Data. In terms of the number of booster
doses given per head of the population, the UK is in seventh place, behind
Gibraltar, Israel, Chile, Uruguay, Iceland and the United Arab Emirates â
according to the same organisation's figures. The Downing Street coronavirus briefing led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just wrapped up. He was joined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England. In case you missed it, here's a quick round-up of what we learned: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The target of offering booster jabs to all adults in England by the end of January (and that means giving them the opportunity to book jabs) is ambitious - but how achievable is it? Crucially we have the supply. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are going to come into the country and there will be enough to vaccinate the eligible adult population. But at the moment, the NHS is not vaccinating at the rate it needs to if it is going to hit that target. Currently it is doing about 2.5m boosters a week, so that would take until the end of February to reach all adults in England. The PM acknowledged it's got to get back up to the levels seen in the spring - when more than 4m doses a week were being given. A third of the mass vaccination centres that were in place then have closed and GPs are back doing their day to day work. But what we've seen is pharmacies step up and we've heard about the military and other people coming in to help them. There are about 30 hospitals currently vaccinating the public - but around 200 that could be opened up to do that too. If they manage to do all that and do it quickly, then the end of January is achievable. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The advice from the prime minister was clear - donât cancel
your Christmas plans, and do get your booster. He defended the governmentâs reluctance to move to Plan B - which would involve advising people in England to work from
home if they can (as they are advised to do in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland). The leader of the lockdown-resistant Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs â
the former chief whip Mark Harper â says he gives the government ""credit"" for
this. But note, Boris Johnson refused to rule this out completely. The best he could promise, choosing his words carefully, was
this: ""The kind of lockdown we had before is extremely unlikely."" It would seem that further restrictions will be dependent
more on the progress of the pandemic than on politics. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The UK has bought hundreds of thousands of doses of a powerful antiviral drug that can treat Covid. The treatment,molnupiravir,could help those who are most at risk of getting severely ill if they catch the virus. In trials, the twice daily pills cut the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. The therapy works in a different way to current vaccines and should be very effective even against new variants, such as Omicron. A question now from Bloomberg on working from home - and why England is out of kilter with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson says this is not something the government thinks is necessary - it has a package of measures to deal with the Delta variant and they've been working. He says the reason for not implementing Plan B - a contingency to protect the NHS which includes guidance to work from home - is in order to take an approach that is ""proportionate and balanced"". He will change things as necessary, but is looking for reassurance that vaccines are effective against Omicron. And the PM ends the briefing with a mention of Storm Arwen, saying how sympathetic he is to people in the million or so homes that have lost electricity - and assuring those still without power that the government is doing what it can to restore it. Next, the PM is asked if he can reassure businesses that are worried about another so-called ""pingdemic"". Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe, from the Financial Times, says the government has ruled out a ""Plan B"" to tackle Covid, but can the PM confirm contingency measures like working from home won't be taken if there's a surge? Johnson says he does not think a return to the ""pingdemic"" of July is likely to happen (where people were alerted to contact with Covid cases) because the numbers of cases of Omicron are small. But that will have to stay under review.

As we near the end of our coverage, here's a quick reminder of today's main headlines:  A couple who were moved into forced isolation in a Dutch hospital after they walked out of a Covid-19 hotel have been told they can now leave. Carolina Pimenta tested positive for Covid-19 after landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on a flight from South Africa on Friday. She was arrested by military police on Sunday night on a plane about to take off for Spain. The couple have now been told prosecutors have decided not to pursue the case. Read the full story of what happened to them here. Some supermarkets in England say they won't be enforcing new face mask rules, instead they'll use a lighter touch. Icelandtells the BBC its staff will not ask customers to wear masks so they don't have to face abuse. Tesco, the largest UK supermarket chain, will just be putting up signs to remind customers about face mask rules, the BBC understands. AldiandLidlare also understood to have no plans to challenge customers. Sainsbury'ssays it will have ""greeters and security guards at the front of our supermarkets"" to remind people to wear masks. Morrisonsis expected to have staff checking mask wearing at the front of the shops, and will hand out masks to customers that have forgotten them. Asdaalso says it will hand out masks to shoppers who are without one. You can read morehere. As we reported earlier, Greece is making vaccines mandatory for anyone aged 60 and over from next year, and those who do not comply will face a â¬100 (Â£85) fine each month until they do so. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis said it was predominantly those over 60 who died of Covid, and that only 60,000 of the more than 500,000 unvaccinated citizens in that age group had got their first jab this month. ""I have no doubt that this political decision will save human lives. Because vaccination becomes more than just compulsory. It saves lives. It is necessary for health. It is necessary for the whole society. ""The funds collected by the fines will be given to our hospitals. It is not a punishment. I would say it is a health fee. An incentive for precaution, a life boost.  And I think it is also an act of justice for the people who are vaccinated. It is not acceptable for some people to be deprived of the health services they need because others stubbornly refuse to do the obvious Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greek Prime Minister He also added he had been âtorturedâ by the decision, but that he felt âa heavy responsibilityâ towards the most vulnerable, âeven if it might fleetingly displease themâ. Minister Darragh O'Brien confirmed the new rules will initially last for two weeks Turning to developments outside of the UK now, the Irish government will require all international travellers to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test prior to their arrival in the country, regardless of their vaccination status. The country's Housing Minister, Darragh O'Brien, told reporters passengers will be required to have taken a
lab-conducted antigen test no more than 48 hours before
travelling or a PCR test within 72 hours of arrival. O'Brien said restrictions will initially apply for a two-week period. The rules will apply to travellers arriving from Great Britain, but not to those crossing the border with Northern Ireland. Ireland's Department of Transport is in discussions with airlines and ferry companies to ensure the tests are checked before people board flights or ferries to the country. The move follows the UK government's decision to exclude Ireland and other Common Travel Area countries from similar rules it implemented for international arrivals on Saturday. Ireland is currently examining 11 suspected cases of the Omicron variant. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said it is likely the
new variant is already present in the country. In Northern Ireland, Covid-19 vaccination hubs have opened to help meet demand for booster doses, the health minister says. Robin Swann says the aim is to ""bring booster doses to all eligible age groups as quickly as possible"". Northern Irelandhas had the lowest uptake of the booster shot in the UK. Swann is urging the public not to ""be put off getting their first, second or booster doses due toconcerns or speculation about the Omicron variant"". This video can not be played The BBC's Philippa Roxby and Ione Wells answer your questions on the new Covid variant. After the UK government's latest update on coronavirus and booster jabs, BBC health correspondent Philippa Roxby and political correspondent Ione Wells answer your questions. The UK's Covid booster vaccine programme is being expanded amid concerns about the new Omicron variant. The government has set a target to offer all eligible adults in England the chance to book a booster by the end of January. A second vaccine dose will be offered to children aged 12-15. When can I get my booster? When you are contacted will depend on your age and whether you are in an at-risk group. Vulnerable people will be contacted first, then over-40s and older people, then younger age groups. However, people are being asked not to contact the NHS about their booster jab, and wait to be invited. Across England, jabs will be rolled out at 1,500 community pharmacies, extra hospital hubs and pop-up vaccination sites. ScotlandandWaleshave yet to finalise details of how boosters will be given out. Northern Ireland has announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Read morehere. A further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday. The average number of daily confirmed cases has bounced around since mid-July and was rising again through November, but has dipped in recent days. Another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported. The number of daily deaths has been falling steadily through November. As weâve been
reporting, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is trying to establish where
exactly in the UK the Omicron variant is. It's confirmed 22 cases have been detected, but as we've been reporting, the variant is likely to be transmitting in the community, so that number will grow. Earlier, we told you the Local
Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said that two cases had been detected in
Nottingham. However, it has since clarified that the cityhas only one case on recordâ a student, who has been self-isolating since they were infected. Here's a breakdown of cases in England confirmed by the UKHSA: And as weâve also
reported,there are 9 cases in Scotland. Five are in Lanarkshire and four are in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. This video can not be played PM: All adults to be offered a Covid booster by end of January Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the government's target is for all adults to be offered a Covid booster by the end of January, with temporary vaccination centres to be opened up, as at other stages of the vaccine roll-out. Reality Check At the Downing Street briefing just now,
Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We've delivered more booster doses
than any other country, with the exception of the USA and China."" Heâs
right in terms of thetotal number of booster doses,externalgiven. China has given 66 million, the US
has given 40 million and the UK is in third place with 18 million, according to
Our World in Data. In terms of the number of booster
doses given per head of the population, the UK is in seventh place, behind
Gibraltar, Israel, Chile, Uruguay, Iceland and the United Arab Emirates â
according to the same organisation's figures. The Downing Street coronavirus briefing led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just wrapped up. He was joined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England. In case you missed it, here's a quick round-up of what we learned: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The target of offering booster jabs to all adults in England by the end of January (and that means giving them the opportunity to book jabs) is ambitious - but how achievable is it? Crucially we have the supply. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are going to come into the country and there will be enough to vaccinate the eligible adult population. But at the moment, the NHS is not vaccinating at the rate it needs to if it is going to hit that target. Currently it is doing about 2.5m boosters a week, so that would take until the end of February to reach all adults in England. The PM acknowledged it's got to get back up to the levels seen in the spring - when more than 4m doses a week were being given. A third of the mass vaccination centres that were in place then have closed and GPs are back doing their day to day work. But what we've seen is pharmacies step up and we've heard about the military and other people coming in to help them. There are about 30 hospitals currently vaccinating the public - but around 200 that could be opened up to do that too. If they manage to do all that and do it quickly, then the end of January is achievable. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The advice from the prime minister was clear - donât cancel
your Christmas plans, and do get your booster. He defended the governmentâs reluctance to move to Plan B - which would involve advising people in England to work from
home if they can (as they are advised to do in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland). The leader of the lockdown-resistant Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs â
the former chief whip Mark Harper â says he gives the government ""credit"" for
this. But note, Boris Johnson refused to rule this out completely. The best he could promise, choosing his words carefully, was
this: ""The kind of lockdown we had before is extremely unlikely."" It would seem that further restrictions will be dependent
more on the progress of the pandemic than on politics. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The UK has bought hundreds of thousands of doses of a powerful antiviral drug that can treat Covid. The treatment,molnupiravir,could help those who are most at risk of getting severely ill if they catch the virus. In trials, the twice daily pills cut the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. The therapy works in a different way to current vaccines and should be very effective even against new variants, such as Omicron. A question now from Bloomberg on working from home - and why England is out of kilter with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson says this is not something the government thinks is necessary - it has a package of measures to deal with the Delta variant and they've been working. He says the reason for not implementing Plan B - a contingency to protect the NHS which includes guidance to work from home - is in order to take an approach that is ""proportionate and balanced"". He will change things as necessary, but is looking for reassurance that vaccines are effective against Omicron. And the PM ends the briefing with a mention of Storm Arwen, saying how sympathetic he is to people in the million or so homes that have lost electricity - and assuring those still without power that the government is doing what it can to restore it. Next, the PM is asked if he can reassure businesses that are worried about another so-called ""pingdemic"". Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe, from the Financial Times, says the government has ruled out a ""Plan B"" to tackle Covid, but can the PM confirm contingency measures like working from home won't be taken if there's a surge? Johnson says he does not think a return to the ""pingdemic"" of July is likely to happen (where people were alerted to contact with Covid cases) because the numbers of cases of Omicron are small. But that will have to stay under review. ""We haven't ruled out anything, I think another lockdown of the kind we've had before is extremely unlikely but we keep everything under constant review,"" he says. On local lockdown measures he says: ""We've settled pretty much on the view that moving together is the way to do it."" Is there community transmission of the new Omicron variant in the UK, the Daily Mail's Jason Groves asks Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Javid replies that they are ""not able to say"" at the moment, but it's likely. Boris Johnson is asked whether he would encourage people who are already scrapping school Nativity plays and Christmas parties in response to the government's new rules to ""think again"".

"Booster offer for England's adults by end of JanuaryBoris Johnson promises to ""throw everything"" at the expanded jab rollout to beat the Omicron variant.","This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he wanted to increase vaccination capacity across the UK Covid booster jabs will be offered to everyone in England who is eligible by the end of January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Mr Johnson said the government would be ""throwing everything"" at the campaign so everyone can get a third jab. People will be invited to book a booster three months after their second vaccine dose. The rollout was expanded in response to the emerging Omicron variant, which could be more infectious than Delta. A total of 22 cases of the new variant have so far been confirmed in the UK - 13 in England and nine cases inScotland linked to a single event. The prime minister said booster doses will be given at 1,500 community pharmacy sites and extra hospital hubs in England. He added 400 military personnel will be on hand to help the NHS alongside ""the fantastic jabs army of volunteers"". ""There'll be temporary vaccination centres popping up like Christmas trees,"" he told a Downing Street press conference. When can I get my booster jab? What Covid rules are being toughened? Where do I have to wear a mask now? Earlier, Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency - the body which replaced Public Health England - suggested people should limit unnecessary socialising in the run-up to Christmas, saying: ""If we all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the variant at bay"". But the prime minister disagreed, saying government guidance remains the same - but that people should ""take sensible precautions"" like washing hands and wearing masks. Asked whether people should cancel Christmas parties and nativity plays, Mr Johnson said: ""We don't want people to cancel such events, and we think that overwhelmingly the best thing for kids is to be in schools."" He said instead, they were taking a ""balanced and proportionate"" approach, and while he thought it extremely unlikely that another lockdown would be required, he was ruling nothing out. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said getting vaccinated would ""give ourselves the best chance of a Christmas with our loved ones"". Boris Johnson later made a speech at a festive food and drink market being held in Downing Street Almost 18 million people in the UK have already had a booster jab. A further 14 million more adults have now become eligible for one in England alone, Mr Johnson said. On Monday, the government's vaccines advisers saidboosters would be offered to all over-18sin the UK with the minimum gap between the second dose and booster reduced from six to three months. Mr Johnson urged people to wait to be contacted by the health service before booking their booster, saying: ""Even if you have had your second jab over three months ago and you are now eligible, please don't try and book until the NHS says it is your turn."" Jabs will be prioritised according to age, with the NHS working down the list in five-year bands as before, he said. As well as expanding the booster jabs programme, the government has strengthened other Covid rules in response to concern over the new variant. Face coverings are once again compulsory in places like shops and on public transport in England, and contacts of suspected Omicron cases are now required to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status. And as of Tuesday morning, anyone coming to the UK must self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test, taken within 48 hours of arrival. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the measures, but said he had written to the prime minister urging him to ""go further"" by introducing ""vital"" testing for everyone before they travel. He said: ""They need urgently to put that additional measure in place... a PCR test is not a substitute for a pre-departure test."" The end of January target is ambitious, but certainly achievable. Crucially there is plentiful supply of vaccines - the challenge is increasing the rate at which the NHS can give jabs. Currently just over two million booster doses a week are being given in England. At that rate it would take until the start of spring to vaccinate all eligible adults. The PM can only set these targets for England but ministers in devolved nations have also committed to ramping up boosters The challenge therefore is to get up to the levels of vaccination seen in the spring when around four million doses a week were being administered. Some of the infrastructure that was in place in those early days has been dismantled. Many GPs and their teams have returned to their day jobs. A third of the mass vaccination centres have closed. Pharmacies have stepped in to offer more jabs, but they are constrained in how many they can do by lack of staff. Extra support for them will be vital. So will the hospital vaccination sites - there's more than 200 of them but only 30 currently vaccinate members of the public. NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said she was aiming to free up capacity to allow hospitals, GP surgeries and pharmacies to give more booster jabs. She said NHS staff were working at ""breakneck speed"" to expand the vaccine programme, which was already at its ""most complex phase"" and now faced the biggest change to eligibility so far. Northern Ireland has announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Scotland and Wales have said their booster programmes will be ramped up, but are yet to lay out the full details. A further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday, while another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.

Escaped couple fight Omicron quarantine in TB ward,"Carolina Pimenta and her partner are now waiting to be released from a tuberculosis hospital A couple who were moved into forced isolation in a Dutch hospital after they walked out of a Covid-19 hotel have been told they can now leave. Carolina Pimenta tested positive for Covid-19 after landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on a flight from South Africa on Friday. She was arrested by military police on Sunday night on a plane about to take off for Spain. The couple have now been told prosecutors have decided not to pursue the case. Ms Pimenta and her partner AndrÃ©s Sanz were among 624 passengers who arrived in Amsterdam from South Africa hours after a Dutch ban on flights came into force linked to the discovery of the Omicron variant. Sixty-one of those travellers tested positive for Covid-19, and further sequencing has found at least 14 of them are carrying the new strain. It has since emerged that the new variant was present in the Netherlands even earlier than thought, in samples taken on 19 and 23 November. For AndrÃ©s Sanz and his girlfriend the holiday trip turned sour on their return to Europe Carolina, a Portuguese bio-chemical researcher who turns 28 in a few days, was among the 61 who tested positive, while her Spanish partner was negative. She had already had a negative PCR test before the flight. They wanted to stay together so both were transferred into quarantine at the Ramada Hotel, a 10-minute drive from the terminal. But Carolina was convinced she had returned a false-positive so she asked local health authority staff for another test. How can I tell I have Omicron? Omicron variant in Netherlands earlier than thought Fearing impact of new variant measures She told the BBC that staff from the local health authority, on duty in a room near the hotel reception, had suggested her partner borrow a bike and cycle to the supermarket to buy a lateral flow antigen test. As a close contact of a person who recently tested positive he was supposed to be isolating too. The couple allege they showed the negative results to Dutch police and local health team on site, insisting they were told, ""If I were you I would go."" They then caught a taxi back to the airport and used negative PCR tests they took before boarding their flight from South Africa to get on a plane to Spain. North Holland police spokesman Willem Gijtenbeek told the BBC that until that specific point they had had no jurisdiction to hold or detain anyone for breaking quarantine. ""However, when the couple left the hotel, the head of Kennermerland security area took legal measures because of the threat to public health and ordered their mandatory isolation,"" he explained. The local Kennemerland health authority denied the couple had been given permission to leave the hotel. The problem, a spokesperson said, was that quarantine was voluntary but the couple still had a responsibility to remain in isolation. When the passengers arrived from South Africa they were held for several hours for Covid tests After the couple left the hotel, the local mayor of Haarlemmermeer, Marianne Schuurmans, arranged for the couple to be held under an emergency order, and that changed the status of their quarantine to enforced. Military police promptly boarded the plane and arrested Carolina. ""It's shameful as a Dutch person to see how they have been treated,"" Bart Maes, the couple's lawyer, told the BBC. The Netherlands imposed an extended partial lockdown at the weekend and is one of several European countries struggling to contain record numbers of coronavirus infections. Faced with a shortage of intensive care beds, the government has imposed a 17:00 closure of bars, restaurants and most shops. But Mr Maes, who has also campaigned against the Dutch Corona vaccine passport, believes everyone involved in the couple's case should be ashamed. ""It's bureaucracy all over, no-one knows what anyone else is doing, everyone is blaming everyone else."" Mr Sanz has not tested positive. Other than the positive test on arrival, Carolina Pimenta has taken two PCR tests and two antigen tests, all of which returned negative. The couple were moved to a tuberculosis hospital in the northern town of Haren, where they were told they had to remain in quarantine until five days after Carolina's positive PCR test at Schiphol on Friday. ""We went on a dream holiday in Africa and now we are living a nightmare. We are watching the world say we are criminals with a story that is just a lie,"" she complained. Their lawyer told the BBC on Tuesday evening that the hospital had told him they were were being released. The case had been handed to the public prosecutor, who had decided not to seek an extension to their isolation, he explained. ""We're free!"" Carolina Pimenta said in a message to the BBC. They would now travel to the Spanish consulate ahead of being flown on to Spain, her lawyer told the BBC. To him it's absurd that, for someone suspected of being a super-spreader, the researcher is left to mix in a room with hundreds of passengers and then moved all over the country, meeting consular staff and lawyers.

Global markets fall after Moderna Omicron warningStock markets slide after Moderna boss casts doubt on vaccine effectiveness against new variant.BusinessComments,"Stock markets around the world have fallen after the boss of Moderna cast doubts on the effectiveness of vaccines against the new Omicron Covid variant. Stephane Banceltold the Financial Times,externalhe thought there would be a ""material drop"" in vaccine efficacy. The Covid variant was first detected in South Africa, and thesymptoms have been mild so far. But travel restrictions have been imposed as a precaution by placesincluding the UK, the EU and the US. Mr Bancel predicted that existing vaccines would be less effective in staving off Omicron, and that it would take months for drugs companies to update vaccines. ""There is no world, I think, where [the effectiveness] is the same level,"" he said. In the US, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broader S&P 500 share indexes closed 1.9% lower. The tech-focused Nasdaq lost 1.6%. The falls also follow remarks by the chairman of the Federal Reserve suggesting that the emergence of the new variant would worsen uncertainty around the economic recovery and inflation. In response to a question, Mr Powell also said it was time to retire the term ""transitory"" which he has used to describe recent high rates of inflation. The Federal Reserve should consider tapering bond purchases more quickly, the first step towards raising interest rates, he added. The US market falls followed similar declines in Europe and Asia. The UK'sFTSE 100share index, Germany'sDax, and France'sCac 40slipped more than 1.5% each before regaining ground, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 lost 1.5%, hitting its lowest level in nearly seven weeks. Tokyo's Nikkei index closed down 1.6%, crude oil prices fell nearly 3%, and the Australian dollar hit a one-year low. Omicron pauses the return to economic normality How can I tell I have Omicron? There was also a scramble for assets that are considered to be safer in times of uncertainty, such as gold, German government bonds, and the yen. ""It's not good news, and it's coming from someone who should know,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency strategist Joe Capurso. ""Markets have reacted in exactly the way you'd expect them to."" Markets plunged on Friday after investors were rattled by the discovery of the new variant, with the FTSE 100 indexsuffering its biggest drop in more than a year. Stock markets rebounded slightly on Monday, but are still far below last week's levels. However, both the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250, which is more focused on UK firms, are still substantially higher than this time last year - up about 8.3% and 9.6% respectively. Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms or falls owing to coronavirus or the financial crisis. There are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances. There are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Timing is more critical for those at retirement age, as this may be when a retiree uses their pension pot to buy a retirement income, or annuity. The bigger the pot, the more income they will get in retirement. Read more here. Uncertainty about the new variant has triggered global alarm, with border measures casting a shadow over the economic recovery from the Covid pandemic that has been taking place. It comes asinfections rise again in some European countries. However, European Medicines Agency (EMA) executive director Emer Cooke told the European Parliament that even if the new variant becomes more widespread, existing vaccines should continue to provide protection. Andrea Ammon, who chairs the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC), said 42 cases of the variant had been confirmed in 10 EU countries. There were another six ""probable"" cases. She said the cases were mild or without symptoms, although in younger age groups. The science may still be uncertain but the Omicron variant has definitively intruded upon recent stock market euphoria. The designation as a variant of concern last week, and then further comments this morning from vaccine makers that existing vaccines will not be as effective, has caused widespread and significant falls in share prices. So what will the economic effect be? It should be limited and that is mainly because it's clear that the UK Government and the US Government will do everything to avoid any further lockdowns. The world awaits the health data from hospitals, first from South Africa's outbreak, and then elsewhere, about its transmissibility and severity. The new restrictions announced here in the UK and around the world reflect real time science, and in particular an expectation that the variant takes some bricks out of the wall of vaccine immunity. That in and of itself will have some economic impact. In the UK, real time data from restaurant reservations and online job adverts were well above the equivalent day last year. Retail footfall was just 8% below the equivalent day in 2019. Things were beginning to get back to normal, even with a considerable number of Delta cases, and a steady stream of weekly deaths. Omicron has paused some of this process, merely by injecting a doubt that the pandemic is behind us. Read more from Faisal here The World Health Organization has said it could take weeks to determine how severe Omicron infections could be, and how much protection current vaccines give. The University of Oxford said there was no evidence that current vaccines would not prevent severe disease from Omicron, but that it was ready to rapidly develop an updated version of its shot with AstraZeneca, if that is necessary. Moderna and fellow drugs firms BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson are working on vaccines that specifically target Omicron in case existing shots are not effective against it. Moderna has also been testing a higher dose of its existing booster.

"Frustration mounts as thousands still without powerOne couple in their 80s say they feel ""completely abandoned"" as they enter their fifth day without power.","Engineers have continued efforts to restore power Thousands of people in Scotland still have no power in their homes after Storm Arwen caused ""catastrophic"" damage to the electricity network. Residents in parts of the rural north-east of Scotland, Perthshire, Angus and southern and central Scotland are still awaiting reconnection. Some have told BBC Scotland they are struggling to get reliable updates from their energy providers. One man in his 80s said he and his wife felt ""completely abandoned"". Energy provider SSEN said that as of 21:00 on Tuesday,power had been returned to more than 118,000 customers, but 9,500 remained without,external, with Aberdeenshire remaining the worst affected. Scottish Power Energy Networks - which covers the southern part of the country - said it expected 1,000 properties to be without power overnight in the Borders after reconnecting about 1,000 Borders homes on Tuesday, along with 300 in Dumfries and Galloway. The energy firms have apologised to those affected. Power lines were brought down by trees, including in Ballater Further bad news came as the Met Office advised there was a risk of potential for wet, cold and windy conditions over the next 24 hours, including northerly winds of up to 60mph. It said damage could occur where trees and property had been destabilised by the winds during Storm Arwen. Sepa has also warned of the potential for high tides and overtopping on the east coast at high tide - around midday on Wednesday. The flood barriers in Eyemouth will be deployed as a result. Nicola Sturgeon tweeted on Tuesday afternoon saying those facing the ""almost intolerable"" situation would receive help as soon as possible. Allow Twitter content?

Deputy First Minister John Swinney updated the Scottish Parliament on the government's response to the storm. He said: ""To give a sense of the scale of his event, Storm Arwen has been a more significant event than the Beast from the East in 2018, requiring a complexity of response that we have not seen for a number of years."" He added: ""My expectation is that most of the remaining customers' supply will be restored today. ""But I regret, for some of the more complex cases, supply is unlikely to be restored until later in the week."" Mr Swinney added that a full review of the preparations made for the storm would be undertaken in a bid to learn any lessons from the way it was handled.

Global markets fall after Moderna Omicron warning,"Stock markets around the world have fallen after the boss of Moderna cast doubts on the effectiveness of vaccines against the new Omicron Covid variant. Stephane Banceltold the Financial Times,externalhe thought there would be a ""material drop"" in vaccine efficacy. The Covid variant was first detected in South Africa, and thesymptoms have been mild so far. But travel restrictions have been imposed as a precaution by placesincluding the UK, the EU and the US. Mr Bancel predicted that existing vaccines would be less effective in staving off Omicron, and that it would take months for drugs companies to update vaccines. ""There is no world, I think, where [the effectiveness] is the same level,"" he said. In the US, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broader S&P 500 share indexes closed 1.9% lower. The tech-focused Nasdaq lost 1.6%. The falls also follow remarks by the chairman of the Federal Reserve suggesting that the emergence of the new variant would worsen uncertainty around the economic recovery and inflation. In response to a question, Mr Powell also said it was time to retire the term ""transitory"" which he has used to describe recent high rates of inflation. The Federal Reserve should consider tapering bond purchases more quickly, the first step towards raising interest rates, he added. The US market falls followed similar declines in Europe and Asia. The UK'sFTSE 100share index, Germany'sDax, and France'sCac 40slipped more than 1.5% each before regaining ground, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 lost 1.5%, hitting its lowest level in nearly seven weeks. Tokyo's Nikkei index closed down 1.6%, crude oil prices fell nearly 3%, and the Australian dollar hit a one-year low. Omicron pauses the return to economic normality How can I tell I have Omicron? There was also a scramble for assets that are considered to be safer in times of uncertainty, such as gold, German government bonds, and the yen. ""It's not good news, and it's coming from someone who should know,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency strategist Joe Capurso. ""Markets have reacted in exactly the way you'd expect them to."" Markets plunged on Friday after investors were rattled by the discovery of the new variant, with the FTSE 100 indexsuffering its biggest drop in more than a year. Stock markets rebounded slightly on Monday, but are still far below last week's levels. However, both the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250, which is more focused on UK firms, are still substantially higher than this time last year - up about 8.3% and 9.6% respectively. Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms or falls owing to coronavirus or the financial crisis. There are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances. There are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Timing is more critical for those at retirement age, as this may be when a retiree uses their pension pot to buy a retirement income, or annuity. The bigger the pot, the more income they will get in retirement. Read more here. Uncertainty about the new variant has triggered global alarm, with border measures casting a shadow over the economic recovery from the Covid pandemic that has been taking place. It comes asinfections rise again in some European countries. However, European Medicines Agency (EMA) executive director Emer Cooke told the European Parliament that even if the new variant becomes more widespread, existing vaccines should continue to provide protection. Andrea Ammon, who chairs the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC), said 42 cases of the variant had been confirmed in 10 EU countries. There were another six ""probable"" cases. She said the cases were mild or without symptoms, although in younger age groups. The science may still be uncertain but the Omicron variant has definitively intruded upon recent stock market euphoria. The designation as a variant of concern last week, and then further comments this morning from vaccine makers that existing vaccines will not be as effective, has caused widespread and significant falls in share prices. So what will the economic effect be? It should be limited and that is mainly because it's clear that the UK Government and the US Government will do everything to avoid any further lockdowns. The world awaits the health data from hospitals, first from South Africa's outbreak, and then elsewhere, about its transmissibility and severity. The new restrictions announced here in the UK and around the world reflect real time science, and in particular an expectation that the variant takes some bricks out of the wall of vaccine immunity. That in and of itself will have some economic impact. In the UK, real time data from restaurant reservations and online job adverts were well above the equivalent day last year. Retail footfall was just 8% below the equivalent day in 2019. Things were beginning to get back to normal, even with a considerable number of Delta cases, and a steady stream of weekly deaths. Omicron has paused some of this process, merely by injecting a doubt that the pandemic is behind us. Read more from Faisal here The World Health Organization has said it could take weeks to determine how severe Omicron infections could be, and how much protection current vaccines give. The University of Oxford said there was no evidence that current vaccines would not prevent severe disease from Omicron, but that it was ready to rapidly develop an updated version of its shot with AstraZeneca, if that is necessary. Moderna and fellow drugs firms BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson are working on vaccines that specifically target Omicron in case existing shots are not effective against it. Moderna has also been testing a higher dose of its existing booster.

We'll throw everything at booster campaign - PM,"This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister says new Covid rules are not a massive overhaul to general life The UK ""will throw everything"" at the expanded booster jab rollout in the wake of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, Boris Johnson has said. But the PM insisted there was no need to change the overall guidance on ""how people should be living their lives"". Earlier Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, said people should not socialise ""when we don't particularly need to"". Meanwhile masks must now be wornin shops and public transportin England. A total of 22 cases of the new coronavirus variant have so far been confirmed in the UK. Thirteen are in England - in the East Midlands, the east of England, London and the North West. Nine cases are in Scotland and all appear to have come from a single event on 20 November, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. South Africa was the first country to identify the new variant, and reported it to the World Health Organization on 24 November. What Covid rules are being toughened? How worrying is the new Covid variant? How do you detect Omicron? Speaking outside a vaccine centre in north London earlier today, Mr Johnson said it is ""overwhelmingly likely"" booster jabs can give a ""lot of protection against all types of the virus"", adding it is crucial for everybody to get the additional dose when eligible. He added: ""We've no doubt at all that the NHS, all the volunteers, the Army, everybody can rise to the challenge. Is it going to be hard work? Yes it is, but I know people can do it."" Booster jabs areto be offered to all over-18s in the UKand children aged 12 to 15 will be invited for a second jab, as part of a major expansion of the vaccine programme. At a No 10 press conference the prime minister announced that the aim is to offer all adults in England over 18 a booster jab by the end of January 2022, with people becoming eligible for a booster at least three months after their second dose. That means 14 million more adults have now become eligible for a booster in England alone, Mr Johnson said. Jabs will be rolled out at 1,500 community pharmacy sites and extra hospital hubs in England and some 400 military personnel will work with the ""jabs army of volunteers"", he announced. People arriving in the UK from abroad will also now have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. Earlier Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency - the body which replaced Public Health England - suggested people should reduce social contacts in the run up to Christmas. When asked about her comments, the prime minister said she was right and people should continue to take ""normal precautions"", but said a change in the guidance wasn't necessary ""We don't see anything to suggest that we need to go, for instance, to Plan B,"" he said, referring to tougher curbs in England. However, Mr Johnson added taking ""particular precautions"" against Omicron were needed until experts know ""exactly what kind of a threat it may present"". Some Conservative backbench MPs questioned Dr Harries' advice during a debate on face masks in the House of Commons, with some asking on whose authority she was speaking given her suggestion was not government policy. Meanwhile, Wales' health minister Eluned Morgan saidpeople should take the ""threat"" of socialising indoors with others at Christmas seriously. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading The new rules on face coverings bring England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where they are already mandatory on public transport and for many indoor areas. Newly-published guidance,externalsays they should be worn in locations including shops, shopping centres, posts offices, banks, hairdressers and food takeaways, as well as on public transport. Although the change does not require people in England to wear coverings in pubs and restaurants,they are required in hospitality venues elsewhere in the UK in some circumstances. Police in England say they will work ""in partnership with relevant business owners and their staff"" to ensure people comply with the new face coverings rules. As a last resort people can be fined Â£200, reduced to Â£100 if paid within 14 days. Another change, which has already come into effect, requires all contacts of suspected Omicron cases to self-isolate for 10 days, even if they are fully vaccinated.

Booster jabs for all adults by end of January - PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he wanted to increase vaccination capacity across the UK Covid booster jabs will be offered to everyone in England who is eligible by the end of January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Mr Johnson said the government would be ""throwing everything"" at the campaign so everyone can get a third jab. People will be invited to book a booster three months after their second vaccine dose. The rollout was expanded in response to the emerging Omicron variant, which could be more infectious than Delta. A total of 22 cases of the new variant have so far been confirmed in the UK - 13 in England and nine cases inScotland linked to a single event. The prime minister said booster doses will be given at 1,500 community pharmacy sites and extra hospital hubs in England. He added 400 military personnel will be on hand to help the NHS alongside ""the fantastic jabs army of volunteers"". ""There'll be temporary vaccination centres popping up like Christmas trees,"" he told a Downing Street press conference. When can I get my booster jab? What Covid rules are being toughened?

Earlier, Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency - the body which replaced Public Health England - suggested people should limit unnecessary socialising in the run-up to Christmas, saying: ""If we all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the variant at bay"". But the prime minister disagreed, saying government guidance remains the same - but that people should ""take sensible precautions"" like washing hands and wearing masks. Asked whether people should cancel Christmas parties and nativity plays, Mr Johnson said: ""We don't want people to cancel such events, and we think that overwhelmingly the best thing for kids is to be in schools."" He said instead, they were taking a ""balanced and proportionate"" approach, and while he thought it extremely unlikely that another lockdown would be required, he was ruling nothing out. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said getting vaccinated would ""give ourselves the best chance of a Christmas with our loved ones"". Boris Johnson later made a speech at a festive food and drink market being held in Downing Street Almost 18 million people in the UK have already had a booster jab. A further 14 million more adults have now become eligible for one in England alone, Mr Johnson said. On Monday, the government's vaccines advisers saidboosters would be offered to all over-18sin the UK with the minimum gap between the second dose and booster reduced from six to three months. Mr Johnson urged people to wait to be contacted by the health service before booking their booster, saying: ""Even if you have had your second jab over three months ago and you are now eligible, please don't try and book until the NHS says it is your turn."" Jabs will be prioritised according to age, with the NHS working down the list in five-year bands as before, he said. As well as expanding the booster jabs programme, the government has strengthened other Covid rules in response to concern over the new variant. Face coverings are once again compulsory in places like shops and on public transport in England, and contacts of suspected Omicron cases are now required to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status. And as of Tuesday morning, anyone coming to the UK must self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test, taken within 48 hours of arrival. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the measures, but said he had written to the prime minister urging him to ""go further"" by introducing ""vital"" testing for everyone before they travel. He said: ""They need urgently to put that additional measure in place... a PCR test is not a substitute for a pre-departure test."" The end of January target is ambitious, but certainly achievable. Crucially there is plentiful supply of vaccines - the challenge is increasing the rate at which the NHS can give jabs. Currently just over two million booster doses a week are being given in England. At that rate it would take until the start of spring to vaccinate all eligible adults. The PM can only set these targets for England but ministers in devolved nations have also committed to ramping up boosters The challenge therefore is to get up to the levels of vaccination seen in the spring when around four million doses a week were being administered. Some of the infrastructure that was in place in those early days has been dismantled. Many GPs and their teams have returned to their day jobs. A third of the mass vaccination centres have closed. Pharmacies have stepped in to offer more jabs, but they are constrained in how many they can do by lack of staff. Extra support for them will be vital. So will the hospital vaccination sites - there's more than 200 of them but only 30 currently vaccinate members of the public. NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said she was aiming to free up capacity to allow hospitals, GP surgeries and pharmacies to give more booster jabs. She said NHS staff were working at ""breakneck speed"" to expand the vaccine programme, which was already at its ""most complex phase"" and now faced the biggest change to eligibility so far. Northern Ireland has announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Scotland and Wales have said their booster programmes will be ramped up, but are yet to lay out the full details. A further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday, while another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.

It was edited by James Clarke and Claire Heald, with Kevin Ponniah at the helm. We'll be back for more tomorrow - hope you can join us again. As we near the end of our coverage, here's a quick reminder of today's main headlines:  A couple who were moved into forced isolation in a Dutch hospital after they walked out of a Covid-19 hotel have been told they can now leave. Carolina Pimenta tested positive for Covid-19 after landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on a flight from South Africa on Friday. She was arrested by military police on Sunday night on a plane about to take off for Spain. The couple have now been told prosecutors have decided not to pursue the case. Read the full story of what happened to them here. Some supermarkets in England say they won't be enforcing new face mask rules, instead they'll use a lighter touch. Icelandtells the BBC its staff will not ask customers to wear masks so they don't have to face abuse. Tesco, the largest UK supermarket chain, will just be putting up signs to remind customers about face mask rules, the BBC understands. AldiandLidlare also understood to have no plans to challenge customers. Sainsbury'ssays it will have ""greeters and security guards at the front of our supermarkets"" to remind people to wear masks. Morrisonsis expected to have staff checking mask wearing at the front of the shops, and will hand out masks to customers that have forgotten them. Asdaalso says it will hand out masks to shoppers who are without one. You can read morehere. As we reported earlier, Greece is making vaccines mandatory for anyone aged 60 and over from next year, and those who do not comply will face a â¬100 (Â£85) fine each month until they do so. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis said it was predominantly those over 60 who died of Covid, and that only 60,000 of the more than 500,000 unvaccinated citizens in that age group had got their first jab this month. ""I have no doubt that this political decision will save human lives. Because vaccination becomes more than just compulsory. It saves lives. It is necessary for health. It is necessary for the whole society. ""The funds collected by the fines will be given to our hospitals. It is not a punishment. I would say it is a health fee. An incentive for precaution, a life boost.  And I think it is also an act of justice for the people who are vaccinated. It is not acceptable for some people to be deprived of the health services they need because others stubbornly refuse to do the obvious Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greek Prime Minister He also added he had been âtorturedâ by the decision, but that he felt âa heavy responsibilityâ towards the most vulnerable, âeven if it might fleetingly displease themâ. Minister Darragh O'Brien confirmed the new rules will initially last for two weeks Turning to developments outside of the UK now, the Irish government will require all international travellers to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test prior to their arrival in the country, regardless of their vaccination status. The country's Housing Minister, Darragh O'Brien, told reporters passengers will be required to have taken a
lab-conducted antigen test no more than 48 hours before
travelling or a PCR test within 72 hours of arrival. O'Brien said restrictions will initially apply for a two-week period. The rules will apply to travellers arriving from Great Britain, but not to those crossing the border with Northern Ireland. Ireland's Department of Transport is in discussions with airlines and ferry companies to ensure the tests are checked before people board flights or ferries to the country. The move follows the UK government's decision to exclude Ireland and other Common Travel Area countries from similar rules it implemented for international arrivals on Saturday. Ireland is currently examining 11 suspected cases of the Omicron variant. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said it is likely the
new variant is already present in the country. In Northern Ireland, Covid-19 vaccination hubs have opened to help meet demand for booster doses, the health minister says. Robin Swann says the aim is to ""bring booster doses to all eligible age groups as quickly as possible"". Northern Irelandhas had the lowest uptake of the booster shot in the UK. Swann is urging the public not to ""be put off getting their first, second or booster doses due toconcerns or speculation about the Omicron variant"". This video can not be played The BBC's Philippa Roxby and Ione Wells answer your questions on the new Covid variant. After the UK government's latest update on coronavirus and booster jabs, BBC health correspondent Philippa Roxby and political correspondent Ione Wells answer your questions. The UK's Covid booster vaccine programme is being expanded amid concerns about the new Omicron variant. The government has set a target to offer all eligible adults in England the chance to book a booster by the end of January. A second vaccine dose will be offered to children aged 12-15. When can I get my booster? When you are contacted will depend on your age and whether you are in an at-risk group. Vulnerable people will be contacted first, then over-40s and older people, then younger age groups. However, people are being asked not to contact the NHS about their booster jab, and wait to be invited. Across England, jabs will be rolled out at 1,500 community pharmacies, extra hospital hubs and pop-up vaccination sites. ScotlandandWaleshave yet to finalise details of how boosters will be given out. Northern Ireland has announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Read morehere. A further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday. The average number of daily confirmed cases has bounced around since mid-July and was rising again through November, but has dipped in recent days. Another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported. The number of daily deaths has been falling steadily through November. As weâve been
reporting, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is trying to establish where
exactly in the UK the Omicron variant is. It's confirmed 22 cases have been detected, but as we've been reporting, the variant is likely to be transmitting in the community, so that number will grow. Earlier, we told you the Local
Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said that two cases had been detected in
Nottingham. However, it has since clarified that the cityhas only one case on recordâ a student, who has been self-isolating since they were infected. Here's a breakdown of cases in England confirmed by the UKHSA: And as weâve also
reported,there are 9 cases in Scotland. Five are in Lanarkshire and four are in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. This video can not be played PM: All adults to be offered a Covid booster by end of January Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the government's target is for all adults to be offered a Covid booster by the end of January, with temporary vaccination centres to be opened up, as at other stages of the vaccine roll-out. Reality Check At the Downing Street briefing just now,
Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We've delivered more booster doses
than any other country, with the exception of the USA and China."" Heâs
right in terms of thetotal number of booster doses,externalgiven. China has given 66 million, the US
has given 40 million and the UK is in third place with 18 million, according to
Our World in Data. In terms of the number of booster
doses given per head of the population, the UK is in seventh place, behind
Gibraltar, Israel, Chile, Uruguay, Iceland and the United Arab Emirates â
according to the same organisation's figures. The Downing Street coronavirus briefing led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just wrapped up. He was joined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England. In case you missed it, here's a quick round-up of what we learned: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The target of offering booster jabs to all adults in England by the end of January (and that means giving them the opportunity to book jabs) is ambitious - but how achievable is it? Crucially we have the supply. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are going to come into the country and there will be enough to vaccinate the eligible adult population. But at the moment, the NHS is not vaccinating at the rate it needs to if it is going to hit that target. Currently it is doing about 2.5m boosters a week, so that would take until the end of February to reach all adults in England. The PM acknowledged it's got to get back up to the levels seen in the spring - when more than 4m doses a week were being given. A third of the mass vaccination centres that were in place then have closed and GPs are back doing their day to day work. But what we've seen is pharmacies step up and we've heard about the military and other people coming in to help them. There are about 30 hospitals currently vaccinating the public - but around 200 that could be opened up to do that too. If they manage to do all that and do it quickly, then the end of January is achievable. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The advice from the prime minister was clear - donât cancel
your Christmas plans, and do get your booster. He defended the governmentâs reluctance to move to Plan B - which would involve advising people in England to work from
home if they can (as they are advised to do in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland). The leader of the lockdown-resistant Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs â
the former chief whip Mark Harper â says he gives the government ""credit"" for
this. But note, Boris Johnson refused to rule this out completely. The best he could promise, choosing his words carefully, was
this: ""The kind of lockdown we had before is extremely unlikely."" It would seem that further restrictions will be dependent
more on the progress of the pandemic than on politics. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The UK has bought hundreds of thousands of doses of a powerful antiviral drug that can treat Covid. The treatment,molnupiravir,could help those who are most at risk of getting severely ill if they catch the virus. In trials, the twice daily pills cut the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. The therapy works in a different way to current vaccines and should be very effective even against new variants, such as Omicron. A question now from Bloomberg on working from home - and why England is out of kilter with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson says this is not something the government thinks is necessary - it has a package of measures to deal with the Delta variant and they've been working. He says the reason for not implementing Plan B - a contingency to protect the NHS which includes guidance to work from home - is in order to take an approach that is ""proportionate and balanced"". He will change things as necessary, but is looking for reassurance that vaccines are effective against Omicron. And the PM ends the briefing with a mention of Storm Arwen, saying how sympathetic he is to people in the million or so homes that have lost electricity - and assuring those still without power that the government is doing what it can to restore it. Next, the PM is asked if he can reassure businesses that are worried about another so-called ""pingdemic"". Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe, from the Financial Times, says the government has ruled out a ""Plan B"" to tackle Covid, but can the PM confirm contingency measures like working from home won't be taken if there's a surge? Johnson says he does not think a return to the ""pingdemic"" of July is likely to happen (where people were alerted to contact with Covid cases) because the numbers of cases of Omicron are small. But that will have to stay under review. ""We haven't ruled out anything, I think another lockdown of the kind we've had before is extremely unlikely but we keep everything under constant review,"" he says. On local lockdown measures he says: ""We've settled pretty much on the view that moving together is the way to do it."" Is there community transmission of the new Omicron variant in the UK, the Daily Mail's Jason Groves asks Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Javid replies that they are ""not able to say"" at the moment, but it's likely. Boris Johnson is asked whether he would encourage people who are already scrapping school Nativity plays and Christmas parties in response to the government's new rules to ""think again"". ""We don't want people to cancel such events,"" the prime minister replies - and the ""best place"" for children to be is in school. Â© 2025 BBC.

Speaking outside a vaccine centre in north London earlier today, Mr Johnson said it is ""overwhelmingly likely"" booster jabs can give a ""lot of protection against all types of the virus"", adding it is crucial for everybody to get the additional dose when eligible.

Booster jabs areto be offered to all over-18s in the UKand children aged 12 to 15 will be invited for a second jab, as part of a major expansion of the vaccine programme. At a No 10 press conference the prime minister announced that the aim is to offer all adults in England over 18 a booster jab by the end of January 2022, with people becoming eligible for a booster at least three months after their second dose. That means 14 million more adults have now become eligible for a booster in England alone, Mr Johnson said.

TSB to close another 70 branches by July,"TSB, which had 475 branches just over a year ago, has announced more closures which will leave it with just 220. Another 70 branches are to shut by the end of June, on top of a significant closure programme throughout this year. The bank said the Covid pandemic had accelerated customers' use of digital banking instead of branches. It said none of the sites due to close would be the last bank in town but unions have heavily criticised the plans. ""TSB axing a quarter of its branches in 2022, on top of the numbers already closed, is a bitter blow for many communities,"" said Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union. ""Unite has consistently argued that local banking and access to cash is essential especially for those on lower incomes."" About 150 staff will be affected by the closures, but will be offered alternative roles. What does it mean for a town when a bank closes? Co-op Bank snubbed in TSB takeover approach TSB haspublished a list of the branches,externalit is planning to close, which span the country and include nine in Scotland. ""Closing branches is an incredibly difficult decision to take, said Robin Bulloch, from TSB. ""These changes allow us to maintain an extensive branch presence across the country. They are accompanied by a significant investment programme to upgrade branches to better suit customer needs. And, where it takes longer to get to the nearest branch, we will introduce more 'pop-up' services in communities.""

UK competition watchdog orders Meta to sell GiphyThe CMA rules Facebook's purchase of the vast Gif database unfair to competing social-media platforms.,"Facebook's parent company, Meta, has been ordered to sell Giphy by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. The company, then known simply as Facebook, bought the Gif-sharing search engine last year for a reported $315m (Â£236m). It planned to integrate Giphy's vast database of looping short video animations with another of its existing social-media platforms, Instagram. But the CMA ruled the purchase unfair to competing social-media platforms. Facebook adopted Meta as its new corporate name, in October - but individual platforms owned by the company, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, retain their original identities. In May 2020, when it announced its acquisition of Giphy, it said 50% of the Gif search engine's traffic already came from Facebook platforms - half of that from Instagram. But Giphy also provides Gifs to competitors such as TikTok, Snapchat and Twitter. Gif stands for Graphics Interchange Format, an image format developed in the 1980s to display static and moving images. And they have become a staple of social-media posts and comments. The CMA said: ""After consulting with interested businesses and organisations - and assessing alternative solutions put forward by Facebook - the CMA has concluded that its competition concerns can only be addressed by Facebook selling Giphy in its entirety to an approved buyer.""

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Stuart McIntosh, who chaired the independent inquiry into the acquisition, said without action it would ""allow Facebook to increase its significant market power in social media even further, through controlling competitors' access to Giphy Gifs"". ""By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social-media users and promoting competition and innovation in digital advertising,"" he added. Experts said the decision by the regulator was a significant one. Peter Broadhurst, partner at law firm Crowell & Moring, said: ""This is the first time the CMA has ever blocked a major digital tech deal and indicates the direction of travel for the UK regulator's oversight of similar deals going forward."" In its decision the CMA noted that Giphy's advertising services had the ""potential"" to compete with Facebook's. ""This will cause quite a lot of uncertainty for companies trying to do deals where the parties don't actually compete but maybe could do in the future - particularly where one of them may be big in its own market,"" said Mr Broadhurst. But Meta told BBC News: ""We disagree with this decision. ""We are reviewing the decision and considering all options, including appeal. ""Both consumers and Giphy are better off with the support of our infrastructure, talent, and resources. ""Together, Meta and Giphy would enhance Giphy's product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API [application programming interface] partners in the UK and around the world who use Giphy every day, providing more choices for everyone."" In June 2020, the CMA sent an enforcement order to Facebook, effectively putting a hold on any merging of the companies until its investigation was over. In August 2021, it announced its provisional findings - the acquisition would ""harm competition between social-media platforms and remove a potential challenger in the display-advertising market"". At the time, the CMA warned ""it could require Facebook to unwind the deal and sell off Giphy in its entirety"". ButMeta's lawyers,externalsaid this provisional finding contained ""fundamental errors of law and fact"". By seeking to undo the acquisition ""in circumstances where Giphy does not even carry on business in the UK, not only is the CMA engaging in extraterritorial overreach but the CMA is sending a chilling message to start-up entrepreneurs, 'Do not build new companies because you will not be able to sell them,'"" they said.

'Weâve had 20 cancellations in one weekend',"Damian Wawrzyniak is worried about the impact on Christmas trading ""We had 20 cancellations over the weekend, mostly for Christmas parties. Customers were phoning to tell us they weren't sure what was going to happen in a few weeks so they'd rather cancel now."" Damian Wawrzyniak, an award-winning chef, is one of many in the hospitality industry worried about the impact the Omicron variant of coronavirus is having on his business. The sector has been allowed to operate free from restrictions since 19 July, but there are fears customer confidence in eating and drinking out has taken a hit as restaurants and bars prepare for their main money-making period of the year. There are also concerns some measures could return after the government announced it was reintroducing mandatory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport. ""Hospitality has been waiting for Christmas, and if it's not what we were hoping for, there's going to be some casualties across the industry, including my places,"" said Mr Wawrzyniak, who runs House of Feasts in Peterborough. ""We won't be able to survive without that Christmas trade."" Where do you have to wear masks now? What Covid rules are being toughened in the UK? Hospitality has been one of the hardest hit industries by the coronavirus pandemic, with many pubs, hotels and eateries being closed during lockdowns. As businesses have begun to recover and recoup lost earnings, a chronic shortage in workers surfaced,with job vacancies reaching the highest levels since records began. Sam Morgan has seen a drop in enquiries for his restaurants Sam Morgan, who owns the restaurants Craft and 8, told the BBC that a corporate booking for a private dining experience cancelled on Monday after the announcement of the new Covid variant. He said the business, which had booked a table for 12 people, told him it had changed its policy and would look to rebook in January. The restaurants purchase fresh produce ahead of large bookings, but Mr Morgan said ""that food will now end up in the bin"" due to the slim chances of a replacement booking. His venues usually received up to 150 enquiries a day, he added, but had only seen about 10 in the last 48 hours. ""People are just freezing and they are not doing anything and that's all to do with consumer confidence,"" said Mr Morgan. The confidence dent to customers would affect hospitality more than other sectors, he added, as people may think: ""Do we really want go out? Do we really need to go? I probably should not book."" However, Mr Morgan said he was ""encouraged"" that the government had not implemented restrictions on hospitality but said he would be ""naive"" to believe they may not return. He said his businesses relied on larger dining groups of six to 16 people, which would be affected if measures such as the ""rule of six"" returned. ""It's a challenge,"" said Mr Morgan. ""We are fighting a losing battle. We are ladened with debt."" Dave Critchley says he is starting to see cancellations from larger groups Meanwhile, Dave Critchley, chef and owner of Lu Ban restaurant in Liverpool, told the BBC his recently-opened business had never seen a ""solid, full December"" due to the pandemic. He said the Chinese-inspired dine-in was starting to see larger groups cancel their bookings. Since the weekend, two outside events the restaurant was catering for cancelled as a result of the new variant. ""It's a real kick in the teeth,"" added Mr Critchley. ""That's big business. It's a double whammy at the moment."" The chef explained a strong Christmas was something the restaurant was ""desperate for"" due to January being a ""bleak time for hospitality"". ""We still want to have a business on the other side. We have got to expect the worst and hope for the best,"" he said. Industry figures have said the industry could not ""financially sustain another lockdown"", with some calling for government support. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the return of masks in shops and on public transport would ""undoubtedly have an immediate impact on consumer confidence"", which she said was ""fragile"". ""There is no doubt that this will have a dampening effect just as we were about to head into our busiest trading period,"" she added. Meanwhile, the British Beer and Pub Association said hospitality was a ""safe environment"" and restrictions ""need not be placed on our sector at this time - and particularly during the festive period where we visit the local to see friends and family"". Like others, Mr Wawrzyniak said the industry needs ""clear advice"" from the government. ""It's not for me to tell people to wear a mask or not. That's the government's job,"" he added. ""We went through hell in the last 18 months and we really don't need a repeat of that. We need to know what's going on."" He said the government's decision to review current measures in three weeks could deliver a further blow. ""What happens if they announce, around 17 December, that they'll lock us down? It will be an absolute disaster."" A government spokesman said it had taken ""swift and decisive action"" to mandate face coverings in some settings, but this did not apply to hospitality venues. He added: ""We have already provided an unprecedented support package of Â£352bn which hospitality businesses have had continued access to, and we have published a new Hospitality Strategy to support England's pubs, bars, restaurants and other venues to thrive long-term.""

It was edited by James Clarke and Claire Heald, with Kevin Ponniah at the helm. We'll be back for more tomorrow - hope you can join us again. As we near the end of our coverage, here's a quick reminder of today's main headlines:  A couple who were moved into forced isolation in a Dutch hospital after they walked out of a Covid-19 hotel have been told they can now leave. Carolina Pimenta tested positive for Covid-19 after landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on a flight from South Africa on Friday. She was arrested by military police on Sunday night on a plane about to take off for Spain. The couple have now been told prosecutors have decided not to pursue the case.

Icelandtells the BBC its staff will not ask customers to wear masks so they don't have to face abuse. Tesco, the largest UK supermarket chain, will just be putting up signs to remind customers about face mask rules, the BBC understands. AldiandLidlare also understood to have no plans to challenge customers. Sainsbury'ssays it will have ""greeters and security guards at the front of our supermarkets"" to remind people to wear masks. Morrisonsis expected to have staff checking mask wearing at the front of the shops, and will hand out masks to customers that have forgotten them. Asdaalso says it will hand out masks to shoppers who are without one. You can read morehere. As we reported earlier, Greece is making vaccines mandatory for anyone aged 60 and over from next year, and those who do not comply will face a â¬100 (Â£85) fine each month until they do so. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis said it was predominantly those over 60 who died of Covid, and that only 60,000 of the more than 500,000 unvaccinated citizens in that age group had got their first jab this month. ""I have no doubt that this political decision will save human lives. Because vaccination becomes more than just compulsory. It saves lives. It is necessary for health. It is necessary for the whole society. ""The funds collected by the fines will be given to our hospitals. It is not a punishment. I would say it is a health fee. An incentive for precaution, a life boost.  And I think it is also an act of justice for the people who are vaccinated. It is not acceptable for some people to be deprived of the health services they need because others stubbornly refuse to do the obvious Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greek Prime Minister He also added he had been âtorturedâ by the decision, but that he felt âa heavy responsibilityâ towards the most vulnerable, âeven if it might fleetingly displease themâ. Minister Darragh O'Brien confirmed the new rules will initially last for two weeks Turning to developments outside of the UK now, the Irish government will require all international travellers to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test prior to their arrival in the country, regardless of their vaccination status. The country's Housing Minister, Darragh O'Brien, told reporters passengers will be required to have taken a
lab-conducted antigen test no more than 48 hours before
travelling or a PCR test within 72 hours of arrival. O'Brien said restrictions will initially apply for a two-week period. The rules will apply to travellers arriving from Great Britain, but not to those crossing the border with Northern Ireland. Ireland's Department of Transport is in discussions with airlines and ferry companies to ensure the tests are checked before people board flights or ferries to the country. The move follows the UK government's decision to exclude Ireland and other Common Travel Area countries from similar rules it implemented for international arrivals on Saturday. Ireland is currently examining 11 suspected cases of the Omicron variant. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said it is likely the
new variant is already present in the country. In Northern Ireland, Covid-19 vaccination hubs have opened to help meet demand for booster doses, the health minister says. Robin Swann says the aim is to ""bring booster doses to all eligible age groups as quickly as possible"". Northern Irelandhas had the lowest uptake of the booster shot in the UK. Swann is urging the public not to ""be put off getting their first, second or booster doses due toconcerns or speculation about the Omicron variant"". This video can not be played The BBC's Philippa Roxby and Ione Wells answer your questions on the new Covid variant. After the UK government's latest update on coronavirus and booster jabs, BBC health correspondent Philippa Roxby and political correspondent Ione Wells answer your questions. The UK's Covid booster vaccine programme is being expanded amid concerns about the new Omicron variant. The government has set a target to offer all eligible adults in England the chance to book a booster by the end of January. A second vaccine dose will be offered to children aged 12-15. When can I get my booster? When you are contacted will depend on your age and whether you are in an at-risk group. Vulnerable people will be contacted first, then over-40s and older people, then younger age groups. However, people are being asked not to contact the NHS about their booster jab, and wait to be invited. Across England, jabs will be rolled out at 1,500 community pharmacies, extra hospital hubs and pop-up vaccination sites. ScotlandandWaleshave yet to finalise details of how boosters will be given out. Northern Ireland has announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Read morehere. A further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday. The average number of daily confirmed cases has bounced around since mid-July and was rising again through November, but has dipped in recent days. Another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported. The number of daily deaths has been falling steadily through November. As weâve been
reporting, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is trying to establish where
exactly in the UK the Omicron variant is. It's confirmed 22 cases have been detected, but as we've been reporting, the variant is likely to be transmitting in the community, so that number will grow. Earlier, we told you the Local
Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said that two cases had been detected in
Nottingham. However, it has since clarified that the cityhas only one case on recordâ a student, who has been self-isolating since they were infected. Here's a breakdown of cases in England confirmed by the UKHSA: And as weâve also
reported,there are 9 cases in Scotland. Five are in Lanarkshire and four are in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. This video can not be played PM: All adults to be offered a Covid booster by end of January Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the government's target is for all adults to be offered a Covid booster by the end of January, with temporary vaccination centres to be opened up, as at other stages of the vaccine roll-out. Reality Check At the Downing Street briefing just now,
Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We've delivered more booster doses
than any other country, with the exception of the USA and China."" Heâs
right in terms of thetotal number of booster doses,externalgiven. China has given 66 million, the US
has given 40 million and the UK is in third place with 18 million, according to
Our World in Data. In terms of the number of booster
doses given per head of the population, the UK is in seventh place, behind
Gibraltar, Israel, Chile, Uruguay, Iceland and the United Arab Emirates â
according to the same organisation's figures. The Downing Street coronavirus briefing led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just wrapped up. He was joined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England. In case you missed it, here's a quick round-up of what we learned: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The target of offering booster jabs to all adults in England by the end of January (and that means giving them the opportunity to book jabs) is ambitious - but how achievable is it? Crucially we have the supply. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are going to come into the country and there will be enough to vaccinate the eligible adult population. But at the moment, the NHS is not vaccinating at the rate it needs to if it is going to hit that target. Currently it is doing about 2.5m boosters a week, so that would take until the end of February to reach all adults in England. The PM acknowledged it's got to get back up to the levels seen in the spring - when more than 4m doses a week were being given. A third of the mass vaccination centres that were in place then have closed and GPs are back doing their day to day work. But what we've seen is pharmacies step up and we've heard about the military and other people coming in to help them. There are about 30 hospitals currently vaccinating the public - but around 200 that could be opened up to do that too. If they manage to do all that and do it quickly, then the end of January is achievable. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The advice from the prime minister was clear - donât cancel
your Christmas plans, and do get your booster. He defended the governmentâs reluctance to move to Plan B - which would involve advising people in England to work from
home if they can (as they are advised to do in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland). The leader of the lockdown-resistant Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs â
the former chief whip Mark Harper â says he gives the government ""credit"" for
this. But note, Boris Johnson refused to rule this out completely. The best he could promise, choosing his words carefully, was
this: ""The kind of lockdown we had before is extremely unlikely."" It would seem that further restrictions will be dependent
more on the progress of the pandemic than on politics. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The UK has bought hundreds of thousands of doses of a powerful antiviral drug that can treat Covid. The treatment,molnupiravir,could help those who are most at risk of getting severely ill if they catch the virus. In trials, the twice daily pills cut the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. The therapy works in a different way to current vaccines and should be very effective even against new variants, such as Omicron. A question now from Bloomberg on working from home - and why England is out of kilter with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson says this is not something the government thinks is necessary - it has a package of measures to deal with the Delta variant and they've been working. He says the reason for not implementing Plan B - a contingency to protect the NHS which includes guidance to work from home - is in order to take an approach that is ""proportionate and balanced"". He will change things as necessary, but is looking for reassurance that vaccines are effective against Omicron. And the PM ends the briefing with a mention of Storm Arwen, saying how sympathetic he is to people in the million or so homes that have lost electricity - and assuring those still without power that the government is doing what it can to restore it. Next, the PM is asked if he can reassure businesses that are worried about another so-called ""pingdemic"". Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe, from the Financial Times, says the government has ruled out a ""Plan B"" to tackle Covid, but can the PM confirm contingency measures like working from home won't be taken if there's a surge? Johnson says he does not think a return to the ""pingdemic"" of July is likely to happen (where people were alerted to contact with Covid cases) because the numbers of cases of Omicron are small. But that will have to stay under review. ""We haven't ruled out anything, I think another lockdown of the kind we've had before is extremely unlikely but we keep everything under constant review,"" he says. On local lockdown measures he says: ""We've settled pretty much on the view that moving together is the way to do it."" Is there community transmission of the new Omicron variant in the UK, the Daily Mail's Jason Groves asks Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Javid replies that they are ""not able to say"" at the moment, but it's likely. Boris Johnson is asked whether he would encourage people who are already scrapping school Nativity plays and Christmas parties in response to the government's new rules to ""think again"". ""We don't want people to cancel such events,"" the prime minister replies - and the ""best place"" for children to be is in school. Â© 2025 BBC.

England face mask rules return over variant fearsCoverings become mandatory in shops and on public transport under measures to slow Omicron's spread.,"Face coverings have become mandatory again on public transport and shops in England in an effort to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. People arriving in the UK from abroad will now also have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. It comes after 14 cases of the new variant were detected in the UK. Boris Johnson is expected to set out plans for the booster jab programme in England at a news conference later. On Monday the government announced a major expansion of the booster jab rollout as part of efforts to help stop a potential wave of infections. They areto be offered to all over-18s in the UK, with children aged 12 to 15 invited for a second jab. More local pharmacies could be used as part of the rollout and it is likely that there will be some prioritisation to ensure the vulnerable get their top-up shots first - as with the original scheme. What Covid rules are being toughened? How worrying is the new Covid variant? How do you detect Omicron? Three more Omicron cases have been found in Scotlandand Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said it is expected cases of the new variant will continue to rise. Early evidence suggests Omicron - first found in southern Africa - has a higher re-infection risk. But scientists say it will take about three weeks before it is known how the variant impacts on the effectiveness of vaccines. Mr Johnson said the new mask and testing measures would ""buy us time in the face of this new variant"". Richard Walker, managing director of the Iceland grocery chain, told the BBC his company supported compulsory mask wearing but he would not be asking staff to police those who refused to do so. Care Minister Gillian Keegan told BBC Breakfast that it was ""down to individuals"" to do the right thing, calling on the public to be ""sensible"", and said she understood Mr Walker's position. While it is still unclear the impact the new variant could have she said people should continue with their Christmas plans but be ""cautious"". Police in England say they will work ""in partnership with relevant business owners and their staff"" to ensure people comply with the new face coverings rules. Assistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said officers would engage with people not wearing face coverings and encourage them to do so. As a last resort people can be fined Â£200, reduced to Â£100 if paid within 14 days. The changes will be reviewed in three weeks' time and the health secretary told MPs they would be given a chance to vote on them. Scientists are agreed accelerating the booster programme is key to combatting Omicron if the worst fears are realised. That job though now lies in the hands of the NHS. And the challenge that it faces is that the infrastructure that was so successful in delivering the jabs in the first half of the year has been scaled back. Three-quarters of vaccinations were delivered by GP-led teams. But many of those GP and staff have now returned to their day jobs, focussing on the flu vaccine rollout and their patients. Around 50 mass vaccination centres have also been shut down. Restarting any of that will not be immediate so in the short-term the easiest solution is to extend the opening hours of the remaining big centres and providing more support to high street pharmacists who are also heavily involved. Currently around 2.5m booster jabs are being given each week - at that rate it could take around three months to provide boosters to everyone. Halving that would give the UK the best possible chance of combatting any Omicron wave. Mr Javid said if it emerged that the variant was ""no more dangerous than the Delta variant"" then measures would not be kept in place ""for a day longer than necessary"". This video can not be played Sajid Javid on Omicron numbers in the UK: ""We expect cases to rise in coming days"" The new rules on face coverings bring England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where they are already mandatory on public transport and for many indoor areas. Newly-published guidance,externalsays they should be worn in locations including shops, shopping centres, posts offices, banks, hairdressers and food takeaways, as well as on public transport. Although the change does not require people in England to wear coverings in pubs and restaurants,they are required in hospitality venues elsewhere in the UK in some circumstances. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading Labour's shadow health minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan said the government should not have stopped asking the public in England to wear masks. Another change, which has already come into effect, requires all contacts of suspected Omicron cases to self-isolate for 10 days, even if they are fully vaccinated. Mandatory masks: 'We worry people won't come in' 'Weâve had 20 cancellations in one weekend' EasyJet says Omicron has weakened bookings Meanwhile, the first ministers of Scotland and Wales have called for the PCR test requirement to be changed so that everyone arriving in the UK would have to isolate for eight days. The latest cases of the Omicron variant in England were detected in the Camden and Wandsworth areas of London. Like the other three cases in England, they have been linked to travel in southern Africa. Nine cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus have been identified in Scotland. The average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. A further42,583 cases were reported on Monday.,external Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, told the BBC it was hoped a booster vaccine dose might ""to some extent, counter the potential drop in vaccine effectiveness we might find with this variant"". She said people could also do their bit by reducing social contacts. NHS England has said it will ""shortly"" set out how the booster vaccine programme will be expanded, including who will be prioritised and how capacity will be expanded. An NHS spokesman said boosters would be given in priority order and urged people to come forward ""as quickly as possible"" when called. Dr Farah Jameel, chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, told the BBC that GP practices needed to have their contractual targets paused so that they could ""refocus clinical priorities"" on supporting the rollout of jabs. The University of Oxford, which developed a Covid vaccine alongside AstraZeneca, has said it can ""rapidly"" update its vaccine ""if it should be necessary"" to tackle the Omicron variant.

"We'll throw everything at booster campaign - PMBoris Johnson says there needs to be ""another great surge"" against coronavirus and the new variant.UK","This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister says new Covid rules are not a massive overhaul to general life The UK ""will throw everything"" at the expanded booster jab rollout in the wake of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, Boris Johnson has said. But the PM insisted there was no need to change the overall guidance on ""how people should be living their lives"". Earlier Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, said people should not socialise ""when we don't particularly need to"". Meanwhile masks must now be wornin shops and public transportin England. A total of 22 cases of the new coronavirus variant have so far been confirmed in the UK. Thirteen are in England - in the East Midlands, the east of England, London and the North West. Nine cases are in Scotland and all appear to have come from a single event on 20 November, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. South Africa was the first country to identify the new variant, and reported it to the World Health Organization on 24 November. What Covid rules are being toughened? How worrying is the new Covid variant? How do you detect Omicron? Speaking outside a vaccine centre in north London earlier today, Mr Johnson said it is ""overwhelmingly likely"" booster jabs can give a ""lot of protection against all types of the virus"", adding it is crucial for everybody to get the additional dose when eligible. He added: ""We've no doubt at all that the NHS, all the volunteers, the Army, everybody can rise to the challenge. Is it going to be hard work? Yes it is, but I know people can do it."" Booster jabs areto be offered to all over-18s in the UKand children aged 12 to 15 will be invited for a second jab, as part of a major expansion of the vaccine programme. At a No 10 press conference the prime minister announced that the aim is to offer all adults in England over 18 a booster jab by the end of January 2022, with people becoming eligible for a booster at least three months after their second dose. That means 14 million more adults have now become eligible for a booster in England alone, Mr Johnson said. Jabs will be rolled out at 1,500 community pharmacy sites and extra hospital hubs in England and some 400 military personnel will work with the ""jabs army of volunteers"", he announced. People arriving in the UK from abroad will also now have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. Earlier Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency - the body which replaced Public Health England - suggested people should reduce social contacts in the run up to Christmas. When asked about her comments, the prime minister said she was right and people should continue to take ""normal precautions"", but said a change in the guidance wasn't necessary ""We don't see anything to suggest that we need to go, for instance, to Plan B,"" he said, referring to tougher curbs in England. However, Mr Johnson added taking ""particular precautions"" against Omicron were needed until experts know ""exactly what kind of a threat it may present"". Some Conservative backbench MPs questioned Dr Harries' advice during a debate on face masks in the House of Commons, with some asking on whose authority she was speaking given her suggestion was not government policy. Meanwhile, Wales' health minister Eluned Morgan saidpeople should take the ""threat"" of socialising indoors with others at Christmas seriously. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading The new rules on face coverings bring England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where they are already mandatory on public transport and for many indoor areas. Newly-published guidance,externalsays they should be worn in locations including shops, shopping centres, posts offices, banks, hairdressers and food takeaways, as well as on public transport. Although the change does not require people in England to wear coverings in pubs and restaurants,they are required in hospitality venues elsewhere in the UK in some circumstances. Police in England say they will work ""in partnership with relevant business owners and their staff"" to ensure people comply with the new face coverings rules. As a last resort people can be fined Â£200, reduced to Â£100 if paid within 14 days. Another change, which has already come into effect, requires all contacts of suspected Omicron cases to self-isolate for 10 days, even if they are fully vaccinated.

England face mask rules return over variant fearsCoverings become mandatory in shops and on public transport under measures to slow Omicron's spread.UKComments,"Face coverings have become mandatory again on public transport and shops in England in an effort to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. People arriving in the UK from abroad will now also have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. It comes after 14 cases of the new variant were detected in the UK. Boris Johnson is expected to set out plans for the booster jab programme in England at a news conference later. On Monday the government announced a major expansion of the booster jab rollout as part of efforts to help stop a potential wave of infections. They areto be offered to all over-18s in the UK, with children aged 12 to 15 invited for a second jab. More local pharmacies could be used as part of the rollout and it is likely that there will be some prioritisation to ensure the vulnerable get their top-up shots first - as with the original scheme. What Covid rules are being toughened? How worrying is the new Covid variant? How do you detect Omicron? Three more Omicron cases have been found in Scotlandand Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said it is expected cases of the new variant will continue to rise. Early evidence suggests Omicron - first found in southern Africa - has a higher re-infection risk. But scientists say it will take about three weeks before it is known how the variant impacts on the effectiveness of vaccines. Mr Johnson said the new mask and testing measures would ""buy us time in the face of this new variant"". Richard Walker, managing director of the Iceland grocery chain, told the BBC his company supported compulsory mask wearing but he would not be asking staff to police those who refused to do so. Care Minister Gillian Keegan told BBC Breakfast that it was ""down to individuals"" to do the right thing, calling on the public to be ""sensible"", and said she understood Mr Walker's position. While it is still unclear the impact the new variant could have she said people should continue with their Christmas plans but be ""cautious"". Police in England say they will work ""in partnership with relevant business owners and their staff"" to ensure people comply with the new face coverings rules. Assistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said officers would engage with people not wearing face coverings and encourage them to do so. As a last resort people can be fined Â£200, reduced to Â£100 if paid within 14 days. The changes will be reviewed in three weeks' time and the health secretary told MPs they would be given a chance to vote on them. Scientists are agreed accelerating the booster programme is key to combatting Omicron if the worst fears are realised. That job though now lies in the hands of the NHS. And the challenge that it faces is that the infrastructure that was so successful in delivering the jabs in the first half of the year has been scaled back. Three-quarters of vaccinations were delivered by GP-led teams. But many of those GP and staff have now returned to their day jobs, focussing on the flu vaccine rollout and their patients. Around 50 mass vaccination centres have also been shut down. Restarting any of that will not be immediate so in the short-term the easiest solution is to extend the opening hours of the remaining big centres and providing more support to high street pharmacists who are also heavily involved. Currently around 2.5m booster jabs are being given each week - at that rate it could take around three months to provide boosters to everyone. Halving that would give the UK the best possible chance of combatting any Omicron wave. Mr Javid said if it emerged that the variant was ""no more dangerous than the Delta variant"" then measures would not be kept in place ""for a day longer than necessary"". This video can not be played Sajid Javid on Omicron numbers in the UK: ""We expect cases to rise in coming days"" The new rules on face coverings bring England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where they are already mandatory on public transport and for many indoor areas. Newly-published guidance,externalsays they should be worn in locations including shops, shopping centres, posts offices, banks, hairdressers and food takeaways, as well as on public transport.

This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading Labour's shadow health minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan said the government should not have stopped asking the public in England to wear masks. Another change, which has already come into effect, requires all contacts of suspected Omicron cases to self-isolate for 10 days, even if they are fully vaccinated. Mandatory masks: 'We worry people won't come in' 'Weâve had 20 cancellations in one weekend' EasyJet says Omicron has weakened bookings Meanwhile, the first ministers of Scotland and Wales have called for the PCR test requirement to be changed so that everyone arriving in the UK would have to isolate for eight days. The latest cases of the Omicron variant in England were detected in the Camden and Wandsworth areas of London. Like the other three cases in England, they have been linked to travel in southern Africa. Nine cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus have been identified in Scotland. The average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. A further42,583 cases were reported on Monday.,external Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, told the BBC it was hoped a booster vaccine dose might ""to some extent, counter the potential drop in vaccine effectiveness we might find with this variant"". She said people could also do their bit by reducing social contacts. NHS England has said it will ""shortly"" set out how the booster vaccine programme will be expanded, including who will be prioritised and how capacity will be expanded. An NHS spokesman said boosters would be given in priority order and urged people to come forward ""as quickly as possible"" when called. Dr Farah Jameel, chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, told the BBC that GP practices needed to have their contractual targets paused so that they could ""refocus clinical priorities"" on supporting the rollout of jabs. The University of Oxford, which developed a Covid vaccine alongside AstraZeneca, has said it can ""rapidly"" update its vaccine ""if it should be necessary"" to tackle the Omicron variant. European stock markets have fallenafter the boss of Moderna cast doubts on the effectiveness of vaccines against the new Omicron Covid variant.

It was edited by James Clarke and Claire Heald, with Kevin Ponniah at the helm. We'll be back for more tomorrow - hope you can join us again. As we near the end of our coverage, here's a quick reminder of today's main headlines:  A couple who were moved into forced isolation in a Dutch hospital after they walked out of a Covid-19 hotel have been told they can now leave. Carolina Pimenta tested positive for Covid-19 after landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on a flight from South Africa on Friday. She was arrested by military police on Sunday night on a plane about to take off for Spain. The couple have now been told prosecutors have decided not to pursue the case. Read the full story of what happened to them here. Some supermarkets in England say they won't be enforcing new face mask rules, instead they'll use a lighter touch. Icelandtells the BBC its staff will not ask customers to wear masks so they don't have to face abuse. Tesco, the largest UK supermarket chain, will just be putting up signs to remind customers about face mask rules, the BBC understands. AldiandLidlare also understood to have no plans to challenge customers. Sainsbury'ssays it will have ""greeters and security guards at the front of our supermarkets"" to remind people to wear masks. Morrisonsis expected to have staff checking mask wearing at the front of the shops, and will hand out masks to customers that have forgotten them. Asdaalso says it will hand out masks to shoppers who are without one. You can read morehere. As we reported earlier, Greece is making vaccines mandatory for anyone aged 60 and over from next year, and those who do not comply will face a â¬100 (Â£85) fine each month until they do so. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis said it was predominantly those over 60 who died of Covid, and that only 60,000 of the more than 500,000 unvaccinated citizens in that age group had got their first jab this month. ""I have no doubt that this political decision will save human lives. Because vaccination becomes more than just compulsory. It saves lives. It is necessary for health. It is necessary for the whole society. ""The funds collected by the fines will be given to our hospitals. It is not a punishment. I would say it is a health fee. An incentive for precaution, a life boost.  And I think it is also an act of justice for the people who are vaccinated. It is not acceptable for some people to be deprived of the health services they need because others stubbornly refuse to do the obvious Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greek Prime Minister He also added he had been âtorturedâ by the decision, but that he felt âa heavy responsibilityâ towards the most vulnerable, âeven if it might fleetingly displease themâ. Minister Darragh O'Brien confirmed the new rules will initially last for two weeks Turning to developments outside of the UK now, the Irish government will require all international travellers to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test prior to their arrival in the country, regardless of their vaccination status. The country's Housing Minister, Darragh O'Brien, told reporters passengers will be required to have taken a
lab-conducted antigen test no more than 48 hours before
travelling or a PCR test within 72 hours of arrival. O'Brien said restrictions will initially apply for a two-week period. The rules will apply to travellers arriving from Great Britain, but not to those crossing the border with Northern Ireland. Ireland's Department of Transport is in discussions with airlines and ferry companies to ensure the tests are checked before people board flights or ferries to the country. The move follows the UK government's decision to exclude Ireland and other Common Travel Area countries from similar rules it implemented for international arrivals on Saturday. Ireland is currently examining 11 suspected cases of the Omicron variant. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said it is likely the
new variant is already present in the country. In Northern Ireland, Covid-19 vaccination hubs have opened to help meet demand for booster doses, the health minister says. Robin Swann says the aim is to ""bring booster doses to all eligible age groups as quickly as possible"". Northern Irelandhas had the lowest uptake of the booster shot in the UK. Swann is urging the public not to ""be put off getting their first, second or booster doses due toconcerns or speculation about the Omicron variant"". This video can not be played The BBC's Philippa Roxby and Ione Wells answer your questions on the new Covid variant. After the UK government's latest update on coronavirus and booster jabs, BBC health correspondent Philippa Roxby and political correspondent Ione Wells answer your questions. The UK's Covid booster vaccine programme is being expanded amid concerns about the new Omicron variant. The government has set a target to offer all eligible adults in England the chance to book a booster by the end of January. A second vaccine dose will be offered to children aged 12-15. When can I get my booster? When you are contacted will depend on your age and whether you are in an at-risk group. Vulnerable people will be contacted first, then over-40s and older people, then younger age groups. However, people are being asked not to contact the NHS about their booster jab, and wait to be invited. Across England, jabs will be rolled out at 1,500 community pharmacies, extra hospital hubs and pop-up vaccination sites. ScotlandandWaleshave yet to finalise details of how boosters will be given out. Northern Ireland has announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Read morehere. A further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday. The average number of daily confirmed cases has bounced around since mid-July and was rising again through November, but has dipped in recent days. Another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported. The number of daily deaths has been falling steadily through November. As weâve been
reporting, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is trying to establish where
exactly in the UK the Omicron variant is. It's confirmed 22 cases have been detected, but as we've been reporting, the variant is likely to be transmitting in the community, so that number will grow. Earlier, we told you the Local
Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said that two cases had been detected in
Nottingham. However, it has since clarified that the cityhas only one case on recordâ a student, who has been self-isolating since they were infected. Here's a breakdown of cases in England confirmed by the UKHSA: And as weâve also
reported,there are 9 cases in Scotland. Five are in Lanarkshire and four are in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. This video can not be played PM: All adults to be offered a Covid booster by end of January Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the government's target is for all adults to be offered a Covid booster by the end of January, with temporary vaccination centres to be opened up, as at other stages of the vaccine roll-out. Reality Check At the Downing Street briefing just now,
Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We've delivered more booster doses
than any other country, with the exception of the USA and China."" Heâs
right in terms of thetotal number of booster doses,externalgiven. China has given 66 million, the US
has given 40 million and the UK is in third place with 18 million, according to
Our World in Data. In terms of the number of booster
doses given per head of the population, the UK is in seventh place, behind
Gibraltar, Israel, Chile, Uruguay, Iceland and the United Arab Emirates â
according to the same organisation's figures. The Downing Street coronavirus briefing led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just wrapped up. He was joined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England. In case you missed it, here's a quick round-up of what we learned: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The target of offering booster jabs to all adults in England by the end of January (and that means giving them the opportunity to book jabs) is ambitious - but how achievable is it? Crucially we have the supply. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are going to come into the country and there will be enough to vaccinate the eligible adult population. But at the moment, the NHS is not vaccinating at the rate it needs to if it is going to hit that target. Currently it is doing about 2.5m boosters a week, so that would take until the end of February to reach all adults in England. The PM acknowledged it's got to get back up to the levels seen in the spring - when more than 4m doses a week were being given. A third of the mass vaccination centres that were in place then have closed and GPs are back doing their day to day work. But what we've seen is pharmacies step up and we've heard about the military and other people coming in to help them. There are about 30 hospitals currently vaccinating the public - but around 200 that could be opened up to do that too. If they manage to do all that and do it quickly, then the end of January is achievable. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The advice from the prime minister was clear - donât cancel
your Christmas plans, and do get your booster. He defended the governmentâs reluctance to move to Plan B - which would involve advising people in England to work from
home if they can (as they are advised to do in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland). The leader of the lockdown-resistant Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs â
the former chief whip Mark Harper â says he gives the government ""credit"" for
this. But note, Boris Johnson refused to rule this out completely. The best he could promise, choosing his words carefully, was
this: ""The kind of lockdown we had before is extremely unlikely."" It would seem that further restrictions will be dependent
more on the progress of the pandemic than on politics. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The UK has bought hundreds of thousands of doses of a powerful antiviral drug that can treat Covid. The treatment,molnupiravir,could help those who are most at risk of getting severely ill if they catch the virus. In trials, the twice daily pills cut the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. The therapy works in a different way to current vaccines and should be very effective even against new variants, such as Omicron. A question now from Bloomberg on working from home - and why England is out of kilter with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson says this is not something the government thinks is necessary - it has a package of measures to deal with the Delta variant and they've been working. He says the reason for not implementing Plan B - a contingency to protect the NHS which includes guidance to work from home - is in order to take an approach that is ""proportionate and balanced"". He will change things as necessary, but is looking for reassurance that vaccines are effective against Omicron. And the PM ends the briefing with a mention of Storm Arwen, saying how sympathetic he is to people in the million or so homes that have lost electricity - and assuring those still without power that the government is doing what it can to restore it. Next, the PM is asked if he can reassure businesses that are worried about another so-called ""pingdemic"". Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe, from the Financial Times, says the government has ruled out a ""Plan B"" to tackle Covid, but can the PM confirm contingency measures like working from home won't be taken if there's a surge? Johnson says he does not think a return to the ""pingdemic"" of July is likely to happen (where people were alerted to contact with Covid cases) because the numbers of cases of Omicron are small. But that will have to stay under review. ""We haven't ruled out anything, I think another lockdown of the kind we've had before is extremely unlikely but we keep everything under constant review,"" he says. On local lockdown measures he says: ""We've settled pretty much on the view that moving together is the way to do it."" Is there community transmission of the new Omicron variant in the UK, the Daily Mail's Jason Groves asks Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Javid replies that they are ""not able to say"" at the moment, but it's likely. Boris Johnson is asked whether he would encourage people who are already scrapping school Nativity plays and Christmas parties in response to the government's new rules to ""think again"". ""We don't want people to cancel such events,"" the prime minister replies - and the ""best place"" for children to be is in school. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sex harassment rife in Australia parliament - report,"Former political staffer Brittany Higgins inspired others to come forward with allegations A third of employees in Australia's federal parliament have been sexually harassed, a landmark report has found. The report was commissioned after a former staffer, Brittany Higgins, said she had been raped by a colleague in a minister's office. Her story earlier this year triggered a wave of wide-ranging allegations of misconduct in Canberra. The victims were disproportionately women, said Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins. The report,titled Set the Standard,external, found 51% of staffers had experienced some form of bullying, sexual harassment or actual or attempted sexual assault. ""Such experiences leave a trail of devastation for individuals and their teams and undermine the performance of our parliament to the nation's detriments,"" said Ms Jenkins, the report's author. Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the findings as ""appalling"", adding: ""I wish I found it more surprising"". Mr Morrison has previously beenaccused of being ""tone deaf""on issues disproportionately affecting women in parliament. The review, tabled in federal parliament,externalon Tuesday, interviewed 1,723 people and 33 organisations. It found 63% of female parliamentarians had experienced sexual harassment - an even higher percentage than for political staffers. One unnamed MP told the review: ""Aspiring male politicians who thought nothing of, in one case, picking you up, kissing you on the lips, lifting you up, touching you, pats on the bottom, comments about appearance, you know, the usual. The point I make with that ... [w]as the culture allowed it, encouraged it."" This video can not be played Why Australian women are saying 'enough is enough' The report made recommendations including improving leadership and gender balances, and reducing a culture of alcohol. Ms Higgins said she urged MPs across the political divide to ""implement these recommendations in full"". ""I want to thank the many brave people who shared their stories, which contributed to this review,'' she said.

As we near the end of our coverage, here's a quick reminder of today's main headlines:  A couple who were moved into forced isolation in a Dutch hospital after they walked out of a Covid-19 hotel have been told they can now leave. Carolina Pimenta tested positive for Covid-19 after landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on a flight from South Africa on Friday. She was arrested by military police on Sunday night on a plane about to take off for Spain. The couple have now been told prosecutors have decided not to pursue the case. Read the full story of what happened to them here. Some supermarkets in England say they won't be enforcing new face mask rules, instead they'll use a lighter touch. Icelandtells the BBC its staff will not ask customers to wear masks so they don't have to face abuse. Tesco, the largest UK supermarket chain, will just be putting up signs to remind customers about face mask rules, the BBC understands. AldiandLidlare also understood to have no plans to challenge customers. Sainsbury'ssays it will have ""greeters and security guards at the front of our supermarkets"" to remind people to wear masks. Morrisonsis expected to have staff checking mask wearing at the front of the shops, and will hand out masks to customers that have forgotten them. Asdaalso says it will hand out masks to shoppers who are without one. You can read morehere. As we reported earlier, Greece is making vaccines mandatory for anyone aged 60 and over from next year, and those who do not comply will face a â¬100 (Â£85) fine each month until they do so. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis said it was predominantly those over 60 who died of Covid, and that only 60,000 of the more than 500,000 unvaccinated citizens in that age group had got their first jab this month. ""I have no doubt that this political decision will save human lives. Because vaccination becomes more than just compulsory. It saves lives. It is necessary for health. It is necessary for the whole society. ""The funds collected by the fines will be given to our hospitals. It is not a punishment. I would say it is a health fee. An incentive for precaution, a life boost.  And I think it is also an act of justice for the people who are vaccinated. It is not acceptable for some people to be deprived of the health services they need because others stubbornly refuse to do the obvious Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greek Prime Minister He also added he had been âtorturedâ by the decision, but that he felt âa heavy responsibilityâ towards the most vulnerable, âeven if it might fleetingly displease themâ. Minister Darragh O'Brien confirmed the new rules will initially last for two weeks Turning to developments outside of the UK now, the Irish government will require all international travellers to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test prior to their arrival in the country, regardless of their vaccination status. The country's Housing Minister, Darragh O'Brien, told reporters passengers will be required to have taken a
lab-conducted antigen test no more than 48 hours before
travelling or a PCR test within 72 hours of arrival. O'Brien said restrictions will initially apply for a two-week period. The rules will apply to travellers arriving from Great Britain, but not to those crossing the border with Northern Ireland. Ireland's Department of Transport is in discussions with airlines and ferry companies to ensure the tests are checked before people board flights or ferries to the country. The move follows the UK government's decision to exclude Ireland and other Common Travel Area countries from similar rules it implemented for international arrivals on Saturday. Ireland is currently examining 11 suspected cases of the Omicron variant. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said it is likely the
new variant is already present in the country. In Northern Ireland, Covid-19 vaccination hubs have opened to help meet demand for booster doses, the health minister says. Robin Swann says the aim is to ""bring booster doses to all eligible age groups as quickly as possible"". Northern Irelandhas had the lowest uptake of the booster shot in the UK. Swann is urging the public not to ""be put off getting their first, second or booster doses due toconcerns or speculation about the Omicron variant"". This video can not be played The BBC's Philippa Roxby and Ione Wells answer your questions on the new Covid variant. After the UK government's latest update on coronavirus and booster jabs, BBC health correspondent Philippa Roxby and political correspondent Ione Wells answer your questions. The UK's Covid booster vaccine programme is being expanded amid concerns about the new Omicron variant. The government has set a target to offer all eligible adults in England the chance to book a booster by the end of January. A second vaccine dose will be offered to children aged 12-15. When can I get my booster? When you are contacted will depend on your age and whether you are in an at-risk group. Vulnerable people will be contacted first, then over-40s and older people, then younger age groups. However, people are being asked not to contact the NHS about their booster jab, and wait to be invited. Across England, jabs will be rolled out at 1,500 community pharmacies, extra hospital hubs and pop-up vaccination sites. ScotlandandWaleshave yet to finalise details of how boosters will be given out. Northern Ireland has announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Read morehere. A further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday. The average number of daily confirmed cases has bounced around since mid-July and was rising again through November, but has dipped in recent days. Another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported. The number of daily deaths has been falling steadily through November. As weâve been
reporting, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is trying to establish where
exactly in the UK the Omicron variant is. It's confirmed 22 cases have been detected, but as we've been reporting, the variant is likely to be transmitting in the community, so that number will grow. Earlier, we told you the Local
Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said that two cases had been detected in
Nottingham. However, it has since clarified that the cityhas only one case on recordâ a student, who has been self-isolating since they were infected. Here's a breakdown of cases in England confirmed by the UKHSA: And as weâve also
reported,there are 9 cases in Scotland. Five are in Lanarkshire and four are in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. This video can not be played PM: All adults to be offered a Covid booster by end of January Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the government's target is for all adults to be offered a Covid booster by the end of January, with temporary vaccination centres to be opened up, as at other stages of the vaccine roll-out. Reality Check At the Downing Street briefing just now,
Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We've delivered more booster doses
than any other country, with the exception of the USA and China."" Heâs
right in terms of thetotal number of booster doses,externalgiven. China has given 66 million, the US
has given 40 million and the UK is in third place with 18 million, according to
Our World in Data. In terms of the number of booster
doses given per head of the population, the UK is in seventh place, behind
Gibraltar, Israel, Chile, Uruguay, Iceland and the United Arab Emirates â
according to the same organisation's figures. The Downing Street coronavirus briefing led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just wrapped up. He was joined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England. In case you missed it, here's a quick round-up of what we learned: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The target of offering booster jabs to all adults in England by the end of January (and that means giving them the opportunity to book jabs) is ambitious - but how achievable is it? Crucially we have the supply. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are going to come into the country and there will be enough to vaccinate the eligible adult population. But at the moment, the NHS is not vaccinating at the rate it needs to if it is going to hit that target. Currently it is doing about 2.5m boosters a week, so that would take until the end of February to reach all adults in England. The PM acknowledged it's got to get back up to the levels seen in the spring - when more than 4m doses a week were being given. A third of the mass vaccination centres that were in place then have closed and GPs are back doing their day to day work. But what we've seen is pharmacies step up and we've heard about the military and other people coming in to help them. There are about 30 hospitals currently vaccinating the public - but around 200 that could be opened up to do that too. If they manage to do all that and do it quickly, then the end of January is achievable. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The advice from the prime minister was clear - donât cancel
your Christmas plans, and do get your booster. He defended the governmentâs reluctance to move to Plan B - which would involve advising people in England to work from
home if they can (as they are advised to do in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland). The leader of the lockdown-resistant Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs â
the former chief whip Mark Harper â says he gives the government ""credit"" for
this. But note, Boris Johnson refused to rule this out completely. The best he could promise, choosing his words carefully, was
this: ""The kind of lockdown we had before is extremely unlikely."" It would seem that further restrictions will be dependent
more on the progress of the pandemic than on politics. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The UK has bought hundreds of thousands of doses of a powerful antiviral drug that can treat Covid. The treatment,molnupiravir,could help those who are most at risk of getting severely ill if they catch the virus. In trials, the twice daily pills cut the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. The therapy works in a different way to current vaccines and should be very effective even against new variants, such as Omicron. A question now from Bloomberg on working from home - and why England is out of kilter with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson says this is not something the government thinks is necessary - it has a package of measures to deal with the Delta variant and they've been working. He says the reason for not implementing Plan B - a contingency to protect the NHS which includes guidance to work from home - is in order to take an approach that is ""proportionate and balanced"". He will change things as necessary, but is looking for reassurance that vaccines are effective against Omicron. And the PM ends the briefing with a mention of Storm Arwen, saying how sympathetic he is to people in the million or so homes that have lost electricity - and assuring those still without power that the government is doing what it can to restore it. Next, the PM is asked if he can reassure businesses that are worried about another so-called ""pingdemic"". Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe, from the Financial Times, says the government has ruled out a ""Plan B"" to tackle Covid, but can the PM confirm contingency measures like working from home won't be taken if there's a surge? Johnson says he does not think a return to the ""pingdemic"" of July is likely to happen (where people were alerted to contact with Covid cases) because the numbers of cases of Omicron are small. But that will have to stay under review. ""We haven't ruled out anything, I think another lockdown of the kind we've had before is extremely unlikely but we keep everything under constant review,"" he says. On local lockdown measures he says: ""We've settled pretty much on the view that moving together is the way to do it."" Is there community transmission of the new Omicron variant in the UK, the Daily Mail's Jason Groves asks Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Javid replies that they are ""not able to say"" at the moment, but it's likely. Boris Johnson is asked whether he would encourage people who are already scrapping school Nativity plays and Christmas parties in response to the government's new rules to ""think again"". ""We don't want people to cancel such events,"" the prime minister replies - and the ""best place"" for children to be is in school. Â© 2025 BBC.

UK competition watchdog orders Meta to sell Giphy,"Facebook's parent company, Meta, has been ordered to sell Giphy by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. The company, then known simply as Facebook, bought the Gif-sharing search engine last year for a reported $315m (Â£236m). It planned to integrate Giphy's vast database of looping short video animations with another of its existing social-media platforms, Instagram. But the CMA ruled the purchase unfair to competing social-media platforms. Facebook adopted Meta as its new corporate name, in October - but individual platforms owned by the company, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, retain their original identities. In May 2020, when it announced its acquisition of Giphy, it said 50% of the Gif search engine's traffic already came from Facebook platforms - half of that from Instagram. But Giphy also provides Gifs to competitors such as TikTok, Snapchat and Twitter. Gif stands for Graphics Interchange Format, an image format developed in the 1980s to display static and moving images. And they have become a staple of social-media posts and comments. The CMA said: ""After consulting with interested businesses and organisations - and assessing alternative solutions put forward by Facebook - the CMA has concluded that its competition concerns can only be addressed by Facebook selling Giphy in its entirety to an approved buyer.""

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Stuart McIntosh, who chaired the independent inquiry into the acquisition, said without action it would ""allow Facebook to increase its significant market power in social media even further, through controlling competitors' access to Giphy Gifs"". ""By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social-media users and promoting competition and innovation in digital advertising,"" he added. Experts said the decision by the regulator was a significant one. Peter Broadhurst, partner at law firm Crowell & Moring, said: ""This is the first time the CMA has ever blocked a major digital tech deal and indicates the direction of travel for the UK regulator's oversight of similar deals going forward."" In its decision the CMA noted that Giphy's advertising services had the ""potential"" to compete with Facebook's. ""This will cause quite a lot of uncertainty for companies trying to do deals where the parties don't actually compete but maybe could do in the future - particularly where one of them may be big in its own market,"" said Mr Broadhurst. But Meta told BBC News: ""We disagree with this decision. ""We are reviewing the decision and considering all options, including appeal. ""Both consumers and Giphy are better off with the support of our infrastructure, talent, and resources. ""Together, Meta and Giphy would enhance Giphy's product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API [application programming interface] partners in the UK and around the world who use Giphy every day, providing more choices for everyone."" In June 2020, the CMA sent an enforcement order to Facebook, effectively putting a hold on any merging of the companies until its investigation was over. In August 2021, it announced its provisional findings - the acquisition would ""harm competition between social-media platforms and remove a potential challenger in the display-advertising market"". At the time, the CMA warned ""it could require Facebook to unwind the deal and sell off Giphy in its entirety"". ButMeta's lawyers,externalsaid this provisional finding contained ""fundamental errors of law and fact"". By seeking to undo the acquisition ""in circumstances where Giphy does not even carry on business in the UK, not only is the CMA engaging in extraterritorial overreach but the CMA is sending a chilling message to start-up entrepreneurs, 'Do not build new companies because you will not be able to sell them,'"" they said.

Zara founderâs daughter gets top job at fashion giant,"High Street fashion giant Inditex, which owns brands including Zara and Massimo Dutti, has appointed the founder's daughter as its new chairwoman. Marta Ortega will replace Pablo Isla, chairman of Inditex since 2011. Ms Ortega has been with the firm for 15 years, starting out as an assistant at its High Street brand Bershka. ""I have always said I would dedicate my life to building upon my parents' legacy,"" the 37-year-old said. ""I have lived and breathed this company since my childhood, and I have learned from all the great professionals I have worked with over the last 15 years,"" said Ms Ortega, adding that she was deeply honoured by the trust the firm was placing in her. Ms Ortega has been credited with strengthening the retailer's brand image, having led several campaigns, including the launch of Zara's premium collections such as Zara SRPLS and Charlotte Gainsbourg by Zara. Inditex was founded by Amancio Ortega with his ex-wife Rosalia in 1975 in Galicia, Spain. Mr Ortega is one of the world's richest men, with an estimated net worth of $77.8bn (Â£58.3bn), according to Forbes. He was chairman of Inditex until 2011. Inditex, whose brands also include Pull&Bear and Stradivariusm, has come to dominate High Streets around the world, with more than 6,600 shops globally. Most of its clothing is made close to its Spanish headquarters or in nearby countries such as Portugal, Morocco and Turkey, helping the firm to achieve its famously fast reaction times to new fashion trends. by Vivienne Nunis, BBC business reporter Marta Ortega PÃ©rez began working for Inditex on a shop floor in London 15 years ago. Her new job will be as the company's chairwoman, helping steer a retail behemoth with nearly 7,000 stores, more than 8,000 factories and a market value of $100bn. Is she the right person for the job? She says she's grown up around the company and learned a lot in her time formally working there. But others will see this more as a Spanish version of the hit HBO series ""Succession"", where family members are given preference for top jobs over better qualified members of the team. Indeed shares in Inditex have fallen on news of the appointment. Alongside new chief executive Ãscar GarcÃ­a Maceiras, Marta Ortega PÃ©rez will face a number of challenges. At a time when consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental costs of fast fashion, Zara particularly is in an awkward spot - its reputation is built on bringing style trends to High Street stores quickly and cheaply. There are also supply chain concerns. Just this week, authorities in the French city of Bordeaux rejected plans by a Zara store to double its floor space, over allegations the fashion label may have profited from the forced labour of Uighurs in China. But the new chief executive and chairwoman are unlikely to be steering the Inditex ship without the help of founder Amancio. When he resigned as chairman in 2011, he didn't put his feet up. Instead the man known as ""The Boss"" has remained very much involved in the company. Though now aged in his 80s, it's a fair bet he'll remain so, even with the appointment of the new executive team. The group also announced the appointment of new chief executive Ãscar GarcÃ­a Maceiras on Tuesday. He joined Inditex in March as general counsel and secretary of the board, following a career as a Spanish state attorney and in the private sector working for several Spanish banks. Inditex shares fell almost 5% after the announcement. Analysts at Kepler said outgoing chairman Mr Isla had driven Inditex's big international expansion over the past 17 years. ""We believe that the timing is not the best ... as we believe that both Marta Ortega and the CEO Oscar Maceiras have a lot to prove when it comes to their ability to run this big monster in the middle of the Covid crisis,"" it said. Maureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, says investors and analysts are ""nervous"" about Marta Ortega because she is not well known outside the fashion group, but she doesn't think it is fair to make assumptions about the future of Zara and its owner Inditex. ""They've got two people there who have relevant and long experience of the company - Carlos Crespo and Oscar Maceiras,"" she told the BBC. ""The current chief executive Carlos Crespo has moved over to become chief operating officer, so it's not like he's leaving the company. And they say Oscar Maceiras is good at team building."" She said talks about a succession plan had been underway at Inditex since Amancio Ortega stepped down in 2011: ""It was something that was going to happen eventually."" Commenting on Ms Ortega's past performance at Zara, Ms Hinton said: ""It seems to me she has more marketing experience than managing experience, but as chairperson she will be steering the direction of the company, rather than hands-on day-to-day management.""

Global markets fall after Moderna Omicron warningStock markets slide after Moderna boss casts doubt on vaccine effectiveness against new variant.Business,"Stock markets around the world have fallen after the boss of Moderna cast doubts on the effectiveness of vaccines against the new Omicron Covid variant. Stephane Banceltold the Financial Times,externalhe thought there would be a ""material drop"" in vaccine efficacy. The Covid variant was first detected in South Africa, and thesymptoms have been mild so far. But travel restrictions have been imposed as a precaution by placesincluding the UK, the EU and the US. Mr Bancel predicted that existing vaccines would be less effective in staving off Omicron, and that it would take months for drugs companies to update vaccines. ""There is no world, I think, where [the effectiveness] is the same level,"" he said. In the US, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broader S&P 500 share indexes closed 1.9% lower. The tech-focused Nasdaq lost 1.6%. The falls also follow remarks by the chairman of the Federal Reserve suggesting that the emergence of the new variant would worsen uncertainty around the economic recovery and inflation. In response to a question, Mr Powell also said it was time to retire the term ""transitory"" which he has used to describe recent high rates of inflation. The Federal Reserve should consider tapering bond purchases more quickly, the first step towards raising interest rates, he added. The US market falls followed similar declines in Europe and Asia. The UK'sFTSE 100share index, Germany'sDax, and France'sCac 40slipped more than 1.5% each before regaining ground, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 lost 1.5%, hitting its lowest level in nearly seven weeks. Tokyo's Nikkei index closed down 1.6%, crude oil prices fell nearly 3%, and the Australian dollar hit a one-year low. Omicron pauses the return to economic normality How can I tell I have Omicron? There was also a scramble for assets that are considered to be safer in times of uncertainty, such as gold, German government bonds, and the yen. ""It's not good news, and it's coming from someone who should know,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency strategist Joe Capurso. ""Markets have reacted in exactly the way you'd expect them to."" Markets plunged on Friday after investors were rattled by the discovery of the new variant, with the FTSE 100 indexsuffering its biggest drop in more than a year. Stock markets rebounded slightly on Monday, but are still far below last week's levels. However, both the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250, which is more focused on UK firms, are still substantially higher than this time last year - up about 8.3% and 9.6% respectively. Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms or falls owing to coronavirus or the financial crisis. There are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances. There are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Timing is more critical for those at retirement age, as this may be when a retiree uses their pension pot to buy a retirement income, or annuity. The bigger the pot, the more income they will get in retirement. Read more here. Uncertainty about the new variant has triggered global alarm, with border measures casting a shadow over the economic recovery from the Covid pandemic that has been taking place. It comes asinfections rise again in some European countries. However, European Medicines Agency (EMA) executive director Emer Cooke told the European Parliament that even if the new variant becomes more widespread, existing vaccines should continue to provide protection. Andrea Ammon, who chairs the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC), said 42 cases of the variant had been confirmed in 10 EU countries. There were another six ""probable"" cases. She said the cases were mild or without symptoms, although in younger age groups. The science may still be uncertain but the Omicron variant has definitively intruded upon recent stock market euphoria. The designation as a variant of concern last week, and then further comments this morning from vaccine makers that existing vaccines will not be as effective, has caused widespread and significant falls in share prices. So what will the economic effect be? It should be limited and that is mainly because it's clear that the UK Government and the US Government will do everything to avoid any further lockdowns. The world awaits the health data from hospitals, first from South Africa's outbreak, and then elsewhere, about its transmissibility and severity. The new restrictions announced here in the UK and around the world reflect real time science, and in particular an expectation that the variant takes some bricks out of the wall of vaccine immunity. That in and of itself will have some economic impact. In the UK, real time data from restaurant reservations and online job adverts were well above the equivalent day last year. Retail footfall was just 8% below the equivalent day in 2019. Things were beginning to get back to normal, even with a considerable number of Delta cases, and a steady stream of weekly deaths. Omicron has paused some of this process, merely by injecting a doubt that the pandemic is behind us. Read more from Faisal here The World Health Organization has said it could take weeks to determine how severe Omicron infections could be, and how much protection current vaccines give. The University of Oxford said there was no evidence that current vaccines would not prevent severe disease from Omicron, but that it was ready to rapidly develop an updated version of its shot with AstraZeneca, if that is necessary. Moderna and fellow drugs firms BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson are working on vaccines that specifically target Omicron in case existing shots are not effective against it. Moderna has also been testing a higher dose of its existing booster.

"Sex harassment rife in Australia parliament - reportCanberra's workplace culture has left a ""trail of devastation"" for women especially, a review finds.Australia","Former political staffer Brittany Higgins inspired others to come forward with allegations A third of employees in Australia's federal parliament have been sexually harassed, a landmark report has found. The report was commissioned after a former staffer, Brittany Higgins, said she had been raped by a colleague in a minister's office. Her story earlier this year triggered a wave of wide-ranging allegations of misconduct in Canberra. The victims were disproportionately women, said Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins. The report,titled Set the Standard,external, found 51% of staffers had experienced some form of bullying, sexual harassment or actual or attempted sexual assault. ""Such experiences leave a trail of devastation for individuals and their teams and undermine the performance of our parliament to the nation's detriments,"" said Ms Jenkins, the report's author. Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the findings as ""appalling"", adding: ""I wish I found it more surprising"". Mr Morrison has previously beenaccused of being ""tone deaf""on issues disproportionately affecting women in parliament. The review, tabled in federal parliament,externalon Tuesday, interviewed 1,723 people and 33 organisations. It found 63% of female parliamentarians had experienced sexual harassment - an even higher percentage than for political staffers.

Mandatory masks: 'We worry people won't come in'Shopkeepers are concerned about enforcing mask-wearing and fear they will have to close again.Business,"Sisters Katie Pitts and Karen Caton fear customers might not come into their shop if they have to put on a mask Face coverings have become mandatory again in shops and on public transport in England as a precaution against the new Omicron variant of coronavirus. But shopkeepers are concerned that this could have a serious impact on their businesses, at a time when violence and verbal abuse against retail and hospitality staff is at an all-time high. Here's what people in the sector had to say. Katie Pitts, co-owner of Leeds-based fashion boutique The Dressing Room, is worried that frustration over the pandemic might affect consumers' spending behaviour this Christmas. ""We've got a lot of lovely customers who have helped us through a tough time, but people are a bit frustrated,"" she says. ""We're a non-essential retailer, so if they don't feel like wearing a mask, they might not come in."" Although The Dressing Room has a website, 70% of all sales still come from footfall to the store, as customers prefer to try clothing on before they buy, says Ms Pitt. So far, no customers have declined to wear masks and Ms Pitts hopes it stays that way. ""It's not a discussion we want to have, it's not our rule, it's a rule we have to go by,"" she says. Where do you have to wear masks now? Nigel Bourne has had to ask people to leave his shop because they refused to wear a mask Nigel Bourne, the owner of Sussex-based cookware retailer Rye Cookshop, tells the BBC face covering rules should ""never have gone out in the first place"". He says he wishes the government would ""be stronger on advertising"" how people should wear masks, having experienced some customers wearing them wrongly. The shop owner, based in Rye, East Sussex, says he hasn't had to call the police over people not wearing masks as no-one has been abusive. But he has had to ask people to leave his shop. ""It's hard work all the policing of it. We do it for ourselves and for other people. I do not want to work in a shop where people are not wearing their masks properly. ""If the law says you have got to wear it, wear it."" The guidance over how face coverings will be enforced in shops and on public transport will be set out in due course, the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC. The National Police Chiefs' Council says police forces will ""continue to enforce coronavirus regulations where it is necessary to do so"" and will support transport and retail staff in ensuring people wear face coverings. It is unclear whether penalties for those who refuse to wear masks without good reason will change. Previously, people faced a Â£200 fine which was reduced to Â£100 if paid within 14 days. The fine doubled for each subsequent offence and could go up to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. Assistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill says officers will respond to incidents where ""individuals are violent or abusive towards staff or members of the public"" and will be more visible in towns and shopping centres. According to theOffice for National Statistics,external, 85% of adults said they had worn a face covering outside their home in the past seven days, with 70% saying they wore one often or always while shopping. However, just 18% of people shopping said that everyone or almost everyone they saw was wearing a face covering. Supermarket chain Iceland says it will not be policing whether customers are wearing face masks. Iceland's managing director Richard Walker told the BBC's Today programme that while staff and customer safety was a priority, he did not want to put his staff at ""risk of confrontation or abuse"". ""I think over 90% of retail staff have been threatened, assaulted or abused in the last 12 months and we alone have had over 4,000 incidents of reported verbal abuse each year,"" he said. During the first coronavirus lockdown from March-May last year, the number of incidents rose to more than 50 incidents a week, he added. ""Since staff were told not to challenge customers, that figure dropped tenfold to five a week,"" said Mr Walker. ""So I think if the government want it to happen, they must step in to help businesses like us and police the wearing of masks."" While many consumers follow mask-wearing rules, violence and verbal abuse against retail workers is at an all-time high According to consumer expert Kate Hardcastle, business owners are particularly worried about experiencing abuse, particularly when it comes to enforcing social distancing rules. ""Small businesses say they have felt intimidated - one told me they feel they can't operate in their store by themselves. ""They feel they have to have another presence there as support, in case something happens."" Retailers are concerned about damaging the relationship with their customers, says Ms Hardcastle, at a time when they can't really afford for anything else to go wrong. ""Not only is it unpleasant to deal with, but a lot of shop owners are experiencing recruitment issues. It's not going to entice someone to go into a retail career if they have to cope with ongoing abuse,"" she says. But most of all, Ms Hardcastle says businesses are really ""terrified"" of being ordered by the government to close again. Rebecca Morter, chief executive of Lone Design Club, wants to avoid having to close her business again this Christmas Rebecca Morter, chief executive of sustainable fashion shop Lone Design Club, says she has encountered a couple of customers who don't want to follow Covid rules on masks and social distancing in the past. She agrees with Ms Hardcastle that retailers are most concerned about being forced to close again. ""Anything that helps prevent the new variant and keep the virus spreading is a good thing,"" she says. ""I understand that some people disagree, but we really, really don't want to go into another lockdown, so for us it's important that everyone follows the rules so we can stay open."" Manchester shopping mall the Trafford Centre told the BBC it would be deploying staff to hand out free masks and encouraging shoppers to wear face coverings unless they are exempt. Doug Russell, health and safety officer at shop workers' union Usdaw, says it is ""extremely regrettable"" that the government didn't keep existing rules on masks in place as the country reopened. Yet workers had no power to make customers wear them anyway, he adds, and that is unlikely to change this time. The fact the issue ""attracted so much aggression by a minority of people"" is a ""social bafflement"", adds Mr Russell. He says the new rules are inevitably going to lead to more ""clashes"" between shop workers and small groups of people who refuse to wear masks. ""Shop workers have been at the forefront all the way throughout the pandemic."" Shoppers asked to respect new mandatory mask rules Where do I still need to wear a mask?

Barbados becomes the world's newest republic,"This video can not be played In a midnight ceremony, a new era begins in Barbados Barbados has officially removed Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state and become the world's newest republic. In an overnight ceremony in the capital, Bridgetown, Dame Sandra Mason was sworn in as president. The Prince of Wales and Barbadian singer Rihanna attended the event, which coincided with the country's 55th anniversary of independence. In a speech, Prince Charles acknowledged the ""appalling atrocity of slavery"" the Caribbean island suffered. The new era for Barbados ends Britain's centuries of influence over the island, which was a hub for the transatlantic slave trade for more than 200 years. To signify the official change of power, a final salute was made to the British monarchy and the Royal Standard flag was lowered and replaced. Speaking as the guest of honour at the event, Prince Charles reiterated the continuing ties between the two nations despite the constitutional status change. He described the moment as a new beginning before being awarded the prestigious Order of Freedom of Barbados by the new president. The Queen sent the country her ""warmest good wishes"" for ""happiness, peace and prosperity in the future"" and said the nation holds a ""special place"" in her heart. Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? Seven things you might not know about the Commonwealth Dame Sandra Mason, 72, the island's governor-general since 2018, was named as president-elect of the nation following a vote in parliament last month. She now replaces the Queen as the head of state. ""Vessel Republic Barbados has set sail on her maiden voyage. May she weather all storms and land our country and citizens safely on the horizons and shores which are ahead of us,"" she said after being sworn in. Barbados announced its plan to become a republic last year, but it will remain within the Commonwealth. Formerly known as the British Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Nations is a loose association of former British colonies and current dependencies, along with some countries that have no historical ties to Britain. Prince Charles travelled to Bridgetown as a guest of honour at the ceremony The British monarch's Royal Standard flag was taken down and replaced to mark the official change of status Rihanna was declared a national hero at the independence day event Leading national figures, including Prime Minister Mia Mottley, swore allegiance to Barbados in front of the new president at the ceremony, which lasted for several hours. She later announced that pop star Rihanna would be named a national hero by President Mason. The artist and businesswoman, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, waspreviously named an ambassador by her home countryin 2018. ""May you continue to shine like a diamond and bring honour to your nation,"" Ms Mottley said, in reference to one of Rihanna's songs. In the heat of a Barbados night, the handover ceremony has combined pomp and ceremony with one big party. It has been a show of national pride with a sprinkling of this island's most famous names as VIP guests including the cricketer Sir Garfield Sobers and the singer Rihanna. In between them both sat the Prince of Wales. It must have been a moment of mixed emotions for him - he took the final salute and watched the Royal Standard lowered for the last time as his mother was removed as head of state. He used his speech to emphasise the pain of slavery and the enduring friendship of the two nations. The mood music from the royal household has been positive and pragmatic. They can't stop a constitutional shift but they can try to ensure positive relationships remain. The country's prime minister has described the move to a republic as a ""seminal moment"" which will see Barbados fully leave its colonial past behind. It was one of England's first slave colonies. English settlers first occupied the island in 1627 and, under British control, it became a sugar plantation economy using enslaved people brought in from Africa. Slavery was abolished in Barbados in 1834 and the country became fully independent in 1966. In his speech on Tuesday, Prince Charles spoke of the ""appalling atrocity of slavery"" which he said ""forever stains our history"". Before Barbados, the last nation to remove the Queen as head of state was Mauritius in 1992. With a population of about 285,000 people, Barbados is one of the more populous and prosperous Caribbean islands. Once heavily dependent on sugar exports, its economy has diversified but has been hit hard by Covid-19 hurting tourism and rising prices caused by supply chain disruptions.

Zara founderâs daughter steps up at fashion giant,"High Street fashion giant Inditex, which owns brands including Zara and Massimo Dutti, has appointed the founder's daughter as its new chairwoman. Marta Ortega will replace Pablo Isla, chairman of Inditex since 2011. Ms Ortega has been with the firm for 15 years, starting out as an assistant at its High Street brand Bershka. ""I have always said I would dedicate my life to building upon my parents' legacy,"" the 37-year-old said. ""I have lived and breathed this company since my childhood, and I have learned from all the great professionals I have worked with over the last 15 years,"" said Ms Ortega, adding that she was deeply honoured by the trust the firm was placing in her. Ms Ortega has been credited with strengthening the retailer's brand image, having led several campaigns, including the launch of Zara's premium collections such as Zara SRPLS and Charlotte Gainsbourg by Zara. Inditex was founded by Amancio Ortega with his ex-wife Rosalia in 1975 in Galicia, Spain. Mr Ortega is one of the world's richest men, with an estimated net worth of $77.8bn (Â£58.3bn), according to Forbes. He was chairman of Inditex until 2011. Inditex, whose brands also include Pull&Bear and Stradivariusm, has come to dominate High Streets around the world, with more than 6,600 shops globally. Most of its clothing is made close to its Spanish headquarters or in nearby countries such as Portugal, Morocco and Turkey, helping the firm to achieve its famously fast reaction times to new fashion trends. by Vivienne Nunis, BBC business reporter Marta Ortega PÃ©rez began working for Inditex on a shop floor in London 15 years ago. Her new job will be as the company's chairwoman, helping steer a retail behemoth with nearly 7,000 stores, more than 8,000 factories and a market value of $100bn. Is she the right person for the job? She says she's grown up around the company and learned a lot in her time formally working there. But others will see this more as a Spanish version of the hit HBO series ""Succession"", where family members are given preference for top jobs over better qualified members of the team. Indeed shares in Inditex have fallen on news of the appointment. Alongside new chief executive Ãscar GarcÃ­a Maceiras, Marta Ortega PÃ©rez will face a number of challenges. At a time when consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental costs of fast fashion, Zara particularly is in an awkward spot - its reputation is built on bringing style trends to High Street stores quickly and cheaply. There are also supply chain concerns. Just this week, authorities in the French city of Bordeaux rejected plans by a Zara store to double its floor space, over allegations the fashion label may have profited from the forced labour of Uighurs in China. But the new chief executive and chairwoman are unlikely to be steering the Inditex ship without the help of founder Amancio. When he resigned as chairman in 2011, he didn't put his feet up. Instead the man known as ""The Boss"" has remained very much involved in the company. Though now aged in his 80s, it's a fair bet he'll remain so, even with the appointment of the new executive team. The group also announced the appointment of new chief executive Ãscar GarcÃ­a Maceiras on Tuesday. He joined Inditex in March as general counsel and secretary of the board, following a career as a Spanish state attorney and in the private sector working for several Spanish banks. Inditex shares fell almost 5% after the announcement. Analysts at Kepler said outgoing chairman Mr Isla had driven Inditex's big international expansion over the past 17 years. ""We believe that the timing is not the best ... as we believe that both Marta Ortega and the CEO Oscar Maceiras have a lot to prove when it comes to their ability to run this big monster in the middle of the Covid crisis,"" it said. Maureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, says investors and analysts are ""nervous"" about Marta Ortega because she is not well known outside the fashion group, but she doesn't think it is fair to make assumptions about the future of Zara and its owner Inditex. ""They've got two people there who have relevant and long experience of the company - Carlos Crespo and Oscar Maceiras,"" she told the BBC. ""The current chief executive Carlos Crespo has moved over to become chief operating officer, so it's not like he's leaving the company. And they say Oscar Maceiras is good at team building."" She said talks about a succession plan had been underway at Inditex since Amancio Ortega stepped down in 2011: ""It was something that was going to happen eventually."" Commenting on Ms Ortega's past performance at Zara, Ms Hinton said: ""It seems to me she has more marketing experience than managing experience, but as chairperson she will be steering the direction of the company, rather than hands-on day-to-day management.""

MPs back setting ground rents at one peppercorn,"MPs have backed setting the cost of ground rents on new houses in England and Wales at ""one peppercorn"" a year. The government-sponsored plan, if it becomes law, will effectively leave owners who buy only leases - rather than freeholds - paying nothing. The move follows concerns that leaseholders are being charged exorbitant, fast-rising ground rents. But Labour says ministers need to go further and completely ban the selling of houses without a freehold. The Leasehold Reform Bill passed its first stage in the Commons unopposed on Monday. The bill, which has already been passed by the House of Lords, will now undergo further scrutiny by MPs before it can become law. Leasehold campaigners welcome new changes Government vows to end complex leasehold costs It is relatively normal for someone buying part of a shared building - such as a flat in a converted house or purpose-built block - to own just a leasehold, lasting up to 999 years. Someone else owns the freehold - the property as a whole and the land on which it is built. In this situation, the leaseholder pays ground rent to the freeholder. But, according to research from 2018 by Propertymark, the association for letting and estate agents, the arrangement isincreasingly being applied to people purchasing new-build houses.,externalMany buyers claim they have been mis-sold a leasehold by a developer. In 2018 the government consulted on capping ground rent on leasehold houses at Â£10 a year, butthe Leasehold Reform Bill,externalstipulates setting the annual rate at ""one peppercorn"". Housing Minister Eddie Hughes told the House of Commons that the system had become ""a nightmare for some"" new-house buyers. ""Regardless of whether the ground rent is a nominal peppercorn or thousands of pounds, the fundamental issue is that no meaningful service is is provided in return,"" he added. ""We want to end this for new leases. That's why we're legislating, so that new residential long leases will have no financial demand for ground rent. ""Instead, nothing more than an actual peppercorn can be collected from the leaseholder."" Pepper is an expensive commodity, but individual corns do not command a high value The term ""peppercorn"", referring to non-existent or minuscule payments, is thought to date back to the 16th or 17th Century. While the spice itself was highly valuable in bulk, a single corn was considered to be of little worth. Mr Hughes said that, while freeholders could ""physically"" demand this payment, they were unlikely to do so, and that this would ensure meals remained ""well-seasoned"". For Labour, shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell said leases for both old and new houses should be banned. She said the system was a ""scam on an industrial scale"", adding that the bill did ""nothing for those trapped"" in existing leaseholds. But her party is supporting the legislation, while arguing it needs to go further. Someone who owns a property outright, including the land it is built on, is a freeholder. With a leasehold, the person owns a lease, which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes. When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years - but sometimes up to 999 years. People may extend their lease or buy the freehold, but this can be complicated and expensive and involve legal fees. Leasehold house owners are also often charged expensive ground rent, as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell.

Sex harassment rife in Australia parliament: Study,"Former political staffer Brittany Higgins inspired others to come forward with allegations A third of employees in Australia's federal parliament have been sexually harassed, a landmark report has found. The report was commissioned after a former staffer, Brittany Higgins, said she had been raped by a colleague in a minister's office. Her story earlier this year triggered a wave of wide-ranging allegations of misconduct in Canberra. The victims were disproportionately women, said Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins. The report,titled Set the Standard,external, found 51% of staffers had experienced some form of bullying, sexual harassment or actual or attempted sexual assault. ""Such experiences leave a trail of devastation for individuals and their teams and undermine the performance of our parliament to the nation's detriments,"" said Ms Jenkins, the report's author. Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the findings as ""appalling"", adding: ""I wish I found it more surprising"". Mr Morrison has previously beenaccused of being ""tone deaf""on issues disproportionately affecting women in parliament. The review, tabled in federal parliament,externalon Tuesday, interviewed 1,723 people and 33 organisations. It found 63% of female parliamentarians had experienced sexual harassment - an even higher percentage than for political staffers. One unnamed MP told the review: ""Aspiring male politicians who thought nothing of, in one case, picking you up, kissing you on the lips, lifting you up, touching you, pats on the bottom, comments about appearance, you know, the usual. The point I make with that ... [w]as the culture allowed it, encouraged it.""

Barbados becomes the world's newest republicThe Caribbean nation parts ways with the Queen in a ceremony attended by Prince Charles and Rihanna.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played In a midnight ceremony, a new era begins in Barbados Barbados has officially removed Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state and become the world's newest republic.

Slavery was abolished in Barbados in 1834 and the country became fully independent in 1966. In his speech on Tuesday, Prince Charles spoke of the ""appalling atrocity of slavery"" which he said ""forever stains our history"". Before Barbados, the last nation to remove the Queen as head of state was Mauritius in 1992. With a population of about 285,000 people, Barbados is one of the more populous and prosperous Caribbean islands. Once heavily dependent on sugar exports, its economy has diversified but has been hit hard by Covid-19 hurting tourism and rising prices caused by supply chain disruptions.

MPs back setting ground rents at one peppercornPeople with leases on new-build houses say freeholders are charging them exorbitant amounts.UK Politics,"MPs have backed setting the cost of ground rents on new houses in England and Wales at ""one peppercorn"" a year. The government-sponsored plan, if it becomes law, will effectively leave owners who buy only leases - rather than freeholds - paying nothing. The move follows concerns that leaseholders are being charged exorbitant, fast-rising ground rents. But Labour says ministers need to go further and completely ban the selling of houses without a freehold. The Leasehold Reform Bill passed its first stage in the Commons unopposed on Monday. The bill, which has already been passed by the House of Lords, will now undergo further scrutiny by MPs before it can become law. Leasehold campaigners welcome new changes Government vows to end complex leasehold costs It is relatively normal for someone buying part of a shared building - such as a flat in a converted house or purpose-built block - to own just a leasehold, lasting up to 999 years. Someone else owns the freehold - the property as a whole and the land on which it is built. In this situation, the leaseholder pays ground rent to the freeholder. But, according to research from 2018 by Propertymark, the association for letting and estate agents, the arrangement isincreasingly being applied to people purchasing new-build houses.,externalMany buyers claim they have been mis-sold a leasehold by a developer. In 2018 the government consulted on capping ground rent on leasehold houses at Â£10 a year, butthe Leasehold Reform Bill,externalstipulates setting the annual rate at ""one peppercorn"". Housing Minister Eddie Hughes told the House of Commons that the system had become ""a nightmare for some"" new-house buyers. ""Regardless of whether the ground rent is a nominal peppercorn or thousands of pounds, the fundamental issue is that no meaningful service is is provided in return,"" he added. ""We want to end this for new leases. That's why we're legislating, so that new residential long leases will have no financial demand for ground rent. ""Instead, nothing more than an actual peppercorn can be collected from the leaseholder."" Pepper is an expensive commodity, but individual corns do not command a high value The term ""peppercorn"", referring to non-existent or minuscule payments, is thought to date back to the 16th or 17th Century. While the spice itself was highly valuable in bulk, a single corn was considered to be of little worth. Mr Hughes said that, while freeholders could ""physically"" demand this payment, they were unlikely to do so, and that this would ensure meals remained ""well-seasoned"". For Labour, shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell said leases for both old and new houses should be banned. She said the system was a ""scam on an industrial scale"", adding that the bill did ""nothing for those trapped"" in existing leaseholds. But her party is supporting the legislation, while arguing it needs to go further. Someone who owns a property outright, including the land it is built on, is a freeholder. With a leasehold, the person owns a lease, which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes. When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years - but sometimes up to 999 years. People may extend their lease or buy the freehold, but this can be complicated and expensive and involve legal fees. Leasehold house owners are also often charged expensive ground rent, as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell.

"MI6 must adapt to survive, says spy chief","Richard Moore says the threat and opportunities posed by new technology are ""a white-hot focus"" for MI6 Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6, must become more open in order to do its secret work effectively. That's according to its chief, Richard Moore, in his first major public speech since taking on the role in October 2020. Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum computing and digital technology have combined to completely transform the way human intelligence is gathered by spies, presenting MI6 with major challenges in the digital age. Biometric data and facial recognition, for example, have made it far harder for intelligence officers to assume false identities in hostile countries without being recognised and exposed. It was revealed in September that inside MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross there is a real-life Q Section that works to provide Britain's spies with the latest gadgets to keep them safe and secret. But on Tuesday, in addressing the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Mr Moore will admit that mastering human intelligence in this era of accelerating technology is not something his service can do in its own. MI6 spies acquire secrets from overseas targets to help protect Britain's national security Mr Moore, who has spent 34 years working for MI6, will tell his audience it ""includes being more open, and partnering with the private sector to find new technologies"". He adds that ""advances in quantum engineering and engineered biology will change entire industries"". Advances here and in data science in general will have attractions for malign actors, both nation-state and trans-national terrorist groups. ""I am paid,"" he says, ""to look at the threat side of the ledger. MI6 deals with the world as it is, not as we would like it to be"". He describes the impact of all this revolutionary technical progress as ""a white-hot focus for MI6"". So where exactly does he say these threats to the UK's national security are coming from? Mr Moore lists China, Russia, Iran and international terrorism as the ""Big Four"" priorities for the (West's) intelligence world. ""Our adversaries are pouring money and ambition into mastering artificial intelligence, quantum computing and synthetic biology because they know... this will give them leverage"". Artificial intelligence has transformed the way information is gathered by spies As one of Britain's three intelligence agencies, along with the Security Service (MI5) and GCHQ, MI6's role has always been to acquire secrets from overseas targets to help protect Britain's national security. While human intelligence - old-fashioned spying - has been at the heart of its work, the MI6 chief points to his service's innovations over time.  Examples he cites are ""from the chemistry that enabled us to produce secret writing technologies in the early days, to the wireless and secure speech technologies we developed during the Second World War"". Today, he says, MI6 is a founding member of the UK's unified cyber command which counters state threats, terrorists and criminals and supports military operations. James Bond and MI6: Is there fact in fiction? The challenge of being gay and an MI6 spy The bizarre tale of the MP who faked his own death This speech could perhaps be seen as a belated admission that if it is not careful, MI6 risks getting left behind by the breakneck speed of advances in digital technology. ""We cannot hope to replicate the global tech industry, so we must tap into it,"" he says. "" Through the National Security Strategic Investment Fund we are opening up our mission problems to those with talent in organisations that wouldn't normally work with national security."" But such a sea change in the way MI6 works will not go unnoticed by Britain's adversaries. Going into partnership with others outside the closed world of career spies, whose lifelong mantra has been secrecy, brings with it an inherent risk of leaks or worse, however thoroughly people are vetted. MI6 may have no other choice but to go down this route - but it is still a bold move that could present the UK's enemies with some interesting opportunities.

LiveLivePM to confirm booster plans as new rules beginLess than a minute ago,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces that all adults will be offered a booster jab by the end of January People will be worked through by age group - as at other stages of the Covid vaccine roll-out - he tells a news conference ""We will let you know when it's your turn,"" NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard adds Health Secretary Sajid Javid meanwhile acknowledges the new variant is likely to be transmitting in the community Face coverings are mandatory again on public transport and in shops in England to try and combat Omicron Earlier, UK health security chief Dr Jenny Harries called on people not to socialise unnecessarily ahead of Christmas But Johnson later clarified: ""We are not changing the guidance on how you should be living your life"" Omicron was in Europe earlier than first believed, it emerges, with cases found in samples taken in the Netherlands Edited by James Clarke Today's live coverage was written by George Bowden, Matt Murphy, Mary O'Connor, Marie Jackson, Dulcie Lee, Jen Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Paul Seddon. It was edited by James Clarke and Claire Heald, with Kevin Ponniah at the helm. We'll be back for more tomorrow - hope you can join us again. As we near the end of our coverage, here's a quick reminder of today's main headlines:  A couple who were moved into forced isolation in a Dutch hospital after they walked out of a Covid-19 hotel have been told they can now leave. Carolina Pimenta tested positive for Covid-19 after landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on a flight from South Africa on Friday. She was arrested by military police on Sunday night on a plane about to take off for Spain. The couple have now been told prosecutors have decided not to pursue the case. Read the full story of what happened to them here. Some supermarkets in England say they won't be enforcing new face mask rules, instead they'll use a lighter touch. Icelandtells the BBC its staff will not ask customers to wear masks so they don't have to face abuse. Tesco, the largest UK supermarket chain, will just be putting up signs to remind customers about face mask rules, the BBC understands. AldiandLidlare also understood to have no plans to challenge customers. Sainsbury'ssays it will have ""greeters and security guards at the front of our supermarkets"" to remind people to wear masks. Morrisonsis expected to have staff checking mask wearing at the front of the shops, and will hand out masks to customers that have forgotten them. Asdaalso says it will hand out masks to shoppers who are without one. You can read morehere. As we reported earlier, Greece is making vaccines mandatory for anyone aged 60 and over from next year, and those who do not comply will face a â¬100 (Â£85) fine each month until they do so. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis said it was predominantly those over 60 who died of Covid, and that only 60,000 of the more than 500,000 unvaccinated citizens in that age group had got their first jab this month. ""I have no doubt that this political decision will save human lives. Because vaccination becomes more than just compulsory. It saves lives. It is necessary for health. It is necessary for the whole society. ""The funds collected by the fines will be given to our hospitals. It is not a punishment. I would say it is a health fee. An incentive for precaution, a life boost.  And I think it is also an act of justice for the people who are vaccinated. It is not acceptable for some people to be deprived of the health services they need because others stubbornly refuse to do the obvious Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greek Prime Minister He also added he had been âtorturedâ by the decision, but that he felt âa heavy responsibilityâ towards the most vulnerable, âeven if it might fleetingly displease themâ. Minister Darragh O'Brien confirmed the new rules will initially last for two weeks Turning to developments outside of the UK now, the Irish government will require all international travellers to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test prior to their arrival in the country, regardless of their vaccination status. The country's Housing Minister, Darragh O'Brien, told reporters passengers will be required to have taken a
lab-conducted antigen test no more than 48 hours before
travelling or a PCR test within 72 hours of arrival. O'Brien said restrictions will initially apply for a two-week period. The rules will apply to travellers arriving from Great Britain, but not to those crossing the border with Northern Ireland. Ireland's Department of Transport is in discussions with airlines and ferry companies to ensure the tests are checked before people board flights or ferries to the country. The move follows the UK government's decision to exclude Ireland and other Common Travel Area countries from similar rules it implemented for international arrivals on Saturday. Ireland is currently examining 11 suspected cases of the Omicron variant. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said it is likely the
new variant is already present in the country. In Northern Ireland, Covid-19 vaccination hubs have opened to help meet demand for booster doses, the health minister says. Robin Swann says the aim is to ""bring booster doses to all eligible age groups as quickly as possible"". Northern Irelandhas had the lowest uptake of the booster shot in the UK. Swann is urging the public not to ""be put off getting their first, second or booster doses due toconcerns or speculation about the Omicron variant"". This video can not be played The BBC's Philippa Roxby and Ione Wells answer your questions on the new Covid variant. After the UK government's latest update on coronavirus and booster jabs, BBC health correspondent Philippa Roxby and political correspondent Ione Wells answer your questions. The UK's Covid booster vaccine programme is being expanded amid concerns about the new Omicron variant. The government has set a target to offer all eligible adults in England the chance to book a booster by the end of January. A second vaccine dose will be offered to children aged 12-15. When can I get my booster? When you are contacted will depend on your age and whether you are in an at-risk group. Vulnerable people will be contacted first, then over-40s and older people, then younger age groups. However, people are being asked not to contact the NHS about their booster jab, and wait to be invited. Across England, jabs will be rolled out at 1,500 community pharmacies, extra hospital hubs and pop-up vaccination sites. ScotlandandWaleshave yet to finalise details of how boosters will be given out. Northern Ireland has announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Read morehere. A further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday. The average number of daily confirmed cases has bounced around since mid-July and was rising again through November, but has dipped in recent days. Another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported. The number of daily deaths has been falling steadily through November. As weâve been
reporting, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is trying to establish where
exactly in the UK the Omicron variant is. It's confirmed 22 cases have been detected, but as we've been reporting, the variant is likely to be transmitting in the community, so that number will grow. Earlier, we told you the Local
Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said that two cases had been detected in
Nottingham. However, it has since clarified that the cityhas only one case on recordâ a student, who has been self-isolating since they were infected. Here's a breakdown of cases in England confirmed by the UKHSA: And as weâve also
reported,there are 9 cases in Scotland. Five are in Lanarkshire and four are in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. This video can not be played PM: All adults to be offered a Covid booster by end of January Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the government's target is for all adults to be offered a Covid booster by the end of January, with temporary vaccination centres to be opened up, as at other stages of the vaccine roll-out. Reality Check At the Downing Street briefing just now,
Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We've delivered more booster doses
than any other country, with the exception of the USA and China."" Heâs
right in terms of thetotal number of booster doses,externalgiven. China has given 66 million, the US
has given 40 million and the UK is in third place with 18 million, according to
Our World in Data. In terms of the number of booster
doses given per head of the population, the UK is in seventh place, behind
Gibraltar, Israel, Chile, Uruguay, Iceland and the United Arab Emirates â
according to the same organisation's figures. The Downing Street coronavirus briefing led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just wrapped up. He was joined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England. In case you missed it, here's a quick round-up of what we learned: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The target of offering booster jabs to all adults in England by the end of January (and that means giving them the opportunity to book jabs) is ambitious - but how achievable is it? Crucially we have the supply. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are going to come into the country and there will be enough to vaccinate the eligible adult population. But at the moment, the NHS is not vaccinating at the rate it needs to if it is going to hit that target. Currently it is doing about 2.5m boosters a week, so that would take until the end of February to reach all adults in England. The PM acknowledged it's got to get back up to the levels seen in the spring - when more than 4m doses a week were being given. A third of the mass vaccination centres that were in place then have closed and GPs are back doing their day to day work. But what we've seen is pharmacies step up and we've heard about the military and other people coming in to help them. There are about 30 hospitals currently vaccinating the public - but around 200 that could be opened up to do that too. If they manage to do all that and do it quickly, then the end of January is achievable. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The advice from the prime minister was clear - donât cancel
your Christmas plans, and do get your booster. He defended the governmentâs reluctance to move to Plan B - which would involve advising people in England to work from
home if they can (as they are advised to do in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland). The leader of the lockdown-resistant Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs â
the former chief whip Mark Harper â says he gives the government ""credit"" for
this. But note, Boris Johnson refused to rule this out completely. The best he could promise, choosing his words carefully, was
this: ""The kind of lockdown we had before is extremely unlikely."" It would seem that further restrictions will be dependent
more on the progress of the pandemic than on politics. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The UK has bought hundreds of thousands of doses of a powerful antiviral drug that can treat Covid. The treatment,molnupiravir,could help those who are most at risk of getting severely ill if they catch the virus. In trials, the twice daily pills cut the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. The therapy works in a different way to current vaccines and should be very effective even against new variants, such as Omicron. A question now from Bloomberg on working from home - and why England is out of kilter with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson says this is not something the government thinks is necessary - it has a package of measures to deal with the Delta variant and they've been working. He says the reason for not implementing Plan B - a contingency to protect the NHS which includes guidance to work from home - is in order to take an approach that is ""proportionate and balanced"". He will change things as necessary, but is looking for reassurance that vaccines are effective against Omicron. And the PM ends the briefing with a mention of Storm Arwen, saying how sympathetic he is to people in the million or so homes that have lost electricity - and assuring those still without power that the government is doing what it can to restore it. Next, the PM is asked if he can reassure businesses that are worried about another so-called ""pingdemic"". Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe, from the Financial Times, says the government has ruled out a ""Plan B"" to tackle Covid, but can the PM confirm contingency measures like working from home won't be taken if there's a surge? Johnson says he does not think a return to the ""pingdemic"" of July is likely to happen (where people were alerted to contact with Covid cases) because the numbers of cases of Omicron are small. But that will have to stay under review. ""We haven't ruled out anything, I think another lockdown of the kind we've had before is extremely unlikely but we keep everything under constant review,"" he says. On local lockdown measures he says: ""We've settled pretty much on the view that moving together is the way to do it."" Is there community transmission of the new Omicron variant in the UK, the Daily Mail's Jason Groves asks Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Javid replies that they are ""not able to say"" at the moment, but it's likely. Boris Johnson is asked whether he would encourage people who are already scrapping school Nativity plays and Christmas parties in response to the government's new rules to ""think again"". ""We don't want people to cancel such events,"" the prime minister replies - and the ""best place"" for children to be is in school. Â© 2025 BBC.

Barbados becomes the world's newest republicThe Caribbean nation parts ways with the Queen in a ceremony attended by Prince Charles and Rihanna.,"This video can not be played In a midnight ceremony, a new era begins in Barbados Barbados has officially removed Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state and become the world's newest republic. In an overnight ceremony in the capital, Bridgetown, Dame Sandra Mason was sworn in as president. The Prince of Wales and Barbadian singer Rihanna attended the event, which coincided with the country's 55th anniversary of independence. In a speech, Prince Charles acknowledged the ""appalling atrocity of slavery"" the Caribbean island suffered. The new era for Barbados ends Britain's centuries of influence over the island, which was a hub for the transatlantic slave trade for more than 200 years. To signify the official change of power, a final salute was made to the British monarchy and the Royal Standard flag was lowered and replaced. Speaking as the guest of honour at the event, Prince Charles reiterated the continuing ties between the two nations despite the constitutional status change. He described the moment as a new beginning before being awarded the prestigious Order of Freedom of Barbados by the new president. The Queen sent the country her ""warmest good wishes"" for ""happiness, peace and prosperity in the future"" and said the nation holds a ""special place"" in her heart. Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? Seven things you might not know about the Commonwealth Dame Sandra Mason, 72, the island's governor-general since 2018, was named as president-elect of the nation following a vote in parliament last month. She now replaces the Queen as the head of state. ""Vessel Republic Barbados has set sail on her maiden voyage. May she weather all storms and land our country and citizens safely on the horizons and shores which are ahead of us,"" she said after being sworn in. Barbados announced its plan to become a republic last year, but it will remain within the Commonwealth. Formerly known as the British Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Nations is a loose association of former British colonies and current dependencies, along with some countries that have no historical ties to Britain. Prince Charles travelled to Bridgetown as a guest of honour at the ceremony The British monarch's Royal Standard flag was taken down and replaced to mark the official change of status Rihanna was declared a national hero at the independence day event Leading national figures, including Prime Minister Mia Mottley, swore allegiance to Barbados in front of the new president at the ceremony, which lasted for several hours. She later announced that pop star Rihanna would be named a national hero by President Mason. The artist and businesswoman, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, waspreviously named an ambassador by her home countryin 2018. ""May you continue to shine like a diamond and bring honour to your nation,"" Ms Mottley said, in reference to one of Rihanna's songs. In the heat of a Barbados night, the handover ceremony has combined pomp and ceremony with one big party. It has been a show of national pride with a sprinkling of this island's most famous names as VIP guests including the cricketer Sir Garfield Sobers and the singer Rihanna. In between them both sat the Prince of Wales. It must have been a moment of mixed emotions for him - he took the final salute and watched the Royal Standard lowered for the last time as his mother was removed as head of state. He used his speech to emphasise the pain of slavery and the enduring friendship of the two nations. The mood music from the royal household has been positive and pragmatic. They can't stop a constitutional shift but they can try to ensure positive relationships remain. The country's prime minister has described the move to a republic as a ""seminal moment"" which will see Barbados fully leave its colonial past behind. It was one of England's first slave colonies. English settlers first occupied the island in 1627 and, under British control, it became a sugar plantation economy using enslaved people brought in from Africa. Slavery was abolished in Barbados in 1834 and the country became fully independent in 1966. In his speech on Tuesday, Prince Charles spoke of the ""appalling atrocity of slavery"" which he said ""forever stains our history"". Before Barbados, the last nation to remove the Queen as head of state was Mauritius in 1992. With a population of about 285,000 people, Barbados is one of the more populous and prosperous Caribbean islands. Once heavily dependent on sugar exports, its economy has diversified but has been hit hard by Covid-19 hurting tourism and rising prices caused by supply chain disruptions.

Australia bank pays out over charging dead people,"Australian banking giant Westpac has admitted to breaking the law after it was hit with six lawsuits by regulators over its poor treatment of customers, including charging fees to dead people. It will pay $81m (A$113m; Â£61m) in penalties, subject to court approval. The bank will also hand $57m of compensation to its customers. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said Westpac needs to urgently improve its ""poor compliance culture"". ""The conduct and breaches alleged in these proceedings caused widespread consumer harm and ranged across Westpac's everyday banking, financial advice, superannuation and insurance businesses,"" ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said. ASIC,Australia's corporate watchdog,external, said one of the six investigations found the bank had charged more than $7m in fees over a 10-year period to more than 11,000 ""deceased customers for financial advice services that were not provided due to their death."" The regulator also said Westpac distributed duplicate insurance policies to more than 7,000 customers, causing customers to unnecessarily pay for two, or more, policies. It also estimated that at least 25,000 customers were charged more than $5m in fees that had not been disclosed adequately. ASIC said Westpac had admitted the allegations filed in the federal court. ""In each of these matters, Westpac has fallen short of our standards and the standards our customers expect of us. ""The issues raised in these matters should not have occurred, and our processes, systems and monitoring should have been better. We are putting things right and unreservedly apologise to our customers,""Westpac chief executive Peter King said in a statement,external. It is the latest major regulatory blow for Westpac. In September last year, it agreed to pay a record $930m fine for the country's biggest ever breach of money laundering laws. The previous year, Westpac's then-chief executive Brian Hartzer stepped down after the bank became embroiled in the money-laundering scandal. Also in 2019, a national inquiry into Australia's scandal-plagued financial sector proposed sweeping changes to the industry in an attempt to end rampant misconduct. The Royal Commission - Australia's highest form of public inquiry - spent 12 months investigating wrongdoing by some of the country's biggest institutions. It came aftera decade of scandals that shook confidence in Australia's largest industry.

England face mask rules return over variant fears,"Face coverings have become mandatory again on public transport and shops in England in an effort to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. People arriving in the UK from abroad will now also have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. It comes after 14 cases of the new variant were detected in the UK. Boris Johnson is expected to set out plans for the booster jab programme in England at a news conference later. On Monday the government announced a major expansion of the booster jab rollout as part of efforts to help stop a potential wave of infections. They areto be offered to all over-18s in the UK, with children aged 12 to 15 invited for a second jab. More local pharmacies could be used as part of the rollout and it is likely that there will be some prioritisation to ensure the vulnerable get their top-up shots first - as with the original scheme. What Covid rules are being toughened? How worrying is the new Covid variant? How do you detect Omicron? Three more Omicron cases have been found in Scotlandand Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said it is expected cases of the new variant will continue to rise. Early evidence suggests Omicron - first found in southern Africa - has a higher re-infection risk.

Mr Johnson said the new mask and testing measures would ""buy us time in the face of this new variant"". Richard Walker, managing director of the Iceland grocery chain, told the BBC his company supported compulsory mask wearing but he would not be asking staff to police those who refused to do so. Care Minister Gillian Keegan told BBC Breakfast that it was ""down to individuals"" to do the right thing, calling on the public to be ""sensible"", and said she understood Mr Walker's position. While it is still unclear the impact the new variant could have she said people should continue with their Christmas plans but be ""cautious"". Police in England say they will work ""in partnership with relevant business owners and their staff"" to ensure people comply with the new face coverings rules. Assistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said officers would engage with people not wearing face coverings and encourage them to do so. As a last resort people can be fined Â£200, reduced to Â£100 if paid within 14 days. The changes will be reviewed in three weeks' time and the health secretary told MPs they would be given a chance to vote on them. Scientists are agreed accelerating the booster programme is key to combatting Omicron if the worst fears are realised. That job though now lies in the hands of the NHS. And the challenge that it faces is that the infrastructure that was so successful in delivering the jabs in the first half of the year has been scaled back. Three-quarters of vaccinations were delivered by GP-led teams. But many of those GP and staff have now returned to their day jobs, focussing on the flu vaccine rollout and their patients. Around 50 mass vaccination centres have also been shut down. Restarting any of that will not be immediate so in the short-term the easiest solution is to extend the opening hours of the remaining big centres and providing more support to high street pharmacists who are also heavily involved. Currently around 2.5m booster jabs are being given each week - at that rate it could take around three months to provide boosters to everyone. Halving that would give the UK the best possible chance of combatting any Omicron wave.

"MI6 must adapt to survive, says spy chiefRichard Moore says the secret service must partner with the private sector to find new technologies.UK","Richard Moore says the threat and opportunities posed by new technology are ""a white-hot focus"" for MI6 Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6, must become more open in order to do its secret work effectively. That's according to its chief, Richard Moore, in his first major public speech since taking on the role in October 2020. Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum computing and digital technology have combined to completely transform the way human intelligence is gathered by spies, presenting MI6 with major challenges in the digital age. Biometric data and facial recognition, for example, have made it far harder for intelligence officers to assume false identities in hostile countries without being recognised and exposed. It was revealed in September that inside MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross there is a real-life Q Section that works to provide Britain's spies with the latest gadgets to keep them safe and secret. But on Tuesday, in addressing the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Mr Moore will admit that mastering human intelligence in this era of accelerating technology is not something his service can do in its own. MI6 spies acquire secrets from overseas targets to help protect Britain's national security Mr Moore, who has spent 34 years working for MI6, will tell his audience it ""includes being more open, and partnering with the private sector to find new technologies"". He adds that ""advances in quantum engineering and engineered biology will change entire industries"". Advances here and in data science in general will have attractions for malign actors, both nation-state and trans-national terrorist groups. ""I am paid,"" he says, ""to look at the threat side of the ledger. MI6 deals with the world as it is, not as we would like it to be"". He describes the impact of all this revolutionary technical progress as ""a white-hot focus for MI6"". So where exactly does he say these threats to the UK's national security are coming from? Mr Moore lists China, Russia, Iran and international terrorism as the ""Big Four"" priorities for the (West's) intelligence world. ""Our adversaries are pouring money and ambition into mastering artificial intelligence, quantum computing and synthetic biology because they know... this will give them leverage"". Artificial intelligence has transformed the way information is gathered by spies As one of Britain's three intelligence agencies, along with the Security Service (MI5) and GCHQ, MI6's role has always been to acquire secrets from overseas targets to help protect Britain's national security. While human intelligence - old-fashioned spying - has been at the heart of its work, the MI6 chief points to his service's innovations over time.

Mandatory masks: 'We worry people won't come in'Shopkeepers are concerned about enforcing mask-wearing and terrified they will have to close again.Business,"Sisters Katie Pitts and Karen Caton fear customers might not come into their shop if they have to put on a mask Face coverings have become mandatory again in shops and on public transport in England as a precaution against the new Omicron variant of coronavirus. But shopkeepers are concerned that this could have a serious impact on their businesses, at a time when violence and verbal abuse against retail and hospitality staff is at an all-time high. Here's what people in the sector had to say. Katie Pitts, co-owner of Leeds-based fashion boutique The Dressing Room, is worried that frustration over the pandemic might affect consumers' spending behaviour this Christmas. ""We've got a lot of lovely customers who have helped us through a tough time, but people are a bit frustrated,"" she says. ""We're a non-essential retailer, so if they don't feel like wearing a mask, they might not come in."" Although The Dressing Room has a website, 70% of all sales still come from footfall to the store, as customers prefer to try clothing on before they buy, says Ms Pitt. So far, no customers have declined to wear masks and Ms Pitts hopes it stays that way. ""It's not a discussion we want to have, it's not our rule, it's a rule we have to go by,"" she says. Where do you have to wear masks now? Nigel Bourne has had to ask people to leave his shop because they refused to wear a mask Nigel Bourne, the owner of Sussex-based cookware retailer Rye Cookshop, tells the BBC face covering rules should ""never have gone out in the first place"". He says he wishes the government would ""be stronger on advertising"" how people should wear masks, having experienced some customers wearing them wrongly. The shop owner, based in Rye, East Sussex, says he hasn't had to call the police over people not wearing masks as no-one has been abusive. But he has had to ask people to leave his shop. ""It's hard work all the policing of it. We do it for ourselves and for other people. I do not want to work in a shop where people are not wearing their masks properly. ""If the law says you have got to wear it, wear it."" The guidance over how face coverings will be enforced in shops and on public transport will be set out in due course, the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC. The National Police Chiefs' Council says police forces will ""continue to enforce coronavirus regulations where it is necessary to do so"" and will support transport and retail staff in ensuring people wear face coverings. It is unclear whether penalties for those who refuse to wear masks without good reason will change. Previously, people faced a Â£200 fine which was reduced to Â£100 if paid within 14 days. The fine doubled for each subsequent offence and could go up to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. Assistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill says officers will respond to incidents where ""individuals are violent or abusive towards staff or members of the public"" and will be more visible in towns and shopping centres. According to theOffice for National Statistics,external, 85% of adults said they had worn a face covering outside their home in the past seven days, with 70% saying they wore one often or always while shopping. However, just 18% of people shopping said that everyone or almost everyone they saw was wearing a face covering. Supermarket chain Iceland says it will not be policing whether customers are wearing face masks. Iceland's managing director Richard Walker told the BBC's Today programme that while staff and customer safety was a priority, he did not want to put his staff at ""risk of confrontation or abuse"". ""I think over 90% of retail staff have been threatened, assaulted or abused in the last 12 months and we alone have had over 4,000 incidents of reported verbal abuse each year,"" he said. During the first coronavirus lockdown from March-May last year, the number of incidents rose to more than 50 incidents a week, he added. ""Since staff were told not to challenge customers, that figure dropped tenfold to five a week,"" said Mr Walker. ""So I think if the government want it to happen, they must step in to help businesses like us and police the wearing of masks."" While many consumers follow mask-wearing rules, violence and verbal abuse against retail workers is at an all-time high According to consumer expert Kate Hardcastle, business owners are particularly worried about experiencing abuse, particularly when it comes to enforcing social distancing rules. ""Small businesses say they have felt intimidated - one told me they feel they can't operate in their store by themselves. ""They feel they have to have another presence there as support, in case something happens."" Retailers are concerned about damaging the relationship with their customers, says Ms Hardcastle, at a time when they can't really afford for anything else to go wrong. ""Not only is it unpleasant to deal with, but a lot of shop owners are experiencing recruitment issues. It's not going to entice someone to go into a retail career if they have to cope with ongoing abuse,"" she says. But most of all, Ms Hardcastle says businesses are really ""terrified"" of being ordered by the government to close again. Rebecca Morter, chief executive of Lone Design Club, wants to avoid having to close her business again this Christmas Rebecca Morter, chief executive of sustainable fashion shop Lone Design Club, says she has encountered a couple of customers who don't want to follow Covid rules on masks and social distancing in the past. She agrees with Ms Hardcastle that retailers are most concerned about being forced to close again. ""Anything that helps prevent the new variant and keep the virus spreading is a good thing,"" she says. ""I understand that some people disagree, but we really, really don't want to go into another lockdown, so for us it's important that everyone follows the rules so we can stay open."" Manchester shopping mall the Trafford Centre told the BBC it would be deploying staff to hand out free masks and encouraging shoppers to wear face coverings unless they are exempt. Doug Russell, health and safety officer at shop workers' union Usdaw, says it is ""extremely regrettable"" that the government didn't keep existing rules on masks in place as the country reopened. Yet workers had no power to make customers wear them anyway, he adds, and that is unlikely to change this time. The fact the issue ""attracted so much aggression by a minority of people"" is a ""social bafflement"", adds Mr Russell. He says the new rules are inevitably going to lead to more ""clashes"" between shop workers and small groups of people who refuse to wear masks. ""Shop workers have been at the forefront all the way throughout the pandemic."" Shoppers asked to respect new mandatory mask rules Where do I still need to wear a mask?
