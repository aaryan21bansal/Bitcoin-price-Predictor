UK's sexual health is 'not in good shape'Two charities are urging the government to increase funding to sexual health services and education.Newsbeat,"Two leading sexual health charities are calling on the government to invest more in sexual health clinics and sex education in the UK. Nearly half of all new sexually transmitted infections are in people under 25. And there's a new STI diagnosis in England every 70 seconds. The Terrence Higgins Trust and British Association for Sexual Health and HIV have teamed up to say more needs to be done. Their new report claims the government hascut sexual health spendingin England by 25% since 2014. The report looked into nearly half a million STI diagnoses in 2018 and found cases of gonorrhoea were up by 249% and syphilis up by 165% in the last ten years. Research also found that the people most affected by STIs were gay men, who accounted for 75% of all syphilis and nearly 50% of gonorrhoea diagnoses in England. What to do if you get an STI Sex diseases on the rise in England Some of the highest overall rates of STIs were reported in Black Caribbean and Black non-Caribbean/non-African populations. The report did find some positive action had been taken - HIV prevention tools (like the drug PReP) mean there had been a 6% reduction in diagnoses from 2017-2018. Dr Alex George shares his tips on dealing with STIs Dr Alex George has worked in obstetrics and gynaecology and offers sexual health advice on his social media and YouTube channel. ""The important thing is to not be worried about going to an STI clinic for a check up and asking any questions you might have,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""If you haven't had a check up in recent months or you've just got a new partner then please get yourself checked out."" He says that a good starting point is looking at resources online - including the sexual health charityBrook,externaland theNHS website,external. One of the big talking points to come from this recent survey is the worry people have about the stigma of visiting a sexual health clinic. ""Remember the number one thing is looking after you and your body - it's your right to look after your own health,"" Dr Alex says. ""If you go to a sexual health clinic and see other people, remember they are there for the same reason as you so take comfort in that and focus on the fact you are looking after yourself."" When it comes to having a conversation with a new partner about using a condom he says to ""remember safety first."" ""Be casual about the conversation and don't over-think it. People feel like they have to have a big conversation but just stay firm and do what you want to do. ""If the person doesn't want to use a condom then you have your answer there - do what you have to do,"" he says. There were nearly half a million sexually transmitted infection diagnoses in England in 2018 The HPV vaccine programme was also credited for reducing cases of genital warts by 3% since 2017. Recommendations in the report include providing local government with more funding to improve sexual health services and doing more to encourage people to get help even when they might feel there is stigma or discrimination linked with having an STI. Jonathan McShane, chair of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ""This report shows that the nation's sexual health is not in good shape and this must be a wake up call to the Government to take action.

NHS orders 'coronavirus pods' in England hospitals,"Every hospital in England is being asked to create ""priority assessment pods"" for patients with suspected coronavirus, the NHS has said. Patients who are concerned they may have the virus are still advised to isolate themselves and call 111. But the contingency measure is intended to prevent any patients who do arrive at hospital from mixing with vulnerable patients. The secure areas are expected to be introduced by Friday. In China, 490 people have died and 24,300 people have beenconfirmed to have contracted the new virus. It has now spread to 25 nations, with two cases in the UK. The new measure means that A&E departments will be able to direct people who think they have symptoms of the coronavirus to a pod away from other patients, where they can call specialist NHS 111 teams on a dedicated phone. An NHS spokeswoman said: ""Anyone with a cough, fever, or shortness of breath who attends hospital and has recently returned from China will be advised to follow signs to NHS 111 pods and call for advice, so they stay isolated from other patients and avoid causing unnecessary pressure in A&E."" Coronavirus outbreak hits cruise ship off Japan BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said the NHS is aware people may not always follow the advice to self-isolate if the virus starts to spread across England. The pods are meant to protect others using the hospitals - who may have vulnerable immune systems. ""The problem hospitals face is where to create these pods. There is not lots of spare space on many sites to house coronavirus patients and building separate facilities may not be practical,"" he said. A Scottish government spokesperson said it had detailed arrangements in place to carry out coronavirus test sampling, but these were being kept under review and additional measures would be introduced if necessary. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus Since the virus has spread overseas, 25 nations have confirmed a total of 191 cases, although there has been only one death so far, in the Philippines. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a global health emergency. On Tuesday, the Foreign Office advised all UK citizens to leave China if possible, to minimise the risk of exposure to the virus. Two flights from Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have originated, have brought 94 Britons and their family members back to the UK so far. They are now in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral for 14 days - the incubation period of the virus - to ensure they are not infected. A further eight UK nationals and six of their family members left on a flight to New Zealand on Tuesday, andthe Foreign Office is chartering a final repatriation flight on Sunday, to allow remaining Britons to leave Hubei province in China. The Foreign Office said there were between 150 and 200 UK citizens and their dependents remaining in this part of China, and about 100 of them have asked for help to leave. This video can not be played David Abel, one of 3,700 people in quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess, speaking soon after the quarantine began Another British man, David Abel, is in quarantine on a cruise ship docked in the Japanese port of Yokohamaafter a passenger from Hong Kong fell ill with the virus. At least 10 people on board the ship, the Diamond Princess, have since tested positive for the virus. Two people in the UK - a student at the University of York and one of their relatives - have been confirmed to have coronavirus and are being treated at the specialist infectious diseases unit at Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary. The Department of Health and Social Care said 466 people have tested negative for the virus. The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough.

The Trump impeachment story explainedFour numbers that explain why Trump was clearedVideoVideoTrump 'guilty of appalling abuse of public trust',"The story centred around a call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump You may have heard this one before: a controversy involving a foreign power that threatened the future of the Trump presidency. Donald Trump was impeached over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. In the end, he was cleared on two charges by a majority of senators at this trial. How did we get here? Let's break it down. President Trump was accused of breaking the law by pressuring Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival. In July 2019, he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate one of the frontrunners to take him on in the 2020 presidential election. This mattered, opposition Democrats said, because it is illegal to ask foreign entities for help in winning a US election. He says he has done nothing wrong. After Mr Trump was impeached in December, a trial took place that could have led to the president being removed. In the end, he was cleared. At the heart of this story was a complaint from an unknown whistleblower. In August 2019, an anonymous intelligence official wrote a letter expressing concern over President Trump's 25 July phone conversation with Ukraine's president. The official spoke of an ""urgent concern"" that Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election. Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means A rough transcript of the call,externallater revealed Mr Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. A senior official later testified the president had made clear the release of this aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated. The White House denies this. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Trump and his supporters alleged Mr Biden abused his power to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could implicate his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company. But these allegations were widely discredited. There is no evidence that Mr Biden took any action to intentionally benefit his son, nor is there any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Congressional Democrats said the phone call was proof Mr Trump broke the law by seeking foreign help to try to smear Mr Biden. But there was debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constituted an impeachable offence. President Trump says it's a ""witch hunt"". The Democrat-held House of Representatives impeached him on two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. But to remove Mr Trump, senators from his own Republican Party would have needed to turn against him at his trial, which didn't happen. President Trump says he called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July 2019 to congratulate him on his election victory. Mr Zelensky, a former TV star with no political experience, had been elected president three months earlier. But an anonymous whistleblower, reported to be a CIA official, felt there was something more serious in their exchange, and explained why in a formal complaint on 12 August. The whistleblower admitted having not directly heard the call but said accounts shared by other officials had painted a consistent picture. For context, about a dozen people are reported to have listened in on the conversation, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The call occurred days after Mr Trump blocked $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. Critics argued this was used as a bargaining chip, but Mr Trump denied this. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" The whistleblower alleged the president used ""the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 presidential election, adding that White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the call and had acted to ""lock down"" all details of it. As the controversy grew, Mr Trump promised to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" he said would prove the call had been ""totally appropriate"". But details disclosed by the White House were notes of the conversation and not a full, verbatim account. It did little to quell the spiralling controversy. The notes showed Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2015 because he had been investigating an energy company which employed Hunter Biden. At the time, by working closely with foreign-owned entities while his father was in the White House, Hunter Biden was criticised for leaving his father exposed to suggestions of a possible conflict of interest. But no evidence emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. Hunter Biden denied wrongdoing and officials in Kiev said there was no evidence to support the allegations. Then-President Barack Obama sits with then Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010 Mr Trump pressing a foreign leader to investigate discredited allegations against Mr Biden was significant. If he wins the Democratic nomination, Mr Biden would be the man facing Mr Trump for the presidency in November 2020. As Mr Biden is a leading rival for the presidency, it opened Mr Trump up to claims he was working with a foreign power to influence the election. This - crucially - is against the law. This was not the first time Mr Trump has been scrutinised over his foreign connections. His 2016 election campaign was investigated over its alleged ties to Russia. The inquiry didn't establish a criminal conspiracy to influence the election, but it also didn't exonerate the president of obstructing justice. The Democrats launched a formal inquiry into the Ukraine affair and a number of officials were called to testify. They included the US government's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. Who listens in on a president's phone call? Ukraine has 'no jurisdiction' to investigate Bidens How easy is it to impeach a president? The acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told the inquiry that Mr Trump had made the release of the military aid conditional on Ukraine opening an investigation into the Bidens' dealings. He also said there was ""an irregular, informal channel of US policymaking"" in the country more generally. The White House denied this was the case. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was subpoenaed for documents relating to Ukraine. He has been central in pushing the allegations against the Bidens. Mr Pompeo has also been served with a subpoena. But the most dramatic testimony came from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. He told Congress that he was working at the ""express direction"" of the president when pressure was put on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Sondland added that an offer of a White House visit for Ukraine's president was conditional on the country publicly announcing a probe. He also implicated Mr Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton in the Ukraine dealings. In December, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives unveiled two impeachment charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Then, a week before Christmas, the House voted to impeach Mr Trump, ensuring he became only the third US president to suffer the same fate (after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton). Over two weeks in January and February 2020, the Senate held a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, so a guilty verdict was always unlikely given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. And this is how it came to pass. Mr Trump was cleared - by 52 votes to 48 on one count, and 53 votes to 47 on the other.

But there was debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constituted an impeachable offence. President Trump says it's a ""witch hunt"". The Democrat-held House of Representatives impeached him on two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. But to remove Mr Trump, senators from his own Republican Party would have needed to turn against him at his trial, which didn't happen. President Trump says he called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July 2019 to congratulate him on his election victory. Mr Zelensky, a former TV star with no political experience, had been elected president three months earlier. But an anonymous whistleblower, reported to be a CIA official, felt there was something more serious in their exchange, and explained why in a formal complaint on 12 August. The whistleblower admitted having not directly heard the call but said accounts shared by other officials had painted a consistent picture. For context, about a dozen people are reported to have listened in on the conversation, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The call occurred days after Mr Trump blocked $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. Critics argued this was used as a bargaining chip, but Mr Trump denied this. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" The whistleblower alleged the president used ""the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 presidential election, adding that White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the call and had acted to ""lock down"" all details of it. As the controversy grew, Mr Trump promised to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" he said would prove the call had been ""totally appropriate"". But details disclosed by the White House were notes of the conversation and not a full, verbatim account. It did little to quell the spiralling controversy. The notes showed Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2015 because he had been investigating an energy company which employed Hunter Biden. At the time, by working closely with foreign-owned entities while his father was in the White House, Hunter Biden was criticised for leaving his father exposed to suggestions of a possible conflict of interest. But no evidence emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. Hunter Biden denied wrongdoing and officials in Kiev said there was no evidence to support the allegations. Then-President Barack Obama sits with then Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010 Mr Trump pressing a foreign leader to investigate discredited allegations against Mr Biden was significant. If he wins the Democratic nomination, Mr Biden would be the man facing Mr Trump for the presidency in November 2020. As Mr Biden is a leading rival for the presidency, it opened Mr Trump up to claims he was working with a foreign power to influence the election. This - crucially - is against the law. This was not the first time Mr Trump has been scrutinised over his foreign connections. His 2016 election campaign was investigated over its alleged ties to Russia. The inquiry didn't establish a criminal conspiracy to influence the election, but it also didn't exonerate the president of obstructing justice. The Democrats launched a formal inquiry into the Ukraine affair and a number of officials were called to testify. They included the US government's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. Who listens in on a president's phone call? Ukraine has 'no jurisdiction' to investigate Bidens How easy is it to impeach a president? The acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told the inquiry that Mr Trump had made the release of the military aid conditional on Ukraine opening an investigation into the Bidens' dealings. He also said there was ""an irregular, informal channel of US policymaking"" in the country more generally. The White House denied this was the case. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was subpoenaed for documents relating to Ukraine. He has been central in pushing the allegations against the Bidens. Mr Pompeo has also been served with a subpoena. But the most dramatic testimony came from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. He told Congress that he was working at the ""express direction"" of the president when pressure was put on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Sondland added that an offer of a White House visit for Ukraine's president was conditional on the country publicly announcing a probe. He also implicated Mr Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton in the Ukraine dealings. In December, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives unveiled two impeachment charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Then, a week before Christmas, the House voted to impeach Mr Trump, ensuring he became only the third US president to suffer the same fate (after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton). Over two weeks in January and February 2020, the Senate held a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, so a guilty verdict was always unlikely given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. And this is how it came to pass. Mr Trump was cleared - by 52 votes to 48 on one count, and 53 votes to 47 on the other.

Five need-to-know things,"Myths around the risks of coronavirus in the UK are doing the rounds. We put the facts straight. You might be seeing people wearing them, butthere is limited evidence that they work. That's because they are generally too loose, don't cover the eyes and can't be worn for long periods. Face masks need to be changed frequently (because they get sweaty), if they are to offer any real protection. To protect yourself, the World Health Organization (WHO) says,externalit's more important to: cover your mouth and nose while sneezing, with a tissue or your elbow put the tissue straight into a closed bin wash your hands regularly with soap and water or sanitiser keep your distance from people who are coughing and sneezing (at least one metre) Don't bother: eating garlic gargling mouthwash rinsing your nose with saline using sesame oil under the nose None of these will help protect against the new virus in any way, the WHO adds. Dogs and cats are not spreaders There is no evidence that your pet dog or cat can pass on the new coronavirus,according to the WHO,external. UK experts say reports of a dog in Hong Kong repeatedly testing positive should not lead people to panic. ""We have to differentiate between real infection and just detecting the presence of the virus,"" says Prof Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham. ""I still think it's questionable how relevant it is to the human outbreak as most of the global outbreak has been driven by human-to-human transmission."" He added: ""We need to find out more, but we don't need to panic - I doubt it could spread to another dog or a human because of the low levels of the virus."" But you should still wash your hands regularly with soap and water after touching pets. Even cuddly ones can carry bacteria such as E.coli and salmonella - and these are bugs that can pass between pets and humans. The new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease Covid-19) is thought to have originated in wildlife and been passed to humans via a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The virus could have gone unnoticed in animals before jumping to humans, which is how many viruses start. eg. avian flu, Ebola, Sars. Scientists say the likelihood of the virus making yet another jump to another species like dogs in such a short space of time is very, very small. During the Sars outbreak in 2003, a small number of cats and dogs tested positive for the virus. These animals did not transmit the virus to other animals of the same species, or to humans. Coronavirus: What are the symptoms? The new virus is part of the coronavirus family, which includes the common cold, Sars and Mers Most people will have mild symptoms (dry cough, high temperature) and will recover,the UK's top doctor says. However, the virus is making some people seriously ill (pneumonia, breathing problems) and killing a small number (severe lung issues) - around 1%. The elderly, the unwell and (possibly) men are more at risk of getting a serious disease. Children and younger adults tend to have much milder symptomsbut those with severe asthma or weakened immune systems could still have serious complications. Remember that seasonal flu, which circulates every winter, kills people too -an average of 600 people die from complications of flu in the UK every year,externaland hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Prof Ball, from Nottingham University, recommends good personal and hand hygiene to protect against flu and coronavirus. Scientists still don't know exactly how the new virus is spread but it does seem to be very infectious. ""Tiny droplets from coughs and breathing are most likely,"" Prof Ball says, soadvising people with mild symptoms to self-isolate for seven daysis lowering that risk even further. Reducing close contact with people, particularly those who look unwell, is a good move too. Getting a flu vaccine at the moment is still advised by UK health officials. How deadly is the coronavirus? There are no specific medicines or vaccines for the new virus, and antibiotics don't work either (they fight off bacteria, not viruses). Treatment options do exist but most people get better on their own. Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine, but this will have to be tested in trials first, so it could be some time before it's ready. Older people and those with other health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease, cancer and diabetes, are most vulnerable to the new virus. Although anyone of any age can get it, it is hoped that only one in five of the population will be infected - but the worst case scenario could be 80%. There is no need to avoid your local take-away or to stop buying Chinese food or beer from any other outlet, despite fears on social media. The WHO says it's also safe to receive packages and letters from countries with coronavirus hotspots,external. The virus is unlikely to survive for long enough on these kind of surfaces. But it can survive on surfaces like door handles, cups, mobile phones and money for days, potentially, which is why regularly cleaning our hands with soap and water is so important. You have to be in close contact with an infected person - within two metres for 15 minutes or more - to be at risk, according to advice from Public Health England. UK government advisers say it's more likely you'll be infected from close family and friends than when attending a large gathering or event. The virus is now circulating widely within the UK so health officials say that reducing social contact - by working at home, avoiding busy public transport and staggering your commute - is a good idea too.

Diary from locked-down Wuhan,"Guo Jing lives in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the heart of the outbreak of a new virus which has got the world worried. Wuhan has been under lockdown since 23 January, to try to contain the infection. Transport is shut down, most shops and businesses closed, and people are being advised to stay at home. Jing is a 29-year-old social worker and rights activist who lives on her own. For the past week, she has kept a diary, which she shares here with the BBC. I didn't know what to dowhen I woke up and learned about the lockdown.I don't know what it means, how long it will last and what kind of preparations I should make. There are a lot of infuriating comments [on social media]: that many patients cannot be hospitalised after diagnosis [because of a lack of places], that patients with fever are not properly treated. Many more people are wearing masks. Friends have told me to stock up on supplies. Rice and noodles have almost sold out. This video can not be played Fears over coronavirus in China trigger face mask shortage A man was buying lots of salt, and someone asked him why he was buying so much. He replied: ""What if the lockdown lasted for a whole year?"" I went to a pharmacy and it was already limiting the number of shoppers. It had already sold out of masks and alcohol disinfectant. After stocking up on food, I am still in shock. Cars and pedestrians are dwindling, and the city has come to a stop all out of a sudden. When will the city live again? The world is quiet, and the silence is horrifying. I live alone, so I can only tell there are other human beings around from the occasional noises in the corridor. I have a lot of time to think about how to survive. I don't have any resources or connections. One of my goals is not to fall sick, so I have to make myself exercise. Food is crucial to survival too, so I have to know whether there is enough supply. The government hasn't said how long the lockdown will last, nor how we can carry on functioning. People are saying it might last until May. The pharmacy and the convenience store downstairs were closed today, but it was comforting to see that couriers are still out delivering food. Noodles are all sold out in the supermarkets, but there is some rice. I also went to the market today. I bought celery, garlic shoots and eggs. After going home, I washed all my clothes and took a shower. Personal hygiene is important - I think I am washing my hands 20 to 30 times a day. Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began People cry out 'stay strong' from Wuhan windows How do you quarantine a city - and does it work? Going out makes me feel that I am still connected to the world. It's very difficult to imagine how elderly citizens living alone and people with disabilities will get through this. I didn't want to cook less than usual, because it was the last night of the year of the pig - it was supposed to be a meal of celebration. Over dinner, I was on a video call with my friends. There was no escaping talk of the virus. Some people are in towns near Wuhan, some chose not to go home because of the disease, some still insist on gathering despite the outbreak. A friend coughed during the call. Someone jokingly told her to hang up! We chatted for three hours and I thought I could then fall asleep with happy thoughts. But when I closed my eyes, memories of the past few days came in flashbacks. Tears fell. I felt helpless, angry and sad. I thought about death, too. I don't have many regrets, because my job is meaningful. But I don't want my life to end. Today is Chinese New Year. I never have much interest in celebrating festivals, but now new year feels even more irrelevant. In the morning, I saw some blood after I sneezed, and I was scared. My brain was filled with worries about sickness. I was wondering if I should go out or not. But I had no fever and a good appetite, so I went out. I wore two masks even though people say it's pointless and unnecessary. I am worried about [poor quality] fakes, so a double mask makes me feel safer. It was still very quiet. Chinese wish is for new year health, not fortune Chinese diasporas stockpile surgical masks A flower shop was open, and the owner had placed some chrysanthemums [often used as funeral flowers] at the door. But I didn't know if that meant anything. In the supermarket, the vegetable shelves were empty and almost all dumplings and noodles were sold out. There were only a few people queuing. I keep having this urge to buy lots during each visit to the shop. I bought another 2.5 kg of rice, even though I have 7kg of rice at home. I also couldn't help buying some sweet potatoes, dumplings, sausages, red beans, green beans, millet and salted eggs. I don't even like salted eggs! I will give them to friends, after the lockdown is lifted. I have enough food for a month, and this compulsive buying seems crazy. But under such circumstances, how could I blame myself? I went for a walk by the river. Two snack shops were open and some people were out walking their dogs. I saw some others were taking a stroll as well - I guess they also didn't want to be trapped. I'd never walked along that road before. It felt like my world had expanded just a little bit. It not just the city that's trapped. It's also the voices of the people. On the first day of the lockdown, I couldn't write [anything about it] on social media [because of censorship]. I couldn't even write on WeChat. Internet censorship has existed for a long time in China, but now it feels even more cruel. Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? How are coronavirus patients treated? Scientists race to develop a coronavirus vaccine Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? When your life is turned upside down, it's a challenge to build up your daily life again. I keep exercising in the mornings, using an app, but I can't focus because my brain is occupied. This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city I left home again today and tried to count how many people I met - I met eight during my walk to a noodle shop some 500m away from my home. I didn't want to go home. I wanted to explore more. It's only two months since I moved to Wuhan. I don't have many friends here, and I don't know the city very well. I guess I saw about 100 people today. I have to keep making myself heard and break the shackles. I hope everyone stays hopeful. Friends, I hope that we will meet and talk in the future. Around 8pm I heard the shouts of ""Go, Wuhan!"" from people's windows. The collective chanting is a form of self-empowerment. Panic has driven a wedge between people. In many cities, people are required to wear a face mask in public. On the face of it, the measure is to control the pneumonia outbreak. But actually it could lead to abuse of power. Some citizens without a mask have been thrown off public transport. We don't know why they didn't wear a mask. Perhaps they couldn't buy any, or they didn't know about the notice. No matter what, their rights to go out should not be taken away. In some videos circulating online, some people had sealed up the doors of people who'd self-quarantined themselves. People from Hubei province [where Wuhan is] were driven out of their homes and had nowhere to go. But at the same time, some people are offering accommodation to Hubei people. There are a lot of ways the government could encourage people to stay home. It has to ensure that every citizen has enough face masks, or even give cash rewards to citizens who stay home. Today, there's finally sunlight - just like my mood. I saw more people in my complex and there were a few community workers. They appeared to perform temperature checks on non-residents. It is not easy to build trust and bonds under a lockdown. The city is worn down by heaviness. In the midst of all this, I can't help but becoming more on-guard. My anxiety about survival has been slowly dissipating. Walking further in the city will be meaningless if I don't make any connections with people here. Social participation is an important need. Everyone has to find a role in society and makes one's life meaningful. In this lonely city, I have to find my role. Guo Jing also published parts of her diary on WeChat. She was talking to the BBC's Grace Tsoi. Illustrations by Davies Surya. Your questions:You asked, we answered The story explained:How worried should we be?

NHS orders 'coronavirus pods' in England hospitalsThe move is meant to protect other patients from infection if people ignore advice to self-isolate.,"Every hospital in England is being asked to create ""priority assessment pods"" for patients with suspected coronavirus, the NHS has said. Patients who are concerned they may have the virus are still advised to isolate themselves and call 111. But the contingency measure is intended to prevent any patients who do arrive at hospital from mixing with vulnerable patients. The secure areas are expected to be introduced by Friday. In China, 490 people have died and 24,300 people have beenconfirmed to have contracted the new virus. It has now spread to 25 nations, with two cases in the UK. The new measure means that A&E departments will be able to direct people who think they have symptoms of the coronavirus to a pod away from other patients, where they can call specialist NHS 111 teams on a dedicated phone. An NHS spokeswoman said: ""Anyone with a cough, fever, or shortness of breath who attends hospital and has recently returned from China will be advised to follow signs to NHS 111 pods and call for advice, so they stay isolated from other patients and avoid causing unnecessary pressure in A&E."" Coronavirus outbreak hits cruise ship off Japan BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said the NHS is aware people may not always follow the advice to self-isolate if the virus starts to spread across England. The pods are meant to protect others using the hospitals - who may have vulnerable immune systems. ""The problem hospitals face is where to create these pods. There is not lots of spare space on many sites to house coronavirus patients and building separate facilities may not be practical,"" he said. A Scottish government spokesperson said it had detailed arrangements in place to carry out coronavirus test sampling, but these were being kept under review and additional measures would be introduced if necessary. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus Since the virus has spread overseas, 25 nations have confirmed a total of 191 cases, although there has been only one death so far, in the Philippines. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a global health emergency. On Tuesday, the Foreign Office advised all UK citizens to leave China if possible, to minimise the risk of exposure to the virus. Two flights from Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have originated, have brought 94 Britons and their family members back to the UK so far. They are now in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral for 14 days - the incubation period of the virus - to ensure they are not infected. A further eight UK nationals and six of their family members left on a flight to New Zealand on Tuesday, andthe Foreign Office is chartering a final repatriation flight on Sunday, to allow remaining Britons to leave Hubei province in China. The Foreign Office said there were between 150 and 200 UK citizens and their dependents remaining in this part of China, and about 100 of them have asked for help to leave.

Two people in the UK - a student at the University of York and one of their relatives - have been confirmed to have coronavirus and are being treated at the specialist infectious diseases unit at Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary. The Department of Health and Social Care said 466 people have tested negative for the virus.

Trump hails 'American comeback' in Congress speech,"This video can not be played Republicans chant ""four more years"" - the president hopes a strong economy will win him re-election. President Donald Trump has hailed the ""great American comeback"" in a speech to Congress that exposed sharp divisions at the top of US politics. At his annual State of the Union address, Mr Trump set out his case for another four years in office. He was speaking on the eve of his expected acquittal on corruption charges in his impeachment trial. At one point the Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of his speech behind him. The Republican president delivered Tuesday night's nationally televised speech in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, where he was impeached in December. His trial in the upper chamber, the Senate, culminates on Wednesday but with Republicans in charge there he is all but certain to be cleared and escape being thrown out of office. As it happened - coverage of Trump's speech Tension and theatrics - five takeaways from the speech Mr Trump did not mention impeachment at all in his speech although he did jab at Democrats. Republican lawmakers chanted ""four more years"" as Mr Trump prepared to speak, urging him on for November's White House election. The State of the Union address is a speech delivered by the president to Congress towards the beginning of each calendar year in office. It is usually used as a chance to report on the condition of the nation, but also allows the president to outline a legislative agenda and national priorities. Mrs Pelosi has been one of the president's fiercest critics - she was the one who first launched formal impeachment efforts last year. Mr Trump has frequently taunted her as ""Crazy Nancy"". It was the first time the two had come face-to-face since she stormed out of a White House meeting four months ago. Before Mr Trump began speaking at the podium in the well of the House, he appeared to snub the outstretched hand of Mrs Pelosi, America's most powerful elected Democrat. This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the president's speech at the end of his address The House speaker, critics noticed, skipped the traditional introduction welcoming the president as a ""distinct honour"". When the president accused Democrats of planning to force American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to undocumented immigrants, Mrs Pelosi was observed twice mouthing: ""Not true."" She stunned onlookers by shredding a copy of the president's remarks as he concluded. Mrs Pelosi told reporters afterwards her gesture was ""the courteous thing to do, considering the alternatives"". She did rise to applaud the president more than once, including when he promoted his pet project of infrastructure investment, a possible area of bipartisan co-operation. Mr Trump struck an upbeat note in a speech lasting one hour and 18 minutes that contrasted sharply with his lament of ""American carnage"" in his 2017 inaugural presidential address. In an implicit rebuke to his predecessor Barack Obama, the president told his audience: ""In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny. ""We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back!"" Trump's State of the Union speech fact-checked Mr Trump repeatedly swiped at Democrats, including left-wing candidates such as Bernie Sanders, who are vying to challenge him for the presidency. ""We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!"" said the president, whose critics point out that he has not put forward a healthcare plan of his own. As is tradition, the president invited several special guests, including Venezuelan opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³, military veterans and the brother of a man killed by an undocumented immigrant. In a move certain to infuriate liberal critics, Mr Trump announced he would award the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honour, to firebrand conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who revealed this week he has lung cancer. First Lady Melania Trump bestowed the honour on an emotional Mr Limbaugh as the president spoke. A protester was escorted from the chamber while Mr Trump defended gun rights. It was Fred Guttenberg, the father of Jaime Guttenberg, a student killed in a mass school shooting at Parkland, Florida, in February 2018. Mr Guttenberg was a guest of Mrs Pelosi. Rush Limbaugh (L) and First Lady Melania Trump Each year after the State of the Union speech, a member of the main opposition party is tasked with responding and this year it fell to Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. She accused the president of failing to fix America's problems. ""Bullying people on Twitter doesn't fix bridges - it burns them,"" she said. As they did last year, many female Democrats - including Mrs Pelosi - wore white as tribute to the suffragettes who won the vote for US women a century ago. Several liberal Democratic lawmakers, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Maxine Waters of California, boycotted Mr Trump's address. Ms Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that she would ""not use my presence at a state ceremony to normalize Trump's lawless conduct & subversion of the Constitution"". Other left-wing Democrats, including Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, walked out during Mr Trump's speech. As is traditional during the State of the Union, one member of the president's cabinet did not attend the address. He or she remains at a secret location to make sure the government can continue should calamity befall the nation's president, vice-president and other top leaders. That person, who is known as the designated survivor, was Interior Secretary David Bernhardt on Tuesday night.

Finland to give dads same parental leave as mums,"Fathers in Finland currently get 2.2 months of parental leave (file photo) Finland's new government has announced plans to give all parents the same parental leave, in a push to get fathers to spend more time with their children. Paid allowance will increase to a combined 14 months, which works out as 164 days per parent. Neighbouring Sweden has Europe's most generous system of parental leave with 240 days each after a baby's birth. Finland says it wants to ""promote wellbeing and gender equality"". Health and social affairs minister Aino-Kaisa Pekonen told reporters that ""a radical reform of family benefits"" had begun, with the aim of strengthening the relationship of parents from the start. Under the current system in Finland, maternity leave is 4.2 months,external, while fathers are given 2.2 months until the child turns two. On top of that, another six months' parental leave can be shared. However, on average only one in four fathers take what they are given. The current plans now talk only of parental leave. Each parent would receive 6.6 months' leave (164 days under Finland's six-day-week benefit system) and pregnant women would get an additional month's allowance. Parents would be allowed to transfer 69 days of their quota. Single parents would be allowed to use both allowances. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said last month that her country still had some way to go to achieve gender equality, and complained that too few fathers were spending time with their children when they were young. Anne Lise Ellingsaeter, a University of Oslo professor who led a Nordic inquiry into parental leave, told the BBC that the Nordic countries had been leading the way on giving fathers entitlement that could not be transferred to the mother. The EU is also heading that way, with a 2019 directive giving member states three years to provide each parent with at least four months' leave, including two months that can not be transferred. The rising star who is the world's youngest PM How the wealthiest countries compare on parental leave Millennial men demand better parental leave Portugal already has a gender-neutral system, with 120 days paid at 100% of salary and another optional 30 days at 80% of salary. Prof Ellingsaeter said giving fathers increased rights had not been a complete success in the Nordic countries. ""Norway was the first country in 1993 to have non-transferable leave for fathers and then Sweden followed suit. But Denmark instituted a father quota in 1998 and abolished it later, and it hasn't been re-introduced,"" she said. This video can not be played Celebrating Swedish dads Fathers in Denmark get two weeks after a birth,externaland the mother and father can share a further 32 weeks between them. Since December, Finland has been governed by a five-party coalition and each party is led by a woman. Ms Marin, 34, has said it is ""not that big a deal"" in Finnish terms to have women in power. The government estimates that the changes will cost an extra â¬100m (Â£84m; $110m). Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Estonia and Portugal were praised in a Unicef report last year for offering the best family-friendly policies. It ranked the UK, Ireland, Greece, Cyprus and Switzerland the lowest of 31 ""rich countries"".

Five need-to-know things about coronavirus,"Myths around the risks of coronavirus in the UK are doing the rounds. We put the facts straight. You might be seeing people wearing them, butthere is limited evidence that they work. That's because they are generally too loose, don't cover the eyes and can't be worn for long periods. Face masks need to be changed frequently (because they get sweaty), if they are to offer any real protection. To protect yourself, the World Health Organization (WHO) says,externalit's more important to: cover your mouth and nose while sneezing, with a tissue or your elbow put the tissue straight into a closed bin wash your hands regularly with soap and water or sanitiser keep your distance from people who are coughing and sneezing (at least one metre) Don't bother: eating garlic gargling mouthwash rinsing your nose with saline using sesame oil under the nose None of these will help protect against the new virus in any way, the WHO adds. Dogs and cats are not spreaders There is no evidence that your pet dog or cat can pass on the new coronavirus,according to the WHO,external. UK experts say reports of a dog in Hong Kong repeatedly testing positive should not lead people to panic. ""We have to differentiate between real infection and just detecting the presence of the virus,"" says Prof Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham. ""I still think it's questionable how relevant it is to the human outbreak as most of the global outbreak has been driven by human-to-human transmission."" He added: ""We need to find out more, but we don't need to panic - I doubt it could spread to another dog or a human because of the low levels of the virus."" But you should still wash your hands regularly with soap and water after touching pets. Even cuddly ones can carry bacteria such as E.coli and salmonella - and these are bugs that can pass between pets and humans. The new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease Covid-19) is thought to have originated in wildlife and been passed to humans via a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The virus could have gone unnoticed in animals before jumping to humans, which is how many viruses start. eg. avian flu, Ebola, Sars. Scientists say the likelihood of the virus making yet another jump to another species like dogs in such a short space of time is very, very small. During the Sars outbreak in 2003, a small number of cats and dogs tested positive for the virus. These animals did not transmit the virus to other animals of the same species, or to humans. Coronavirus: What are the symptoms? The new virus is part of the coronavirus family, which includes the common cold, Sars and Mers Most people will have mild symptoms (dry cough, high temperature) and will recover,the UK's top doctor says. However, the virus is making some people seriously ill (pneumonia, breathing problems) and killing a small number (severe lung issues) - around 1%. The elderly, the unwell and (possibly) men are more at risk of getting a serious disease. Children and younger adults tend to have much milder symptomsbut those with severe asthma or weakened immune systems could still have serious complications. Remember that seasonal flu, which circulates every winter, kills people too -an average of 600 people die from complications of flu in the UK every year,externaland hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Prof Ball, from Nottingham University, recommends good personal and hand hygiene to protect against flu and coronavirus. Scientists still don't know exactly how the new virus is spread but it does seem to be very infectious. ""Tiny droplets from coughs and breathing are most likely,"" Prof Ball says, soadvising people with mild symptoms to self-isolate for seven daysis lowering that risk even further. Reducing close contact with people, particularly those who look unwell, is a good move too. Getting a flu vaccine at the moment is still advised by UK health officials. How deadly is the coronavirus? There are no specific medicines or vaccines for the new virus, and antibiotics don't work either (they fight off bacteria, not viruses). Treatment options do exist but most people get better on their own. Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine, but this will have to be tested in trials first, so it could be some time before it's ready. Older people and those with other health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease, cancer and diabetes, are most vulnerable to the new virus. Although anyone of any age can get it, it is hoped that only one in five of the population will be infected - but the worst case scenario could be 80%. There is no need to avoid your local take-away or to stop buying Chinese food or beer from any other outlet, despite fears on social media. The WHO says it's also safe to receive packages and letters from countries with coronavirus hotspots,external. The virus is unlikely to survive for long enough on these kind of surfaces. But it can survive on surfaces like door handles, cups, mobile phones and money for days, potentially, which is why regularly cleaning our hands with soap and water is so important. You have to be in close contact with an infected person - within two metres for 15 minutes or more - to be at risk, according to advice from Public Health England. UK government advisers say it's more likely you'll be infected from close family and friends than when attending a large gathering or event. The virus is now circulating widely within the UK so health officials say that reducing social contact - by working at home, avoiding busy public transport and staggering your commute - is a good idea too.

Childcare and parental leave help proposed for AMs,"Assembly members are paid Â£67,649 a year Welsh assembly members will receive extra funds for childcare under new plans. An independent body has recommended AMs receive up to Â£297 a month for care outside of normal working hours. The plan aims to remove barriers to membership of the assembly - with additional support for AMs on parental leave and those with disabilities. Plaid Cymru AM Bethan Sayed said she was ""deeply uncomfortable"" with a childcare plan for AMs but not others. Members of the public can have their say on the changes until March 2020. If they go ahead the changes will come into force in May 2021, when the next assembly term starts. Welsh Assembly members receive Â£10,000 pay rise Carwyn Jones 'surprised' by pay hike plan Supply teachers in line for pay boost Dame Dawn Primarolo, chairwoman of the Remuneration Board, said the proposals were aimed at contributing ""towards achieving diversity within the Senedd's membership which in turn will deliver better representation for the people of Wales"". AMs are currently paid Â£67,649 a year, changing annually according to how much average wages in Wales rise or fall. That system would continue. The board is not recommending a significant pay rise like it had in 2014, when the board sparked a row by backing a Â£10,000 increase. Under the plans, members would be able to claim up to Â£297 for the care of children or adult dependants outside of normal working hours - classed as between 9am and 6pm. AMs would need to produce evidence of using registered care providers. The board also proposed allowing AMs going on parental leave to take on an additional staff member while they are off work. There were callsfor more help for assembly members on parental leave earlier this year. Ms Sayed, who is currently pregnant, said extra money for politician's childcare ""needs to be part of wider legislation that would benefit the public at the same time as any such proposal - or even before any such proposals - for AMs"". ""I feel deeply uncomfortable with the idea of having an extra financial offer for AM's, when other women and parents are not afforded that same right, even though they too may be working un-social hours,"" she said. ""I agree that we need a plan for attracting more diverse citizens to stand as AMs, and looking at the range of issues as a whole may be a better way to go about this."" Islwyn Labour AM Rhianon Passmore said the childcare subsidy should apply to all assembly staff, not just assembly members. ""The Welsh Parliament/Senedd should be leading the way for all employers and it should be promoting accessibility for all its workforce at all levels."" Mandy Jones, a Brexit Party AM, called the childcare recommendation ""absolutely wrong"". ""I doubt there would be much public sympathy for giving members more publicly subsidised top-ups when they already enjoy a very competitive salary and pension provision."" Dame Jane Roberts: ""Politicians are an important part of our representative democracy"" Dame Jane Roberts, from the independent Remuneration Board, said the childcare idea had not been prompted by concerns raised by assembly members, but was the result of academic work by the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University. ""It's never popular to pay money to politicians but politicians are an important part of our representative democracy,"" she said. ""It is not a normal job in the same sort of a way. ""What we want to do is encourage as wide a range of people to put themselves forward and do remember this is not paying for childcare, it's only a very very modest contribution and it's outside normal working hours."" Under the proposals AMs with disabilities would also be able to claim for support for the costs of ""reasonable"" adjustments. The consultation documents say a ""very small number"" of long-serving AMs from outside of south Wales still receive reimbursement for interest payments on properties they own. The practice was phased out for new AMs from May 2011, but no end date was placed on when so-called ""transitional arrangements"" for when the interest payments would end. Under the new proposals they will stop at the end of the next assembly term in 2026. The Remuneration Board works independently of the assembly. AMs have no say in the implementation of the proposals. Other changes include more stringent rules on how AMs fund office accommodation in their constituencies. It follows an investigation into a constituency office opened by former UKIP AM Gareth Bennett, which found herented an unusable damp office against the advice of solicitors. AMs will be required to ""follow a set of principles which uphold the reputation of the Welsh Assembly, and are safe, and secure, and are open and welcoming to all who use them"". Members will also be expected to follow a formal procedure for acquiring an office and ensure that all leases, contracts and other relevant documents ""comply with the law"". ""While the Board believes that the significant majority of Members already comply with these rules, their formalisation will ensure better value for money for the taxpayer,"" the consultation document said.

Sturgeon pledges radical overhaul of care system,"Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney attended the launch of the review Nicola Sturgeon has called a review into Scotland's care system ""one of the most important moments"" in her time as first minister. She said she was ""committed"" to turning its vision for caring for young people into reality as quickly as possible. The Independent Care Review,externalsaid the care system should have love and nurture at its heart. But instead, it said many young people experienced a ""fractured, bureaucratic and unfeeling"" system. It said Scotland's care system was failing to give too many children the foundation they need for later life. Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's statement to MSPs The independent root-and-branch review, which was instigated by Ms Sturgeon at the SNP conference in 2016, spoke to 5,500 people - more than half of whom had been in care themselves. Ms Sturgeon praised the report for listening to the voices of those who had experienced care. She told MSPs too many vulnerable young people had been let down and would pay the price for the rest of their lives. The first minister said a radical overhaul was needed and a team would be set up immediately to form a plan to deliver the changes proposed in the review. She also announced an Oversight Body which would be run by people outside the Scottish government and would include people with experience of the care system. The review was launched at an event in Edinburgh There are about 15,000 children in Scotland's care system. Fiona Duncan, the chairwoman of the review, said the human cost of their distressing and disturbing experiences often had a lifelong effect. She said the review had calculated that an ""eye-watering"" Â£875m a year was spent picking up the pieces of earlier failures in the care system. This is money spent on mental health, homelessness and addiction services, which a far higher proportion of care leavers require as adults. Ms Duncan questioned whether the care system was actually a ""system"" at all and said it could often prolong the pain it was trying to protect. She added that people who were trying to do their best for young people were being ""thwarted"" by a system that operated when families and children were in crisis. The review's findings include: Brothers and sisters have been regularly separated and have no say about their future contact Girls who have been sexually abused have been held in secure care Some Children's Hearing panels struggle to understand and empathise with the young people before them Care has become ""monetised"" with competition rather than collaboration Children who have gone through secure care feel that restraint was used as punishment Some children ""actively sought restraint as it was the only time they felt human touch"" Some children feel staff were cold and stigmatising There is an overworked and stressed workforce Ms Duncan said the scale of the ""listening"" that had been done for the review demonstrated the ""human cost is lifelong"". ""Overcoming trauma requires a foundation of stable, nurturing, loving relationships"", she said. ""However, the current 'care system' is failing to provide that foundation for far too many children."" Julian was taken into care as a child Julian remembers being taken away from his parents in the middle of the night when he was five. He says it was dark, he was scared and he was not allowed to say goodbye. No-one explained where he was going or why, he says. Even after he was taken into foster care full-time, he was not kept safe from harm, Julian says. ""I was put back into a situation where I was at risk of being harmed again,"" he says. ""I was put into care because of neglect and the State should have been there to protect me. In many ways it failed to do that."" At the age of seven, he was adopted but he feels that neither he nor his adoptive parents were given the support they needed. He struggled at school and started self-harming. ""I was so angry and frustrated and confused and I did not know how to cope,"" Julian says. At 16, he left home, moved into a homeless hostel and became addicted to alcohol. He describes the care system as a ""cattle market"" for homelessness. Julian, who is now 27, says he was angry and frustrated Julian, who is now 27, says he woke up one day and realised he needed to change. He asked for help after years of refusing it and his early twenties went teetotal. After studying for Highers, and an HNC, this September he is due to start a university degree studying law. His motivation? He says his life has been dominated by legal processes over which he had no control. He believes that working within those legal processes he could help bring about change. Fiona Duncan chaired the review Among her findings, Ms Duncan questioned whether the Children's Hearings System - where decisions are made that affect people for the rest of their lives - was fit for purpose and if it should rely on volunteers. Children's Panels across Scotland are staffed by about 2,500 trained volunteers. The review also called for an end to the inappropriate use of secure care and a complete overhaul of the care inspectorate. Its recommendations include: Everyone involved in The Children's Hearing System must be properly trained in the impact of trauma, childhood development, neuro-diversity and children's rights. There should be changes to how panels work and who sits on them A complete overhaul of the Care Inspectorate No longer sending 16 and 17-year-olds to prison or detention No longer excluding care-experienced children from school An end to acute and crisis services Support for families rather than stigmatisation Ms Duncan said families were not getting the support they needed in order to keep their children at home with them. She said if children did need to be removed from families then it was ""essential"" siblings were kept together for as long as it was safe to do so. She said the whole workforce, paid and unpaid, must be supported to ""love, nurture and cherish children"". For the first time the review also put a price on the annual cost of the looking after children in the care system, which is Â£932m. ""What we have sought to do is understand where all of the pockets of money are all across Scotland that are spent on children and young people in this thing that we call the care system,"" Ms Duncan said. ""It is an estimate because it was almost impossible to get access to all the information we needed. It is pretty accurate but it is a low estimate.""

Arena attack brother 'foiled in bid to buy acid',"Hashem Abedi is standing trial at the Old Bailey over his role in the attack which killed 22 people The brother of the Manchester Arena attacker was thwarted in an attempt to source an acid over fears it could be used to make explosives, a court heard. Salman Abedi detonated a ""homemade improvised explosive device"" outside an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017, the Old Bailey was told. His brother Hashem Abedi is standing trial for his alleged role in the attack which killed 22 people. The 22-year-old denies their murders and the attempted murder of others. Hashem has also pleaded not guilty to conspiring with his brother to cause an explosion. In March 2017, one friend of Hashem was asked to buy sulphuric acid on his behalf for a generator battery in Libya, prosecutor Duncan Penny QC said. The defendant had allegedly turned to the friend - who cannot be named for legal reasons - for help because he was ""skint"". Jurors heard an order for Â£76 worth of acid on Amazon was declined due to lack of funds. The prosecutor said the friend then spoke to his father, explaining what he had been asked to do and seeking assistance, but his father refused and explained that ""acid could be used to manufacture explosives"". The friend subsequently ignored attempts at contact by Hashem over the following days, the Old Bailey heard.

Mr Penny said Â£140 in cash was later paid into Mr Soliman's account. Opening the prosecution on Tuesday, Mr Penny told the court Hashem was ""just as guilty"" of the murder of men, women and children who died in the attack. He said the Abedi brothers spent ""months"" planning the attack which also injured 264 people and left 670 others with ""psychological trauma"". The trial was adjourned until Thursday morning after Mr Justice Jeremy Baker told jurors the defendant said he was feeling unwell. The judge said that after an hour of the hearing Mr Abedi told his legal team he was ""feeling worse not better now and is in some pain"" and would need medical attention.

NHS orders 'coronavirus pods' for every hospital,"Every hospital in England is being asked to create ""priority assessment pods"" for patients with suspected coronavirus, the NHS has said. Patients who are concerned they may have the virus are still advised to isolate themselves and call 111. But the contingency measure is intended to prevent any patients who do arrive at hospital from mixing with vulnerable patients. The secure areas are expected to be introduced by Friday. In China, 490 people have died and 24,300 people have beenconfirmed to have contracted the new virus. It has now spread to 25 nations, with two cases in the UK. The new measure means that A&E departments will be able to direct people who think they have symptoms of the coronavirus to a pod away from other patients, where they can call specialist NHS 111 teams on a dedicated phone. An NHS spokeswoman said: ""Anyone with a cough, fever, or shortness of breath who attends hospital and has recently returned from China will be advised to follow signs to NHS 111 pods and call for advice, so they stay isolated from other patients and avoid causing unnecessary pressure in A&E."" Coronavirus outbreak hits cruise ship off Japan BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said the NHS is aware people may not always follow the advice to self-isolate if the virus starts to spread across England. The pods are meant to protect others using the hospitals - who may have vulnerable immune systems. ""The problem hospitals face is where to create these pods. There is not lots of spare space on many sites to house coronavirus patients and building separate facilities may not be practical,"" he said. A Scottish government spokesperson said it had detailed arrangements in place to carry out coronavirus test sampling, but these were being kept under review and additional measures would be introduced if necessary. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus Since the virus has spread overseas, 25 nations have confirmed a total of 191 cases, although there has been only one death so far, in the Philippines. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a global health emergency. On Tuesday, the Foreign Office advised all UK citizens to leave China if possible, to minimise the risk of exposure to the virus. Two flights from Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have originated, have brought 94 Britons and their family members back to the UK so far. They are now in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral for 14 days - the incubation period of the virus - to ensure they are not infected. A further eight UK nationals and six of their family members left on a flight to New Zealand on Tuesday, andthe Foreign Office is chartering a final repatriation flight on Sunday, to allow remaining Britons to leave Hubei province in China.

Last UK flight for Britons in coronavirus-hit city,"Dozens of Britons flown home from the centre of the outbreak last week have been taken into quarantine The UK government is chartering a final flight to bring British nationals back from the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. The plane will leave in the early hours of Sunday morning and land at RAF Brize Norton, the Foreign Office said. It comes asBritons in mainland China have been urged to leave the countryafter the outbreak claimed more lives. More than 100 UK nationals and family members have already been evacuated to Britain from Wuhan. Between 150 and 200 Britons and their dependents remain in Hubei province, where the outbreak began, and about 100 have asked for help to leave, the Foreign Office said. At least427 people have died after contracting the virus and there have been more than 20,000 confirmed cases, most of them in China. How worried should we be? A visual guide to the outbreak Wuhan resident: 'I'd rather die at home' How the new coronavirus will finally get a proper name Coronavirus outbreak hits cruise ship off Japan Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""We have been working round the clock to help British nationals leave Hubei province, on UK, French and New Zealand flights. ""The Foreign Office is chartering a second and final UK flight with space to help all British nationals and their dependants remaining in Hubei to leave. ""I encourage all British nationals in Hubei to register with our teams if they want to leave on this flight."" British nationals in Hubei can contact the Foreign Office on two 24-hour telephone numbers: +86 (0) 1085296600 and +44 (0) 2070081500. Passengers on a plane in Shanghai On Friday, 83 UK citizens were repatriated on a flight out of Wuhan arranged by the UK government. Another 11 Britons joined them on Sunday on a French flight. A further eight UK nationals and six of their family members left on a flight to New Zealand on Tuesday. It has since emerged that a Belgian woman who was on Sunday's flight tested positive for the virus. All of the Britons are now in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral for 14 days - the incubation period of the virus - to ensure they are not infected. One British passenger, Anthony May-Smith, who arrived in the UK on Sunday, was taken to hospital in Oxford to be tested for potential coronavirus. Health Secretary Matt Hancocktold BBC Breakfastthe test came back negative but that Mr May-Smith has returned to quarantine at Arrowe Park ""because the testâ¦ doesn't work until the coronavirus symptoms come through"". Mr Hancock advised anyone who thought they might have symptoms to not leave home and to call 111. Mr Hancock said it was ""low"" risk that an infected person who was not yet showing symptoms could pass on the virus. There have been two confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK - a student at the University of York and one of their relatives. They are being treated at the specialist infectious diseases unit at Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary. Scots teacher staying put in 'ghost town' Beijing Coronavirus fear hits London's Chinatown UK pharmacies see sanitiser sales spike Meanwhile, one British man in China, who fears he contracted the virus in November, has been told he can return to the UK after the Chinese authorities gave him his passport back. Jamie Morris, 23, from New Tredegar in South Wales had said he did not know when he might be able to return from Wuhan because he had submitted his passport in order to extend his residency permit. He will now be able to join other British nationalson the final flight home. On Tuesday, the Foreign Office advised Britons to leave China to minimise the risk of exposure to coronavirus. The UK is also moving non-essential staff out from its embassy and consulates in the country. The only two UK airlines serving China - British Airways and Virgin Atlantic - have suspended their flights between the countries because of fears about the spread of the virus. But other commercial flights to the UK remain available in some parts of China.

He told the BBC he was supposed to return to the UK on Tuesday. ""We had a flight booked with BA on Tuesday morning and that has had to be cancelled. We've got no idea when we are going to be allowed off the ship,"" he said. ""All we have been informed [sic] is 14 days quarantine on the ship. That means we've got no interaction with other passengers, food is brought to the room. It's really basic food, nothing like we've enjoyed on the cruise at all.""

MP among patients operated on by Paterson,"Breast surgeon Ian Paterson carried out hundreds of botched and needless operations An MP who was operated on by disgraced breast surgeon Ian Paterson says she has been left with ""doubts about her health"". Redditch MP Rachel Maclean had a lump removed over 10 years ago but now questions if it was necessary. On Tuesday, an independent inquiry into Paterson's malpracticerecommended the recall of his 11,000 patients for their treatment to be assessed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock vowed to introduce improvements within a year. Conservative Ms Maclean revealed in a tweet that she had been a patient of Paterson. She said: ""The extent of the malpractice he carried out is shocking, and the response from authorities was woefully lacking."" Ms Maclean said she had found a lump and was advised by Paterson it needed to be removed Speaking to the BBC, Ms Maclean said she wanted to encourage other people who may have been affected to ""seek help if they are worried"". ""I had the lump removed and subsequently received the all-clear from Paterson but, obviously, the doubt is in my mind that I even needed to have that procedure [and] whether he really knew what he was doing,"" she said. ""I think the key now is that people who haven't had any contact get help if they need it, even if it is just to set their mind at rest."" She said she had responses from people from all over the Midlands - where Paterson practiced - after tweeting about her experience, . The MP's disclosure comes after the inquiry concluded that a culture of ""avoidance and denial"" allowed Paterson to perform botched and unnecessary operations on hundreds of patients.

It also revealed five health professionals have been referred to either the General Medical Council or Nursing and Midwifery Council and one case has been sent to police. Staffordshire Police has since said the police referral was in relation to Paterson himself. ""A report of a sexual assault against Ian Paterson was referred to the force by West Midlands Police in May 2018,"" it said. ""The complainant was visited by detectives in June 2018 and after speaking to her she did not wish to pursue a complaint. There were no further safeguarding issues as Ian Paterson was in prison."" Paterson, of Altrincham in Greater Manchester, who grew up in County Down, Northern Ireland,is serving a 20-year jail term for 17 counts of wounding with intent. He worked with cancer patients at NHS and private hospitals in the West Midlands over 14 years. Paterson worked at Spire Hospital, in Solihull, from 1997 to 2011 His unregulated ""cleavage-sparing"" mastectomies, in which breast tissue was left behind, meant the disease returned in many of his patients. Others had surgery they did not need - some even finding out years later they did not have cancer. Latest news from the West Midlands Paterson scandal: Is the NHS learning? 'I am sad that so many women are dead' Judy Conduit had 23 unnecessary operations and said she almost died due to complications during surgery. ""He [Paterson] told me I would have to have a bilateral mastectomy,"" she said. ""Because I had so many surgeries already I agreed, reluctantly in a way, because I didn't really want it done but I knew I couldn't keep putting my body through all these general anaesthetics. ""Unfortunately I developed complications, I was told I had blood clot in the artery next to the heart."" The inquiry made 15 recommendations, and Mr Hancock has vowed to introduce improvements. ""There's a whole series of recommendations but the central one is about information-sharing because the authorities that inspect different parts of the health system, the information wasn't being shared properly,"" he told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. ""That absolutely can be fixed, it will be fixed."" Jeremy Hunt MP, former Health Secretary and current chairman of the Commons Health Select Committee, has also pledged it will look at how to change NHS culture following the inquiry. ""What we will look at is how we change the culture so that doctors who see something going wrong, maybe a mistake they themselves make, how we make it so that it is easy for them to talk about it openly so that mistake isn't repeated,"" he said.

Coronavirus outbreak hits cruise ship off Japan,"This video can not be played David Abel, one of 3,700 people in quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess, speaking soon after the quarantine began At least 10 people on board a cruise ship docked in the Japanese port of Yokohama have tested positive for coronavirus, health authorities say. Almost 300 of the 3,700 people on the Diamond Princess have been tested so far. The number of infected could rise. The checks began after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man who had been on the ship last month fell ill with the virus. Some 3,600 people on a second cruise ship docked in Hong Kong are also being tested. Chinese health authorities are stepping up efforts to control the spread of the virus, with approximately 18 million people in the east of the country now required to stay at home. In Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, 11 large public venues including sports arenas are being turned into makeshift hospitals to provide an additional 10,000 beds for the sick. Two new hospitals have already been built there since the outbreak started. Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan Could it become pandemic? The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others The coronavirus will finally get a proper name President Xi Jinping said China's preventive measures were ""achieving a positive effect"", state media reported. He said China was confident and capable of winning the war against the virus, after authorities were criticised for their initial handling of the outbreak. The WHO has declared a global health emergency over the outbreak but said it did not yet constitute a ""pandemic"", orthe worldwide spread of a new disease,external. However, the number of cases in China jumped by nearly 4,000 on Tuesday alone to more than 24,300, with another 65 deaths bringing the total to 490. The new coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu. In other developments: The Philippines confirms its third case of the virus, and Australia its 13th. South Korea has two new confirmed cases Hong Kong imposes compulsory quarantine on all visitors from mainland China. Health workers in the territory are on strike, demanding the complete closure of the border The Hong Kong flagship airlineCathay Pacific asks its staff to take three weeks' unpaid leave Organisers of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics say they are ""seriously concerned""about the spread of the virus and its possible impact on the games There is a much smaller number of cases in countries around the globe other than China - two people outside of mainland China have died of the disease. The Hong Kong man believed to be the source boarded the cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan, on 20 January, and disembarked in Hong Kong on 25 January. He was only later found to have tested positive for the virus. Officials on the cruise ship began screening guests on Monday evening, and the vessel was placed under quarantine on Tuesday. Passengers and crew on the ship will now be under quarantine for 14 days. The incubation period of the virus is believed to be around two weeks. All 10 cases are in those over the age of 50 and one is in their 80s, Japanese broadcaster NHK said. Two of them are said to be Japanese, and none are in ""serious condition"", it added. ""We had them [the ones who tested positive] get off the vessel and... we are sending them to medical organisations,"" Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said at a news conference on Wednesday. British tourist David Abel, who is on board, told the BBC he was supposed to return to the UK on Tuesday. ""We had a flight booked with BA on Tuesday morning and that has had to be cancelled. We've got no idea when we are going to be allowed off the ship,"" he said. ""All we have been informed [sic] is 14 days quarantine on the ship. That means we've got no interaction with other passengers, food is brought to the room. It's really basic food, nothing like we've enjoyed on the cruise at all."" Another passenger said her mother, who is in her 80s, was running out of medicine. ""We are in trouble because [her] medicine is running out. Many of the passengers are old and some are as troubled as we are,"" she told NHK. The Diamond Princess cruise ship is part of the Princess Cruises line, owned by British-American cruise operator Carnival Corporation. There are now 20 confirmed coronavirus cases in Japan, excluding the cruise ship infections. Separately on Wednesday, 1,800 passengers and a similar number of crew onboard the World Dream, a cruise ship docked in Hong Kong, are also being tested for the virus. Local media reports say that three Chinese passengers who had spent time on the ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking. Passengers developed symptoms on a previous World Dream cruise The infected passengers were on the ship between 19 to 24 January. Hong Kong health officials say none of those on board had contact with the three passengers. Some 30 crew members of the cruise ship say they are suffering symptoms of the virus and are also being tested. How worried should we be?

Scotland's care system 'failing' too many children,"Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney attended the launch of the review Nicola Sturgeon has called a review into Scotland's care system ""one of the most important moments"" in her time as first minister. She said she was ""committed"" to turning its vision for caring for young people into reality as quickly as possible. The Independent Care Review,externalsaid the care system should have love and nurture at its heart. But instead, it said many young people experienced a ""fractured, bureaucratic and unfeeling"" system. It said Scotland's care system was failing to give too many children the foundation they need for later life. Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's statement to MSPs The independent root-and-branch review, which was instigated by Ms Sturgeon at the SNP conference in 2016, spoke to 5,500 people - more than half of whom had been in care themselves. Ms Sturgeon praised the report for listening to the voices of those who had experienced care. She told MSPs too many vulnerable young people had been let down and would pay the price for the rest of their lives. The first minister said a radical overhaul was needed and a team would be set up immediately to form a plan to deliver the changes proposed in the review. She also announced an Oversight Body which would be run by people outside the Scottish government and would include people with experience of the care system. The review was launched at an event in Edinburgh There are about 15,000 children in Scotland's care system. Fiona Duncan, the chairwoman of the review, said the human cost of their distressing and disturbing experiences often had a lifelong effect. She said the review had calculated that an ""eye-watering"" Â£875m a year was spent picking up the pieces of earlier failures in the care system. This is money spent on mental health, homelessness and addiction services, which a far higher proportion of care leavers require as adults. Ms Duncan questioned whether the care system was actually a ""system"" at all and said it could often prolong the pain it was trying to protect. She added that people who were trying to do their best for young people were being ""thwarted"" by a system that operated when families and children were in crisis. The review's findings include: Brothers and sisters have been regularly separated and have no say about their future contact Girls who have been sexually abused have been held in secure care Some Children's Hearing panels struggle to understand and empathise with the young people before them Care has become ""monetised"" with competition rather than collaboration Children who have gone through secure care feel that restraint was used as punishment Some children ""actively sought restraint as it was the only time they felt human touch"" Some children feel staff were cold and stigmatising There is an overworked and stressed workforce Ms Duncan said the scale of the ""listening"" that had been done for the review demonstrated the ""human cost is lifelong"". ""Overcoming trauma requires a foundation of stable, nurturing, loving relationships"", she said. ""However, the current 'care system' is failing to provide that foundation for far too many children."" Julian was taken into care as a child Julian remembers being taken away from his parents in the middle of the night when he was five. He says it was dark, he was scared and he was not allowed to say goodbye. No-one explained where he was going or why, he says. Even after he was taken into foster care full-time, he was not kept safe from harm, Julian says. ""I was put back into a situation where I was at risk of being harmed again,"" he says. ""I was put into care because of neglect and the State should have been there to protect me. In many ways it failed to do that."" At the age of seven, he was adopted but he feels that neither he nor his adoptive parents were given the support they needed. He struggled at school and started self-harming. ""I was so angry and frustrated and confused and I did not know how to cope,"" Julian says. At 16, he left home, moved into a homeless hostel and became addicted to alcohol. He describes the care system as a ""cattle market"" for homelessness. Julian, who is now 27, says he was angry and frustrated Julian, who is now 27, says he woke up one day and realised he needed to change. He asked for help after years of refusing it and his early twenties went teetotal. After studying for Highers, and an HNC, this September he is due to start a university degree studying law. His motivation? He says his life has been dominated by legal processes over which he had no control. He believes that working within those legal processes he could help bring about change. Fiona Duncan chaired the review Among her findings, Ms Duncan questioned whether the Children's Hearings System - where decisions are made that affect people for the rest of their lives - was fit for purpose and if it should rely on volunteers. Children's Panels across Scotland are staffed by about 2,500 trained volunteers. The review also called for an end to the inappropriate use of secure care and a complete overhaul of the care inspectorate. Its recommendations include: Everyone involved in The Children's Hearing System must be properly trained in the impact of trauma, childhood development, neuro-diversity and children's rights. There should be changes to how panels work and who sits on them A complete overhaul of the Care Inspectorate No longer sending 16 and 17-year-olds to prison or detention No longer excluding care-experienced children from school An end to acute and crisis services Support for families rather than stigmatisation Ms Duncan said families were not getting the support they needed in order to keep their children at home with them. She said if children did need to be removed from families then it was ""essential"" siblings were kept together for as long as it was safe to do so. She said the whole workforce, paid and unpaid, must be supported to ""love, nurture and cherish children"". For the first time the review also put a price on the annual cost of the looking after children in the care system, which is Â£932m. ""What we have sought to do is understand where all of the pockets of money are all across Scotland that are spent on children and young people in this thing that we call the care system,"" Ms Duncan said. ""It is an estimate because it was almost impossible to get access to all the information we needed. It is pretty accurate but it is a low estimate.""

Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan,"Guo Jing lives in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the heart of the outbreak of a new virus which has got the world worried. Wuhan has been under lockdown since 23 January, to try to contain the infection. Transport is shut down, most shops and businesses closed, and people are being advised to stay at home. Jing is a 29-year-old social worker and rights activist who lives on her own. For the past week, she has kept a diary, which she shares here with the BBC. I didn't know what to dowhen I woke up and learned about the lockdown.I don't know what it means, how long it will last and what kind of preparations I should make. There are a lot of infuriating comments [on social media]: that many patients cannot be hospitalised after diagnosis [because of a lack of places], that patients with fever are not properly treated. Many more people are wearing masks. Friends have told me to stock up on supplies. Rice and noodles have almost sold out. This video can not be played Fears over coronavirus in China trigger face mask shortage A man was buying lots of salt, and someone asked him why he was buying so much. He replied: ""What if the lockdown lasted for a whole year?"" I went to a pharmacy and it was already limiting the number of shoppers. It had already sold out of masks and alcohol disinfectant. After stocking up on food, I am still in shock. Cars and pedestrians are dwindling, and the city has come to a stop all out of a sudden. When will the city live again? The world is quiet, and the silence is horrifying. I live alone, so I can only tell there are other human beings around from the occasional noises in the corridor. I have a lot of time to think about how to survive. I don't have any resources or connections. One of my goals is not to fall sick, so I have to make myself exercise. Food is crucial to survival too, so I have to know whether there is enough supply. The government hasn't said how long the lockdown will last, nor how we can carry on functioning. People are saying it might last until May. The pharmacy and the convenience store downstairs were closed today, but it was comforting to see that couriers are still out delivering food. Noodles are all sold out in the supermarkets, but there is some rice. I also went to the market today. I bought celery, garlic shoots and eggs. After going home, I washed all my clothes and took a shower. Personal hygiene is important - I think I am washing my hands 20 to 30 times a day. Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began People cry out 'stay strong' from Wuhan windows How do you quarantine a city - and does it work? Going out makes me feel that I am still connected to the world. It's very difficult to imagine how elderly citizens living alone and people with disabilities will get through this. I didn't want to cook less than usual, because it was the last night of the year of the pig - it was supposed to be a meal of celebration. Over dinner, I was on a video call with my friends. There was no escaping talk of the virus. Some people are in towns near Wuhan, some chose not to go home because of the disease, some still insist on gathering despite the outbreak. A friend coughed during the call. Someone jokingly told her to hang up! We chatted for three hours and I thought I could then fall asleep with happy thoughts. But when I closed my eyes, memories of the past few days came in flashbacks. Tears fell. I felt helpless, angry and sad. I thought about death, too. I don't have many regrets, because my job is meaningful. But I don't want my life to end. Today is Chinese New Year. I never have much interest in celebrating festivals, but now new year feels even more irrelevant. In the morning, I saw some blood after I sneezed, and I was scared. My brain was filled with worries about sickness. I was wondering if I should go out or not. But I had no fever and a good appetite, so I went out. I wore two masks even though people say it's pointless and unnecessary. I am worried about [poor quality] fakes, so a double mask makes me feel safer. It was still very quiet. Chinese wish is for new year health, not fortune Chinese diasporas stockpile surgical masks A flower shop was open, and the owner had placed some chrysanthemums [often used as funeral flowers] at the door. But I didn't know if that meant anything. In the supermarket, the vegetable shelves were empty and almost all dumplings and noodles were sold out. There were only a few people queuing. I keep having this urge to buy lots during each visit to the shop. I bought another 2.5 kg of rice, even though I have 7kg of rice at home. I also couldn't help buying some sweet potatoes, dumplings, sausages, red beans, green beans, millet and salted eggs. I don't even like salted eggs! I will give them to friends, after the lockdown is lifted. I have enough food for a month, and this compulsive buying seems crazy. But under such circumstances, how could I blame myself? I went for a walk by the river. Two snack shops were open and some people were out walking their dogs. I saw some others were taking a stroll as well - I guess they also didn't want to be trapped. I'd never walked along that road before. It felt like my world had expanded just a little bit. It not just the city that's trapped. It's also the voices of the people. On the first day of the lockdown, I couldn't write [anything about it] on social media [because of censorship]. I couldn't even write on WeChat. Internet censorship has existed for a long time in China, but now it feels even more cruel. Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? How are coronavirus patients treated? Scientists race to develop a coronavirus vaccine Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? When your life is turned upside down, it's a challenge to build up your daily life again. I keep exercising in the mornings, using an app, but I can't focus because my brain is occupied. This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city I left home again today and tried to count how many people I met - I met eight during my walk to a noodle shop some 500m away from my home. I didn't want to go home. I wanted to explore more. It's only two months since I moved to Wuhan. I don't have many friends here, and I don't know the city very well. I guess I saw about 100 people today. I have to keep making myself heard and break the shackles. I hope everyone stays hopeful. Friends, I hope that we will meet and talk in the future. Around 8pm I heard the shouts of ""Go, Wuhan!"" from people's windows. The collective chanting is a form of self-empowerment. Panic has driven a wedge between people. In many cities, people are required to wear a face mask in public. On the face of it, the measure is to control the pneumonia outbreak. But actually it could lead to abuse of power. Some citizens without a mask have been thrown off public transport. We don't know why they didn't wear a mask. Perhaps they couldn't buy any, or they didn't know about the notice. No matter what, their rights to go out should not be taken away. In some videos circulating online, some people had sealed up the doors of people who'd self-quarantined themselves. People from Hubei province [where Wuhan is] were driven out of their homes and had nowhere to go. But at the same time, some people are offering accommodation to Hubei people. There are a lot of ways the government could encourage people to stay home. It has to ensure that every citizen has enough face masks, or even give cash rewards to citizens who stay home. Today, there's finally sunlight - just like my mood. I saw more people in my complex and there were a few community workers. They appeared to perform temperature checks on non-residents. It is not easy to build trust and bonds under a lockdown. The city is worn down by heaviness. In the midst of all this, I can't help but becoming more on-guard. My anxiety about survival has been slowly dissipating. Walking further in the city will be meaningless if I don't make any connections with people here. Social participation is an important need. Everyone has to find a role in society and makes one's life meaningful. In this lonely city, I have to find my role. Guo Jing also published parts of her diary on WeChat.

Five takeaways,"This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the president's speech at the end of his address It was a historic State of the Union address - conducted the day after the Democrats' chaotic Iowa caucuses and the day before the Senate renders its verdict in the president's impeachment trial. At times belligerent, at times emotional, Donald Trump delivered what will probably be his final speech to a joint session of Congress before standing for re-election in November. Say what you will about it - about the whole evening - but it was memorable. Here are a few key takeaways. Trump's State of the Union speech fact-checked The president's speech was bookended by two notable breaches of decorum. It began as the president handed the text of his speech to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi: he pointedly turned away when she reached out to shake his hand. Then, Pelosi declined to use traditional language that it was her ""honour"" to introduce the president. This video can not be played A State of the Union snub? Trump turns away as Pelosi goes to shake his hand. After the conclusion of the address, Pelosi very visibly ripped up the speech text and tossed it on her desk. She would later tell a Fox News producer that it was the ""courteous thing to do"", given her other options. There were also moments during the address itself where tension boiled over. The president attacked Democratic proposals to abolish private health insurance in blunt language, saying he ""would never let socialism destroy US healthcare"". He also engaged in an extended attack on the Democratic-run states of New York and California for their immigration policies. When the president spoke about gun rights, a member of the audience - the father of a child killed in the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida - was removed from the chamber for shouting his objections. Throughout the president's speech, his lines were frequently greeted by raucous cheers from the Republican legislators, while Democrats sat in stony silence or howled in anger. Democratic lawmakers sat in silence for much of Mr Trump's speech - when they weren't erupting in protest In his speech last year, the president called for a rejection of ""the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution,"" touting ""the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good"". Such rhetoric was very much absent on Tuesday night, reflecting the open partisan warfare that has gripped the nation's capital. An incumbent president's election-year State of the Union address typically foreshadows the themes of the campaign. If that's the case, Donald Trump's speech makes clear he's going to bet his presidency on the state of the economy. This video can not be played Republicans chant ""four more years"" - the president hopes a strong economy will win him re-election. While growth figures for the past year have been modest, the president has presided over economic expansion of record length. At the top of his speech - the portion that will have the most Americans watching - Trump rattled through the litany of facts and figures that support his contention that times are good and will stay that way if he's given another four years in office. He cited deregulation, tax cuts and new trade agreements as his recipe for prosperity. In the campaign to come, expect him to make the case that a Democratic change of course will hit American voters in the place that hurts the most - their pocketbooks. At the top of his speech, Donald Trump said that he was building ""the world's most prosperous and inclusive society"". The use of the word ""inclusive"" wasn't by chance. Throughout his speech, the president made repeated overtures to minority groups in America - groups that, according to polls, view the president with considerable scepticism. Trump spoke of how he had signed criminal justice reform and funded historically black colleges and universities. He specifically noted the low levels of unemployment for ""African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans"". Among his guests were the last surviving member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black World War II fighter wing group, and his great-grandson. Trump announced that he was awarding an ""opportunity scholarship"" to a young black girl to attend a private school in Philadelphia. When talk turned to immigration, the president called out Raul Ortiz, who he recently appointed to deputy chief of Border Patrol. Deputy Chief of US Border Patrol Raul Ortiz listens to Mr Trump's third State of the Union address If the president successfully improves his standing among minority voters - and convinces independent voters of all stripes that Democratic accusations of racism and xenophobia are scurrilous attacks - his path to re-election becomes considerably easier. His State of the Union address suggests that he knows this very well. Every president since Ronald Reagan has relied on special guest recognition as a means of highlighting a policy proposal or recognising the valour or sacrifice of noteworthy individuals. Even in the most acrimonious of times, these moments give a president a chance to solicit bipartisan applause and approbation. In Tuesday night's speech, Trump - the inveterate showman - took things one step further. Besides the ""opportunity scholarship moment"", he also paused mid-speech to have his wife award conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom and to surprise a military wife and her family by reuniting them with her husband, an Army sergeant who had spent the past seven months in Afghanistan. Talk show host and conservative hero Rush Limbaugh flashes a thumbs up after being recognised by the president ""We couldn't keep him waiting any longer,"" the president said, in a moment that seemed plucked from script of a daytime talk show. Democrat Bill Clinton used to be famous for his plan-heavy State of the Union addresses, which would bludgeon listeners with a laundry list of ideas and proposals of varying scope and prospects for success. That's not exactly Donald Trump's style, but he did highlight a few priorities - none of which have much hope for success in a Congress beset by partisan gridlock. He called more funding for vocational training in US public schools and for action to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, which prompted chants from House Democrats touting their already passed legislation that the Republican-controlled Senate has yet to take up. When the president suggested that he was dedicated to ensuring health insurance always covers pre-existing conditions, the Democratic groans were particularly loud - a reflection of the fact that the president supports a lawsuit that would nullify the law that provides those protections. Infrastructure spending, the white whale of bipartisan legislators for the entirety of Trump's presidency, garnered widespread applause, as did yet another call for a US mission to the moon and Mars. Trump also called for a law allowing the victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants to sue cities that do not co-operate with federal immigration officials and a ban on late-term abortions - both met by icy glares from the Democrats. And that was pretty much that. If the president is going to campaign on any bold, new ideas, they'll have to wait for another night to be unveiled.

As it happened: Trump's speech,"Donald Trump's third state of the union address has taken place Trump appeared to snub handshake from House speaker Nancy Pelosi; she tore up his speech later His speech focused on what he called the ""great American comeback"" In optimistic speech, he said ""the years of economic decay are over"" Results from Monday's Iowa caucuses trickle in after technical glitches Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, takes narrow lead in early results Roland Hughes, Max Matza, Holly Honderich and Shrai Popat It's
nearing 23:30 here in Washington, so we are going to wind down our live
coverage of another busy day in US politics. We started out explaining what was happening with the
Democratic race for president in Iowa, and we ended it with President Trump's
third State of the Union address. Here's the latest from Iowa, where
Monday's caucuses aimed to decide who Iowans wanted to run against Mr Trump:  Meanwhile, in Washington:  We'll be back tomorrow for live coverage of the ongoing
impeachment trial into Mr Trump. See you then. It's been a busy few days in US politics - the Iowa caucuses on Monday and the State of the Union address today. It doesn't look like slowing down on Wednesday either. After the chaotic results process, we should (or maybe could) find out who actually won in Iowa and is on the early front foot to be the Democratic nominee. Right now, Pete Buttigieg is in the lead. Oh, and there's also the small matter of the vote on whether to convict President Trump in his impeachment trial. That should happen at about 21:00 east coast time on Wednesday. On BBC World News, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher spoke of the divided body language that coloured Trump's remarks, noting both Trump's snub of top Democrat Nancy Pelosi's attempted handshake and later, Pelosi's shredding of the president speech. But partisan tension aside, ""the point of Trump's speech"", like for any incumbent president before an election ""is to lay out the framework of that re-election campaign,"" Zurcher says. And this year, America's ""booming economy"" was Trump's central pitch, drawing a counterpoint to the Democrats, who he says would endanger a long-term economic growth period. And Trump got most aggressive in two main areas Zurcher says: healthcare and immigration. Zurcher also noted the medal of freedom awarded to Rush Limbaugh, a figure who is is ""notorious among Democrats for what they view as racist and sexist statements"", and known among Republicans as a ""grandfather of conservative politics"". Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi has commented on her headline-grabbing move following Trump's address: ripping up pages of the president's remarks. Asked why she did it, the Speaker of the House told reporters: ""It was the courteous thing to do."" ""It was such a dirty speech,"" she said. âNadie estÃ¡ por encima de la ley.â So says Veronica Escobar, the congresswoman from El Paso, Texas, who is delivering the Spanish-language Democratic rebuttal. The sentence translates to: âNo one is above the law.â âThis is a tragic moment, and Congress must defend our republic,"" she continues in a speech delivered from  a medical clinic in El Paso's Segundo Barrio neighbourhood. She also criticises a statement Trump previously made, calling El Paso a dangerous area. In fact, it is one of the safest communities in America. She calls Trump's words ""a misinformation campaign"". Governor Gretchen Whitmer has wrapped up the Democratic rebuttal. Now a second rebuttal, this time in Spanish, is being delivered by Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar. Take a look at how different lawmakers had very different responses to Trump's remarks this evening. Vice-President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi Democratic members of Congress sit stony-faced Rush Limbaugh, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump gets a thumbs-up from his fellow Republicans ""American workers are hurting,"" says Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in her rebuttal to Mr Trump's speech. ""Wages have stagnated while CEO pay has sky-rocketed,"" she continues, adding that corporations are ""reaping rewards from tax cuts they don't need."" Democrats have made corporate accountability a major issue in the 2020 Democratic election. She is continuing to highlight specific efforts made by state-level Democratic politicians. ""That's strength. That's action,"" she says. Something we meant to mention earlier: a man whose daughter was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida was removed from the House after heckling the president during his remarks. Fred Guttenberg reportedly stood up and shouted something after Trump promised to protect the second amendment - which enshrines the rights of Americans right to keep and bear arms. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi was seen scolding someone in the upper chamber - believed to be Guttenberg - during Trump's remarks on gun rights. Gretchen Whitmer Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, is now delivering the Democrat's rebuttal. ""I'm doing to need a lot more than ten minutes,"" to rebut what Trump said tonight, she says. ""Instead of talking about what he is saying, I'm going to highlight what the Democrats are doing,"" says Whitmer. She is now going from state to state, talking about efforts made by local Democrats to improve life in their districts. ""Everyone in this country benefits when we invest infrastructure,"" she says. We're now waiting for the Democratic rebuttals to Mr Trump's speech, but these are some of the lines he ended with: ""Our brightest discoveries are
not yet known."" ""Our most thrilling stories are not yet told."" ""Our
grandest journeys are not yet made."" ""The American Age, the American Epic,
the American Adventure, has only just begun.""  One hour and 18 minutes. As Trump leaves the chamber, Republicans are overheard telling him ""awesome speech"". Democrats clearly hated it, with several walking out as it was ongoing. Throughout Trump's speech, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, was sitting behind him. When he finished, she was seen tearing a copy of his speech she had on her desk. This all came about 70 minutes after he appeared to snub a handshake from Pelosi, the woman who launched his impeachment proceedings. In an emotional orchestrated moment, the soldier husband of a White House State of the Union guest has just surprised his wife. Sergeant First Class Townsend
Williams was in Afghanistan on his fourth combat deployment, or so we thought... He just walked into the chamber to the shock of his wife and small children. Members of Congress promptly broke out in chants of ""USA"". Reality Check President Trump said that, for the first time in 51 years, ""the cost of prescription drugs actually went down"". In the year to May 2019, the average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell by 0.2% according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the increase in the cost of household items in the US . This is the first price decrease over a 12-month period since 1973, some 47 years ago. But this may not be the most reliable way to measure drug prices according to Inma Hernandez, a pharmacy lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh. ""The CPI is based on a basket of drugs which is representative of popular drugs. So it tends to include widely-used drugs, which are usually cheaper,"" she says. ""However, it is less likely to include newer or less-prescribed drugs, which are more expensive and have higher price increases."" The lack of transparency around drug pricing makes it very difficult to know exactly what's happening to the cost of prescription medication.  ""Three years ago, the
barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and
Syria,"" Trump says, referring to the Islamic State terror group. ""Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent
destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS -- the bloodthirsty killer alâBaghdadi - is dead."" The parents of slain humanitarian aid worker Kayla Mueller - who was killed while in IS captivity - are in the audience tonight. The operation that killed Baghdadi was named after Kayla's birthday, Trump says. He then goes on to tout the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US airstrike at the Baghdad airport in January. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At the top of his speech Donald Trump said that he was
building âthe world's most prosperous and inclusive societyâ. The use of the word âinclusiveâ wasnât by chance. Throughout
his speech, the president made repeated overtures to minority groups in America
â groups that, according to polls, view the president with considerably

minority voters â and convinces independent voters of all stripes that
Democratic accusations of racism and xenophobia are scurrilous attacks â his
path to re-election becomes considerably easier. His State of the Union address
suggests that he knows this very well. ""We have confirmed a record
number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written,"" says Trump. He referred to his two recently approved Supreme Court Judges, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett
Kavanaugh. But in an ad-libbed line that's not in his speech transcript, he adds: ""And we have many in the pipeline."" New Supreme Court judges can only be added when one dies. Could he be saying that he hopes some Supreme Court justices are not around much longer? ""And as the wall goes up, drug
seizures rise, and border crossings go down, and they're going down rapidly,"" says Trump. His promised wall is not going up ""rapidly"", despite his claim, but is slowly making progress. Just last week, part of the wall on the US-Mexico borderactually collapsed due to high winds. Trump is praising ""heroic"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who are tasked with enforcing immigration policy within America's borders. ""Tragically, there are many
cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary
for these criminal illegal aliens. ""In sanctuary cities, local officials
order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public,
instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."" Cameras pan over California lawmakers as Trump speaks, since that state recently declared the entire state to be a ""sanctuary"" zone. More than 400 jurisdictions across the country, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle - major cities in left-leaning states that did not vote for Mr Trump - have enacted policies protecting undocumented immigrants within their boundaries, creating these so-called ""sanctuary cities"".

'Overly sexualised' Pretty Little Thing ad banned,"An advert for fashion retailer Pretty Little Thing which featured women wearing exposing lingerie has been banned for being ""offensive"". The YouTube ad presented the firm's products in an ""overly-sexualised way"" and depicted women as sex objects, the Advertising Standards Authority said. The retailer is one of several online fast fashion companies to have been rapped for their racy marketing. Pretty Little Thing said it ""in no way meant to cause any offence"". The advert began with a woman looking over her shoulder in a seductive manner wearing black vinyl, high-waisted chaps-style knickers. Online fashion twice as 'racy' as High Street Fast fashion: Can it ever be ethical and cheap? It then showed other scantily clad women in seductive or ""highly sexualised"" poses, including one wearing a transparent mesh bodysuit. A viewer complained and the regulator agreed, saying the ad was ""irresponsible"" and likely to cause offence. Pretty Little Thing said it ""celebrates all women"" and promotes body diversity. But the ad, which aired in October last year, must not be shown again. Is online fashion advertising too racy? A previous Pretty Little Thing advertwas banned in 2017for portraying a model who appeared to be under 16 in a ""sexually suggestive"" manner. The regulator also recently banned an ad for rival Missguided that featured ""highly sexualised"" images that objectified women. Another online fashion retailer, Boohoo - which owns Pretty Little Thing -had its email advert bannedfor using the phrase ""send nudes"", which a viewer complained made light of a potentially harmful social trend. It may seem surprising for an advert targeted at women to be banned for objectifying women, but the defence used by Pretty Little Thing in this case touches on an increasingly contested grey area. The company says the advert promoted diversity through ""bold and distinctive fashion of all shapes and sizes"", and that they worked hard to promote ""a healthy body image that was inclusive and empowered women"". But the line between empowerment and objectification of women is a subjective one. Fast-fashion retailers are more likely to push those boundaries. Research we conducted last year found that online-only brands were twice as likely to use more overtly sexualised pictures when selling their clothes than High Street retailers' websites. It also seems that there's also a growing generational divide. While talking to young people, who these adverts are targeted at, it seemed they were more likely to see them as positive images of women being body-confident whatever their shape. Many in older generations view the same images very differently. Are you a Pretty Little Thing customer? What do you think of the advert? Get in touch by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Tension and theatrics - five takeaways from speech,"This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the president's speech at the end of his address It was a historic State of the Union address - conducted the day after the Democrats' chaotic Iowa caucuses and the day before the Senate renders its verdict in the president's impeachment trial.

At the top of his speech, Donald Trump said that he was building ""the world's most prosperous and inclusive society"". The use of the word ""inclusive"" wasn't by chance. Throughout his speech, the president made repeated overtures to minority groups in America - groups that, according to polls, view the president with considerable scepticism. Trump spoke of how he had signed criminal justice reform and funded historically black colleges and universities. He specifically noted the low levels of unemployment for ""African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans"". Among his guests were the last surviving member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black World War II fighter wing group, and his great-grandson. Trump announced that he was awarding an ""opportunity scholarship"" to a young black girl to attend a private school in Philadelphia. When talk turned to immigration, the president called out Raul Ortiz, who he recently appointed to deputy chief of Border Patrol. Deputy Chief of US Border Patrol Raul Ortiz listens to Mr Trump's third State of the Union address If the president successfully improves his standing among minority voters - and convinces independent voters of all stripes that Democratic accusations of racism and xenophobia are scurrilous attacks - his path to re-election becomes considerably easier. His State of the Union address suggests that he knows this very well. Every president since Ronald Reagan has relied on special guest recognition as a means of highlighting a policy proposal or recognising the valour or sacrifice of noteworthy individuals. Even in the most acrimonious of times, these moments give a president a chance to solicit bipartisan applause and approbation. In Tuesday night's speech, Trump - the inveterate showman - took things one step further. Besides the ""opportunity scholarship moment"", he also paused mid-speech to have his wife award conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom and to surprise a military wife and her family by reuniting them with her husband, an Army sergeant who had spent the past seven months in Afghanistan. Talk show host and conservative hero Rush Limbaugh flashes a thumbs up after being recognised by the president ""We couldn't keep him waiting any longer,"" the president said, in a moment that seemed plucked from script of a daytime talk show. Democrat Bill Clinton used to be famous for his plan-heavy State of the Union addresses, which would bludgeon listeners with a laundry list of ideas and proposals of varying scope and prospects for success. That's not exactly Donald Trump's style, but he did highlight a few priorities - none of which have much hope for success in a Congress beset by partisan gridlock. He called more funding for vocational training in US public schools and for action to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, which prompted chants from House Democrats touting their already passed legislation that the Republican-controlled Senate has yet to take up. When the president suggested that he was dedicated to ensuring health insurance always covers pre-existing conditions, the Democratic groans were particularly loud - a reflection of the fact that the president supports a lawsuit that would nullify the law that provides those protections. Infrastructure spending, the white whale of bipartisan legislators for the entirety of Trump's presidency, garnered widespread applause, as did yet another call for a US mission to the moon and Mars. Trump also called for a law allowing the victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants to sue cities that do not co-operate with federal immigration officials and a ban on late-term abortions - both met by icy glares from the Democrats. And that was pretty much that. If the president is going to campaign on any bold, new ideas, they'll have to wait for another night to be unveiled.

House of CommonsParliament A series of Private Members' Bills - bills introduced by MPs and peers who are not government ministers - have been introduced in the Commons following PMQs. There are 20. These include: House of CommonsParliament PMQs ends but shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler raises a point of order relating to Nadia Whittome's question (see post timed at 12:26). She says the claims that everybody on a deportation flight to Jamaica - due to leave next week - are criminals  ""seems not to be true"". Specifically she refers to one of her constituents who is due to be on the flight. She argues that he was convicted ""under the now unlawful"" joint enterprise rule and later released. She adds that the wife of this constituent fears the stress of the situation will kill him. Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle says the MP knows it is not a point of order but adds ""I am sure the government frontbench has heard what was said."" House of CommonsParliament The PM is accused of âducking democratic scrutiny at every opportunityâ by SNP MP Owen Thompson.

House of CommonsParliament Labour's Lilian Greenwood tells MPs that her constituent Errol Graham starved to death months after the Department for Work and Pensions stopped his benefits. ""His emaciated body was only discovered when bailiffs broke down his front door to evict him,"" she says. ""How many more vulnerable benefit claimants will have to die before the government starts to value their lives,"" she asks. The prime minister replies that the government has allocated Â£36m ""to improve safguarding and decision making"". He says there will be an independent serious case panel ""to scrutinise and learn lessons from serious cases like this"". House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Bernard Jenkin asks the prime minister about the emergency legislation in the wake of the Streatham attack. The system of automatic early release for terrorist
offenders ""has run out of road"", Boris Johnson says. Under the proposed legislation, terror offenders will only be considered for release once they have served two-thirds of their sentence and with the approval of the Parole Board. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has previously told MPs the change would apply to both current and future offenders. Find out more about the proposal here House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP and former cabinet minster David Davis says Australia has determined that involving Huawei in its 5G brought with it a ""major risk of both sabotage and espionage"". He asks the PM to pledge that the government will work with other 'Five Eyes' security partners to ""create an alternative"" to the Chinese telecoms firm within two years. In response Boris Johnson says the government would do nothing to endanger its networks or intelligence sharing with allies. ""Will work to ensure high-risk vendors cannot dominate our market,"" he says. House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Suella Braverman raises the issue of Parliament's role in terrorism law. It comes after the government saidthis week that emergency legislation will be introducedto end the automatic early release from prison of terror offenders, following the Streatham attack.

PMQs House of CommonsParliament Conservative Damian Green raises the issue of Huawei. The UK has decided to let the Chinese company continue to be used in its 5G networks but with restrictions, despite pressure from the US to block the firm over security concerns. Mr Green says France and Australia are building a 5G network without the company. ""If they can do it we can do it,"" he says. The prime minister replies that the UK will be ""reducing the involvement of Huawei"" adding that there has been ""a failure of like-minded countries to produce an alternative"" to the Chinese company. ""That is why we are doubling the science budget,"" he says. House of CommonsParliament SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accuses Boris Johnson of adopting an ""isolationist"" approach to post-Brexit trade and ""banning"" journalists from briefings. He asks the prime minister whether he is trying to ""impersonate"" Donald Trump. In response, Mr Johnson says the government has taken an ""outward-looking approach"". In a second question, Mr Blackford says the PM is ""on a dangerous trajectory"" and says the Conservative government is a ""threat to the NHS"". In response, Mr Johnson says the SNP want to ""hand back"" policy control to Brussels by rejoining the EU, and adopt an as-yet-unknown currency. Green MP tweets Caroline Lucas is the only Green MP in the Commons and she often asks a question at PMQs - but we're not sure if the Speaker will call her later in this session.

Mr Johnson accuses the Labour leader of talking ""absolute nonsense"". ""His own approach is utterly unclear,"" he says. House of CommonsParliament Mr Corbyn accuses the government of ""funding billions on fossil fuel projects abroad"". Mr Johnson says the ""grotesque failure of the leader of the opposition to understand what is
happening in this countryâs economy is mind-boggling"". He says the country is leading in the production and design of technology for off-shore wind farms. House of CommonsParliament Mr Corbyn says the UK isn't meeting its targets on climate change and isn't due to meet its target. In response, the PM says the UK has cut CO2 emissions since 2010 by 42%. ""That is an astonishing achievement...thanks to free market dynamic one nation Conservatism,"" he adds. House of CommonsParliament Jeremy Corbyn says the government's own figures show it is missing the carbon budget. Referring to the sacking of Claire O'Neill, he adds: ""We found out this more two former Conservative leaders turned down
the job done by his minister."" He says the PM is ""failing spectacularly"" on climate action. Boris Johnson replies that this is ""beyond satire"". ""This is the first major economy in the world to have set a
target of carbon neutral by 2050. ""We will have a wonderful summit in Glasgow by the end of
the year."" House of CommonsParliament Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also praises the emergency services for how they responded to the terror attack in Streatham.

Bercow peerage would be 'scandal' - Leakey,"This video can not be played David Leakey says John Bercow ""brutalised"" people It ""would be a scandal that Parliament would struggle to live down"" if ex-Commons Speaker John Bercow got a peerage, an ex-Parliament official has said. David Leakey who served in Parliament as Black Rod accused Mr Bercow of ""intolerable behaviour"". But Mr Bercow dismissed his claims as ""total and utter rubbish"". Meanwhile Diane Abbott has been criticised for saying it was ""unlikely"" ex-soldier Mr Leakey was bullied. The shadow home secretary tweeted that Mr Leakey had ""served in Germany, Northern Ireland and Bosnia. But claims he was bullied (i.e. intimidated and coerced) by John Bercow. Unlikely."" She has since deleted her tweet. Responding to her comment, David Penman - general secretary of the FDA Union which represents civil servant - said: ""What a ridiculous comment from an experienced MP, demonstrating blind political partisanship and a complete failure to understand how power is abused in the workplace."" Bercow 'categorically' denies bullying allegations Formal complaint lodged against John Bercow John Bercow bows out as Commons Speaker And Labour MP Dan Jarvis - who served as an army officer -  said ""having a distinguished service record does not preclude you from being a victim of workplace bullying"". ""All of us in the Labour/trade union movement have a responsibility to create a climate where people can voice their concerns and not have their experiences dismissed out of hand."" Mr Bercow has confirmed that he had been proposed for a peerage by outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Getting a peerage would enable Mr Bercow to sit in the House of Lords - but he has suggested Downing Street is seeking to block his appointment to the upper chamber. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Leakey argued Mr Bercow should not be given a peerage on the grounds of his behaviour as Speaker. ""He would fly into a rage, the red mist would descend, and he would be jumping up and down and balling out, and shouting insults,"" he said. ""He called me an anti-Semite once after being rather rude and insulting about my background, education and military career."" David Leakey reached the rank of Lieutenant General in the army In 2018 Mr Leakey accused the ex-Speakerof creating a climate of ""fear and intimidation"" and more recently has said he would submit a dossier to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards detailing his complaints. Lord Lisvane, who served as Clerk of the House between 2011 and 2014, has confirmed to the BBC he has submitted a formal complaint, which was understood to be centred around bullying. Hitting back at the accusations, Mr Bercow told Sky News the claims were ""total and utter rubbish"". He said Mr Leakey was ""not employed by me, he wasn't an employee of the House of Commons"". ""He is in absolutely no position whatsoever to comment on my relations with my parliamentary colleagues, of which he is completely and utterly ignorant. ""What we have got here is somebody who left the House, who is thrashing about, desperate to remain relevant, popping up at every turn, trying to make himself seem very important, very centre-stage, very at the heart of things in the way that I went about my work."" In response, Mr Leakey said Mr Bercow ""either doesn't understand or can't remember how the role of Black Rod operates"" adding that ""30% of my work was within or for the House of Commons"". Mr Bercow stepped down as Speaker in October after 10 years in the role and was replaced by Sir Lindsay Hoyle.

Buttigieg and Sanders lead after Iowa vote chaos,"This video can not be played Buttigieg chokes up as he takes early lead in Iowa result Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are leading in the first vote to choose the Democratic candidate to run against President Donald Trump in November's election. The vote in Iowa has been chaotic, beset by technical problems and delays in reporting results. Iowa's Democratic Party said data from 71% of precincts showed Mr Buttigieg on 26.8%, with Mr Sanders on 25.2%. Elizabeth Warren was third on 18.4% and Joe Biden fourth on 15.4%. Amy Klobuchar was on 12.6%, and Andrew Yang on 1%, according to the other preliminary results released on Tuesday evening from all of Iowa's 99 counties. Tom Steyer and Tulsi Gabbard were on less than 1%. But the state party has still not declared a winner from Monday's vote. Democrats have blamed the delay on a coding error with an app being used for the first time to report the votes. Iowa was the first contest in a string of nationwide state-by-state votes, known as primaries and caucuses, that will culminate in the crowning of a Democratic nominee at the party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July. Eleven candidates remain in a Democratic field that has already been whittled down from more than two dozen. The results represent the share of delegates needed to clinch the party nomination under America's quirky political system. Iowa awards only 41 of the 1,991 delegates required to become the Democratic White House nominee. In the popular vote count, partial results showed Mr Sanders leading with 32,673 ballots, while Mr Buttigieg was second at 31,353. However, Mr Buttigieg came top in certain rural areas with smaller populations, and so far has more delegates. Ms Warren was third with 25,692, followed by Mr Biden at 16,447 and Ms Klobuchar at 15,470. A simple guide to US primaries and caucuses Listen to Americast, our new US politics podcast Meet the Democrats vying to take on Trump Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price told a news conference on Tuesday evening the fiasco had been ""simply unacceptable"". ""I apologise deeply for this,"" he added of the turmoil, which has provoked calls for Iowa to lose its coveted spot atop the presidential voting calendar. ""This was a coding error,"" he said, while insisting the data was secure and promising a thorough review. This video can not be played 'The story of the night is... this system sucks' State party officials earlier said the problem was not the result of ""a hack or an intrusion"". Officials were being dispatched across the Hawkeye state to retrieve hard-copy results. They were matching those numbers against results reported via a mobile app that many precinct captains said had crashed. The app was developed by tech firm Shadow Inc., run by veterans of Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 presidential campaign. It was put together in just two months and had not been independently tested,external, the New York Times reported, quoting people briefed on the matter by the Iowa Democratic Party. The party in Nevada, where caucuses will be held on 22 February, has reversed a decision to use the company's software. Trump declares 'win' amid Democratic caucus chaos Voters flocked on Monday to more than 1,600 caucus sites, including libraries, high schools and community centres. President Trump said earlier that the Iowa Democratic caucuses had been an ""unmitigated disaster"". If elected, 38-year-old Mr Buttigieg would be the first openly gay US president. He is the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a city of just over 100,000 people. He is a former Harvard and Oxford University Rhodes scholar, who served as a military intelligence officer in Afghanistan and used to work for global management consultancy McKinsey. Rivals say Mr Buttigieg, who is younger than Macaulay Culkin and Britney Spears, is too inexperienced to be US president. But he says he is transformative outsider who can break the gridlock in Washington and defeat President Trump. Campaigning in Laconia, New Hampshire, on Tuesday evening, Mr Buttigieg welcomed the preliminary results. ""A campaign that started a year ago with four staff members, no name recognition, no money, just a big idea, a campaign that some said should have no business even making this attempt, has taken its place at the front of this race to replace the current president with a better vision for the future,"" he said. We finally have some 2020 Iowa caucuses results to talk about. And they're going to generate a lot of talk - and hand-wringing. There are clear winners, as Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg can both claim some kind of victory, depending on how the final tabulations come in. There's also a clear loser - Joe Biden. He entered Monday leading in some polls and hoping for a strong showing that would put to bed concerns that he is a flawed front-runner. Instead those concerns are wide awake and pacing the room. Unlike candidates like Mr Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Mr Buttigieg, the Biden campaign coffers are thin - and this Iowa performance isn't opening any cash spigots. It could have been worse for the former vice-president - he could have had to give a fourth-place concession speech on Monday night - but the end result is the same. He was unable to land a knock-out blow on fellow moderate Amy Klobuchar, while Mr Buttigieg and Mr Sanders both exit Iowa strengthened, suggesting Mr Biden could be staring at a third-place finish - or worse - in New Hampshire. Until proven otherwise, Biden still has his southern-state firewall, based on support from elderly and black voters. But the flames are licking at his heels. After pumping nearly $800m (Â£610m) into campaigning in Iowa, the rival campaigns expressed dismay at the debacle. Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, told reporters he was ""obviously disappointed"" at the hold-up, which he said was ""not a good night for democracy"". He said there was no reason to cast ""aspersions"" on the results, but criticised Mr Buttigieg's decision to declare victory on Monday night, despite the lack of any official results. ""I don't know how anybody declares victory before you have an official statement from the election results, we're not even declaring victory,"" Mr Sanders said. Ms Warren, a Massachusetts senator, and former US Vice-President Biden earlier on Tuesday questioned the state party's decision to release partial results. Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders told reporters: ""What we're saying is there are some inconsistencies, that the process, the integrity, is at stake."" What are primaries and caucuses?

"Bercow peerage would be 'scandal' - LeakeyJohn Bercow dismisses the claims, while Diane Abbott is criticised for saying it was 'unlikely' Mr Leakey was bullied.UK Politics","This video can not be played David Leakey says John Bercow ""brutalised"" people It ""would be a scandal that Parliament would struggle to live down"" if ex-Commons Speaker John Bercow got a peerage, an ex-Parliament official has said. David Leakey who served in Parliament as Black Rod accused Mr Bercow of ""intolerable behaviour"". But Mr Bercow dismissed his claims as ""total and utter rubbish"". Meanwhile Diane Abbott has been criticised for saying it was ""unlikely"" ex-soldier Mr Leakey was bullied. The shadow home secretary tweeted that Mr Leakey had ""served in Germany, Northern Ireland and Bosnia. But claims he was bullied (i.e. intimidated and coerced) by John Bercow. Unlikely."" She has since deleted her tweet. Responding to her comment, David Penman - general secretary of the FDA Union which represents civil servant - said: ""What a ridiculous comment from an experienced MP, demonstrating blind political partisanship and a complete failure to understand how power is abused in the workplace."" Bercow 'categorically' denies bullying allegations Formal complaint lodged against John Bercow John Bercow bows out as Commons Speaker And Labour MP Dan Jarvis - who served as an army officer -  said ""having a distinguished service record does not preclude you from being a victim of workplace bullying"". ""All of us in the Labour/trade union movement have a responsibility to create a climate where people can voice their concerns and not have their experiences dismissed out of hand."" Mr Bercow has confirmed that he had been proposed for a peerage by outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Getting a peerage would enable Mr Bercow to sit in the House of Lords - but he has suggested Downing Street is seeking to block his appointment to the upper chamber. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Leakey argued Mr Bercow should not be given a peerage on the grounds of his behaviour as Speaker. ""He would fly into a rage, the red mist would descend, and he would be jumping up and down and balling out, and shouting insults,"" he said. ""He called me an anti-Semite once after being rather rude and insulting about my background, education and military career."" David Leakey reached the rank of Lieutenant General in the army In 2018 Mr Leakey accused the ex-Speakerof creating a climate of ""fear and intimidation"" and more recently has said he would submit a dossier to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards detailing his complaints. Lord Lisvane, who served as Clerk of the House between 2011 and 2014, has confirmed to the BBC he has submitted a formal complaint, which was understood to be centred around bullying. Hitting back at the accusations, Mr Bercow told Sky News the claims were ""total and utter rubbish"". He said Mr Leakey was ""not employed by me, he wasn't an employee of the House of Commons"". ""He is in absolutely no position whatsoever to comment on my relations with my parliamentary colleagues, of which he is completely and utterly ignorant. ""What we have got here is somebody who left the House, who is thrashing about, desperate to remain relevant, popping up at every turn, trying to make himself seem very important, very centre-stage, very at the heart of things in the way that I went about my work."" In response, Mr Leakey said Mr Bercow ""either doesn't understand or can't remember how the role of Black Rod operates"" adding that ""30% of my work was within or for the House of Commons"".

Co-founder of Rockstar Games leaves,"Dan Houser is leaving Rockstar Games the company he founded with his brother Co-founder of Rockstar Games, Dan Houser, is leaving the firm he started with his brother Sam in 1998. Mr Houser was a main creative force behind two of the firm's biggest series, Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead. His departure comes after an ""extended break"", Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive said. Rockstar's series have often courted controversy, but are among the best-selling and most critically-acclaimed games of the past two decades. Mr Houser will officially depart in March, according to a notice Take-Two sent to US financial regulators. His brother Sam Houser will remain as the company's president.

New UK flight for Britons in coronavirus-hit city,"Dozens of Britons flown home from the centre of the outbreak last week have been taken into quarantine The UK government is chartering a final flight to bring British nationals back from the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. The plane will leave in the early hours of Sunday morning and land at RAF Brize Norton, the Foreign Office said. It comes asBritons in mainland China have been urged to leave the countryafter the outbreak claimed more lives. More than 100 UK nationals and family members have already been evacuated to Britain from Wuhan. Between 150 and 200 Britons and their dependents remain in Hubei province, where the outbreak began, and about 100 have asked for help to leave, the Foreign Office said. At least427 people have died after contracting the virus and there have been more than 20,000 confirmed cases, most of them in China. How worried should we be? A visual guide to the outbreak Wuhan resident: 'I'd rather die at home' How the new coronavirus will finally get a proper name Coronavirus outbreak hits cruise ship off Japan Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""We have been working round the clock to help British nationals leave Hubei province, on UK, French and New Zealand flights. ""The Foreign Office is chartering a second and final UK flight with space to help all British nationals and their dependants remaining in Hubei to leave. ""I encourage all British nationals in Hubei to register with our teams if they want to leave on this flight."" British nationals in Hubei can contact the Foreign Office on two 24-hour telephone numbers: +86 (0) 1085296600 and +44 (0) 2070081500. Passengers on a plane in Shanghai On Friday, 83 UK citizens were repatriated on a flight out of Wuhan arranged by the UK government. Another 11 Britons joined them on Sunday on a French flight. A further eight UK nationals and six of their family members left on a flight to New Zealand on Tuesday. It has since emerged that a Belgian woman who was on Sunday's flight tested positive for the virus. All of the Britons are now in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral for 14 days - the incubation period of the virus - to ensure they are not infected. One British passenger, Anthony May-Smith, who arrived in the UK on Sunday, was taken to hospital in Oxford to be tested for potential coronavirus. Health Secretary Matt Hancocktold BBC Breakfastthe test came back negative but that Mr May-Smith has returned to quarantine at Arrowe Park ""because the testâ¦ doesn't work until the coronavirus symptoms come through"". Mr Hancock advised anyone who thought they might have symptoms to not leave home and to call 111. Mr Hancock said it was ""low"" risk that an infected person who was not yet showing symptoms could pass on the virus. There have been two confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK - a student at the University of York and one of their relatives. They are being treated at the specialist infectious diseases unit at Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary. Scots teacher staying put in 'ghost town' Beijing Coronavirus fear hits London's Chinatown UK pharmacies see sanitiser sales spike Meanwhile, one British man in China, who fears he contracted the virus in November, has been told he can return to the UK after the Chinese authorities gave him his passport back. Jamie Morris, 23, from New Tredegar in South Wales had said he did not know when he might be able to return from Wuhan because he had submitted his passport in order to extend his residency permit. He will now be able to join other British nationalson the final flight home. On Tuesday, the Foreign Office advised Britons to leave China to minimise the risk of exposure to coronavirus. The UK is also moving non-essential staff out from its embassy and consulates in the country. The only two UK airlines serving China - British Airways and Virgin Atlantic - have suspended their flights between the countries because of fears about the spread of the virus. But other commercial flights to the UK remain available in some parts of China.

Passengers and crew on the ship will now be quarantined for 14 days. British tourist David Abel is among the 3,700 people on board the ship. He told the BBC he was supposed to return to the UK on Tuesday. ""We had a flight booked with BA on Tuesday morning and that has had to be cancelled. We've got no idea when we are going to be allowed off the ship,"" he said. ""All we have been informed [sic] is 14 days quarantine on the ship. That means we've got no interaction with other passengers, food is brought to the room. It's really basic food, nothing like we've enjoyed on the cruise at all.""

UK councils' benefits pages push credit card adsThe data protection watchdog is assessing hundreds of council websites after a BBC investigation.UK,"High-interest credit card ads are being targeted at people seeking benefits advice on UK local council websites. A BBC investigation found more than 950 advertising cookies - small text files that track people on the internet - embedded in council benefits pages. The regulator said it would assess the findings, which showed the majority of councils do not use the correct form of consent under privacy laws. The advertising industry denied using data from vulnerable residents. The BBC Shared Data Unit used the open source software webXray to take a snapshot over two days last October of more than 400 council benefits pages. This found: More than half of UK councils had third-party advertising cookies on their benefits pages - a total of 950 cookies More than two-thirds of councils did not appear to ask for the correct form of consent under privacy laws Examples of targeted adverts on benefits pages seen by the BBC included high-interest credit cards, Black Friday deals, sports cars with features for disabled people and private funeral care plans The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), an independent body set up to uphold information rights, said the setting of non-essential cookies without consent would be illegal. ICO executive director for technology policy and innovation Simon McDougall said: ""This investigation by the BBC further highlights our concerns about the lack of transparency and consent when adtech is used. ""While the ICO is keen to promote innovative uses of technology, that cannot be at the expense of people's fundamental legal rights. We will be assessing the information provided by the BBC."" Privacy International (PI), the UK non-profit privacy advocacy group, is concerned about the impact that targeted advertising has had on the internet as a whole. ""It's just a wild west,"" said technologist Eliot Bendineli. ""There are thousands of things happening every second when you load a page, and you literally have no control. ""Tracking people through benefits pages is sadly typical. It's always the people that are already vulnerable who are going to suffer the most."" Cookies are small text files that track people across the internet and collect data on them. Many cookies are essential and used to improve the browsing experience. They are used for audience measurement, hosting and website design. Third-party advertising cookies help companies deliver ads that are relevant to your browsing habits. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018, ushering in stricter rules around handling and sharing data that could identify people. In practice, this means any company which handles, stores or shares data must ensure the rights of the individual are upheld, or face a hefty fine. Sitting alongside GDPR are the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, which demand full active consent from users before tracking cookies are embedded on browsers. ""I've been a web developer since the late 1990s and a privacy researcher for the past seven years and this may be the most unexpected place I've seen an ad online,"" said Prof Tim Libert, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and creator of the webXray tool used in this investigation. ""In my view targeting residents through benefits pages is utterly reprehensible, as the most protection should be extended to those most in need."" Disability charity Scope added: ""These targeted trackers are cause for concern. ""Being served an advert for a credit card or low-cost loan while applying for state financial support could lead to debt and financial insecurity. ""Everyone needs to do all they can to make sure disabled people are not unfairly targeted when trying to seek out support."" Ads on council websites to boost income Online election ads - who is targeting whom? Google's 'secret web tracking pages' explained The ICO has already taken a strong line on investigating the adtech industry, with areport released in June,externalnoting ""general, systemic concerns"". The data protection watchdog can issue enforcement notices and fines if they detect a breach of data privacy laws. Facing financial pressures, some UK councils have turned to online advertising as a source of extra revenue. For example,the BBC previously reportedone Welsh council earned just under Â£15,000 in revenue from online advertising in 2016-17. The Council Advertising Network (CAN) helps around 50 councils generate income through online advertising. It also uses advertising technology to deliver messages about services to residents. Managing director Lloyd Clark said: ""We automatically block all categories of advertising that could be used to target vulnerable groups. ""The councils have control of these categories."" Defending the industry, Mr Clark said it existed to serve relevant adverts to the public. ""People don't like irrelevant adverts. But it's certainly possible for bad actors to behave like bad actors. ""Given the tech furniture present right now we're in a position where you need to really trust people because the system won't work without it. It creates a real challenge."" A spokesman for Sheffield Council, which had 25 third party advertising cookies on its benefits pages, said: ""Whilst we are reviewing our use of advertising, currently this is an important revenue stream which is used to help fund improvements to our site for citizens. ""The advertising is carefully controlled and many categories are not allowed where we deem this to be potentially harmful, particularly to our most vulnerable users."" Privacy International's Mr Bendineli said: ""Sadly, I think it's possible they [the councils] might be unaware. You can easily imagine that they don't have the budget to set up a proper website, or someone who sets it up doesn't explain how things are working. ""The internet is difficult, and websites are hard to maintain. It's a full time job and even at Privacy International where we focus on that type of stuff we spend a lot of time maintaining everything we have online. We spend a lot of time making sure it's secure."" The local government associations (LGAs) of England and Scotland said they would examine the use of cookies and the guidance offered on their sites. In Northern Ireland, the LGA said each council was responsible for the management of its own website, but ""welcomed"" the BBC's findings ""to support the ongoing management of council websites"". The Welsh Local Government Association did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC. Just under half of advertising cookies found came from Google's advertising arm, DoubleClick. Google told the BBC it did not build advertising profiles from ""sensitive interest categories"". It said: ""We have strict policies preventing advertisers from using such data to target ads."" Google has also said thatit would phase out third-party cookies within the next two yearson websites accessed via its Chrome browser, in response to calls for greater privacy controls. Prof Libert added: ""First and foremost, it is important to note that there is no way for a tracker to force their code onto a site short of hacking it - the site itself must place the code there. ""So the biggest party of responsibility is the website owner without question.""

Tension and theatrics - five takeaways from speechTrump's reality show tactics add drama to tense occasion which laid bare US's deep partisan divide.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the president's speech at the end of his address It was a historic State of the Union address - conducted the day after the Democrats' chaotic Iowa caucuses and the day before the Senate renders its verdict in the president's impeachment trial. At times belligerent, at times emotional, Donald Trump delivered what will probably be his final speech to a joint session of Congress before standing for re-election in November. Say what you will about it - about the whole evening - but it was memorable. Here are a few key takeaways. Trump's State of the Union speech fact-checked The president's speech was bookended by two notable breaches of decorum. It began as the president handed the text of his speech to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi: he pointedly turned away when she reached out to shake his hand. Then, Pelosi declined to use traditional language that it was her ""honour"" to introduce the president. This video can not be played A State of the Union snub? Trump turns away as Pelosi goes to shake his hand. After the conclusion of the address, Pelosi very visibly ripped up the speech text and tossed it on her desk. She would later tell a Fox News producer that it was the ""courteous thing to do"", given her other options. There were also moments during the address itself where tension boiled over. The president attacked Democratic proposals to abolish private health insurance in blunt language, saying he ""would never let socialism destroy US healthcare"". He also engaged in an extended attack on the Democratic-run states of New York and California for their immigration policies. When the president spoke about gun rights, a member of the audience - the father of a child killed in the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida - was removed from the chamber for shouting his objections. Throughout the president's speech, his lines were frequently greeted by raucous cheers from the Republican legislators, while Democrats sat in stony silence or howled in anger. Democratic lawmakers sat in silence for much of Mr Trump's speech - when they weren't erupting in protest In his speech last year, the president called for a rejection of ""the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution,"" touting ""the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good"". Such rhetoric was very much absent on Tuesday night, reflecting the open partisan warfare that has gripped the nation's capital. An incumbent president's election-year State of the Union address typically foreshadows the themes of the campaign. If that's the case, Donald Trump's speech makes clear he's going to bet his presidency on the state of the economy. This video can not be played Republicans chant ""four more years"" - the president hopes a strong economy will win him re-election. While growth figures for the past year have been modest, the president has presided over economic expansion of record length. At the top of his speech - the portion that will have the most Americans watching - Trump rattled through the litany of facts and figures that support his contention that times are good and will stay that way if he's given another four years in office. He cited deregulation, tax cuts and new trade agreements as his recipe for prosperity. In the campaign to come, expect him to make the case that a Democratic change of course will hit American voters in the place that hurts the most - their pocketbooks. At the top of his speech, Donald Trump said that he was building ""the world's most prosperous and inclusive society"". The use of the word ""inclusive"" wasn't by chance. Throughout his speech, the president made repeated overtures to minority groups in America - groups that, according to polls, view the president with considerable scepticism. Trump spoke of how he had signed criminal justice reform and funded historically black colleges and universities. He specifically noted the low levels of unemployment for ""African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans"". Among his guests were the last surviving member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black World War II fighter wing group, and his great-grandson. Trump announced that he was awarding an ""opportunity scholarship"" to a young black girl to attend a private school in Philadelphia. When talk turned to immigration, the president called out Raul Ortiz, who he recently appointed to deputy chief of Border Patrol. Deputy Chief of US Border Patrol Raul Ortiz listens to Mr Trump's third State of the Union address If the president successfully improves his standing among minority voters - and convinces independent voters of all stripes that Democratic accusations of racism and xenophobia are scurrilous attacks - his path to re-election becomes considerably easier. His State of the Union address suggests that he knows this very well. Every president since Ronald Reagan has relied on special guest recognition as a means of highlighting a policy proposal or recognising the valour or sacrifice of noteworthy individuals. Even in the most acrimonious of times, these moments give a president a chance to solicit bipartisan applause and approbation. In Tuesday night's speech, Trump - the inveterate showman - took things one step further. Besides the ""opportunity scholarship moment"", he also paused mid-speech to have his wife award conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom and to surprise a military wife and her family by reuniting them with her husband, an Army sergeant who had spent the past seven months in Afghanistan. Talk show host and conservative hero Rush Limbaugh flashes a thumbs up after being recognised by the president ""We couldn't keep him waiting any longer,"" the president said, in a moment that seemed plucked from script of a daytime talk show. Democrat Bill Clinton used to be famous for his plan-heavy State of the Union addresses, which would bludgeon listeners with a laundry list of ideas and proposals of varying scope and prospects for success. That's not exactly Donald Trump's style, but he did highlight a few priorities - none of which have much hope for success in a Congress beset by partisan gridlock. He called more funding for vocational training in US public schools and for action to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, which prompted chants from House Democrats touting their already passed legislation that the Republican-controlled Senate has yet to take up. When the president suggested that he was dedicated to ensuring health insurance always covers pre-existing conditions, the Democratic groans were particularly loud - a reflection of the fact that the president supports a lawsuit that would nullify the law that provides those protections. Infrastructure spending, the white whale of bipartisan legislators for the entirety of Trump's presidency, garnered widespread applause, as did yet another call for a US mission to the moon and Mars. Trump also called for a law allowing the victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants to sue cities that do not co-operate with federal immigration officials and a ban on late-term abortions - both met by icy glares from the Democrats. And that was pretty much that. If the president is going to campaign on any bold, new ideas, they'll have to wait for another night to be unveiled.

UK councils' benefits pages push credit card ads,"High-interest credit card ads are being targeted at people seeking benefits advice on UK local council websites. A BBC investigation found more than 950 advertising cookies - small text files that track people on the internet - embedded in council benefits pages. The regulator said it would assess the findings, which showed the majority of councils do not use the correct form of consent under privacy laws. The advertising industry denied using data from vulnerable residents. The BBC Shared Data Unit used the open source software webXray to take a snapshot over two days last October of more than 400 council benefits pages. This found: More than half of UK councils had third-party advertising cookies on their benefits pages - a total of 950 cookies More than two-thirds of councils did not appear to ask for the correct form of consent under privacy laws Examples of targeted adverts on benefits pages seen by the BBC included high-interest credit cards, Black Friday deals, sports cars with features for disabled people and private funeral care plans The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), an independent body set up to uphold information rights, said the setting of non-essential cookies without consent would be illegal. ICO executive director for technology policy and innovation Simon McDougall said: ""This investigation by the BBC further highlights our concerns about the lack of transparency and consent when adtech is used. ""While the ICO is keen to promote innovative uses of technology, that cannot be at the expense of people's fundamental legal rights. We will be assessing the information provided by the BBC."" Privacy International (PI), the UK non-profit privacy advocacy group, is concerned about the impact that targeted advertising has had on the internet as a whole. ""It's just a wild west,"" said technologist Eliot Bendineli. ""There are thousands of things happening every second when you load a page, and you literally have no control. ""Tracking people through benefits pages is sadly typical. It's always the people that are already vulnerable who are going to suffer the most."" Cookies are small text files that track people across the internet and collect data on them. Many cookies are essential and used to improve the browsing experience. They are used for audience measurement, hosting and website design. Third-party advertising cookies help companies deliver ads that are relevant to your browsing habits. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018, ushering in stricter rules around handling and sharing data that could identify people. In practice, this means any company which handles, stores or shares data must ensure the rights of the individual are upheld, or face a hefty fine. Sitting alongside GDPR are the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, which demand full active consent from users before tracking cookies are embedded on browsers. ""I've been a web developer since the late 1990s and a privacy researcher for the past seven years and this may be the most unexpected place I've seen an ad online,"" said Prof Tim Libert, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and creator of the webXray tool used in this investigation. ""In my view targeting residents through benefits pages is utterly reprehensible, as the most protection should be extended to those most in need."" Disability charity Scope added: ""These targeted trackers are cause for concern. ""Being served an advert for a credit card or low-cost loan while applying for state financial support could lead to debt and financial insecurity. ""Everyone needs to do all they can to make sure disabled people are not unfairly targeted when trying to seek out support."" Ads on council websites to boost income Online election ads - who is targeting whom? Google's 'secret web tracking pages' explained The ICO has already taken a strong line on investigating the adtech industry, with areport released in June,externalnoting ""general, systemic concerns"". The data protection watchdog can issue enforcement notices and fines if they detect a breach of data privacy laws. Facing financial pressures, some UK councils have turned to online advertising as a source of extra revenue. For example,the BBC previously reportedone Welsh council earned just under Â£15,000 in revenue from online advertising in 2016-17. The Council Advertising Network (CAN) helps around 50 councils generate income through online advertising. It also uses advertising technology to deliver messages about services to residents. Managing director Lloyd Clark said: ""We automatically block all categories of advertising that could be used to target vulnerable groups. ""The councils have control of these categories."" Defending the industry, Mr Clark said it existed to serve relevant adverts to the public. ""People don't like irrelevant adverts. But it's certainly possible for bad actors to behave like bad actors. ""Given the tech furniture present right now we're in a position where you need to really trust people because the system won't work without it. It creates a real challenge."" A spokesman for Sheffield Council, which had 25 third party advertising cookies on its benefits pages, said: ""Whilst we are reviewing our use of advertising, currently this is an important revenue stream which is used to help fund improvements to our site for citizens. ""The advertising is carefully controlled and many categories are not allowed where we deem this to be potentially harmful, particularly to our most vulnerable users."" Privacy International's Mr Bendineli said: ""Sadly, I think it's possible they [the councils] might be unaware. You can easily imagine that they don't have the budget to set up a proper website, or someone who sets it up doesn't explain how things are working. ""The internet is difficult, and websites are hard to maintain. It's a full time job and even at Privacy International where we focus on that type of stuff we spend a lot of time maintaining everything we have online. We spend a lot of time making sure it's secure."" The local government associations (LGAs) of England and Scotland said they would examine the use of cookies and the guidance offered on their sites. In Northern Ireland, the LGA said each council was responsible for the management of its own website, but ""welcomed"" the BBC's findings ""to support the ongoing management of council websites"". The Welsh Local Government Association did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC. Just under half of advertising cookies found came from Google's advertising arm, DoubleClick. Google told the BBC it did not build advertising profiles from ""sensitive interest categories"". It said: ""We have strict policies preventing advertisers from using such data to target ads."" Google has also said thatit would phase out third-party cookies within the next two yearson websites accessed via its Chrome browser, in response to calls for greater privacy controls. Prof Libert added: ""First and foremost, it is important to note that there is no way for a tracker to force their code onto a site short of hacking it - the site itself must place the code there. ""So the biggest party of responsibility is the website owner without question.""

Trump's address to the nation,"Donald Trump's third state of the union address has taken place Trump appeared to snub handshake from House speaker Nancy Pelosi; she tore up his speech later His speech focused on what he called the ""great American comeback"" In optimistic speech, he said ""the years of economic decay are over"" Results from Monday's Iowa caucuses trickle in after technical glitches Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, takes narrow lead in early results Roland Hughes, Max Matza, Holly Honderich and Shrai Popat It's
nearing 23:30 here in Washington, so we are going to wind down our live
coverage of another busy day in US politics. We started out explaining what was happening with the
Democratic race for president in Iowa, and we ended it with President Trump's
third State of the Union address. Here's the latest from Iowa, where
Monday's caucuses aimed to decide who Iowans wanted to run against Mr Trump:  Meanwhile, in Washington:  We'll be back tomorrow for live coverage of the ongoing
impeachment trial into Mr Trump. See you then. It's been a busy few days in US politics - the Iowa caucuses on Monday and the State of the Union address today. It doesn't look like slowing down on Wednesday either. After the chaotic results process, we should (or maybe could) find out who actually won in Iowa and is on the early front foot to be the Democratic nominee. Right now, Pete Buttigieg is in the lead. Oh, and there's also the small matter of the vote on whether to convict President Trump in his impeachment trial. That should happen at about 21:00 east coast time on Wednesday. On BBC World News, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher spoke of the divided body language that coloured Trump's remarks, noting both Trump's snub of top Democrat Nancy Pelosi's attempted handshake and later, Pelosi's shredding of the president speech. But partisan tension aside, ""the point of Trump's speech"", like for any incumbent president before an election ""is to lay out the framework of that re-election campaign,"" Zurcher says. And this year, America's ""booming economy"" was Trump's central pitch, drawing a counterpoint to the Democrats, who he says would endanger a long-term economic growth period. And Trump got most aggressive in two main areas Zurcher says: healthcare and immigration. Zurcher also noted the medal of freedom awarded to Rush Limbaugh, a figure who is is ""notorious among Democrats for what they view as racist and sexist statements"", and known among Republicans as a ""grandfather of conservative politics"". Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi has commented on her headline-grabbing move following Trump's address: ripping up pages of the president's remarks. Asked why she did it, the Speaker of the House told reporters: ""It was the courteous thing to do."" ""It was such a dirty speech,"" she said. âNadie estÃ¡ por encima de la ley.â So says Veronica Escobar, the congresswoman from El Paso, Texas, who is delivering the Spanish-language Democratic rebuttal. The sentence translates to: âNo one is above the law.â âThis is a tragic moment, and Congress must defend our republic,"" she continues in a speech delivered from  a medical clinic in El Paso's Segundo Barrio neighbourhood. She also criticises a statement Trump previously made, calling El Paso a dangerous area. In fact, it is one of the safest communities in America. She calls Trump's words ""a misinformation campaign"". Governor Gretchen Whitmer has wrapped up the Democratic rebuttal. Now a second rebuttal, this time in Spanish, is being delivered by Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar. Take a look at how different lawmakers had very different responses to Trump's remarks this evening. Vice-President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi Democratic members of Congress sit stony-faced Rush Limbaugh, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump gets a thumbs-up from his fellow Republicans ""American workers are hurting,"" says Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in her rebuttal to Mr Trump's speech. ""Wages have stagnated while CEO pay has sky-rocketed,"" she continues, adding that corporations are ""reaping rewards from tax cuts they don't need."" Democrats have made corporate accountability a major issue in the 2020 Democratic election. She is continuing to highlight specific efforts made by state-level Democratic politicians. ""That's strength. That's action,"" she says. Something we meant to mention earlier: a man whose daughter was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida was removed from the House after heckling the president during his remarks. Fred Guttenberg reportedly stood up and shouted something after Trump promised to protect the second amendment - which enshrines the rights of Americans right to keep and bear arms. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi was seen scolding someone in the upper chamber - believed to be Guttenberg - during Trump's remarks on gun rights. Gretchen Whitmer Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, is now delivering the Democrat's rebuttal. ""I'm doing to need a lot more than ten minutes,"" to rebut what Trump said tonight, she says. ""Instead of talking about what he is saying, I'm going to highlight what the Democrats are doing,"" says Whitmer. She is now going from state to state, talking about efforts made by local Democrats to improve life in their districts. ""Everyone in this country benefits when we invest infrastructure,"" she says. We're now waiting for the Democratic rebuttals to Mr Trump's speech, but these are some of the lines he ended with: ""Our brightest discoveries are
not yet known."" ""Our most thrilling stories are not yet told."" ""Our
grandest journeys are not yet made."" ""The American Age, the American Epic,
the American Adventure, has only just begun.""  One hour and 18 minutes. As Trump leaves the chamber, Republicans are overheard telling him ""awesome speech"". Democrats clearly hated it, with several walking out as it was ongoing. Throughout Trump's speech, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, was sitting behind him. When he finished, she was seen tearing a copy of his speech she had on her desk. This all came about 70 minutes after he appeared to snub a handshake from Pelosi, the woman who launched his impeachment proceedings. In an emotional orchestrated moment, the soldier husband of a White House State of the Union guest has just surprised his wife. Sergeant First Class Townsend
Williams was in Afghanistan on his fourth combat deployment, or so we thought... He just walked into the chamber to the shock of his wife and small children. Members of Congress promptly broke out in chants of ""USA"". Reality Check President Trump said that, for the first time in 51 years, ""the cost of prescription drugs actually went down"". In the year to May 2019, the average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell by 0.2% according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the increase in the cost of household items in the US . This is the first price decrease over a 12-month period since 1973, some 47 years ago. But this may not be the most reliable way to measure drug prices according to Inma Hernandez, a pharmacy lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh. ""The CPI is based on a basket of drugs which is representative of popular drugs. So it tends to include widely-used drugs, which are usually cheaper,"" she says. ""However, it is less likely to include newer or less-prescribed drugs, which are more expensive and have higher price increases."" The lack of transparency around drug pricing makes it very difficult to know exactly what's happening to the cost of prescription medication.  ""Three years ago, the
barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and
Syria,"" Trump says, referring to the Islamic State terror group. ""Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent
destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS -- the bloodthirsty killer alâBaghdadi - is dead."" The parents of slain humanitarian aid worker Kayla Mueller - who was killed while in IS captivity - are in the audience tonight. The operation that killed Baghdadi was named after Kayla's birthday, Trump says. He then goes on to tout the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US airstrike at the Baghdad airport in January. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At the top of his speech Donald Trump said that he was
building âthe world's most prosperous and inclusive societyâ. The use of the word âinclusiveâ wasnât by chance. Throughout
his speech, the president made repeated overtures to minority groups in America
â groups that, according to polls, view the president with considerably
scepticism. Trump spoke of how he signed criminal justice reform and
funded historically black colleges and universities. He specifically noted the low levels of unemployment for
âAfrican-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americansâ. Among his guests at the speech were the last surviving
member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black World War II fighter wing group,
and his great-grandson. He announced that he was awarding an âopportunity scholarshipâ
to a young black girl to attend a private school in Philadelphia. When talk turned to immigration, the president called out
Raul Ortiz, who he recently appointed to deputy chief of Border Patrol. If the president successfully improves his standing among
minority voters â and convinces independent voters of all stripes that
Democratic accusations of racism and xenophobia are scurrilous attacks â his
path to re-election becomes considerably easier. His State of the Union address
suggests that he knows this very well. ""We have confirmed a record
number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written,"" says Trump. He referred to his two recently approved Supreme Court Judges, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett
Kavanaugh. But in an ad-libbed line that's not in his speech transcript, he adds: ""And we have many in the pipeline."" New Supreme Court judges can only be added when one dies. Could he be saying that he hopes some Supreme Court justices are not around much longer? ""And as the wall goes up, drug
seizures rise, and border crossings go down, and they're going down rapidly,"" says Trump. His promised wall is not going up ""rapidly"", despite his claim, but is slowly making progress. Just last week, part of the wall on the US-Mexico borderactually collapsed due to high winds. Trump is praising ""heroic"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who are tasked with enforcing immigration policy within America's borders. ""Tragically, there are many
cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary
for these criminal illegal aliens. ""In sanctuary cities, local officials
order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public,
instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."" Cameras pan over California lawmakers as Trump speaks, since that state recently declared the entire state to be a ""sanctuary"" zone. More than 400 jurisdictions across the country, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle - major cities in left-leaning states that did not vote for Mr Trump - have enacted policies protecting undocumented immigrants within their boundaries, creating these so-called ""sanctuary cities"".

A simple guide to US primaries and caucuses,"Iowa, where it's never too cold to caucus Four years after the world watched Donald Trump's momentum build and build until he became the Republican nominee, America is again deciding who will run for the White House. The nominees are being chosen through a series of primaries and caucuses in every US state and territory, that began in Iowa on 3 February and ends in Puerto Rico in early June. The Republican nominee will be Donald Trump. Even though technically he has a challenger, he is so popular among Republicans, he has a clear run ahead of him. With that in mind, the Democratic primaries are the only ones worth watching. It's an unusual process, not all of which makes sense, although we've tried. A whole year before the primaries, the first candidates emerged from hibernation. Over the year, others woke up and eventually 28 people announced they were running to become the Democratic nominee for president. But dwindling funds, luke-warm or (ice-cold) public reaction and campaign infighting have, to varying degrees, led to most of them pulling out of the race. Which Democrat will take on Trump? The strange symbol on one candidate's hand At the start of primary season, 11 people remained in the running, a number that has now reduced to three. In theory, any one of them could become the nominee. In reality, only two now have a chance. The first event of the primary season isn't a primary at all - it's a series of caucuses, in Iowa. These took place on Monday 3 February, in somewhat chaotic fashion. What are caucuses? This video can not be played How Iowa is like the luge: An unconventional guide to the caucuses A caucus involves people attending a meeting - maybe for a few hours - before they vote on their preferred candidate, perhaps via a head count or a show of hands. Those meetings might be in just a few select locations - you can't just turn up at a polling station. As a result, caucuses tend to really suit candidates who are good at rousing their supporters to get out of bed. People like Bernie Sanders, for example, who performed well in Iowa this time, as did Pete Buttigieg. Nine odd things about the Iowa caucuses Democrats' key issues explained Caucuses used to be far more popular back in the day, but this year, Democrats are holding only four in US states - in Nevada, North Dakota, Wyoming and Iowa. If any candidate gets under 15% of the vote in any caucus, their supporters then get to pick a second choice from among the candidates whodidget more than 15%, or they can just choose to sit out the second vote. Why does Iowa matter? A win there for any candidate can help give them momentum and propel them to victory in the primaries. Why is Iowa first in the primary calendar? You can blame Jimmy Carter, sort of. Iowa became first in 1972, for various technical electoral reasons too boring to go into here. But when Carter ran for president in 1976, his team realised they could grab the momentum by campaigning early in Iowa. He won there, then surprisingly won the presidency, and Iowa's fate was sealed. Why does Iowa not matter? Iowa doesn't represent the entire US - it's largely white, so the way people vote there is very, very different than in other states. Its record on picking the eventual nominees is a bit rubbish too, at least when it comes to Republicans - when there's an open Republican race, Iowa hasn't opted for the eventual nominee since 2000. Such names as Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz have won there in recent years. This year, Iowa suffered a bloody nose when the Democratic result was delayed by days due to technical glitches. Its curtain-raiser status may now be in doubt. New Hampshire: Intensely bucolic Eight days after Iowa on Tuesday, 11 February, was the first primary, in New Hampshire. The tiny north-eastern state of only 1.3m people once again became an unlikely hotbed of political activity. What is a primary? Unlike a caucus, where voters are expected to turn up at a few limited locations at certain times and stick around for a while, primary voters can just turn up at a polling booth and vote in secret. Then leave. How does a primary work? The more votes a candidate gets in a caucus or primary, the more ""delegates"" they are awarded, and all candidates will be hoping to win an unbeatable majority of delegates. The number of delegates differs in each state, and is decided by a convoluted series of criteria. In California's primary, for example, there are 415 Democratic delegates up for grabs this year. In New Hampshire, it was only 24. This year is a bit different. Any candidate would need to get at least 15% of the vote in any primary or caucus to be awarded delegates. There are still eight candidates in the running - an unusually large number - so there's a risk the vote share will be spread out and some of the candidates may struggle to reach 15%. After New Hampshire, we started to get a clear picture of who was struggling (Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren), but even though Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg had claimed the most delegates at this stage, neither is guaranteed to become the nominee. The picture became much clearer on... A few other states voted in between New Hampshire and the end of February, but things really started to warm up by Super Tuesday, on 3 March. What is Super Tuesday? THE big date in the primary calendar, when 16 states, territories or groups voted for their preferred candidate in primaries or caucuses. A third of all the delegates available in the entire primary season were up for grabs on Super Tuesday. By the end of the dayit became much clearer that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were the front-runnersfor the Democratic nomination. The two states with the most delegates voted on Super Tuesday - California (with 415 Democratic delegates) and Texas (228). California voted three months earlier than in 2016, making Super Tuesday even more super than normal. After hectic Super Tuesday, everyone gets to cool down for a week, before another busy day on Tuesday, 10 March, when six states vote, with 352 delegates available. After that, the primary season still has three months left to run and at the end, the role of those delegates will become clear... Hillary Clinton celebrates becoming the Democratic nominee at the 2016 convention. This is as good as things got for her campaign. Donald Trump will almost certainly be sworn in as the Republican nominee at the party convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, between 24 and 27 August. The Democrats will confirm their candidate at their own convention between 13 and 16 July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. What happens in a convention? Here's where those delegates come in. Let's say that during primary season, candidate A wins 10 delegates. During the convention, those 10 delegates would vote for candidate A to become the Democratic nominee. (Any party member can apply to be a delegate - they tend to be party activists or local political leaders.) All through the Democratic primaries, there are3,979 delegatesavailable. If any one candidate wins more than 50% of those delegates during primary season (that's1,990 delegates), then they become the nominee in a vote at the convention. But if we get to the Democratic convention and no-one has more than 50% of the delegates, it becomes what's known as a ""contested"" or ""brokered"" convention. This could well happen this year. There are so many candidates that no one frontrunner emerges in the primaries, and they split the delegates between them. In that circumstance, asecondvote would follow. In that second vote, all the 3,979 delegates would vote again, except this time they would be joined by an estimated771 ""superdelegates"". These are senior party officials past and present (former president Bill Clinton is one, as is current Vermont senator and presidential contender Bernie Sanders), and they're free to vote for whomever they wish. If a candidate wins 50% or more in that vote - 2,376 delegates - then they become the nominee. This is all thanks to a rule change in 2020: last time around, the superdelegates voted at the start of the convention, with the delegates. But many had pledged their support to Hillary Clinton even before the convention, leading her rival Mr Sanders to suggest the deck was stacked against him. He's the one who campaigned for the change - and it may benefit him in 2020. After inching past Iowa, negotiated New Hampshire, survived Super Tuesday and come through the convention, there is only one step left for the nominee: the presidential election, on 3 November. We'll explain how that one works a little closer to the time.

Who could take on Trump?,"Election season is getting under way and the race to become the Democratic challenger to Donald Trump is hotting up. Last summer, there were nearly 30 serious candidates vying for the attention of the party's supporters, but only two are still standing. Here's a brief guide to who they are, with some analysis on each of them from the BBC's Anthony Zurcher. Who are they? What are their key issues? What's their secret weapon against President Trump? We've got it all covered. Veteran politician who was a Delaware senator for more than three decades before becoming Barack Obama's vice-president in 2009. Rebuilding the middle class; investing in federal infrastructure; tuition-free public universities. For the better part of 2019, campaign-watchers in the media and the political world were waiting for the former vice-president's stumbles and bumbles to catch up with him. Entire candidacies (Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and others) were built around the premise that the early frontrunner was poised for a fall. That hasn't ended up happening. While other candidates have surged and faded, Biden keeps on keeping on. His support has been doggedly stable, drawing largely from elderly, moderate and black voters. He doesn't have as much money or draw crowds as big as some of his rivals - and that could catch up with him in the end. He hasn't faded, but he hasnât surged either - and the only way that may happen is if he becomes the safe harbour candidate for voters concerned about more radical alternatives. But even if the road gets rocky, Biden has proven he has staying power. Comfortability. Like an old pair of jeans, Biden is a known, unthreatening quantity. After four years of Donald Trump, that could be the ticket to victory. Vermont senator and self-proclaimed ""Democratic socialist"" who came close to the nomination in 2016. Medicare-for-All universal healthcare coverage; raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans; upping the minimum wage. The big question hanging over Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign was whether it would be able to recapture the magic of his 2016 effort. For a while, it was no sure thing. The 78-year-old candidate had a heart attack in October, raising concerns about his age. He was competing in a much more crowded field, which featured another liberal heavyweight, Elizabeth Warren. His polling support ebbed and flowed for much of 2019. By early 2020, however, he had re-established himself again as the progressive standard-bearer, whose sometimes gruff and always consistent message about income inequality and corporate rapaciousness lent him an air of that much-sought-after modern political quality - authenticity. To win the nomination heâll have to either count on a field where the moderate Democratic vote stays divided or ensure that his base reflects the diversity of the Democratic party - all while deflecting what will be a fierce effort by some in the party to derail his campaign. Loyalty. More than any other Democratic candidate, Sanders has a core group of supporters who have stuck with him through thick and thin. They despaired when he lost in 2016, and have been planning his political revival ever since. Now their time has come. Tap here if you can't see the candidate search tool,external Although the field has now been whittled down to a couple of contenders, at one point it had swelled to nearly 30 Democrats. Former congressman John Delaney began his campaign back in the summer of 2017 and was joined a couple of months later by Andrew Yang. After two and a half years of campaigning, Delaney admitted defeat and withdrew in January. Yang dropped out after getting just 1% of votes in Iowa and 3% in New Hampshire. Others, like Michael Bloomberg, left it late to get involved. His strategy was to focus on states that voted on Super Tuesday, spending huge amounts of his personal wealth on ad campaigns. Ultimately, he came away with just a handful of delegates before promptly quitting the race and endorsing Joe Biden. Joe Biden was the accepted frontrunner in this race throughout 2019. After serving as Barack Obama's vice-president for eight years, he had strong name recognition and held a clear lead in national polls. His numbers dipped at the start of 2020 though and Bernie Sanders overtook him inthe RealClearPolitics national average,externalafter a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses. Biden, however, won by a big margin in South Carolina, which helped boost his poll numbers before he then swept the South on Super Tuesday. Although there is usually a clear winner much sooner, the race officially ends in July at the Democratic National Convention where the candidates with the highest number of delegates becomes the party's presidential nominee.

Mobile operators clash on 'notspots' costs,"The mobile operators will meet on Wednesday to try to agree on sharing the costs of masts and other equipment An agreement to share network equipment in order to improve phone coverage in rural areas has hit a stumbling block over costs. Rival operators are unhappy at the price BT-owned EE is asking them to pay to share its equipment. O2's chief said the fees being sought by its rival ""may undermine the viability of the project"". BT said the costs were based,externalon the value of the masts and other investments it had made over the years. A key meeting is due to take place on Wednesday to hammer out the details, the BBC has learned. The Â£1bn Shared Rural Network (SRN) agreement was announced in October and aims to get the mobile operators working together to extend the geographic coverage of 4G to 95% of the UK by 2025. Many rural areas have only patchy service, and some have none at all. The government is contributing Â£500m towards the costs, with the other half of the bill being footed by the mobile operators. The Conservatives want the deal done as soon as possible -  ideally in time for the Budget on 11 March - and has threatened to intervene if the operators cannot reach agreement. The BBC understands that if the mobile operators do fail to agree, the government will consider other ways of achieving its 95% coverage goal. It will, said one industry insider, make delays to improving rural mobile coverage inevitable. Would a supermarket agree to share its shelves with rivals, asked BT's chief executive The Financial Times reported that BT wants to include 320 yet-to-be-built masts in the agreement and to charge 250% more than the existing commercial rate for rivals to access them. One insider told the BBC it would be cheaper for operators to build their own masts. BT has not revealed the commercial agreements it is hoping to sign with other operators but it is believed it will offer rivals a cheaper rate for masts on its emergency service network, which was partially funded by the government. There are several hundreds of these in rural locations. Previously BT's chief executive Marc Allera has said the costs of sharing equipment needed to reflect the fact that EE has 4G coverage in ""significantly more places than any other network"". ""Finding an analogy here is tricky because this is complex, but I sometimes think of it like Sainsbury's building a new superstore in a rural area and being made to give away shelf space to Tesco, Lidl and Asda,""he said in,externala blog. Of the meeting this week BT told the BBC that it was ""ready to go"". ""We've proposed a far simpler and more pragmatic way for SRN to succeed, plus a way to reduce any taxpayer money by also including new sites that are being built by us in the future. ""It's now down to the industry to finalise the deal to get it done."" All the operators said they were committed to getting an agreement. In a blog, O2 chief executive Mark Evans said,external: ""The SRN requires all four mobile network operators to deliver additional investment and an unprecedented level of infrastructure-sharing; it requires the government to deliver planning policy reform and a modest level of funding."" Dave Dyson, chief executive of Three, said: ""Enhancing mobile connectivity for the 9.3 million living in the UK's countryside requires a joined-up approach between the industry and government. ""A Shared Rural Network is the best way to do that, bringing mobile coverage to more places in the UK and giving people in rural areas a similar choice to those living in towns and cities."" And Vodafone told the BBC: ""We remain committed to the Shared Rural Network scheme and are working towards reaching a final agreement.""

nearing 23:30 here in Washington, so we are going to wind down our live
coverage of another busy day in US politics. We started out explaining what was happening with the
Democratic race for president in Iowa, and we ended it with President Trump's
third State of the Union address. Here's the latest from Iowa, where
Monday's caucuses aimed to decide who Iowans wanted to run against Mr Trump:  Meanwhile, in Washington:  We'll be back tomorrow for live coverage of the ongoing
impeachment trial into Mr Trump. See you then. It's been a busy few days in US politics - the Iowa caucuses on Monday and the State of the Union address today. It doesn't look like slowing down on Wednesday either. After the chaotic results process, we should (or maybe could) find out who actually won in Iowa and is on the early front foot to be the Democratic nominee. Right now, Pete Buttigieg is in the lead. Oh, and there's also the small matter of the vote on whether to convict President Trump in his impeachment trial. That should happen at about 21:00 east coast time on Wednesday. On BBC World News, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher spoke of the divided body language that coloured Trump's remarks, noting both Trump's snub of top Democrat Nancy Pelosi's attempted handshake and later, Pelosi's shredding of the president speech. But partisan tension aside, ""the point of Trump's speech"", like for any incumbent president before an election ""is to lay out the framework of that re-election campaign,"" Zurcher says. And this year, America's ""booming economy"" was Trump's central pitch, drawing a counterpoint to the Democrats, who he says would endanger a long-term economic growth period. And Trump got most aggressive in two main areas Zurcher says: healthcare and immigration. Zurcher also noted the medal of freedom awarded to Rush Limbaugh, a figure who is is ""notorious among Democrats for what they view as racist and sexist statements"", and known among Republicans as a ""grandfather of conservative politics"". Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi has commented on her headline-grabbing move following Trump's address: ripping up pages of the president's remarks. Asked why she did it, the Speaker of the House told reporters: ""It was the courteous thing to do."" ""It was such a dirty speech,"" she said. âNadie estÃ¡ por encima de la ley.â So says Veronica Escobar, the congresswoman from El Paso, Texas, who is delivering the Spanish-language Democratic rebuttal. The sentence translates to: âNo one is above the law.â âThis is a tragic moment, and Congress must defend our republic,"" she continues in a speech delivered from  a medical clinic in El Paso's Segundo Barrio neighbourhood. She also criticises a statement Trump previously made, calling El Paso a dangerous area. In fact, it is one of the safest communities in America. She calls Trump's words ""a misinformation campaign"". Governor Gretchen Whitmer has wrapped up the Democratic rebuttal. Now a second rebuttal, this time in Spanish, is being delivered by Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar. Take a look at how different lawmakers had very different responses to Trump's remarks this evening. Vice-President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi Democratic members of Congress sit stony-faced Rush Limbaugh, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump gets a thumbs-up from his fellow Republicans ""American workers are hurting,"" says Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in her rebuttal to Mr Trump's speech. ""Wages have stagnated while CEO pay has sky-rocketed,"" she continues, adding that corporations are ""reaping rewards from tax cuts they don't need."" Democrats have made corporate accountability a major issue in the 2020 Democratic election. She is continuing to highlight specific efforts made by state-level Democratic politicians. ""That's strength. That's action,"" she says. Something we meant to mention earlier: a man whose daughter was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida was removed from the House after heckling the president during his remarks. Fred Guttenberg reportedly stood up and shouted something after Trump promised to protect the second amendment - which enshrines the rights of Americans right to keep and bear arms. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi was seen scolding someone in the upper chamber - believed to be Guttenberg - during Trump's remarks on gun rights. Gretchen Whitmer Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, is now delivering the Democrat's rebuttal. ""I'm doing to need a lot more than ten minutes,"" to rebut what Trump said tonight, she says. ""Instead of talking about what he is saying, I'm going to highlight what the Democrats are doing,"" says Whitmer. She is now going from state to state, talking about efforts made by local Democrats to improve life in their districts. ""Everyone in this country benefits when we invest infrastructure,"" she says. We're now waiting for the Democratic rebuttals to Mr Trump's speech, but these are some of the lines he ended with: ""Our brightest discoveries are
not yet known."" ""Our most thrilling stories are not yet told."" ""Our
grandest journeys are not yet made."" ""The American Age, the American Epic,
the American Adventure, has only just begun.""  One hour and 18 minutes. As Trump leaves the chamber, Republicans are overheard telling him ""awesome speech"". Democrats clearly hated it, with several walking out as it was ongoing. Throughout Trump's speech, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, was sitting behind him. When he finished, she was seen tearing a copy of his speech she had on her desk. This all came about 70 minutes after he appeared to snub a handshake from Pelosi, the woman who launched his impeachment proceedings. In an emotional orchestrated moment, the soldier husband of a White House State of the Union guest has just surprised his wife. Sergeant First Class Townsend
Williams was in Afghanistan on his fourth combat deployment, or so we thought... He just walked into the chamber to the shock of his wife and small children. Members of Congress promptly broke out in chants of ""USA"". Reality Check President Trump said that, for the first time in 51 years, ""the cost of prescription drugs actually went down"". In the year to May 2019, the average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell by 0.2% according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the increase in the cost of household items in the US . This is the first price decrease over a 12-month period since 1973, some 47 years ago. But this may not be the most reliable way to measure drug prices according to Inma Hernandez, a pharmacy lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh. ""The CPI is based on a basket of drugs which is representative of popular drugs. So it tends to include widely-used drugs, which are usually cheaper,"" she says. ""However, it is less likely to include newer or less-prescribed drugs, which are more expensive and have higher price increases."" The lack of transparency around drug pricing makes it very difficult to know exactly what's happening to the cost of prescription medication.  ""Three years ago, the
barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and
Syria,"" Trump says, referring to the Islamic State terror group. ""Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent
destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS -- the bloodthirsty killer alâBaghdadi - is dead."" The parents of slain humanitarian aid worker Kayla Mueller - who was killed while in IS captivity - are in the audience tonight. The operation that killed Baghdadi was named after Kayla's birthday, Trump says. He then goes on to tout the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US airstrike at the Baghdad airport in January. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At the top of his speech Donald Trump said that he was
building âthe world's most prosperous and inclusive societyâ. The use of the word âinclusiveâ wasnât by chance. Throughout
his speech, the president made repeated overtures to minority groups in America
â groups that, according to polls, view the president with considerably
scepticism. Trump spoke of how he signed criminal justice reform and
funded historically black colleges and universities. He specifically noted the low levels of unemployment for
âAfrican-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americansâ. Among his guests at the speech were the last surviving
member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black World War II fighter wing group,
and his great-grandson. He announced that he was awarding an âopportunity scholarshipâ
to a young black girl to attend a private school in Philadelphia. When talk turned to immigration, the president called out
Raul Ortiz, who he recently appointed to deputy chief of Border Patrol. If the president successfully improves his standing among
minority voters â and convinces independent voters of all stripes that
Democratic accusations of racism and xenophobia are scurrilous attacks â his
path to re-election becomes considerably easier. His State of the Union address
suggests that he knows this very well. ""We have confirmed a record
number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written,"" says Trump. He referred to his two recently approved Supreme Court Judges, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett
Kavanaugh. But in an ad-libbed line that's not in his speech transcript, he adds: ""And we have many in the pipeline."" New Supreme Court judges can only be added when one dies. Could he be saying that he hopes some Supreme Court justices are not around much longer? ""And as the wall goes up, drug
seizures rise, and border crossings go down, and they're going down rapidly,"" says Trump. His promised wall is not going up ""rapidly"", despite his claim, but is slowly making progress. Just last week, part of the wall on the US-Mexico borderactually collapsed due to high winds. Trump is praising ""heroic"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who are tasked with enforcing immigration policy within America's borders. ""Tragically, there are many
cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary
for these criminal illegal aliens. ""In sanctuary cities, local officials
order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public,
instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."" Cameras pan over California lawmakers as Trump speaks, since that state recently declared the entire state to be a ""sanctuary"" zone. More than 400 jurisdictions across the country, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle - major cities in left-leaning states that did not vote for Mr Trump - have enacted policies protecting undocumented immigrants within their boundaries, creating these so-called ""sanctuary cities"".

She is now going from state to state, talking about efforts made by local Democrats to improve life in their districts. ""Everyone in this country benefits when we invest infrastructure,"" she says. We're now waiting for the Democratic rebuttals to Mr Trump's speech, but these are some of the lines he ended with: ""Our brightest discoveries are
not yet known."" ""Our most thrilling stories are not yet told."" ""Our
grandest journeys are not yet made."" ""The American Age, the American Epic,
the American Adventure, has only just begun.""  One hour and 18 minutes. As Trump leaves the chamber, Republicans are overheard telling him ""awesome speech"". Democrats clearly hated it, with several walking out as it was ongoing. Throughout Trump's speech, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, was sitting behind him. When he finished, she was seen tearing a copy of his speech she had on her desk. This all came about 70 minutes after he appeared to snub a handshake from Pelosi, the woman who launched his impeachment proceedings. In an emotional orchestrated moment, the soldier husband of a White House State of the Union guest has just surprised his wife. Sergeant First Class Townsend
Williams was in Afghanistan on his fourth combat deployment, or so we thought... He just walked into the chamber to the shock of his wife and small children. Members of Congress promptly broke out in chants of ""USA"". Reality Check President Trump said that, for the first time in 51 years, ""the cost of prescription drugs actually went down"". In the year to May 2019, the average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell by 0.2% according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the increase in the cost of household items in the US . This is the first price decrease over a 12-month period since 1973, some 47 years ago. But this may not be the most reliable way to measure drug prices according to Inma Hernandez, a pharmacy lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh. ""The CPI is based on a basket of drugs which is representative of popular drugs. So it tends to include widely-used drugs, which are usually cheaper,"" she says. ""However, it is less likely to include newer or less-prescribed drugs, which are more expensive and have higher price increases."" The lack of transparency around drug pricing makes it very difficult to know exactly what's happening to the cost of prescription medication.  ""Three years ago, the
barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and
Syria,"" Trump says, referring to the Islamic State terror group. ""Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent
destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS -- the bloodthirsty killer alâBaghdadi - is dead."" The parents of slain humanitarian aid worker Kayla Mueller - who was killed while in IS captivity - are in the audience tonight. The operation that killed Baghdadi was named after Kayla's birthday, Trump says. He then goes on to tout the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US airstrike at the Baghdad airport in January. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At the top of his speech Donald Trump said that he was
building âthe world's most prosperous and inclusive societyâ. The use of the word âinclusiveâ wasnât by chance. Throughout
his speech, the president made repeated overtures to minority groups in America
â groups that, according to polls, view the president with considerably
scepticism. Trump spoke of how he signed criminal justice reform and
funded historically black colleges and universities. He specifically noted the low levels of unemployment for
âAfrican-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americansâ. Among his guests at the speech were the last surviving
member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black World War II fighter wing group,
and his great-grandson. He announced that he was awarding an âopportunity scholarshipâ
to a young black girl to attend a private school in Philadelphia. When talk turned to immigration, the president called out
Raul Ortiz, who he recently appointed to deputy chief of Border Patrol. If the president successfully improves his standing among
minority voters â and convinces independent voters of all stripes that
Democratic accusations of racism and xenophobia are scurrilous attacks â his
path to re-election becomes considerably easier. His State of the Union address
suggests that he knows this very well. ""We have confirmed a record
number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written,"" says Trump. He referred to his two recently approved Supreme Court Judges, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett
Kavanaugh. But in an ad-libbed line that's not in his speech transcript, he adds: ""And we have many in the pipeline."" New Supreme Court judges can only be added when one dies. Could he be saying that he hopes some Supreme Court justices are not around much longer? ""And as the wall goes up, drug
seizures rise, and border crossings go down, and they're going down rapidly,"" says Trump. His promised wall is not going up ""rapidly"", despite his claim, but is slowly making progress. Just last week, part of the wall on the US-Mexico borderactually collapsed due to high winds. Trump is praising ""heroic"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who are tasked with enforcing immigration policy within America's borders. ""Tragically, there are many
cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary
for these criminal illegal aliens. ""In sanctuary cities, local officials
order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public,
instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."" Cameras pan over California lawmakers as Trump speaks, since that state recently declared the entire state to be a ""sanctuary"" zone. More than 400 jurisdictions across the country, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle - major cities in left-leaning states that did not vote for Mr Trump - have enacted policies protecting undocumented immigrants within their boundaries, creating these so-called ""sanctuary cities"".

Trump State of the Union to focus on US 'comeback',"President Donald Trump is due to give the annual State of the Union address in the same chamber where he was impeached less than three months ago. The speech to Congress Tuesday night, with the theme ""the great American comeback"", will highlight key election year accomplishments. Mr Trump will tout US economic and military strength, US media report. The speech comes as Mr Trump is expected to be acquitted by the Senate in his impeachment trial on Wednesday. The address - Mr Trump's third and possibly last, if he loses his re-election bid in November - is due to begin at 21:00, local time. He is expected to use the address to make his pitch to voters by emphasising optimistic economic figures and criticising rivals. He is also expected to offer his own plans for healthcare, immigration and economic growth, US media say, contrasting his approach with that of the Democrats he accuses of ""socialism"". During Mr Trump's time in office, unemployment has dropped to 3.5%, the lowest in half a century - an accomplishment the president has often pointed to as a reason to re-elect him. However, economic growth and investment has slowed in the past three years. The Pelosi clap and other talking points from last year's address What is the State of the Union speech? Four reactions to Trump's first State of the Union speech The president has invited eight special guests to the address - among them are two military veterans, a former Venezuelan police chief, and the brother of a man killed by an undocumented immigrant. Following the address, Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer will give a rebuttal and congresswoman Veronica Escobar of Texas will follow in Spanish. At least seven Democratic lawmakers, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, have announced their intention boycott the State of the Union. ""[Mr Trump] does not embody the principles, the responsibility, the grace, nor the integrity that is required of the president,"" Ms Pressley said in a statement. The presidential address is due to begin hours after senators conclude their speeches in the weeks-long impeachment trial to determine whether Mr Trump should be removed from office. The president was impeached by the House of Representatives in December on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The first charge centres on the allegation that he pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Democrat Joe Biden. The second charge accuses him of purposefully obstructing the Congressional impeachment investigation. Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing. The Republican-led Senate is expected to acquit him, with Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, urging his colleagues to ""reject the House abuse of power"" with their vote on Wednesday. ""Vote to protect our institutions, vote to reject new precedence that would reduce the [Constitution] framer's design to rubble,"" he said. ""Vote to acquit the president of these charges."" West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate who has voted with Republicans in the past, then called for legislation to censure Mr Trump over the Ukraine matter. ""Censure would allow this body to unite across party lines,"" Mr Manchin said. ""[Trump's] behaviour cannot go unchecked by the Senate and censure would allow a bipartisan statement condemning his unacceptable behaviour in the strongest terms."" A Gallup poll,externalreleased on Tuesday found Mr Trump's approval ratings reach a personal best of 49% ahead of the address.

RHI report to be published on 13 March,"The RHI scheme brought Stormont's institutions to collapse in January 2017 The report into the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme (RHI), which led to the collapse of devolution in 2017, will be published on Friday 13 March. The inquiry chairman, Sir Patrick Coghlin, will make a statement in the Long Gallery, Parliament Buildings in Belfast. The scheme was set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, but it closed in 2016 after concerns were raised about cost controls. The inquiry was established in 2017. Major flaws in the set-up and implementation of the scheme meant it effectively encouraged individuals and businesses to burn more fuel to earn more money. It became known as the ""cash-for-ash"" scandal and the scheme risked going vastly over budget, with fears the overspend could reach as much as Â£700m over 20 years. The inquiry panel is made of up of Sir Patrick Coghlin (centre), Dame Una O'Brien and Dr Keith MacLean The scheme was shut in 2016 and deep cuts in subsidies introduced in 2017 and 2019 brought it within budget. A top civil servant has since told MPs that the overspend figure had actually been just over Â£33m before the measures to curb spending were introduced. Since the scheme was closed to new entrants, available cash has been handed back to the treasury. The sum was Â£25m this year and if no replacement scheme is established, almost Â£400m would be returned over the remaining lifetime of the scheme. Three years after it was established the Renewable Heat Inquiry will issue its report next month. The Chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin, has chosen Stormont, where the political institutions collapsed in the wake of the scandal. It will address several important questions: was there a DUP conspiracy to delay lucrative cost controls in the runaway scheme? did former Economy Minister Arlene Foster pay enough attention as her officials designed and implemented it? what lessons must the civil service learn to ensure it never happens again? The contents will be eagerly anticipated and pored over to see whether three years on, they have any political ramifications. The scheme ultimately led to the collapse of power sharing at Stormont in January 2017 when Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in protest at the DUP's handling of the scandal. The scheme was run by Stormont's Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Deti), which later became the Department for the Economy (DfE). The ministers in office during the creation and implementation of the scheme were the DUP's Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell.
