US orders families of embassy staff to leave Ukraine,"A Ukrainian civilian takes part in a training exercise - Russian forces have been mounting at the border Britain has started withdrawing staff from its embassy in Ukraine, amid growing fears of a Russian invasion. Officials say there have been no specific threats to British diplomats, but about half of the staff working in Kyiv will return to the UK. The US has ordered relatives of its embassy staff to leave, saying an invasion could come ""at any time"". Russia has denied plans for military action, but tens of thousands of troops have amassed on the border. The embassy moves were described as precautionary, and nothing specific is thought to have occurred in the past 24 hours to have triggered the decisions of the US and UK. EU staff in Ukraine will stay in place for now, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saying he would not ""dramatise"" the tensions. Members of the Nato alliance, including Denmark, Spain, Bulgaria and the Netherlands, are sending more fighter jets and warships to Eastern Europe to bolster defences in the region. With an estimated 100,000 Russian troops now at the border with Ukraine, the head of Nato has warned there is a risk of fresh conflict in Europe. The US also told non-essential staff they could leave Ukraine, stressing its moves were not an evacuation. But the State Department told AFP news agency that if there was a Russian invasion, it  would ""not be in a position to evacuate US citizens"". Americans have also been warned by officials not to travel to Ukraine and Russia due to the ""potential for harassment"" against them. Ukraine said it was ""premature"" of the US to withdraw relatives of staff, calling the decision ""a display of excessive caution"". EXPLAINED:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? FROM KYIV:Ukrainians wait as Russia faces off with the West FROM BRUSSELS:Europe 'closest to war' in decades UK SUPPORT:UK says it is sending weapons to defend Ukraine On Saturday, some 90 tonnes of US ""lethal aid""including ammunition for ""front-line defenders"" arrived in Ukraine. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the government was putting together a ""series of actions that would figure into [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin's calculus"" including beefing up defences in Ukraine with more military assistance. Russia has seized Ukrainian territory before, when it annexed Crimea in 2014, following fierce protests in Ukraine that toppled the country's pro-Russian president. Russian forces seized control of Crimea before the territory voted to join Russia in a referendum the West and Ukraine deemed illegal. Russian-backed rebels control areas of eastern Ukraine near Russia's borders in a conflict which has cost an estimated 14,000 lives. A 2015 peace deal is far from being fulfilled. On Sunday, the UK Foreign Office accused Mr Putin ofplanning to install a pro-Moscow figure to lead Ukraine's government. The man named by the UK Foreign Office - former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev - called the claims ""stupid"" in an interview with Reuters news agency. UK ministers have warned that the Russian government will face serious consequences if there is an incursion. US officials said they were concerned that Russia could try to topple and replace the Ukraine government but declined to comment on the UK accusation.

Ukrainians wait as Russia faces off with West,"Christmas in Kyiv has continued as normal, with little sign of anxiety or alert Sometimes it looks a bit like a diplomatic version of ""does he take sugar?"" In Geneva and Brussels, Western diplomats face off against their Russian counterparts, discussing, among other things, Ukraine's ability as a sovereign, independent state, to shape its own destiny. But Ukraine is not there. No matter how many times senior US officials repeat the mantra ""nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine"" - and they repeat it at every opportunity - it's hard for Ukrainians to avoid wondering just what is being discussed behind their backs. With an estimated 100,000 Russian troops massed on the country's northern and eastern borders, you might think this would be cause for serious alarm. Orthodox Christmas was celebrated here last Friday, and if you stroll through Kyiv's busy Christmas markets you're not exactly assailed by a sense of heightened alert and anxiety. ""People are used to heavy times,"" says Petro Burkovsky from one of Kyiv's oldest independent think tanks, the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation. ""In the 20th Century, we had many occasions when people lived in daily horror. It's part of their historical memory."" 10 January:Senior Russian and US diplomats met in the Swiss city of Geneva 12 January:Nato-Russia Council meets in Brussels, for the first time since 2019 13 January:The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe meets in Vienna. The US, Russia and Ukraine are all OSCE members Ukraine's current horror has been going on for almost eight years, since masked Russian troops first appeared on the streets of Crimea. Fighting broke out in the eastern Donbas region in April 2014. Since then, 14,000 soldiers and civilians have been killed in what the government in Kyiv calls the ""Russian-Ukrainian War"". Russia insists to this day that it is not a party to the conflict. Each morning, at a short, sombre ceremony outside the defence ministry in Kyiv, Ukrainian soldiers killed on that particular calendar day since independence in 1991 are commemorated. The vast majority have died since 2014. On the morning we attend, four names are read out, each killed on 11 January. The last of them, Oleh Andriyenko, died a year ago. A ceremony takes place in Kyiv every day to commemorate those who have fallen Each name is met with a volley of gunfire and the toll of a bell. Across town, the faces of dead soldiers stare out in serried ranks from the walls of St Michael's Cathedral in a memorial that stretches for almost 100m. Passers-by stop and reflect, undeterred by the snow and freezing temperatures. Viktor Moroshan, 63, was injured during the ferocious battle for Ilovaisk in August and September 2014. He points to the faces of fallen colleagues from the volunteer Donbas Battalion, which took heavy losses. ""Everyone had one goal,"" he says finally. ""To liberate our land from those Russians."" Viktor met his wife, Tetyana, while he was recovering in the hospital in where she was a volunteer. ""Maybe the war will be big next time,"" she says. ""He [Putin] has a lot of plans to start a new war. It's not a fairy tale."" Viktor describes himself as ethnically Russian, from one of the areas now under rebel control. But his hatred for Russian leader Vladimir Putin is deep. ""He's a maniac. A killer."" Retired now, he says he still keeps an emergency bulletproof vest and helmet ready. ""My wife says 'Vitya, maybe you shouldn't.' But I say we need to be ready. No-one else can defend our fatherland but us."" It's the kind of defiant talk you might expect in a country facing potentially overwhelming odds and knowing that if it comes to a fight, there will be limits to support from outside. WHAT NEXT?Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? EUROPE'S ROLEEU looks for role in Russian row with West RUSSIA'S MOVES:What is Vladimir Putin planning? PEACE HOPES:Can a solution be found for war in Ukraine's east? Ukraine's Western allies talk of ""massive"" consequences if Russia mounts an incursion. But while those could well include increased military assistance, it would be Ukrainians alone doing the fighting and the dying. Hence the growing support for Nato membership. ""Every time Russia starts an escalation in the front line, support for Nato membership grows,"" says Petro Burkovsky, ""and the readiness to make concessions with Russia falls."" Publicly, Nato leaders say the door to membership, opened to Ukraine and Georgia in 2008, is still open. Ukraine's deputy prime minister, visiting Nato headquarters in Brussels on Monday, repeated her government's refrain. ""We have the inherent, sovereign right to choose our own security arrangements,"" Olga Stefanishyna told reporters. ""Including treaties and alliances."" But it's hardly a secret that Nato membership is not on the cards right now. Western officials know it's the very thing most likely to provoke the military confrontation they're so anxious to avoid. Mr Burkovsky says Ukraine has little choice but to wait out a slow-burning, long-term crisis. ""Right now we have to accept the reality of confrontation and conflict with Russia,"" he says. ""Maybe in the course of time, the situation in Russia will change. Russia will not be as formidable as it is now, Ukraine will be stronger and the West will be more decisive towards Ukraine and towards Russia."" For the time being, he says, Ukraine should concentrate on avoiding the fate of two of Russia's other neighbours, Belarus and Kazakhstan. ""They show the fate of people in countries that are Russian satellites,"" he says. ""Most people in Ukraine don't want this destiny for them and of course for their children.""

"Impact of restrictions 'worth it', says Sturgeon","This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says case numbers are ""hopefully now... very firmly on the downward slope"" The impact of Scotland's Covid restrictions on business and hospitality have been ""worth it"", First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. Ms Sturgeon said she understood the measures had a ""very adverse"" effect. But she told the BBC'sSunday Morning programmethat ""we're hopefully seeing Scotland firmly on the downward slope"". Restrictions introduced over the festive period are being phased out, with nightclubs reopening and large indoor events resuming from Monday. The first minister said the rules made enough of a difference to the spread of the Omicron variant to justify the financial impact. Scotland to lift most remaining Covid restrictions What are the Covid rules in Scotland? She added: ""That's not me saying I don't understand and agree that those measures had a very adverse affect on businesses. Hospitality throughout the pandemic has been one of the worst hit sectors. ""But it is not a case of having protective measures and businesses are damaged, or having no proactive measures and everything is fine. ""It is the difference between having protective measures that stem transmission, or allowing transmission to go completely uncontrolled - in which case the impact on business is even greater and even more damaging. "" Ms Sturgeon said hospitality had been one of the ""worst hit"" sectors From Monday guidance advising adults against meeting up with more than three households at a time will also be scrapped, along with curbs on indoor contact sports. However longer-running measures such as the use of face coverings on public transport and indoor public places will continue. Scotland'svaccine passport scheme for businesses and eventsremains in place. Ms Sturgeon said it helped ""as a package of measures"" to protect against transmission. She added: ""I don't underplay the impact of any of these measures on businesses and the night-time industry, but checking Covid certification is a better alternative to being closed."" She said the scheme was ""not causing anybody any real hardship"" and had allowed large events to go ahead. The first minister said she hoped that vaccine passports and wearing of facemasks would ""eventually"" come to an end. She said: ""None of us enjoy wearing masks, they are not the biggest handicap to endure as we try to spread transmission."" Ms Sturgeon said there would be big ""economic consequences"" if we let virus spread in an uncontrolled way. This video can not be played Stephen Kerr says Scottish government has âditheredâ on Covid compensation On Saturday there were 6,768 new Covid cases in Scotland - a fall of around 400 from the previous day. There were 1,458 people in hospital, down from 1,511 on Friday. Conservative MSP Stephen Kerr welcomed the lifting of restrictions, but urged the Scottish government to quickly deliver compensation for ""the pain inflicted on the hospitality sector and night time economy"". He toldBBC Scotland's The Sunday Show: ""We should see the evidence when Nicola Sturgeon says it was all worthwhile. ""Infection rates for this variant of Covid were as great here as in any other part of the UK. He added: ""What I can't applaud the Scottish government for doing is dithering in getting the compensation they promised these businesses. ""Some don't even know how to apply for the money. The Scottish government have a lot to answer for."" Meanwhile, Ms Sturgeon said she would set the legislative timetable for a second Scottish independence referendum in ""the coming weeks"". She said ""preparatory work is underway"" and her aim remained to take steps toenable a referendum to take place before the end of 2023.

England beat West Indies in second T20 by one run,"Reece Topley marked his return to the England T20 side with a wicket and a run-out Second Twenty20 international, Barbados: England 171-8 (20 overs):Roy 45 (31), Moeen 31 (24) West Indies 170-8 (20 overs):Hosein 44* (16), Moeen 3-24 England won by one run, series level at 1-1 Scorecard England dominated the majority of the second T20 against West Indies but ultimately won by just one run after some astonishing late hitting. West Indies needed a seemingly hopeless 30 from the final over, only for Akeal Hosein to take Saqib Mahmood for 28, including three sixes off the last three balls. England earlier bounced back frombeing bowled out for 103in the first T20 to post 171-8 on a similarly challenging pitch. They were propelled by Jason Roy taking 24 off Fabian Allen's 11th over, as 107 runs came in the second half of the innings. Roy made 45, adding 61 with Moeen Ali, who contributed 31, while Chris Jordan once again shone on the island of his birth with a cameo of 27. Left-arm seamer Reece Topley, playing his first T20 international for nearly six years, trapped Brandon King lbw and athletically ran out Shai Hope to leave West Indies reeling on 6-2. With excessive turn on offer, spinners Moeen and Adil Rashid mesmerised the hosts in the middle overs, sharing five wickets. But Romario Shepherd blasted five sixes in his 44 not out, while Hosein's unbeaten 44 came from only 16 balls to make England's margin of victory so much tighter than it should have been. The five-match series is level at 1-1. The third game is on Wednesday. Given the fright they were given at the end of the match, England were indebted to a batting display vastly improved from Saturday's collapse. Whereas the tourists struggled to adapt to the conditions in the series opener, on Sunday they were more willing to be patient before unleashing the batting aggression that is their trademark Roy typified this approach. He lacked fluency as opening partner Tom Banton swept and reverse-swept 25 off 18 balls only to hammer a return catch to left-arm spinner Allen, who then disturbed James Vince's off stump. Roy had 17 from 23 balls at the halfway stage, but exploded into life with three fours and two sixes in the first over of the second half. One of the maximums, a slog sweep, went out of the ground. When he fell in the next over, caught at long-on from the bowling of Shepherd, Roy had taken 28 runs off his seven previous deliveries. Moeen was missed twice - the second a bad drop by Odean Smith - as West Indies failed to match the fielding standards of the previous evening. However, when Moeen and Sam Billings were dismissed in consecutive overs, there was an opening for the hosts. It was snuffed out by Jordan and captain Eoin Morgan adding 31 at 10 runs an over. It turned out to be just enough. Topley last played the shortest format for England during their run to the 2016 World Cup final, with a career-threatening back injury then preventing him from featuring in international cricket for four years. In replacing Tymal Mills he was England's sole change from Saturday and he took only two legal deliveries to make an impact, pinning King with a hooping inswinger. The run-out of Hope was more spectacular. Parrying a stop in his follow-through, Topley chased the rebound, dived and flicked the ball on to the non-striker's stumps. He would have had another wicket had Liam Dawson held onto a skier from Nicholas Pooran at mid-wicket. Still, Moeen and Rashid took control, bowling in tandem for six overs that brought five wickets for 32 runs. Masterful leg-spinner Rashid had Kieron Pollard and Darren Bravo both lbw on review, while off-spinner Moeen continued his fine all-round display by having Pooran and Odean Smith hole out either side of snaffling a sharp caught and bowled off Jason Holder - 3-24 represented his career-best figures. From an almost hopeless position - 61 were needed from the final three overs with only two wickets in hand - Shepherd chanced his arm. He hit Jordan for three sixes in the 18th over, but after Topley was tight in the 19th, the result was barely in doubt going into Mahmood's final set. Still, Hosein's assault of two fours and three sixes was extraordinary and, although the one-run margin does not tell the story of England's superiority, they were extremely ragged at the death. It might have been worse for the tourists had Mahmood not got away with a marginal wide decision from the first legal delivery of the over, much to the frustration of Hosein, who ended with the highest score by a number 10 in T20 internationals. England captain Eoin Morgan:""I was delighted and even with the last quarter, with a relatively inexperienced international side, those are the games you want to play in. For the majority of today I thought we were brilliant."" West Indies captain Kieron Pollard:""I can see the confidence with the guys in the changing room. We will have days like this but my thing is the fight that the guys continue to show."" Player of the match Moeen Ali:""We thought we'd got a really good score but they played well. We paced it better today and each batter gave themselves five or six balls. Chris Jordan played a great knock at the end with the bat.""

Welsh ports had 30% less traffic 'due to Brexit',"Holyhead and Fishguard ports saw a 30% drop in traffic in 2021, according to its operator Stena Line. Ian Davies, boss of Stena's UK ports, said it was down to the new post-Brexit trading relationship with the European Union rather than the pandemic. But he added the company had a ""long-term"" commitment to its Welsh ports and expected things to improve. The UK government said it had made ""extensive preparations"" and continued to work to mitigate disruption. UK-Ireland lorry traffic at Welsh port slumps Stena Line 'committed to Wales' despite traffic drop Welsh ports increasingly bypassed by Irish ferries After years of negotiations,the UK completed its formal separation from the EU on 1 January 2021. Speaking to the BBC Politics Wales programme,Mr Davies said the start of the new UK-EU trading relationship hit its Welsh ports ""quite hard"". ""In January, we saw a big drop off ranging from 50-60% of our freight volumes,"" he said. ""As people really kind of got used to the new regimes and the new documentation that was required, I would say it caught quite a few, not so much in the haulage industry but their customers, unaware. ""But then things gradually improved, but we seem to have plateaued; currently, we're probably in the region of 30% down on our [pre-pandemic] 2019 volume."" Ian Davies says the drop in traffic at Welsh ports in 2021 was because of the UK's new relationship with the EU, not the pandemic Asked if it was possible to decouple the pandemic hit from a change in post-Brexit trading patterns, Mr Davies said: ""I think now we're probably in a position to say yes, this is really the effect post-Brexit of where we are and slight changes in the way that people are moving freight. ""If we look at the Irish Sea in its entirety, the freight volumes are roughly the same. ""What has been adversely affected is really the Welsh ports and the Welsh routes so far."" But he was optimistic about the future, saying he thought ""things will improve"". In October, Ireland's foreign affairs minister said there had beena big increase in ferry routes avoiding Welsh portsby directly linking Ireland to mainland Europe - up from ""less than a dozen"" to 44 direct routes. Simon Coveney told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme at the time the use of a so-called land-bridge from Holyhead to Dover had been a vital part of supply chains in and out of Ireland. Land-bridge movements refer to lorries from Ireland crossing Wales and England en route to other EU countries. Direct sea routes from Ireland to France are slower and more expensive than crossing the Irish Sea and driving south through Wales and England to cross the Channel between Dover and Calais. But sailing directly avoids the new post-Brexit checks and paperwork. Dublin Port's boss said this week Brexit spelled the end of the British land-bridge transit route. Mr Davies said: ""If you look at the numbers you see, statistically, percentage wise, there is a huge increase. ""But you have to remember the market is very small before. The biggest trading partner is still the UK."" Wales currently has three ports that have direct routes to Ireland - Holyhead and Fishguard, which are run by Stena Line, and Pembroke. Asked if he believed those three could be sustained, Mr Davies said Stena Line was ""a long-term player"". ""Business goes through cycles. We saw it in 2007 and 2008 when the Celtic Tiger [Ireland] crashed,"" he said. ""We never thought we would see recovery. It took three or four years. We got there. We see this as another business cycle."" Not all the required checks on EU imports to the UK have been introduced with many more scheduled during 2022. Holyhead is the UK's second busiest port Checks on some animal and plant-based goods are set to be undertaken in so-called Border Control Posts (BCP) from 1 July 2022. The Welsh government has plans to build one BCP outside Holyhead and one in south Wales to service both Fishguard and Pembroke ports. But neither will be ready on 1 July, leading Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething to announce that the Welsh government is ""exploring interim arrangements at Welsh ferry ports to bridge the gap"". The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, accused the UK government of doing ""half a job"" of the Brexit deal. ""Whether it's the unacceptable levels of new red tape for our hauliers and small businesses, the lack of an adequate veterinary agreement for our farmers, or the impact of lost development funds on our most deprived regions, the Conservatives are failing to even attempt to address the problems they have caused on multiple fronts,"" she added. A UK government spokesperson said: ""We have made extensive preparations and continue to work closely with port authorities, devolved administrations and other partners to deliver the systems and infrastructure needed on time."" Asked about the delay, Mr Davies said: ""They have interim measures that they are putting in place so they meet their criteria, so that doesn't really affect us but what we would like is clarity going forward. ""But, we also know the UK government are talking about in 2025 a digital border. ""So, the question is why are we going through all this investment in physical infrastructure when in 2025 we have a digital border potentially coming?""

Investor targets bosses at firms failing on climate,"Aviva Investors will seek to remove board directors of firms that continue to take part in deforestation A major UK investment fund has said it will vote to try to get directors kicked out of firms that fail to make good on environmental pledges. Aviva Investors also wants bosses' pay to be linked to sustainability goals. It is the latest big investment firm to ramp up the pressure on corporations in a bid to make them clean up their acts. BlackRock, the world's largest fund, has told the firms it invests in to step up on sustainability or face the consequences. Aviva Investors, which has Â£262bn of assets under management, set out its expectations in a letter that will be sent to 1,500 firms in 30 countries this week. The fund said it had broadened its definition of sustainability and would now focus on issues such as biodiversity and human rights, alongside existing priorities like climate change and executive pay. ""We will hold boards and individual directors accountable where the pace of change does not reflect the urgency required,"" said the annual letter from Aviva Investors boss Mark Versey. UK firms will have to disclose climate impact Easy ways to make your savings fight climate change Mr Versey said there had been an ""alarming"" 68% decrease in animal and plant species between 1970 and 2016. ""This is of serious concern as ecosystem services provided by the natural world underpin our economies and societies and will increasingly become an important driver of company valuations,"" Mr Versey said, adding that more than half of the world's economic output is ""reliant on biodiversity"". On human rights, Aviva expects companies it backs to scrutinise the impact they have when doing business, and to take action to stop harm. Firms will need to give more detailed explanations of how they intend to meet environmental goals, it added. Mirza Baig, Aviva Investors' head of environmental, social and corporate governance, told the BBC that some companies intentionally set vague targets to avoid being held to account. He said Aviva would increasingly use its vote as a shareholder to try to oust directors at firms that had a ""high impact"" on the planet but did little to rectify this. The fund may also vote against executive pay deals if a firm is falling short, and as a last resort could withdraw its investment. Last year 280 firms changed their practices after pressure from Aviva Investors, Mr Baig said. However, he urged more big investment firms to use their ""loud"" and ""influential"" voices to drive change. ""If there was enough pressure being put on businesses then the world would look very different,"" he said. Big investment funds are increasingly leaning on firms to make them change the way they do business. Last week Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world's biggest investment fund, denied that the firm was being ""woke"" in calling for stronger climate policies from companies. Instead, he said the move made good business sense at a time when the public increasingly expects companies to behave ethically. He insisted his firm was being capitalist,externalin its outlook, adding: ""Make no mistake, the fair pursuit of profit is still what animates markets; and long-term profitability is the measure by which markets will ultimately determine your company's success.""

You can read Michael Emons' report on Chelsea's win over Tottenham here. And don't forget to tune into Match of the Day 2 at 22:30 GMT tonight to see all of the weekend's Premier League goals. Until next time... FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Tottenham Hotspur Spurs boss Antonio Conte speaking to Match of the Day:""My feeling is always the same of the last games, I was very clear in this moment the gap is very large between us and Chelsea. I said this before and when you lose three games in 10 days it means your opponent is better than you in very aspect. ""I am proud of my players because we made a good effort, sometimes that is not enough to give 100%. When you play against a team like this it is not simple. ""There is many points we have to try and work on, not only on the pitch, you have to improve in all aspects if you want to try and in two or three years to become competitive, but for sure we are working very hard on the pitch and you can see our work. ""For Chelsea it was a tough game, we have to continue this way. We have to work very hard to improve the sitution. It depends the final result what you want. ""We are in a good position in the table and hope to stay until the end."" On the January window:""I don't consider the transfer market something so important, it could be an opportunity if you see you need reinforcements, but I spoke with the club and said my vision. ""If there are opportunities you can improve the situation but you need to repeat for many years to build something important, to be more competitive and try to fight and not lose three games in 10 days."" FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel to BBC Sport:""A huge effort, the outlook of some free days and it being a London derby helped too. When we arrived this morning I could feel everyone was excited to play it. It was physically tough, so full credit I think we deserved it. ""Very important for morale - we go into a mini break, it changes everything, the mood, the belief. We played the game we deserved. A lot of good stuff, we were patient and kept on believing and attacking in the second half. ""Now we try to breathe a little bit. ""The message at half-time was keep on pushing, keep on investing, put in the same effort. Not a lot of information, encouragement to keep on going. On Hakim Ziyech:""Maybe it was his best game, it was a very good game overall. He took the risk where it was ppssible, he was safe when it was possible to be safe. It's probably the best position for him, we don't normally have this position, but the overlap gave him the space and the strike was brilliant."" FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea Hakim Ziyech to Match of the Day:""I wanted it in the top corner but it always the question if it goes in! The feeling of the game is amazing for us. ""I enjoyed it, it was a good game from us, created a lot of chances, playing good football and putting everyone in their strengths. ""You always want to have a good game, especially now when we have some days off. It is always good to have a win before that."" FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Tottenham Hotspur Spurs manager Antonio Conte on Sky Sports:""I don't like to lose and defeat is always difficult for me, but I think to have a nine games in a row without defeat was important. ""In this moment, the gap with other teams like Chelsea is really an important gap and the team and the squad, the game was... I am proud for the effort. We tried to do everything but sometimes it is not enough, especially against a team like this. ""Now there is a big difference between us and the top teams."" On Harry Kane's disallowed goal:""It is very difficult to comment and I don't want to comment on the referee's decision. But to disallow this goal in England, was incredible for me. Maybe I am more upset for the yellow card for Tanganga because I think this was clinical."" On transfers coming in:""This is not the right moment to speak, the club know very well what I think. There is not one transfer market to close the gap. The last few years this gap became very big and now it is not simple to find a solution in a short time. ""I am only focused to work until the end, we have four months to try and give everything, but if we think we solve with the transfer market the situation, it is not the reality. You need many years, but for sure we have to start. ""You have to sell or loan players and it is difficult and then you have to find the right players for you. You can only start this process but you need many years. It won't be easy, I spoke with the club and am totally in this position of the club to work and improve the situation on the pitch. ""I am enjoying my time in Tottenham, we have four months to work and get the best possible result. I am proud of the effort. Sometimes you can push 100% but it is not enough."" On Dele Alli:""I don't want to comment on single players. There is the club to make the best decision. There is a sporting director and chairman and they take the last decision."" FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Tottenham Hotspur Spurs midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg on Sky Sports:""Disappointing, I thought at half-time we felt under presure but felt there was something to be taken and then two goals pretty quickly. ""When we got through the quality on the pass was not as we would like to. We tried to stop them, tried to find different ways of stopping their quality players come in dangerous positions but Chelsea are a very versatile team. ""I feel a bit disappointed with the goal we got disallowed. I thought that was the moment maybe if we wanted something today. ""We are not where we want to be yet but we are working well."" FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount to Sky Sports:""That's us, the way we play. You could see straght from the beginning the desire to win the ball back higher. That was definitely us today. ""Over the last couple of weeks we haven't had the results we wanted and you start looking around you and teams are creeping up. To win this game was massive for us. Chelsea goalscorer Hakim Ziyech:""The game agaisnt Brighton (when he did not celebrate a goal) we didn't play well so there was  frustration. But today we played well, they had some counter attacks but it wasn't dangerous at all. ""How good was the goal? I think it was 10 out of 10. I thought maybe i hit it a lttle bit hard and in the end I saw it go in."" FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Thiago Silva, at 37 years and 123 days, became the oldest player to score in the Premier League since February 2013, when 39-year-old Ryan Giggs netted against Queens Park Rangers for Manchester United. FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea Thomas Tuchel speaking to Sky Sports:""We were working extremely hard for it and it was a tough match. The effort was outstanding and it was a deserved win. It is so hard to create chances against them but we were relentless and kept on believing. ""Keep on going, there was no need for changes, some details of when to take the risk and when not. Encouragement to keep on going."" On Harry Kane's disallowed goal: ""I didn't see it. Live I thought it was a goal and was surprised."" On Hakim Ziyech's goal: ""I was right behind! I had the feeling it was a bit too high but it dropped at the right second. It was a brilliant goal. His technique was brilliant. ""The table is the table, it is our responsibility to prove ourselves every third day and now we have a break and it was important to go into this break with a performance we want. We needed this but needed also to do things better. The guys are very tired because it was a long run for us."" On his first year in charge: ""A good year, a nice year. I feel very good because it feels still like the first day, nothing has changed, it is exactly the right place to be. I feel an enormous amount of support - hopefully many more years to come."" FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Tottenham have failed to score in each of their last six meetings with Chelsea in all competitions, with their goalless run against the Blues currently standing at 547 minutes since Erik Lamelaâs strike in September 2020. This is the first time in their history theyâve failed to score in six consecutive matches against an opponent. Spurs have won just one of their last 32 away league games against Chelsea (D10 L21), winning 3-1 in April 2018 with current boss Antonio Conte in charge of the Blues that day. Chelsea have earned 501 points from their 272 Premier League London derby matches, making them the first side to reach 500 points in such fixtures in the history of the competition. No manager to have previously taken charge of Chelsea in the Premier League has won against the Blues at Stamford Bridge in the competition (D7 L14), with Spurs boss Antonio Conte becoming the eighth different manager to try. FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea have won four games against Tottenham in all competitions this seasonmaking them the first Premier League side to win four games against an opponent in a single campaign since Manchester City against West Ham in 2013-14 and the first to win three games in the same month against an opponent since Aston Villa against Blackburn in January 2010.  FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham It's also a first Premier League defeat for Antonio Conte as Spurs boss in his 10th game in charge in the competition. FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Matthew UpsonFormer England and Arsenal defender on BBC Radio 5 Live The disallowed goal aside, in the opening 10 minutes of the second half Chelsea came out in a far better mindset. They were aggressive, decisive and caught Spurs a little bit cold. The first goal from Hakin Ziyech was special and that sparked the display from Chelsea. Overall Thomas Tuchel's side thoroughly deserve the victory and in this fixture they've really got Spurs' number and shown they're capable of being quite comfortable in victory. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham That's it! A controlled and comfortable victory for Chelsea, who beat Spurs for the fourth time this season. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Antonio Rudiger goes bustling forward again, rolling the ball under his studs, but then fouls Ben Davies. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Matthew UpsonFormer England and Arsenal defender on BBC Radio 5 Live Hakim Ziyech deserves the standing ovation he's getting and not just for his goal, it's about his overall contribution today. He's been key to Chelsea today, he's made clever runs, done really well coming inside on his left foot and some of his deliveries into the box have been brilliant. He's had a really strong game. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham All pretty blunt from Tottenham, who are throwing the ball forward in hope but watching it being mopped up easily by Chelsea. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Saul replaces Hakim Ziyech, who can have a sit down and think about that gorgeous goal. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Into stoppage time. Spurs scored twice after this against Leicester. You would say that is extremely unlikely today. Â© 2025 BBC.

UK-Ireland lorry traffic at Welsh port slumps,"Hauliers have needed new paperwork from 1 January Lorry traffic through Holyhead, the UK's second largest port, has fallen to about one-third of its usual capacity, port operator Stena has said. The company has also doubled its ferry service between France and Ireland, with more lorries travelling directly to mainland Europe. Since 1 January, drivers have had to provide specific paperwork to take goods between the EU and the UK. Ian Davies of Stena said he was confident traffic would pick up again. Meanwhile, the boss of one of Wales' largest hauliers, Gwynedd Shipping, said the system for lorries taking goods between the UK and Ireland is not working at the moment. The paperwork arrangements have come about as part of the new trading relationship with the European Union following Brexit. Drivers also have to provide a negative Covid test when travelling between France and the UK. For decades, trucks from mainland Europe heading for Ireland have used the UK as a ""land bridge"", often picking up loads on the way back. Brexit traffic measures introduced at port A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal Mr Davies, head of UK ports for Stena, which owns the port on Anglesey, said it was cheaper and quicker for lorry drivers to travel through the UK. But hauliers' concerns about disruption at ports has made many drive to northern France and across the Irish sea to Ireland in the past few days. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. In response, Stena has started running a second ship between Rosslare and Cherbourg. Mr Davies said: ""We're operating probably only about 30 to 40% capacity - the two ferry companies are very quiet. ""We have routes that go directly between France and Ireland. It has grown in popularity, we've doubled the capacity available, but it's really an uncertain market."" Mr Davies cited stockpiling ahead of 31 December - and the uncertainty before the end of 2020 as to whether there would be a trade deal with the EU - as some of the reasons why Holyhead was so quiet. There werelong queues on the road leading into the portin the run-up to Christmas. ""We had a huge boom prior to Christmas - we had a seven or eight-week period where Holyhead was taking about twelve and a half thousand freight units a week, which normally is 9,000,"" he added. Holyhead is the UK's second busiest port But the Stena official is confident about Holyhead's long-term prospects. Mr Davies expects more goods to start moving through the port again in the longer term, saying the route fits well with just-in-time supply chains. ""The advantages of a land bridge are huge,"" he said. ""There's a lot of uncertainty over Dover-Calais over the Covid testing, and over the administration there, but once people get used to that then we expect to see normal levels return. ""The market always takes time to adjust. People take time to adjust."" Andrew Kinsella, managing director of Gwynedd Shipping, said his company has a backlog of 60 lorries in depots waiting ready to be shipped to Dublin. ""Whilst you don't see queues at ports and terminals the reality is that these queues are developing elsewhere in our depot in Holyhead, in our depot in Deeside and in our depot in Newport in south Wales, and lots of hauliers have depots in the proximity of ports,"" he said. Many drivers are choosing to use routes between Ireland and mainland Europe Mr Kinsella said many hauliers are finding that their customers are not able to generate the special declarations needed to enable a lorry to get onto a ferry. ""I'm saying the system doesn't currently work. We move product, we move a lot of food ingredients, we move a lot of finished food products, snacks, bottled water."" He explains how complicated the new system is, with ""a lot of issues about demarcation about who is going to arrange the export declaration with the UK revenue authorities, who's going to arrange the import declaration, the hauliers then trying to arrange the import safety and security declaration to create an ENS number, which helps you generate a PBN number, so there has been a lot of everyone finding their feet"". People are very patient, he said, but ""the reality is when you start to see empty shelves in supermarkets and when it starts to create supply issues in terms of product coming back from Ireland into the UK, and we move a lot of car parts, a lot of packaging for medical products, metals, timber, there's lots of things at play at the minute"". Industry group Logistics UK said there had been big changes for the industry. Its policy manager for Wales, Chris Yarsely, is expecting delays as traffic returns to normal levels ""unless businesses ensure they are prepared for the new trading conditions"". ""It is virtually impossible to second guess trade patterns in the long term,"" he said. However, he said that on the whole ""traffic is moving relatively smoothly"". ""For many businesses, this is the first time that they have had to use this sort of paperwork for more than 40 years. ""But to keep trade as frictionless as possible, it is imperative that the declarations are correct before vehicles head to the port.""

Stena Line 'committed to Wales' despite traffic drop,"Stena Line is among firms that have made changes to their routes because of Brexit Stena Line has said it remains committed to its ports and ferry routes serving Wales despite a drop in traffic due to Brexit and Covid-19. Since 1 January, drivers have had to provide specific paperwork to take goods between the EU and the UK. The number of lorries using ferries between Holyhead and Dublin, and Fishguard and Rosslare, has dropped by 50% since the start of 2021. Stena Line said it was a ""blip"" and it would work hard to protect the routes. The Welsh Government and a number of MPs haveexpressed concern at the drop in traffic through Welsh ferry ports as hauliers avoid queues. Stena Line, which owns Holyhead Port, said traffic between Britain and Northern Ireland had already returned to normal levels and freight volumes between Ireland and France had risen considerably. Ian Hampton, executive director of Stena Line UK, said the company was also dealing with a fall in passenger numbers due to coronavirus restrictions on both sides of the Irish Sea. He said: ""This is a blip on the horizon in the general life cycle of Stena Line. ""We've been in existence for a long, long time. We have the financial resources to weather the storm. ""We know that the business model in the Irish Sea is a strong model and it is one that we will work hard to protect."" Mr Hampton added: ""We're a hundred percent committed to our operation in the Irish Sea, to our Stena Line vessels and also to the ports that we own."" Holyhead is the UK's second busiest roll-on roll-off ferry port Mr Hampton said that if it got to summer 2021 and freight traffic at the ports had not increased he would be ""concerned"". ""That is something we will monitor carefully, but with the Covid lockdown as well, it's a very hard point to put your finger on,"" he said. UK-Ireland lorry traffic at Holyhead port slumps Brexit traffic measures introduced at port For decades, trucks from mainland Europe heading for Ireland have used the UK as a ""land bridge"", often picking up loads on the way back. Holyhead, Fishguard and Pembroke Dock have all benefited from this traffic. But there are concerns disruption at ports has made many hauliers drive to northern France and across the Irish Sea to Ireland, bypassing the Welsh ports. By using the longer and more expensive sea route, lorries remain in the EU and do not have to go through customs. Demand is so high ferry companies have increased sailings and routes, including Stena Line - 18 months ago there were three sailings a week between Rosslare and France and Spain, now there are 15. Many drivers are choosing to use routes between Ireland and mainland Europe Mr Hampton said he doubted the direct crossings between Ireland and France would completely replace traffic through Holyhead and Fishguard, as the routes were longer and more expensive. ""From hauliers' point of view, the drivers are tied up for the best part of 24 hours at sea,"" he said. ""The UK land bridge is cheaper and quicker, and will always have more capacity. Even with extra ships operating between Rosslare and Cherbourg, there's only about 15% of the space there is between Dublin and Holyhead.""

Petition seeks control of Wales' Crown Estate land,"The Crown Estate owns 65% of shoreline and riverbeds in Wales, as well as the surrounding seabed More than 5,500 people have signed a petition seeking devolved control of the Â£603m Crown Estate land in Wales. Rhodri Williams, 37, from Cwmafan, Neath Port Talbot, started the petition to highlight what he called an ""unjust and unfair"" situation. The estate owns holdings in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with most profits going to the UK Treasury. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has said there was no ""public interest or appetite"" for reform. Mr Williams started an online petition after he discovered the Crown Estate in Scotland was devolved, and the Scottish government received its profits directly. Where does the Queen get her money? 'High possibility' of finding gold in Welsh hills ""It just seems totally unjust and unfair that one part of the union is treated differently to the other,"" he said. The petition calls for a similar devolution settlement here. Mr Williams wants the land's profits to be used to create a green energy sector. Rhodri Williams: ""Why are we not having the money?"" ""These are our waters, why are we not having the money?"" he asked. Mr Hart told MPs in the House of Commons earlier this month there was not ""any public interest or appetite"" for altering the status quo. ""Frankly, it is a case of, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it',"" he added. The 262-year-old Crown Estate, which has assets worth more than Â£15bn, is managed by an independent board, with the Queen receiving 25% of its profits. The rest goes to the UK treasury. Itsland in Wales generated Â£8.7m,externalin revenue last year. The Crown Estate controls more than 50,000 acres of land and the seabed out to 12 nautical miles 65% of shoreline and riverbeds The seabed out to 12 nautical miles More than 50,000 acres (20,230 hectares) of land 250,000 acres (101170 hectares) of mineral deposits Rights to gold and silver - the ""mines Royal"" In Scotland, the estate was devolved in the wake of the2014 independence referendum. This week, Crown Estate Scotland announced it had raisedÂ£700m by leasing offshore wind farms. Stirling University economy Prof David Bell said control of the land was not a ""game-changer"", but a ""useful add-on"". When asked if similar benefits could occur in Wales, he said it would be a ""win-win"" if the land was ""well-managed and with a view to economic and community benefits"". The Welsh Conservatives are opposed to devolution of the Crown Estate. Its environment spokeswoman Janet Finch-Saunders MS said it had ""served us well over the years"", adding: ""If it's not broken, why on earth would we want to support the further devolution of powers?"" The Welsh government said ""devolving control over the Crown Estate would give us greater flexibility to choose how far and fast we deploy renewables in Wales"". ""We have outstanding natural resources to generate renewable energy,"" a spokesperson said. ""We want to be able to use those to benefit people in Wales by investing in communities and green, skilled jobs."" Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake said the Crown Estate should be devolved like in Scotland, where it is used for the ""benefit of the public and public purse"". ""If the Crown Estate was devolved to Wales I think we could consider using and developing the amazing natural resources we have here much quicker than the current system allows,"" he said.

Four things that are going up in price and why,"Lamb lovers will have seen prices rise Everyone is braced for financial pain as the cost of living rises this year, particularly with energy bills likely to soar from April. But it is not just gas that is pushing up prices at theirfastest rate for nearly 30 years. Here are some of the less obvious items which have recorded rapid price rises, and some of the reasons behind the increases. Those families who still sit down to eat a traditional roast dinner together are having to be a little more imaginative if they are trying to keep the costs down. Prices of fresh beef rose by 8.6% from a year earlier, information from data firm Kantar shows. Fresh lamb prices were up even more steeply, rising by 10% to around Â£11 per kilogramme. Potatoes - another Sunday lunch staple - were also highlighted as a factor in pushing up December'sofficial inflation rate,external(which measures the rising cost of living), by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In fact, food prices in general were key to the rate rising to a level not seen for three decades. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, says that a lid had been kept on grocery prices for some time, especially at Christmas, but it is ""inevitable"" that increases are to come. Supermarkets are facing cost pressures of their own from logistics, manufacturing, farming and distribution. Problems such as driver shortages and rising energy prices will add to those pressures. ""Retailers will be having robust discussions with suppliers, but delayed costs have to flow through and be reflected in what consumers pay,"" he says. He points out that when shoppers are faced with grocery price rises of more than 3% or 4% a year, they tend to make bigger decisions, such as cutting back, seeking out promotions, or buying cheaper own-label products. The trouble is, he says, there are price rises ""in nearly every category across the supermarket shelves"" and the price gap between discount brands and others is narrower than was once the case. Richard Walker, boss of supermarket chain Iceland, says he has been seeing an ""alarming"" rise in the use of food banks. Open the bathroom cabinet and the moisturisers and cleansers you see inside may well have got more expensive recently. Prices of skincare products typically rose by 9.6% in the 12 weeks to Boxing Day compared with the same period a year earlier, data from the same Kantar survey shows. Prestige brands, in particular, went up in price even though demand fell, according to analysts. Perhaps people were a little less hung up on their Zoom face. Skincare tells a story typical of the general cost of living squeeze at the moment, in that no one single factor is causing prices to rise. Emma Fishwick says consumers are choosing cheaper brands ""The cost of shipping, packaging and raw materials are on the rise and thereby brands have little choice but to increase the price of their products to ensure that their business is sustainable,"" says Emma Fishwick, from analysts NPD. She said masks, body creams and eye treatments had recorded some of the biggest price rises towards the end of the year. Customer behaviour has been changing as a result, she says. Shoppers are increasingly choosing mid-range brands, which can be 60% cheaper than the upmarket options. ""Whilst consumers feel the squeeze, as the cost of living increases, consumers are increasingly turning to these brands as a cheaper alternative,"" she says. INFLATION:Why prices are rising so quickly PETROL:Are we paying too much at the pump? GAS PRICES:How can I protect myself from rising prices? IMPACT:'I'm so cold it feels like I'm sleeping outside' In the official figures, sofas and the like come under quite a broad category of ""furniture and household goods"". The ONS points out prices in the sector have been rising steadily since the start of 2021. That includes furniture, household appliances - including the cost of fitting them, and even garden equipment. Prices of furniture have been highlighted in official statistics The 7.4% inflation rate of this category in December was the highest since comparable data began in 1989, according to ONS calculations. Furniture prices are rising for many of the same reasons as skincare products and food. The cost of raw materials - such as wood in this case - as well as transporting them has gone up. A settee may be considered a luxury item, and one only bought new after saving up the money. A fridge, on the other hand, is a necessity for every family. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising. If the price of a bottle of milk is Â£1 and it rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. You may not notice price rises from month to month. But right now, prices are rising so quickly that the money people earn does not go as far. Why are prices rising so quickly? Seven reasons living costs are rising around the world Statisticians at the ONS featured the effect of second-hand car prices on the inflation rate as a whole, and not for the first time. They say used-car prices grew by 28% during 2021, compared with a 7.3% increase the previous year. Issues in the new and used car market are pushing up prices The cost of manufacturing new cars has risen and has been made difficult by a global shortage of computer chips, as well as other materials such as copper, aluminium and cobalt. As a result fewer new vehicles have been rolling off production lines. That has meant more buyers turning to the used-car market, which has pushed up prices. Added to that, the ONS says there are concerns in the trade about fewer second-hand cars being made available owing to a dearth of one-year-old cars to sell on. Delays in new car supplies have meant extensions of lease contracts and fewer part exchanges, again affecting used car availability.

Industrial estates - the new spots to socialise?,"Restaurants, cafes and even bars can be now be found in spaces traditionally linked to industry When the UK's first industrial estates appeared in the 1930s they were built simply to boost Britain's productivity. But more than 80 years later, the industrial space is vastly changed. Among traditional hauliers, distributors and manufacturers is a growing number of firms from sectors more synonymous with the high street. Cafes, gyms, artisan restaurants and Instagrammable experiences, like axe throwing, have moved into cavernous lock-ups. Wales' first industrial estate - seen here from the sky in 1952 - was in Treforest Commercial property agent and former CBI Wales chairman Chris Sutton has seen the change at first hand. He said: ""Twenty or 30 years ago, industrial estates were just that. They were industrial in nature, but now we see them as a business location. ""Just in the past two years, we've seen lettings to pottery workshops, a bakery, gin distillery, gyms, craft breweries, climbing walls, funeral services, vets nutrition, a recording studio."" Chris Sutton says industrial estates became an opportunity to rejuvenate the economy There are thousands of industrial and trading estates across the UK, with many clusters of them in Wales. The idea of the industrial estate was born out of a desire to supercharge the UK's industrial production. That was certainly the idea at Wales' first trading estate in Treforest. New meat tray 'could save tonnes of waste' Freeports could drive trade away from Wales, Welsh ministers claim Pontypridd market street food Michelin-star chefs for food gong Off the back of Wales decline in heavy industry, it became, according to Mr Sutton, ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" to rejuvenate. Industrial estates, such as that in Treforest, were created to boost Britain's industrial productivity ""So what we've seen is that industrial accommodation provides a good location for businesses of a wide range. It's not just straightforward, sort of widget manufacturing,"" he said. Cardiff's Boneyard has transformed one corner of industrial space into a thriving creative community. Everything from pizza restaurant to psychotherapists now work from the huddle of converted containers. The Bone Yard in Cardiff is made up of repurposed shipping containers Shoppers have been drawn to industrial spaces by a new kind of retail experience Hospitality businesses are becoming a draw for diners on trading estates and business parks And it's this kind of re-use, and repurposing of industrial space that retail management expert Laura James from University of Wales Trinity St David believes is driven by a change in consumer attitude. ""The first thing to say is that consumers know that there's a need, perhaps, to travel to different destinations in order to kind of fulfil that experience that they're looking for,"" she said. ""It definitely is a different dynamic, isn't it."" Experts believe changes in consumer attitudes are driving the success of repurposed industrial spaces Many independent food outlets have flourished in their new locations ""I think it is interesting to think that we are now looking at going to these industrial sites with a completely different environment. ""One that perhaps we wouldn't have thought of before, but what a fantastic way to try and revive shopping and revive retail and revive socialising."" Who Cult first came to Bridgend Industrial Estate to base their fledgling clothing brand start-up. But it soon found a new market was ready to be serviced. That of destination dining. Or in their case, coffee and donuts. WhoCult found consumer demand was much higher than initially expected The willingness of customers to travel has underpinned the success of many businesses The coffee shop was only meant as an add-on to customers buying clothes. But demand soared. Owner Scott McGill took advantage and opened a purpose built cafÃ© out of town. It has gone from strength to strength, with customers queuing through the carpark during lockdown. Scott McGill's cafe business grew faster than he expected They're now planning a second shop in a similar space. Last year, estate agent Knight Frank said demand for industrial space had ""soared"" in Wales. It said it had hit record levels across the UK during the first half of the year among units larger than 50,000 square feet. Demand for industrial space has soared across the UK The firm said this was largely driven by retailers and distributors expanding their online and home delivery capacity in response to growing e-commerce during the pandemic. There are planning controls which can limit retail and service activity on industrial estates and business parks. But the growth in demand for units on these estates has given rise to a secondary service industry around it. Gym manager James Gill says businesses like his can capitalise on this. The modern day industrial estate looks very different to its originally intended use ""We'll have people come in here and do work from their offices and sit in our caff for hours,"" he says. ""A lot of the guys live away, they live in England, and they'll come here for work, and when they're up here they'll train here all the time.""
