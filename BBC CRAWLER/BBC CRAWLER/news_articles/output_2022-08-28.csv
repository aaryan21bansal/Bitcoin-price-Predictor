Pakistan flood victims throw note pleading for help,"People in the Manoor valley struggle with communications with the outside world Hundreds of people are stranded across the river in the Manoor valley of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province after a flash flood hit the region on Friday, destroying at least 10 bridges and dozens of buildings. ""We need supplies, we need medicine and please rebuild the bridge, we are left with nothing now."" Those are the contents of a handwritten note villagers throw to our team when we visit. The Manoor valley is located in the mountains of Kaghan - a famous tourist destination in Pakistan. The valley has been hit by a torrential flood that killed at least 15 people, including women and children. Flash floods swept away the only concrete bridge connecting the scenic valley to the main city. Since then, all the villages on the other side of the river have been cut off and residents are waiting for help. The BBC team reached the valley after a dangerous one-hour drive along a road that was damaged at many points by the flooding and landslides. In Manoor, two bridges have completely collapsed and a temporary wooden crossing has been erected. Here, we meet a woman sitting with her belongings. She tells the BBC she can see her home but is unable to reach it. ""My home and my children are on the other side of the river. I've been waiting here for two days now thinking the government might come and repair the bridge. But authorities are telling us that we should start walking around the other side of the mountain to reach our homes. But that's a hike of eight to 10 hours. I am an old woman. How can I walk this much?"" She waits for a few more minutes and leaves when the rain starts again and water flowing underneath the temporary wooden bridge begins to swell up. We see men, women and children sitting outside their mud houses on the other side of the river. They wave at us thinking we are government officials. It is then that some of them throw us a piece of paper, packing it into a plastic bag filled with stones in order to throw it to the side of the river where we are filming. This is the only way they can communicate with the other part of the village these days. Mobile networks do not operate here. The handwritten letter carries information about the losses they are coping with and also requests supplies and medicine for the stranded villagers. ""Many people are sick and can't leave the village on foot. Kindly get the bridge built, it's the main connection with the city,"" the letter says. ""We need supplies. We need a road,"" Abdul Rasheed, 60, tells us while speaking of his ordeal. He has lost his wagon to the flood - his only means of earning money to feed his family. ""There are many other people who have lost their property and means of income,"" he says. ""They need help. They need food. There was a small market here which was swept away. Shops had all the food and supplies. ""My home is on the other side and now I'll have to walk for eight hours to reach my home. How can I do that in such an old age?"" he asks. Many shops and hotels have been destroyed here. Soheil and his brother have lost their mobile phone repair shop to the flood. He tells the BBC he has three families to feed and is uncertain about his future now. ""I don't know what to do. No one has come here to help us as we deserve. Every shopkeeper here is worried. They are all poor people who have big families to feed,"" he says. The inside of a restaurant damaged by the floods ""These authorities and politicians come here for photo sessions and fun. They come, take photos and leave. No one is helping us."" But the deputy commissioner of the district tells the BBC a comprehensive rescue and relief operation was carried out immediately in the area and all the hotels have been evacuated. He adds that an assessment has already been made about property damages. ""We have completed the assessment and flood victims will be compensated soon,"" he states. ""Work has already started regarding reconstruction of the bridge, but it will take some time."" In Pictures: Floods and fear in Pakistan While the government blames climate change for the flooding, communities are criticising government and local authorities for allowing builders to construct hotels on the banks of the river. ""These hotels and markets blocked the natural waterways, and so we are witnessing much bigger losses due to the floods which could have been avoided easily,"" says another resident in the main market of Kaghan. Many hotels are built on the banks of the River Kunhar in Kaghan and the adjacent valleys. Floods have destroyed some of them, along with a police station and a religious school. A woman stands outside her house in Charsadda district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province A few hundred metres from the police station, a family sits in a temporary tent right on the river's bank. They say eight members of their family were washed away by the same flood. Heavy rains and floods are wreaking havoc across Pakistan. More than 1,000 people have been killed while millions have been displaced. Officials say at least 700,000 homes have been destroyed. With millions waiting for food, drinking water and shelter, rescue teams are struggling to reach these cut-off communities. Provinces like Sindh and Balochistan are the worst affected but mountainous regions in Khyber Pakhtunkha are also badly hit. Pakistani troops have also been called in to assist aid agencies in reaching the flood-affected areas as road links have been damaged and the only way to reach most communities is with helicopters. Pakistan's government is also appealing to friendly countries, donors and international financial institutions to assist them in coping with the calamity.

'I lost everything',"Pakistan is reeling from some of the worst flooding in years As 22-year-old Muhammad Aslam combs through the ruins of his home, he finds rubble where there were once walls, and piles of straw he's used as a thatch roof for his mud home. His village Sadori - in the Pakistani province of Balochistan - was devastated by flash floods that began in June and have since killed more than 500 people. Close to 50,000 houses have been either been damaged or flattened so far, displacing thousands of people. Mr Aslam and a few others have returned to their village see if they can rebuild their life here. But it's a grim sight that greets them. Nothing can be saved  - even their farm land has been turned into a muddy swamp. ""I lost everything,"" he says. The monsoons first hit Pakistan in the middle of June. The country's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said they brought 133% more rainfall than the annual average, which has not happened in years. The downpour triggered floods which wreaked havoc across provinces, swallowing up entire villages, roads and bridges. For days, people were trapped, landlocked with little help, local media reported. In Sadori, the clouds are still grey and heavy. Anxiety hangs thick in the air. Mr Aslam tells us he is worried about more rains in the coming weeks and has moved his family to a temporary shelter on higher ground. Floods: Research shows millions more at risk of flooding Extreme weather: What is it and how is it connected to climate change? Authorities set up the tented accommodation as part of relief efforts. In Balochistan province alone, more than 18,000 homes have either been partially or completely destroyed. People in Sadori say they do not know how much time they have until the next disaster. Their fears are not without merit. Pakistan's meteorological department (PMD) has warned of a new monsoon spell, expected to brings strong winds and heavy rains to some parts of the country. This comes just as water levels were beginning to subside, and the water level in many rivers was starting to go back to normal. And the floods have already severely hit livelihoods in a country where half the population still depends on agriculture - either selling livestock or farming. Muhammad Saleh's home was swept away by the floods Muhammad Saleh is a cotton and wheat farmer. He told us that in a matter of days he lost a year's worth of harvest to the deluge. Under the gloomy skies, he and his brother pull out bags of wheat buried by mounds of dirt. As he tears open the bags to inspect his prized grain, his face drops. ""It's all been damaged, all of it,"" he says. ""This wheat stock was over 350kg, which was enough for almost eight months of food for our entire family. Now there's nothing left for us."" The 40-year-old father of two lived on a compound with his brother and other family members - 27 in total. The rest of his family have moved to a temporary shelter until it's safe to return home. Locals told the BBC that the shelters often run out of food, and the rations are meagre. Local government agencies have opened camps in flood-hit regions with the help of relief organisations, and are working to help relocate families. Authorities have admitted that relief efforts have been slow, but they say it's not a matter of will but of resources. Mr Saleh said he is looking for temporary work as a labourer but with most farm land in the area destroyed, work is difficult to come by. ""Winter is coming and we don't have anything - not even bedding. I do not know how will we live or keep the children warm."" In another village in Lasbela district  the community have gathered to pray with a family who've lost three people to the floods. Ahmad lost three people in his family in one night Ahmad, who goes by his first name only, woke up to the news that his son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter had been killed overnight. The night before, he had asked his son and his family to sleep at his house. But his son declined, assuming the flooding was not going to get much worse. ""We found them the next morning -  their bodies were stuck in a tree. It's so painful for me to lose them this way,"" he said, overcome by grief. Pakistan is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change despite contributing less than one percent of global emissions, according to theClimate Change Risk Index 2021 by NGO German Watch,external. Local weather experts have warned there are already signs things are changing for the worse because of the climate crisis. The rains this time devastated not only remote communities, but also flooded cities. In Karachi, the streets remained submerged for days. The floods have shown just how fragile the country's infrastructure is, and how vulnerable people here are to extreme weather. And climate experts believe Pakistan needs to adapt and develop its infrastructure, keeping climate change challenges in mind. That's something that Mr Saleh prays for too. ""We want the government to widen the water channels so that when the rains come and the rivers overflow, our lives will not be in danger,"" he says. ""Thank God we survived, but something needs change.""

Truss 'plans to tackle rising bills with tax cuts',"Liz Truss would prioritise tax cuts over giving direct payments to every household to help cover the cost of rising energy bills, if she were to become prime minister, a source close to her has told the BBC. Reports suggest Ms Truss is considering cutting VAT across the board by 5%. But her Tory leadership rival Rishi Sunak said the government ""must provide some direct support"" to all. All households are due to receive Â£400 off their energy bills this winter. This was part of a package of help announced by Mr Sunak in May when he was still chancellor. On Friday, energy regulator Ofgem hiked the price cap on household bills by 80%, meaning the typical household gas and electricity bill will rise to Â£3,549 a year from October. Both candidates to succeed Boris Johnson have faced repeated questions about what action they would take. Ms Truss has so far only confirmed she will cut National Insurance and green levies on bills. On Sunday night, a member of Ms Truss's campaign team said: ""Liz has been clear we need to lower the burden of taxation and focus on boosting energy supplies and this will be her priority as prime minister. ""She's also been clear further support may be required to help. Her preference is to target this to those most in need, but isn't ruling anything out."" Earlier on Sunday, a source close to her had said she had ""ruled out"" further direct support for everyone to pay energy bills. It comes as newspaper reports suggest she is ""mulling"" cuts to VAT and increasing the amount of money people have to earn before they start paying income tax. A report in the Sunday Telegraph,externalsuggests she is looking at a ""nuclear"" option to cut VAT by 5%, saying it could save the average household Â£1,300 a year. This video can not be played Watch: Martin Lewis says people are staring into a ""pit of financial doom"" over energy costs Mr Sunak's team has dismissed a cut to all VAT as being ""incredibly regressive"", saying it would cost more than Â£30bn. A source on his campaign team added: ""Tory members will not like the sound of Liz Truss boosting welfare - once it goes up, it's hard to take back down. ""It also means the worst off this winter are hardworking families and pensioners on middle incomes, which are Conservative and swing voters. Truss's plan is a gift to Labour."" The former chancellor has said he will cut VAT on energy bills and - writing in the Times on Saturday - said direct government support must be provided to everyone, with a focus on low-income households and pensioners. He has also indicated that, for the most vulnerable household, he would try to make up the difference between the current energy price cap of Â£1,971 a year and the new cap of Â£3,549 by changing things like welfare benefits and pensioners' winter fuel credits. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,,externalBoris Johnson said his successor would deliver a ""huge package"" of support, without saying what that would be. He said the months ahead were going to be ""tough, perhaps very tough"" and energy bills would be ""eye-watering"". In his last week as prime minister, Mr Johnson is expected to give a speech about the future of energy that is likely to serve as a challenge to his successor not to neglect plans to ramp up other energy sources, like offshore wind and nuclear power. Mr Sunak has already indicated his support for boosting insulation and offshore wind. Ms Truss has voiced support for exploring more North Sea oil and gas and fracking, where communities support it. But she has criticised other forms of energy such as solar farms on agricultural land. Middle-earners need help with bills too - Zahawi What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? What can be done to tackle the energy crisis? What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? All households will get the Â£400 rebate on energy bills, with low income and vulnerable households receiving an additional Â£650. Pensioners will also receive Â£300 along with their winter fuel payment in November, and people on an eligible disability benefit will receive an additional Â£150. This video can not be played Worried about energy bills? The BBC's Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four discounts and payments that could help Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government's response to the growing cost-of-living crisis. Labour has said its plan to freeze energy prices this winter - paid in part by a windfall tax on energy companies - would save someone on the minimum wage more than Â£40 a week. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said the energy price cap rise was ""nothing short of a catastrophe for millions"" and SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford warned businesses could ""go to the wall"" over winter. The price cap, set by Ofgem, is rising by 80% in October The price of electricity will rise on average from 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) to 52p and gas will go up from 7p to 15p per kWh A typical annual energy bill paid by direct debit is currently Â£1,971. In October, that will rise to Â£3,549 Prepayment meter customers will pay an extra Â£59 a year from October, taking the new typical bill on a prepayment meter to Â£3,608 TRANSFER TRAGEDY:How did Emiliano Sala end up on that plane?

McIlroy wins record third FedEx Cup and $18m prize,"McIlroy (right) receives the FedEx Cup from PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan Tour Championship - final leaderboard -21R McIlroy (NI);-20S Scheffler (US), SJ Im (Kor);-18X Schauffele (US);-17M Homa (US), J Thomas (US);-16P Cantlay (US), S Straka (Aut) Selected others: -13H Matsuyama (Jpn);-12J Spieth (US);-11J Rahm (Spa), M Fitzpatrick (Eng);-9C Smith (Aus);-8C Morikawa (US) Leaderboard Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy became the first player to win the FedEx Cup three times after a remarkable last day at the PGA Tour's Tour Championship. The 33-year-old overturned Scottie Scheffler's six-shot lead to finish one clear of the American and Sungjae Im. Four-time major winner McIlroy carded a four-under 66 to pip the world number one and the South Korean on 21 under. McIlroy receives $18m (Â£15.36m) in prize money for his win at East Lake, his fifth title of the season. Facing LIV players at BMW PGA Championship will be 'hard to stomach' - McIlroy ""What a week, what a day,"" McIlroy told Sky Sports. ""I feel like Scottie deserves at least half of this. He's a hell of a competitor. It was an honour to battle with him."" Scheffler started the week with a six-shot advantage over McIlroy as players began the season-ending event on staggered scores, determined by their respective positions in the FedEx Cup standings. Aftera suspension of playduring Saturday's third round because of lightning, 26-year-old Scheffler led by just one when play resumed on Sunday morning, but extended his lead to six strokes before the final round began later that day. The pair bogeyed the first hole of their final rounds and an out-of-sorts Scheffler dropped further shots on the fourth and sixth. In contrast, a free-flowing McIlroy responded to his opening bogey by making birdie on the third and picking up three more shots in succession from the fifth. That set the tone for the day and McIlroy led by one by the time they got to the 18th tee as the conclusion to the PGA Tour season came down to its very last hole. Both players hit good drives but McIlroy, having been largely imperious all day, pull-hooked his approach and could only make a par five. Scheffler could not take advantage though, hitting the last of a series of modest bunker shots that meant the Masters champion also only parred the closing hole to sign for a ragged 73. He shared second with rising star Im, 24, who shot 66 and had his own chances to claim the title. McIlroy has now earned a total of $43m from his three FedEx Cup victories ""I didn't really give myself much of a chance teeing off today. I thought six behind was going to be really tough to make up, but my good play and Scottie's not-so-great play meant it was a ball game going into the back nine,"" McIlroy added. McIlroy has been one of the PGA Tour's most influential presences during golf's ongoing power struggle, and was one of the leading voices in ameeting held earlier this monthby the tour's top players to discuss the threat of LIV Golf. Following his triumph, he said: ""I believe in the game of golf, I believe in this tour in particular, I believe in the players on this tour. ""It's the greatest place in the world to play golf, bar none, and I've played all over the world. ""This is an incredibly proud moment for me, but it should also be an incredibly proud moment for the PGA Tour. They have had some hard times this year, but we are getting through it and that was a spectacle out there today. ""Two of the best players in the world going head-to-head for the biggest prize on the PGA Tour, and I hope everyone at home enjoyed that."" McIlroy said the FedEx Cup victory would help ""soften the blow"" after he was edged out at the 150th Open Championship, where he shared the lead after 54 holes but finished third behind Australia's Cameron Smith. ""St Andrews was really hard for me. It was a tough one to get over,"" he said. ""This softens the blow a little bit. It doesn't make it that much easier to get over, but it's great to end the season on a high note like this.""

Unions propose co-ordinated strikes this autumn,"Unite members have been striking at the Port of Felixstowe in a dispute over pay The UK's two largest trade unions, Unite and Unison, are seeking to co-ordinate strike action this autumn as they step up demands for better pay. Both have submitted motions ahead of the Trade Union Congress next month calling for walkouts to be synchronised to have more impact. There has been a rise of strikes this summer, with rail workers, barristers and rubbish collectors walking out. The TUC - which represents 48 unions - will hold its annual conference online. It said it was ready to help members of those unions win pay rises that reflect the cost of living. The seaside town where dockers are striking Thousands of Royal Mail workers go on strike Train drivers at three more operators vote to strike ""This Conservative government is now putting together a co-ordinated plan to stop workers from protecting their pay and conditions - and working people are on the brink,"" spokeswoman said. ""So, if strikes coincide, it reflects this broad attack on working people and their living standards coming from this government. ""The TUC has always helped to co-ordinate strike action when asked by our unions and we are ready to do so again."" As first reported by the Observer,external, co-ordinated action would stop short of a general strike, which some union leaders have called for. Unite's motion urges the TUC,externalto help ""facilitate and encourage industrial coordination"" between unions so that workers can ""most effectively harness their union power to win"". Meanwhile, Unison's motion will call for a special working group to organise co-ordinated action over pay and terms. Unite, which has 1.2 million members, organised the eight-day strike currently under way at the UK's biggest container port, Felixstowe, as well asrecent walkouts on London's bus and Tube network. It represents workers in manufacturing, public services, transport, food, finance and construction. Bus and tube strikes cripple London's transport system Unison, which has 1.3 million members, is taking part in bin strikes currently hitting Scotland and plans walkouts by school and nursery staff as well as exam board workers. Unison and other unions have largely been rebuffed in their demand for pay rises that match the rising cost of living. A spokesman told the BBC: ""Workers don't take the decision to strike lightly, but they feel they have no  other choice to get a decent wage increase. It makes sense for unions to ensure any industrial action is as effective and meaningful as possible."" On Sunday, Unite boss Sharon Graham told the BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme that her organisation would not back down. She said 73,000 of her members had been in dispute in the last year, and 80% of those actions had been successful. ""We've put Â£150m back in members' pockets, and they are ordinary men and women of all different ages. It would be totally wrong for me as the leader of this trade union not to say to employers that you need to pay these workers more."" Liz Truss, who is seen as the most likely candidate to replace Boris Johnson as PM, has promised to crack down on unions if she wins power, by making it harder to organise strikes. But Ms Graham said the ""the mood of country"" had changed and said she expected Ms Truss to ""temper"" her plans if she takes over in September. Ms Graham also criticised Labour for not showing stronger support for the strikes, adding that leader Sir Keir Starmer needed to ""get a spine"". ""Trade unions are emerging as the only people in the corner of workers,"" she said. ""I feel that Parliament has been captured by the business lobby.""

The pair bogeyed the first hole of their final rounds and an out-of-sorts Scheffler dropped further shots on the fourth and sixth. In contrast, a free-flowing McIlroy responded to his opening bogey by making birdie on the third and picking up three more shots in succession from the fifth. That set the tone for the day and McIlroy led by one by the time they got to the 18th tee as the conclusion to the PGA Tour season came down to its very last hole. Both players hit good drives but McIlroy, having been largely imperious all day, pull-hooked his approach and could only make a par five. Scheffler could not take advantage though, hitting the last of a series of modest bunker shots that meant the Masters champion also only parred the closing hole to sign for a ragged 73. He shared second with rising star Im, 24, who shot 66 and had his own chances to claim the title. McIlroy has now earned a total of $43m from his three FedEx Cup victories ""I didn't really give myself much of a chance teeing off today. I thought six behind was going to be really tough to make up, but my good play and Scottie's not-so-great play meant it was a ball game going into the back nine,"" McIlroy added. McIlroy has been one of the PGA Tour's most influential presences during golf's ongoing power struggle, and was one of the leading voices in ameeting held earlier this monthby the tour's top players to discuss the threat of LIV Golf. Following his triumph, he said: ""I believe in the game of golf, I believe in this tour in particular, I believe in the players on this tour. ""It's the greatest place in the world to play golf, bar none, and I've played all over the world. ""This is an incredibly proud moment for me, but it should also be an incredibly proud moment for the PGA Tour. They have had some hard times this year, but we are getting through it and that was a spectacle out there today. ""Two of the best players in the world going head-to-head for the biggest prize on the PGA Tour, and I hope everyone at home enjoyed that."" McIlroy said the FedEx Cup victory would help ""soften the blow"" after he was edged out at the 150th Open Championship, where he shared the lead after 54 holes but finished third behind Australia's Cameron Smith. ""St Andrews was really hard for me. It was a tough one to get over,"" he said. ""This softens the blow a little bit. It doesn't make it that much easier to get over, but it's great to end the season on a high note like this.""

"Do not protect Liverpool killers, urge police","Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot after a gunman ran into her home in Liverpool Anyone who withholds the names of those behind three fatal shootings in Liverpool, including that of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel, is ""protecting killers"", Merseyside Police have said. Olivia was fatally shot on Monday after a gunman chased a man, neither of whom had links to her family, into her home. She was one of four people killed recently on Merseyside amid a rise in gun and knife crimes. Police said: ""You know their names, now we need the names of their murderers."" Two men arrested on suspicion of Olivia's murder werebailed on Saturday. Police said one of the men, aged 36, was recalled to prison after breaching the terms of his licence. Ashley Dale, Sam Rimmer and Karen Dempsey were also killed this August Olivia's killing was one of four which took place on Merseyside within a matter of days amid a recent rise of gun and knife crimes. Karen Dempsey, 55, was found stabbed in a pub car park in Kirkby on Monday. Her son has been charged with her murder. Meanwhile, police are also appealing for information over the killings of Ashley Dale and Sam Rimmer. Ms Dale, who worked on the environmental health team at Knowsley Council, was fatally shot in her back garden on 21 August. She was not believed to have been the intended target of the shooting, which led to the arrests of two people. Police have also detained a fourth person on suspicion of the murder of Mr Rimmer, aged 22, on 16 August. He was with a group of friends in Lavrock Bank cul-de-sac when they were shot at by riders on two electric bikes, officers said. Police want to know more about the movements of this black Audi Q3 in the days before Olivia's death Merseyside Police launched a social media campaign on Sunday, saying: ""You know their names, now we need the names of their murderers."" In a video, a voiceover states: ""We've got parents who've lost their children. ""We've got a nine-year-old girl who won't celebrate her 18th birthday. She won't celebrate her wedding. She won't have children of her own. ""If you've got information and you're withholding it, you're protecting the killers. ""We need your information.

Police have also said they want more information about a black Audi Q3 which was seen leaving Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, after Olivia's shooting. The car, which has been seized by officers, was believed to be the same vehicle used to take intended target Joseph Nee, 35, to hospital. They said they wanted information about its movements in the days before Olivia's death.

Pakistan appeals for flood aid as 119 more die,"This video can not be played Watch: Millions affected by heavy flooding in Pakistan Pakistan is appealing for further international assistance as floods devastate the country, leaving people searching for higher, drier ground. The death toll from the monsoon rains has reached 1,033 - with 119 killed in the last 24 hours, the National Disaster Management Authority says. The US, UK, UAE and others have contributed to a disaster appeal, but more funds are needed, officials say. One man told the BBC his daughter had been swept away by a flooded river. ""She told me: 'Daddy, I'm going to collect leaves for my goat,'"" Muhammad Fareed, who lives in the Kaghan Valley in the northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said. ""She went to the bank of the river and a gush of water followed and took her away."" Muhammad Fareed, whose daughter died in the Kunhar river An aide to Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told the BBC the country was desperate for international support. ""Pakistan has been grappling with economic issues, but now just when we were about to overcome them the monsoon disaster hit,"" Salman Sufi said. Funding from a lot of development projects had been rerouted to the affected people, he added. In pictures: Floods and fear in Pakistan According to reports by the Dawn newspaper, Prime Minister Sharif has announced a grant of 10bn rupees ($45m) for those in the most affected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Every flood-affected family would be given 25,000 rupees ($112), Mr Sharif said, which would be disbursed within a week. Displaced people wait for relief at a flooded area in the Charsadda District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province In the north-west of the country, thousands of people fled their homes after rivers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa burst their banks, causing powerful flash floods. ""The house which we built with years of hard work started sinking in front of our eyes,"" Junaid Khan, 23, told the AFP news agency. ""We sat on the side of the road and watched our dream house sinking."" The province of Sindh in the south-east of the country has also been badly affected,with thousands displaced from their homes. Flood victims queue up outside a bank to receive financial assistance in southern Sindh province Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Sindh There were displaced people in all of the villages we drove through across Sindh. The full scale of the devastation in the province is yet to be fully understood, but on the ground the people describe it as the worst disaster they've survived. Floods are not uncommon in Pakistan but the people here tell us these rains were different. They were more than anything that's ever been seen here. One local official described them as ""floods of biblical proportions"". Near the city of Larkana, thousands of mud homes have sunk under water, and for miles all that's visible is treetops. Where the water level is slightly lower, thatched roofs creep out from underneath the menacing water. The needs of the survivors are varied. In one village we visit, the people sat there are desperate for food. In another they say they've got their grains, but they need money to meet their other needs. We visit one where many children have developed waterborne diseases. A mobile truck pulls over and scores immediately run towards it.  Children carrying other children make their way to the long queue. One 12-year-old girl says she and her baby sister have not eaten in a day. ""No food has come here. But my sister is sick, she has been vomiting, I hope they can help."" Mr Sharif said 33 million people had been hit by the floods - about 15% of the country's population. He said the losses caused by floods this season were comparable to those during the floods of 2010-11, said to be the worst on record. Officials in the country blame climate change for the devastation. But poor local government planning has exacerbated the impact in the past, with buildings often erected in areas prone to seasonal flooding.

Bin strike talks continue but still no resolution,"Tourists pose for pictures beside overflowing bins in Edinburgh It is hoped a new pay offer could be made to unions in a bid to end the council strike in Scotland.

Council leader Cammy Day said he was continuing to press the Scottish government to fund an ""acceptable settlement"". ""This dispute has brought the value of our waste and cleansing teams - and their right to fair wage - into sharp focus and I'm delighted they'll be back out from Tuesday, helping to return our city to its best,"" he said. ""While they'll be working hard to catch up on collections and making every effort to collect litter across the city, it'll take time for things to return to normal. ""Please bear with them as they do so and, if you can store your extra waste safely for a little longer or are able to book an appointment at a recycling centre, please do so."" Residents are being asked to put their bins out as normal on their scheduled collection day, when extra waste will be collected if it is bagged. Public Health Scotland has warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste, and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins have overflowed. Scott Rennox spoke to BBC Scotland in Portobello Scott Rennox, a street cleanser in Edinburgh, spoke to BBC Scotland to explain why he was on strike. ""Everything's going up, the energy prices are going up and we're still getting the same pay,"" the Unite member said. ""We're just letting them see what it's like if we don't get our pay."" He said he and his colleagues worked all through the pandemic. ""We're picking up more masks than we do cigarette packets now - and there's plenty of disease around them,"" he said. ""What we're wanting is fair pay for what we do because it's not just rubbish we're picking up, it's dog bags, needles, dead animals, glass, everything. ""We don't want to see the town black, we just want a clean city but pay us fair to keep the city clean."" He said he was hopeful that a deal could be struck. ""But they're talking and talking and talking - how much is there to talk about? Just sort something out and get us back to work, get the streets clean again and get us back to normal."" Unions are seeking an agreement similar to the one made to council workers in England, which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay offer. They say that offering a percentage pay rise would mean the most money would go to the best paid staff. The bin strike began in Edinburgh on 18 August, in the midst of festival season, after the unions rejected aninitial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. It escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out despite a revised 5% offer. Monday is the last full day of the current bin strike in Edinburgh but action is due to last until Wednesday in some other places. Fresh strikes are due to start next week.Â Cosla had described it as ""one of, if not the best offer in decades for Scottish local government workers"" with some workers getting an overall 7.36% increase. The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff. But the unions - Unite, Unison and GMB - are calling for more funding from the government to pay for an improved offer. And they have refused a government request to suspend strikes while negotiations are held with Cosla. The council unions sense they are in a very strong negotiating position. The strike is having a major effect on refuse collections in much of Scotland and leaving town and city centres filthy. The threat of a second strike in just over a week means these scenes could be repeated. This is something nobody wants to see happen. The unions want a ""flat cash offer"" rather than a percentage pay rise. This means everybody would get the same pay rise but the most benefit would go to the lowest paid. A straightforward percentage rise would mean that senior staff would get the most.

Truss 'rules out' more direct energy bill help for all,"Liz Truss would prioritise tax cuts over giving direct payments to every household to help cover the cost of rising energy bills, if she were to become prime minister, a source close to her has told the BBC. Reports suggest Ms Truss is considering cutting VAT across the board by 5%. But her Tory leadership rival Rishi Sunak said the government ""must provide some direct support"" to all. All households are due to receive Â£400 off their energy bills this winter. This was part of a package of help announced by Mr Sunak in May when he was still chancellor. On Friday, energy regulator Ofgem hiked the price cap on household bills by 80%, meaning the typical household gas and electricity bill will rise to Â£3,549 a year from October. Both candidates to succeed Boris Johnson have faced repeated questions about what action they would take. Ms Truss has so far only confirmed she will cut National Insurance and green levies on bills. On Sunday night, a member of Ms Truss's campaign team said: ""Liz has been clear we need to lower the burden of taxation and focus on boosting energy supplies and this will be her priority as prime minister. ""She's also been clear further support may be required to help. Her preference is to target this to those most in need, but isn't ruling anything out."" Earlier on Sunday, a source close to her had said she had ""ruled out"" further direct support for everyone to pay energy bills. It comes as newspaper reports suggest she is ""mulling"" cuts to VAT and increasing the amount of money people have to earn before they start paying income tax. A report in the Sunday Telegraph,externalsuggests she is looking at a ""nuclear"" option to cut VAT by 5%, saying it could save the average household Â£1,300 a year. This video can not be played Watch: Martin Lewis says people are staring into a ""pit of financial doom"" over energy costs Mr Sunak's team has dismissed a cut to all VAT as being ""incredibly regressive"", saying it would cost more than Â£30bn. A source on his campaign team added: ""Tory members will not like the sound of Liz Truss boosting welfare - once it goes up, it's hard to take back down. ""It also means the worst off this winter are hardworking families and pensioners on middle incomes, which are Conservative and swing voters. Truss's plan is a gift to Labour."" The former chancellor has said he will cut VAT on energy bills and - writing in the Times on Saturday - said direct government support must be provided to everyone, with a focus on low-income households and pensioners. He has also indicated that, for the most vulnerable household, he would try to make up the difference between the current energy price cap of Â£1,971 a year and the new cap of Â£3,549 by changing things like welfare benefits and pensioners' winter fuel credits. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,,externalBoris Johnson said his successor would deliver a ""huge package"" of support, without saying what that would be. He said the months ahead were going to be ""tough, perhaps very tough"" and energy bills would be ""eye-watering"". In his last week as prime minister, Mr Johnson is expected to give a speech about the future of energy that is likely to serve as a challenge to his successor not to neglect plans to ramp up other energy sources, like offshore wind and nuclear power. Mr Sunak has already indicated his support for boosting insulation and offshore wind. Ms Truss has voiced support for exploring more North Sea oil and gas and fracking, where communities support it. But she has criticised other forms of energy such as solar farms on agricultural land. Middle-earners need help with bills too - Zahawi What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? What can be done to tackle the energy crisis? What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? All households will get the Â£400 rebate on energy bills, with low income and vulnerable households receiving an additional Â£650. Pensioners will also receive Â£300 along with their winter fuel payment in November, and people on an eligible disability benefit will receive an additional Â£150. This video can not be played Worried about energy bills? The BBC's Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four discounts and payments that could help Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government's response to the growing cost-of-living crisis. Labour has said its plan to freeze energy prices this winter - paid in part by a windfall tax on energy companies - would save someone on the minimum wage more than Â£40 a week. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said the energy price cap rise was ""nothing short of a catastrophe for millions"" and SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford warned businesses could ""go to the wall"" over winter. The price cap, set by Ofgem, is rising by 80% in October The price of electricity will rise on average from 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) to 52p and gas will go up from 7p to 15p per kWh A typical annual energy bill paid by direct debit is currently Â£1,971. In October, that will rise to Â£3,549 Prepayment meter customers will pay an extra Â£59 a year from October, taking the new typical bill on a prepayment meter to Â£3,608 TRANSFER TRAGEDY:How did Emiliano Sala end up on that plane?

An 80-point lead has now been turned into a 93-point advantage for Max Verstappen after his 14th-to P1 performance in Belgium. Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez goes five points clear of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. In the constructors' championship, 118 points is in the hands of Red Bull at the top of the standings, while Ferrari in second are just 41 points ahead of third-placed Mercedes. Andrew BensonBBC Sportâs chief F1 writer at Spa The Belgian Grand Prix has secured its place on the 2023 Formula 1 calendar with a new one-year contract. The race at historic Spa-Francorchamps had been vulnerable as F1 juggled its options, but has secured a reprieve. An F1 statement said: ""Formula 1 can confirm that the Belgian GP will be on the 2023 calendar following an agreement to extend our partnership."" But F1 wants evidence organisers are willing to make significant investment to secure its longer-term future. Full story here Fernando Alonsoin his Alpine finished P5, but all the drama happened on the opening lap where he was involved in a collision with Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton. Speaking to Sky Sports he said: ""I was surprised, but he has seen the incident and takes responsibility and it was a lap one incident nothing really to say there. ""It has happened in the past with Hamilton and Rosberg and it is a tricky corner. It was frustrating but my car was strong and I could continue. There was no damage but I will have to check later."" Toto Wolff gave his assessment of the race to Sky Sports: ""I don't think you can be satisfied if you see Verstappen being in a league of his own. We need to really find out how we can improve our car. the gap is just too big. ""Hamilton came in and said he squeezed him, apologetic. It's very difficult in the car to really see, but clearly yes."" Is the car difficult to drive? ""I think that's just the reality. We need to accept that the car is very difficult to drive, it hasn't got the pace on a single lap so we just need to work ourselves out of this."" What do the next four days look like? ""I think there'll be a lot of sticking the heads together, setting the sides not only for the next few races but for next season."" Can you win races this season? ""That was clearly not great for us all week and I hope Zandvoort will suit us more and that we are more competitive. ""We mustn't be too much between depression and mania - today would be all of the reasons to be depressed and angry. Three weeks ago we were thinking absolutely we were going to be in the race and we never give up.""  Mercedes driverGeorge Russellfinished P4 and afterwards he spoke to Sky Sports: ""A little bit of mixed feelings today. If you said last night I would be two seconds off the podium I would have said that's good recovery, but we had two scrappy laps and then the tyres go out of the window and as soon as you lose that sweet spot (with the tyres) I knew that was it. ""I think our race pace was better than the Ferraris, at worse I think we are equal with them today but Max is cruising  at the moment."" Lewis Hamilton who was out of the race after a collision with Alpine's Fernando Alonso:""Looking back at the footage he was in my blind spot and I didn't leave enough space. It's my fault. I am sorry to the team"" On Alonso's comment:""It doesn't really matter what he says. I don't really care."" On looking ahead to Zandvoort:""I just need to recuperate and get back on the treadmill."" Asked if he was surprised by Charles Leclerc pitting at the end to go for the fastest lap, Fernando Alonso jokes: ""Ferrari always does some strange strategy!"" Charles Leclerc who finished 6th after a five second penalty:""I mean the pit lane is not bad luck, its my fault. It's a mistake that's it. We were just not quick enough, this is the big problem."" On Ferrari getting up to Red Bull's pace:""It's starting to look very difficult. To get to Red Bull's pace is very difficult."" Is he still in the title race?:""Yeah, but it is starting to look very difficult. I'll focus race by race."" Another disappointing day for Charles Leclerc, made worse by a time penalty at the end. What did the Ferrari man make of his race at Spa? Red Bull team principalChristian Hornerspeaking to Sky Sports after both of his drivers finished first and second respectively: ""This is the biggest team performance - never expected Max to win and get to the front so quickly and Checo too - it was a great finish. It was an amazing performance, back up there like in 2010. ""Max was not greedy at the start and picked his way through it and it was an incredible performance. ""It is encouraging (being one-two in the championship and top of the constructors) but you can't allow yourself to think too far ahead. The whole team is doing their bit, which gives us the car and results.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Carlos Sainz who finished third:""Yeah unfortunately the race was harder than expected. We got a good start and a good restart but the pace wasn't there. ""For some reason our package wasn't quite there this weekend. But we got podium and we'll take it. ""The first two laps were strong then we went into tyre degradation straight after. ""Unfortunately we couldn't put on a stronger fight and had to survive. We have to learn why we aren't as competitive. ""Zandvoort should be a good track for us and we will try to win it in Zandvoort."" Red Bull driver Sergio Perezfinished in second place and after the race said: ""I really hoped for more, today was a good opportunity. Max was flying and on another planet, he was untouchable, but it was a strong result for the team and that was important. ""There was a bit of chaos on lap one and I had a poor start but managed to get it back on Turn Five -  it was very hectic."" Belgian Grand Prix winner Max Verstappen: ""It was quite a hectic first lap to try and stay out of trouble. So many things were happening in front of me, picked the right places to pass people, looked after out tyres and that's how we made our way forward and once we were in the lead, it was all about managing everything but this whole weekend has been incredible."" On starting P14 to win, fastest lap and driver of the day: ""It's been a weekend I couldn't have imagined before but I think we want more of them and we'll keep working hard."" On his home Grand Prix in Zandvoort next week? ""Of course I am going to enjoy today and then next week' we''ll see what we can do."" My word someone is blasting that music in the paddock offensively loud. Shall we have a look at what the top three had to say? Ninth win of the 2022 season for Max Verstappen and the 29th of the Dutchman's career. With a second-placed finish in Belgium and Charles Leclerc ending the day in fifth, Sergio Perez has leapfrogged the Ferrari driver in the standings.  Allow Twitter content?

Talks continue in bid to end bin strikes,"Tourists pose for pictures beside overflowing bins in Edinburgh It is hoped a new pay offer could be made to unions in a bid to end the council strike in Scotland. Bin strikes now affect two thirds of Scotland's local authorities and rubbish is building up in many town and city centres. Discussions between the unions and the council's umbrella body, Cosla, took place on Sunday. There is still no new offer but sources close to negotiations believe it is possible one may be made on Monday. No talks are scheduled, but a revised pay offer could come from Cosla. Kate Hagmman, Cosla's resources spokeswoman, said: ""We remain in intense active discussions with our trade union colleagues."" Public health warning as bin strikes continue Is there a bin strike in my area? The people hiring skips and using baths to store rubbish The Scottish government has encouraged both sides to seek a ""fair resolution"" to the dispute. Ben MacPherson, minister for social security and local government, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning ScotlandÂ programmeÂ that afterÂ ""constructive discussions over recent days""Â CoslaÂ met with local government leaders to discuss a ""potential proposition"".Â Â However, he said: ""It would not be appropriate for the Scottish government to comment further beyond continuing to encourage both sides to continue to seek that fair resolution to the dispute that we all want to see as soon as possible.Â ""The unions andÂ CoslaÂ are the negotiating parties in this scenario. The Scottish government can't make the unions an offer because we are not the employer in this situation but we're engaged with local government leaders and we want to see a resolution to this just like everyone else.""Â Edinburgh's strike is due to end after Monday but more action is planned next week Meanwhile City of Edinburgh Council said additional resources would be deployed to support the clean up on Tuesday, when the strike ends. Council leader Cammy Day said he was continuing to press the Scottish government to fund an ""acceptable settlement"". ""This dispute has brought the value of our waste and cleansing teams - and their right to fair wage - into sharp focus and I'm delighted they'll be back out from Tuesday, helping to return our city to its best,"" he said. ""While they'll be working hard to catch up on collections and making every effort to collect litter across the city, it'll take time for things to return to normal. ""Please bear with them as they do so and, if you can store your extra waste safely for a little longer or are able to book an appointment at a recycling centre, please do so."" Residents are being asked to put their bins out as normal on their scheduled collection day, when extra waste will be collected if it is bagged. Public Health Scotland has warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste, and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins have overflowed. Scott Rennox spoke to BBC Scotland in Portobello Scott Rennox, a street cleanser in Edinburgh, spoke to BBC Scotland to explain why he was on strike. ""Everything's going up, the energy prices are going up and we're still getting the same pay,"" the Unite member said. ""We're just letting them see what it's like if we don't get our pay."" He said he and his colleagues worked all through the pandemic. ""We're picking up more masks than we do cigarette packets now - and there's plenty of disease around them,"" he said. ""What we're wanting is fair pay for what we do because it's not just rubbish we're picking up, it's dog bags, needles, dead animals, glass, everything. ""We don't want to see the town black, we just want a clean city but pay us fair to keep the city clean."" He said he was hopeful that a deal could be struck. ""But they're talking and talking and talking - how much is there to talk about? Just sort something out and get us back to work, get the streets clean again and get us back to normal."" Unions are seeking an agreement similar to the one made to council workers in England, which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay offer. They say that offering a percentage pay rise would mean the most money would go to the best paid staff. The bin strike began in Edinburgh on 18 August, in the midst of festival season, after the unions rejected aninitial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. It escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out despite a revised 5% offer. Monday is the last full day of the current bin strike in Edinburgh but action is due to last until Wednesday in some other places. Fresh strikes are due to start next week.Â Cosla had described it as ""one of, if not the best offer in decades for Scottish local government workers"" with some workers getting an overall 7.36% increase. The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff. But the unions - Unite, Unison and GMB - are calling for more funding from the government to pay for an improved offer. And they have refused a government request to suspend strikes while negotiations are held with Cosla. The council unions sense they are in a very strong negotiating position. The strike is having a major effect on refuse collections in much of Scotland and leaving town and city centres filthy. The threat of a second strike in just over a week means these scenes could be repeated. This is something nobody wants to see happen. The unions want a ""flat cash offer"" rather than a percentage pay rise. This means everybody would get the same pay rise but the most benefit would go to the lowest paid. A straightforward percentage rise would mean that senior staff would get the most.

The hidden castles under Belfast's shops,"A castle built under the command of Sir Arthur Chichester in the early 1600s was destroyed by fire a century later The history of Belfast can be told through many of its street names and buildings, much of it reflecting the city's industrial heritage and Victorian boom. But in one block, under the feet of shoppers, there is a story which dates back several hundred years. Castle Lane, Castle Arcade, Castle Place and Castle Buildings. Each pays tribute to the site of not one, but three Belfast castles, and archaeologists believe their foundations and artefacts could still lie below the surface. Part of the area is the former British Homes Stores (BHS) site, which is now to be converted into a complex of leisure and retail units. It will be called The Keep, a nod by developers to a past which was first referenced in 1262. Then it was an Anglo-Norman castle, believed to consist of an earthen mound, similar to mottes that remain visible in townlands such as Dundonald. It was a ""critical part of the medieval Norman settlement of Belfast"", striding the Farset River, which we now know as High Street, archaeologist RuairÃ­ Ã Baoill told BBC News NI. However, the site was destroyed in the 1300s, as power shifted to the Gaelic lords in Ireland, such as the Clandeboye O'Neills. The O'Neills in turn built a new castle, a ""strategic base"", Mr Ã Baoill explained. ""We know there was a castle there because there are references to it being attacked in the 1400s and the 1500s in both Irish and English histories and it's actually shown in two maps,"" he said. Medieval burials have also been documented in Cornmarket, an area which is now home to shops, cafes and buskers. 'The Keep' development site has referenced the castle in its promotional material According to Queen's University academic Dr Colm Donnelly, the O'Neill castle would have looked like a tower house, ""a small building, maybe four storeys high"", with rooms stacked on top of one another, connected by a spiral staircase. Similar stone towers from this period have survived, such as Audley's Castle and Kilclief Castle, close to Strangford. ""They were abandoned by and large in the 17th century, but they survive in the Irish landscape,"" Dr Donnelly said. The Clandeboye O'Neill building is believed to have resembled tower houses such as the 15th century Kilclief Castle, near Strangford ""They're really well constructed, but they're not immune from the forces of nature, such as frost getting into the walls."" This second Belfast castle was also replaced, but not entirely. ""At the end of the 16th century the Gaelic lords went into revolt and they were defeated by the forces of Queen Elizabeth I, one of whom was Arthur Chichester,"" Mr Ã Baoill said. ""He was given land all over the place, including the town of Belfast."" The Chichester castle features prominently to the top right of Thomas Phillips' map of Belfast in 1685 A report by the plantation commissioners in 1611 gives an account of shops being built in the new Chichester town, with 120,000 bricks being used by masons. Among the writings is a reference to the old ""decayed"" castle, the O'Neill building, part of which was retained and linked to the new Chichester castle via a staircase. The third castle survived for a century, but burnt down in 1708, killing four people, including three sisters of the 4th Earl of Donegall. The Plantation of Ulster explained It can be seen in a map of Belfast in 1685, however, along with the city's walls, which were ground-made ramparts that partly enclosed the town. ""It was smack in the centre of Belfast, around Cornmarket and Castle Arcade,"" Mr Ã Baoill said. ""Underground are the remains of at least two castles side by side, and possibly the Anglo-Norman one as well, but it's really frustrating because you can't see them."" ""Underground they're safe,"" he added. Due to the risk of flooding in Belfast, Mr Ã Baoill said archaeologists believed few of the city centre's buildings have deep basements, meaning there is a possibility that ""substantial archaeological remains"" exist across the area. The castles, off modern Castle Place, were built at a site of strategic importance, according to RuairÃ­ Ã Baoill Historian Dr Jim O'Neill agreed and explained a shallow trench he once excavated in Waring Street revealed centuries of buildings had been layered on top of each other, indicating that the castles' remains could exist mere metres underground. He said it is believed the medieval tower house contained masonry vaulting. ""If you had a limitless budget and luck on your side, you should find this large brick structure with a masonry core, which would be astounding,"" he detailed. ""It would be astonishing to find that and then, of course, associated with that the remains of domestic life from that time."" The planned redevelopment of the BHS site has been limited to ""areas of previous ground disturbance"", the Department for Communities told BBC News NI, with the need for an archaeological assessment ""likely to be minimal or avoided entirely"". It added, however, the area was recognised as having a ""heightened archaeological potential within the historic core of Belfast"". RuairÃ­ Ã Baoill (red jacket) has previously carried out excavations in Castle Lane in 1983 The department's Historic Environment Division (HED), which advises on the potential archaeological impact on planning decisions, highlighted the history of the location to Belfast City Council, which approved the project. The council said the planning conditions ""ensure appropriate mitigation of any archaeological impacts of development"". Dr O'Neill said the castles had always been of great interest to archaeologists and that local experts would like to excavate in the wider area. ""There's always that possibility, that frisson of excitement that we might get gold in terms of the archaeology of Belfast,"" he said. RuairÃ­ Ã Baoill added there remained a ""massive interest"" from Belfast people too in the city's history as more resources are made available to tell its story online. ""It's frustrating you can't see it [the castle], but just because you can't see it, it doesn't mean it isn't there,"" he said. ""There are hundreds of years of history back to the Anglo-Normans in the city centre, there's thousands of years in the hills around Belfast. ""We have a really really interesting past, a much longer past than sometimes people believe.""

Rapper Dave makes Leeds Festival history,"Dave is the youngest solo headliner of Reading and Leeds Festivals since a Yorkshire site was added in 1999 Dave rapped on stage with a delighted fan while becoming Leeds Festival's youngest headliner on Saturday. ""I feel like I should share this moment with one of you guys for the final time,"" said the 24-year-old Londoner. He then brought out an energetic young Merseysider, Ã  la viral sensation Alex from Glastonbury several years ago, to perform the track Thiago Silva. Earlier, US star Megan Thee Stallion invited ""hot girls"" and ""hot guys"" from the audience up for a dirty dance-off. The Texan hip-hop sensation made history too by becoming the event's first black female co-headliner, as rap music took over from rock and pop. Dave is a born story-teller and clearly now made for the main stage. He arrived wearing a matching green vest top and shorts, with a ""Psycho"" cap on. And backed by a marching band with added strings and brass, situated behind a big metal heart-shaped cage, began to tell his truth. ""It's been a long road,"" he said, displayed in black-and-white on big screens. ""I want to take you guys on a journey."" Stopping only briefly due to a health and safety concern in the crowd, he coolly performed songs from his Mobo Award-winning recent record We're All Alone in this Together, one of the biggest-selling albums of the year, which tackles themes of loneliness, mental health and racism in the UK. As well as material from his Brit Award and Mercury Prize-winning album Psychodrama (hence the cap), which explores issues around grief, domestic abuse and his brother's incarceration. There were good time vibes though, and early in the set he turned Saturday night in west Yorkshire into a Funky Friday, delivering his number one hit. The star took he crowd on an emotinal journey from south London to the Leeds main stage Then came the moment of the night. After his band played a snippet of The White Stripes anthem Seven Nation Army, up came a ""buzzing"" bare-chested young fan who said he had been waiting for seven hours in the hope of being selected. ""You nearly got me up in Newcastle,"" he revealed, excitedly. Then addressing the crowd, added: ""I've been a fan of Dave for so long, I've been to three of his shows, I've been on tour with him... well, notwithhim!"" After going bar for bar with his hero twice, drawing loud cheers, he stopped for a quick selfie video and disappeared off into the night. The limelight then fell back on the headliner, who let fans, old and new, into the secrets of his songwriting process, while switching between the piano and guitar. ""Music is my way of communicating,"" he explained. ""I'm not that good at speaking."" There were camera phones held aloft for as far as the eye could see as he ripped into his Stormzy collaboration Clash. Unlike at Reading, Leeds' sister festival, the night before, there was no cameo from last year's headliner however. Though it didn't really matter, this was Dave's night. ""It's one of the greatest honours in all of our lives,"" he beamed on behalf of himself and his band. Speaking to Radio 1's Newsbeat in December, Dave said headlining a major event like Reading and Leeds would be a completely different challenge and experience to anything he has done before, promising ""the highest quality production value that I can"". It was a promise he very much kept. Marking another big moment for UK grime and rap. Megan Thee Stallion, like Dave, welcomed fans on stage Before Dave there was Megan, who put on a highly sexually-charged HIIT class of a show, which peaked with a rendition of her's and Cardi B's track WAP (which I'm afraid I cannot decode for you here). Her lyrics, filthier than some of the bodies on display that have been on the campsite since Wednesday, gave the brilliant sign language interpreters on the side of the sound stage an unenviable task. ""We here to have a party tonight,"" she announced. ""I hope you all ready."" Twerking throughout in a leather corset and thong, Megan handpicked some ""hotties"" from the crowd - including a woman in a white bikini, another in a cowboy hat and a bloke in Hawaiian shirt - to join her, as one of the main stages was briefly turned into a strip club. ""That's what I'm talking about!"" she yelled, encouragingly, in the direction of her newest dance students, after having warned them not to be shy. It was a warning that was well-heeded by all. Megan, who is currently embroiled in a dispute with her record label, played a career-spanning set that was a joyous sight to behold. Festival organiser Melvin Benn described her booking as ""a good step forward for us"", a nod to the much-needed diversification of the line-up in recent years, reflecting people's changing listening habits in the genre-straddling streaming era. ""Festivals are a reflection of what people are choosing to watch,"" he recently told Music Week. ""As it happens, this year [Friday's co-headliner] Halsey was available and Megan Thee Stallion was available and they both wanted to play. ""Her show is exactly what the Reading and Leeds audience want and I was pleased and surprised that she wanted to do it."" Wolf Alice, who will play at Leeds on Sunday, said last year festival bookers had been playing it safe since Covid, giving preference to heritage acts. And while there is still a long way to go in that regard, Saturday saw an abundance of new talent on display, including PinkPantheress, Griff and Joy Crookes. Little Simz brought great tea-time vibes as the sun began to set Another London rapper/actress Little Simz, who actually features alongside the multi-talented Dave in the cult gang drama Top Boy, set the tone for the evening getting the crowd to put their ""dancing shoes"" on to groove to songs from her critically-acclaimed albums, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert and Grey Area as the sun started to set. After finishing up with the tongue-twisting vocal gymnastics of Venom, she seemed genuinely humbled by the rapturous applause. ""Every time I come to Leeds I have a wonderful time,"" she said. ""I'm so grateful to be here."" She dedicated her penultimate track Woman to all the females in the field, rapping lyrics befitting of the evening ahead: ""All I see is black stars and I love it, yeah / Time's up, tell the people that we coming, yeah, yeah."" Leeds Festival continues on Sunday with performances from Yorkshire rock bands Arctic Monkeys and Bring Me the Horizon, who both performed in Reading on Saturday evening.

The seaside town where dockers are striking,"Union members have been striking at the Port of Felixstowe in a dispute over pay Almost 2,000 workers have entered their final day of industrial action at the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk. How do people who live and work in the area feel about the action taken by the dockers at UK's largest container port? Jon Cowell says the dockers deserve the pay rise they are striking for The Port of Felixstowe is internationally significant, handling almost half of the container freight entering the UK - around four million containers a year from 2,000 ships. But its importance is also ""massive"" for the local area and economy, says retired tug driver Jon Cowell. The 66-year-old, who supports the dockers' strikes, says he has seen the port ""emerge from a tiny little dock bay to what it is today"". He says without the port, the Edwardian seaside town ""wouldn't be anywhere near as vibrant or as busy as it is today"". ""The seaside does good business but that's only during the summer. During the winter it can be a bit bleak around here but at least you've got money coming into the community and that's keeping the majority of our shops open,"" he says. Mr Cowell, who lives near the high street, says shift work at the port is ""onerous to say the least"" and the workers have been ""having below inflationary pay rises for about 10 years now"". ""Good luck to them, the company has made an awful lot of money over the years... I think all of the people who are making a lot of money out of it now have got plenty of it to be spreading it around with the fellas who do the dock work and make it what it is today,"" he says. Jade Hurn, 26, says it would be ""great"" if everyone could get a pay rise in line with inflation Meanwhile Jade Hurn, who works in Felixstowe, says it is difficult to give a true opinion without knowing all of the details. The 26-year-old estate agent says: ""It's hard to make everybody happy but if you make the majority of people unhappy, they are going to say something about it and that's what has happened."" She added: ""It's hard to have an opinion on every single level of role that's affected by it unless you know what everybody is earning and what everybody's lifestyle is like, and the people who do know that sort of information are the people who don't really have to strike."" Miss Hurn says she has been affected by the increased cost in fuel, describing the price as ""ridiculous"", as she travels from her home in Stowmarket to work in the coastal town. She says if everybody could get a pay rise in line with inflation, which is what the dock workers are calling for, ""that would be great"". ""But that's not to say they don't deserve it because we haven't got it, if they can get it good for them."" Postman Dan Jacobs, who is among the Royal Mail workers taking industrial action, thinks the port strikes are ""unnecessary"" But as far as postal worker Dan Jacobs is concerned, the dockers are ""paid enough"". The 47-year-old from Felixstowe is one of thethousands of postal workers who started their four days of industrial action on Friday. Royal Mail postal workers are also walking out on 31 August and 8 and 9 September. ""There are strikes across the board, these strikes, rail strikes and I'm a postman and we're striking but I think the dock strikes are unnecessary as I think they get paid enough,"" says Mr Jacobs. ""The average wage of a docker is over Â£40,000, I get paid at the moment, because I'm only on a 25-hour contract, Â£15,000 or Â£16,000 a year and I can live on that. ""So if they're being paid double that, they don't need to strike, do they?"" He adds: ""I wish we didn't have to strike but because we've been offered 2% we need to, but the dockers have been offered 7% and I think they should accept it."" Royal Mail said the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents the postal workers, had rejected a pay rise offer ""worth up to 5.5%"" after three months of talks. The union has called for Royal Mail to increase wages to an amount that ""covers the current cost of living"". The strike action started last Sunday Members of the union Unite who work at the Port of Felixstowe are on their eighth and final day of industrial action. It is the first time in 30 years that dock workers have gone on strike. Striking workers include crane drivers, machine operators and stevedores, who load and unload ships. Unite's national officer, Robert Morton, says members wanted an ""increase to match inflation and not to come back with anything less"". He adds: ""I don't think 7% is a particularly generous offer in relation to the company's profits."" The company says the average wage of workers is around Â£43,000 but Mr Morton says some of the union's members were on Â£20,000 a year, so the ""figures don't equate"". Port strikes could hit toy industry, say retailers Port disruption 'could escalate until Christmas' Workers at key UK port to strike for eight days Paul Davey, a spokesman for the port which is owned by CK Hutchison Holding Ltd, says the strike action is ""unnecessary"". ""The offer we've made to them is worth Â£3,500 extra this year in their pockets and the strike Unite has called is actually going to take the thick end of Â£1,000 out of each of their pockets,"" he says.

"Do not protect Liverpool killers, urge policeDetectives make a direct appeal to those who know the names of people behind the recent murders.Liverpool","Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot after a gunman ran into her home in Liverpool Anyone who withholds the names of those behind three fatal shootings in Liverpool, including that of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel, is ""protecting killers"", Merseyside Police have said. Olivia was fatally shot on Monday after a gunman chased a man, neither of whom had links to her family, into her home. She was one of four people killed recently on Merseyside amid a rise in gun and knife crimes. Police said: ""You know their names, now we need the names of their murderers."" Two men arrested on suspicion of Olivia's murder werebailed on Saturday. Police said one of the men, aged 36, was recalled to prison after breaching the terms of his licence. Ashley Dale, Sam Rimmer and Karen Dempsey were also killed this August Olivia's killing was one of four which took place on Merseyside within a matter of days amid a recent rise of gun and knife crimes. Karen Dempsey, 55, was found stabbed in a pub car park in Kirkby on Monday. Her son has been charged with her murder. Meanwhile, police are also appealing for information over the killings of Ashley Dale and Sam Rimmer. Ms Dale, who worked on the environmental health team at Knowsley Council, was fatally shot in her back garden on 21 August. She was not believed to have been the intended target of the shooting, which led to the arrests of two people. Police have also detained a fourth person on suspicion of the murder of Mr Rimmer, aged 22, on 16 August. He was with a group of friends in Lavrock Bank cul-de-sac when they were shot at by riders on two electric bikes, officers said. Police want to know more about the movements of this black Audi Q3 in the days before Olivia's death Merseyside Police launched a social media campaign on Sunday, saying: ""You know their names, now we need the names of their murderers."" In a video, a voiceover states: ""We've got parents who've lost their children. ""We've got a nine-year-old girl who won't celebrate her 18th birthday. She won't celebrate her wedding. She won't have children of her own. ""If you've got information and you're withholding it, you're protecting the killers. ""We need your information.

Police have also said they want more information about a black Audi Q3 which was seen leaving Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, after Olivia's shooting. The car, which has been seized by officers, was believed to be the same vehicle used to take intended target Joseph Nee, 35, to hospital.

FT: Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone Hearts manager Robbie Neilsonsays mounting injury problems could force him to seek further signings before Thursday's deadline. Kye Rowles, Liam Boyce and Nathaniel Atkinson went off injured today and Neilson tells BBC Sportsound: ""Delighted to get three points but disappointed to lose a couple of players. ""The squad was down to the bare bones going into the game. Fingers crossed the injuries aren't too serious. ""The injuries today might make us have to be more aggressive in the market. ""Rowles hurt his metatarsal, so that will get a scan. Same with Liam's knee. ""Atkinsons damaged his groin. It's very early days and we hope they're light injuries."" FT: Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone Allan PrestonEx-Hearts and St Johnstone defender on BBC Sportsound St Johnstone don't have a goalscorer so I expect them to be down at the bottom end this season. When they were having success it was built on a solid defence and they need to get back to trying to keep clean sheets.  FT: Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone St Johnstone boss Callum Davidsontells BBC Sportsound: ""Definitely frustration in how we lost the third goal. We fought really hard. ""First half we didn't play particularly well, but gave a great response after the break. ""We were slightly on top and had a free-kick two minutes before it [the penalty] and we play the ball long then they pick up seconds and counter. ""We do a long throw, Craig Gordon catches it and they basically go 3-2 up from it. ""It's basic and we have to do better. I'm pretty furious to lose a goal like that. It's hard to take and costly."" FT: Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone It's now four defeats in five for St Johnstone this season, but Callum Davidson must have been heartened by his team's performance today. We'll hear from the St Johnstone gaffer shortly. FT: Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone Michael StewartFormer Hearts midfielder on BBC Scotland The one downside for Hearts is the injuries. Halkett and Kingsley, we don't know how long they'll be out. Now Boyce, Rowles and Atkinson have joined them today. It's going to be a busy last few days of the transfer window.  FT: Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone FT: Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone FT: Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone Allan PrestonEx-Hearts and St Johnstone defender on BBC Sportsound Give credits to both teams, they were excellent and went for it from start to the finish. This game had everything - goals, woodwork struck, penalties, talking points, controversy. Massive result for Hearts, while St Johnstone will be gutted not to take anything.  Phew, what a game. Hearts bounce back to winning ways after three successive defeats as Lawrence Shankland's penalty settles a five-goal thriller. The Tynecastle men trailed to Graham Carey's opener then led after headers from Kye Rowles and Liam Boyce, who both departed injured and were followed by Nathaniel Atkinson. Andrew Considine hauled St Johnstone level, but Hearts dug deep to secure victory and move up to third place. St Johnstone remain 10th, two points off the bottom. Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone McKay - who else - breaks forward and finds partner in crime Shankland. The Hearts striker takes a touch then rattles in a shot that flies over. Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone Stoppage time being played... Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone Oh dear, Drey Wright. Big, big chance for St Johnstone as a cross falls invitingly for the winger at the back post, but composure deserts him and his effort is miles too high. Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone Barrie McKay and Lawrence Shankland are developing a terrific understanding this season. McKay shuttles a pass to the Scotland striker, then runs on to the lay-off and fires not far past the post. Lovely build-up. Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone Never mind the players, I'm knackered just watching this game. Absolutely brilliant entertainment. Hearts 3-2 St Johnstone Allan PrestonEx-Hearts & St Johnstone defender on BBC Sportsound Barrie McKay had a lovely touch then suckered Gordon into conceding the penalty. He's in great form and must be a contender for the Scotland squad.  Lawrence Shankland Cool as you like. Shankland puts the penalty into the bottom right-hand corner as Remi Matthews dives the other way. Hearts 2-2 St Johnstone Barrie McKay is chopped down by Liam Gordon and the ref points to the spot... Hearts 2-2 St Johnstone We're almost into the final 10 minutes and Hearts are building up a head of steam. Will there be a winner in this gloriously chaotic Tynecastle tussle? Hearts 2-2 St Johnstone Alex Mitchell is a relieved man. The St Johnstone defender slides in to get a toe to Andy Halliday's miscued shot and gratefully watches the ball loop into the arms of his goalkeeper Remi Matthews. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Talks continue in bid to end bin strikesUnions want a ""flat cash pay offer"" where everybody would receive the same amount of money.Scotland","Tourists pose for pictures beside overflowing bins in Edinburgh It is hoped a new pay offer could be made to unions in a bid to end the council strike in Scotland. Bin strikes now affect two thirds of Scotland's local authorities and rubbish is building up in many town and city centres. Discussions between the unions and the council's umbrella body, Cosla, took place on Sunday. There is still no new offer but sources close to negotiations believe it is possible one may be made on Monday. No talks are scheduled, but a revised pay offer could come from Cosla. Kate Hagmman, Cosla's resources spokeswoman, said: ""We remain in intense active discussions with our trade union colleagues."" Public health warning as bin strikes continue Is there a bin strike in my area? The people hiring skips and using baths to store rubbish The Scottish government has encouraged both sides to seek a ""fair resolution"" to the dispute. Ben MacPherson, minister for social security and local government, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning ScotlandÂ programmeÂ that afterÂ ""constructive discussions over recent days""Â CoslaÂ met with local government leaders to discuss a ""potential proposition"".Â Â However, he said: ""It would not be appropriate for the Scottish government to comment further beyond continuing to encourage both sides to continue to seek that fair resolution to the dispute that we all want to see as soon as possible.Â ""The unions andÂ CoslaÂ are the negotiating parties in this scenario. The Scottish government can't make the unions an offer because we are not the employer in this situation but we're engaged with local government leaders and we want to see a resolution to this just like everyone else.""Â Edinburgh's strike is due to end after Monday but more action is planned next week Meanwhile City of Edinburgh Council said additional resources would be deployed to support the clean up on Tuesday, when the strike ends. Council leader Cammy Day said he was continuing to press the Scottish government to fund an ""acceptable settlement"". ""This dispute has brought the value of our waste and cleansing teams - and their right to fair wage - into sharp focus and I'm delighted they'll be back out from Tuesday, helping to return our city to its best,"" he said. ""While they'll be working hard to catch up on collections and making every effort to collect litter across the city, it'll take time for things to return to normal. ""Please bear with them as they do so and, if you can store your extra waste safely for a little longer or are able to book an appointment at a recycling centre, please do so."" Residents are being asked to put their bins out as normal on their scheduled collection day, when extra waste will be collected if it is bagged. Public Health Scotland has warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste, and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins have overflowed. Scott Rennox spoke to BBC Scotland in Portobello Scott Rennox, a street cleanser in Edinburgh, spoke to BBC Scotland to explain why he was on strike. ""Everything's going up, the energy prices are going up and we're still getting the same pay,"" the Unite member said. ""We're just letting them see what it's like if we don't get our pay."" He said he and his colleagues worked all through the pandemic. ""We're picking up more masks than we do cigarette packets now - and there's plenty of disease around them,"" he said. ""What we're wanting is fair pay for what we do because it's not just rubbish we're picking up, it's dog bags, needles, dead animals, glass, everything. ""We don't want to see the town black, we just want a clean city but pay us fair to keep the city clean."" He said he was hopeful that a deal could be struck. ""But they're talking and talking and talking - how much is there to talk about? Just sort something out and get us back to work, get the streets clean again and get us back to normal."" Unions are seeking an agreement similar to the one made to council workers in England, which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay offer. They say that offering a percentage pay rise would mean the most money would go to the best paid staff. The bin strike began in Edinburgh on 18 August, in the midst of festival season, after the unions rejected aninitial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. It escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out despite a revised 5% offer. Monday is the last full day of the current bin strike in Edinburgh but action is due to last until Wednesday in some other places. Fresh strikes are due to start next week.Â Cosla had described it as ""one of, if not the best offer in decades for Scottish local government workers"" with some workers getting an overall 7.36% increase. The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff. But the unions - Unite, Unison and GMB - are calling for more funding from the government to pay for an improved offer. And they have refused a government request to suspend strikes while negotiations are held with Cosla. The council unions sense they are in a very strong negotiating position. The strike is having a major effect on refuse collections in much of Scotland and leaving town and city centres filthy. The threat of a second strike in just over a week means these scenes could be repeated. This is something nobody wants to see happen. The unions want a ""flat cash offer"" rather than a percentage pay rise. This means everybody would get the same pay rise but the most benefit would go to the lowest paid. A straightforward percentage rise would mean that senior staff would get the most.

Solar panel sales boom as energy bills soar,"The energy bills crisis has prompted a big rise in demand for solar panels. Just over 3,000 solar installations are being carried out every week, according to trade association Solar Energy UK, up from 1,000 a week in July 2020. One provider said this month it had seenenquiries about solar panels rise tenfold,external. ""More solar panels are being put on British roofs than ever before,"" said Chris Hewett, chief executive of Solar Energy UK. The fact that renewable energy helps protect the planet has always made it an attractive option. The way they work is simple: the panels absorb sunlight through photovoltaic cells which convert it into electricity that can be flowed through your home, or into a battery. The process significantly reduces the amount of electricity you will need from the network. People who have successfully installed solar panels report saving hundreds of pounds on electricity bills. But they are not the answer for everyone, as installing them means an upfront investment of thousands of pounds and you'll need the right type of property. Soaring energy prices, however, have slashed the time taken to recoup your initial costs. 'Lives at risk' without more help on energy bills What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? How high will energy bills go? A decade ago a typical solar panel system cost around Â£20,000 and would take around a decade to cover those set-up costs. But prices for solar panel systems have fallen by more than 60% since then, meaning it takes between four and five years for a system to pay for itself. The price includes installation and the number of panels will depend on how much space you have on a roof. A typical 20sq m roof could hold 12 panels. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests a standard solar panel system costs between Â£9,000 to Â£11,700, while Solar Energy UK lists the cost of a ""typical"" 3.1kWp system for a three-bed house as Â£3,925. What you'll end up paying will depend on the size of the system, the type of panel you choose, the quality of components, the accessibility and state of repair of your roof, and the individual installer, says Which? Why record heat doesn't mean record solar power The price hikes that lie ahead Many houses in the UK are just not designed to cope with a warming climate but homeowners are adapting Not everyone will own a home that can benefit from solar energy, especially if you own a north-facing property, or your home is largely shaded. ""Solar panels are perfect for residential properties with a south, east or west-facing roof, preferably without any shading,"" says Mandip Bhamra, head of renewables at SaveMoneyCutCarbon. ""Depending on how old your house is, you may want to check your roof is structurally sound before fitting the solar panels onto it,"" says Brian Davenport, owner of The Solar Centreâ¯. He says most installers will have access to a structural engineer for calculating the wind-load should a roof show any signs of distress. ""There should also be a small amount of room made available in your loft for the inverter, which is roughly the size of a microwave,"" he adds. If you live in a flat you'd need to discuss the issue of installing solar panels with other residents and the freeholder. ""For a block of flats, most roofing should be fine, and with some flats where there is excess land, these can be placed in the ground too,"" says Mandip Bhamra. The amount of electricity solar panels generate depends on the type and size of system and home. A report for Solar Energy UK suggests that a typical home could cut electricity bills by more than Â£300 a year. Households with electric heating could be more than Â£900 a year better off, the report said, although most UK households remain on gas central heating. If energy bills rise as predicted this winter, then the value of electricity generated through solar panels could almost double, says Kevin Holland, managing director of The Solar Shed, a Norfolk-based renewable energy business. He says a typical solar panel system could generate Â£1,200 worth of electricity in a year at current prices. If energy bills rise by 80% in October plus a further 50% in January, as forecast, then the value of electricity generated by a typical system could climb to around Â£3,240. Also, if you don't actually use all the electricity you generate, you can sell that surplus to an energy firm. Fitting solar panels is a wise move, says Colin Froude Colin Froude installed solar panels on his detached home in Salisbury, Wiltshire 11 years ago. ""I've never regretted it. It paid for itself in about seven or eight years and now my energy bills are just Â£67 a month, a saving of up to Â£80 a month,"" says Colin, who used to be in the Royal Air Force but is now retired. ""Paying that by standing order means I've actually built up a Â£330 credit in recent months so even when bills climb in October I won't increase my standing order as that credit should see me through into the New Year."" He spent Â£18,000 on installing 19 solar panels on his home in 2011 and says that has since generated Â£21,000 worth of electricity. He spent another Â£12,000 installing a battery, new transformer and optimisers fitted to each panel a year ago but says that has improved efficiency enormously. The move paid off. The system generated 1,600kwh in three months this summer. ""I did it to future-proof the house as protection against power cuts but it's rapidly paying for itself."" He cooks with electricity and says the solar panels generate all the hot water the household needs, so in the summer months when the heating is off, he pays nothing for gas. ""Given the rising cost of energy I would recommend solar panels to anyone,"" he says. A great idea... as long as you can't see them? It's a big investment so there are several things to consider. ""Well-chosen solar panel systems can provide a reliable source of renewable electricity for decades, helping to cut your carbon footprint, but buying an inappropriate system could leave you out of pocket,"" says Which? In other words it's important to do thorough research and get a variety of quotes. It is also worth considering that however much you splash out, it may not add an equal value to your home. Ageing, unattractive old solar panels could well put some potential buyers off. ""As long as you can't see them, solar panels are a great idea,"" says Charlie Wells, managing director of estate agency Prime Purchase. ""Estate agents are unlikely to offer a higher valuation if a property already has solar panels installed,"" says Brian Davenport. But some buyers will be attracted by renewable energy and the chance to save cash on energy bills, says Kevin Holland. ""If there are two houses in the street for sale, one has no solar and a Â£4,000 energy bill, the other has solar and a Â£1,500 energy bill, which one are you buying?"" he says.

"Men held over Olivia Pratt-Korbel's murder bailedOne of the men has been recalled to prison after breaching the terms of his licence, police said.Liverpool","Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot after a gunman ran into her home Two men who were arrested on suspicion of the murder of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel in Liverpool have been released on bail. Police said one of the men, aged 36, had been recalled to prison after breaching the terms of his licence. Olivia was fatally shot after a gunman chased a man - both of whom had no links to her family - into her home. Her mum was injured as she tried to the shut the door but the attacker fired more shots at the man he had pursued. On Thursday, Merseyside Police arrested the 36-year-old man on suspicion of Olivia's murder and two counts of attempted murder. They also detained a 33-year-old man for the same offences on Friday. A spokeswoman for Merseyside Police said: ""Both men have been released on bail and the 36-year-old man has been recalled to prison after breaching the terms of his licence."" Ashley Dale, Sam Rimmer and Karen Dempsey were also killed this August Police appealed for more information about a black Audi Q3 that was seen leaving Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, after Monday's shooting and is believed to be the same car used to take intended target Joseph Nee, 35, to hospital. They said they wanted information about the car's movements in the days before Olivia's death. She was one of four people who were killed in a week in Merseyside amid a recent rise of gun and knife crimes. A number of people have been arrested after the deaths of Ashley Dale, Sam Rimmer and Karen Dempsey this August. Earlier on Saturday, thousands of football fans applauded in memory of Olivia during the ninth minute of Liverpool's game at Anfield, with fans singing You'll Never Walk Alone. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson wore a shirt in tribute to Olivia It was part of a series of tributes in the city to the four victims of the violence. Balloons were released at the city's Sefton Park in memory of Ashley Dale, who was gunned down in her garden on Sunday. Karen Dempsey, 55, was also found stabbed in a pub car park in Kirkby on Monday. Her son has been charged with her murder. Meanwhile, police have also arrested a fourth person on suspicion of the murder of 22-year-old Sam Rimmer on 16 August. He was with a group of friends in Lavrock Bank cul-de-sac when they were shot at by riders on two electric bikes, Merseyside Police said. A minute's applause was held during the game against Bournemouth A 23-year-old man from Liverpool is being interviewed by detectives after he was detained on suspicion of murder. A 17-year-old boy and two men, aged 20 and 21, who were previously arrested on suspicion of murder have since been bailed. The government has said it will allocate Â£500,000 for Merseyside to counter crime and provide mental health support after the recent killings.

"Truss 'rules out' more direct energy bill help for allThe Tory leadership contender is considering other options such as tax cuts, her teams says.UK Politics","Liz Truss would prioritise tax cuts over giving direct payments to every household to help cover the cost of rising energy bills, if she were to become prime minister, a source close to her has told the BBC. Reports suggest Ms Truss is considering cutting VAT across the board by 5%. But her Tory leadership rival Rishi Sunak said the government ""must provide some direct support"" to all. All households are due to receive Â£400 off their energy bills this winter. This was part of a package of help announced by Mr Sunak in May when he was still chancellor. On Friday, energy regulator Ofgem hiked the price cap on household bills by 80%, meaning the typical household gas and electricity bill will rise to Â£3,549 a year from October. Both candidates to succeed Boris Johnson have faced repeated questions about what action they would take. Ms Truss has so far only confirmed she will cut National Insurance and green levies on bills. On Sunday night, a member of Ms Truss's campaign team said: ""Liz has been clear we need to lower the burden of taxation and focus on boosting energy supplies and this will be her priority as prime minister. ""She's also been clear further support may be required to help. Her preference is to target this to those most in need, but isn't ruling anything out."" Earlier on Sunday, a source close to her had said she had ""ruled out"" further direct support for everyone to pay energy bills. It comes as newspaper reports suggest she is ""mulling"" cuts to VAT and increasing the amount of money people have to earn before they start paying income tax. A report in the Sunday Telegraph,externalsuggests she is looking at a ""nuclear"" option to cut VAT by 5%, saying it could save the average household Â£1,300 a year. This video can not be played Watch: Martin Lewis says people are staring into a ""pit of financial doom"" over energy costs Mr Sunak's team has dismissed a cut to all VAT as being ""incredibly regressive"", saying it would cost more than Â£30bn. A source on his campaign team added: ""Tory members will not like the sound of Liz Truss boosting welfare - once it goes up, it's hard to take back down. ""It also means the worst off this winter are hardworking families and pensioners on middle incomes, which are Conservative and swing voters. Truss's plan is a gift to Labour."" The former chancellor has said he will cut VAT on energy bills and - writing in the Times on Saturday - said direct government support must be provided to everyone, with a focus on low-income households and pensioners. He has also indicated that, for the most vulnerable household, he would try to make up the difference between the current energy price cap of Â£1,971 a year and the new cap of Â£3,549 by changing things like welfare benefits and pensioners' winter fuel credits. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,,externalBoris Johnson said his successor would deliver a ""huge package"" of support, without saying what that would be. He said the months ahead were going to be ""tough, perhaps very tough"" and energy bills would be ""eye-watering"". In his last week as prime minister, Mr Johnson is expected to give a speech about the future of energy that is likely to serve as a challenge to his successor not to neglect plans to ramp up other energy sources, like offshore wind and nuclear power. Mr Sunak has already indicated his support for boosting insulation and offshore wind. Ms Truss has voiced support for exploring more North Sea oil and gas and fracking, where communities support it. But she has criticised other forms of energy such as solar farms on agricultural land. Middle-earners need help with bills too - Zahawi What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? What can be done to tackle the energy crisis? What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? All households will get the Â£400 rebate on energy bills, with low income and vulnerable households receiving an additional Â£650. Pensioners will also receive Â£300 along with their winter fuel payment in November, and people on an eligible disability benefit will receive an additional Â£150. This video can not be played Worried about energy bills? The BBC's Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four discounts and payments that could help Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government's response to the growing cost-of-living crisis. Labour has said its plan to freeze energy prices this winter - paid in part by a windfall tax on energy companies - would save someone on the minimum wage more than Â£40 a week. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said the energy price cap rise was ""nothing short of a catastrophe for millions"" and SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford warned businesses could ""go to the wall"" over winter. The price cap, set by Ofgem, is rising by 80% in October The price of electricity will rise on average from 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) to 52p and gas will go up from 7p to 15p per kWh A typical annual energy bill paid by direct debit is currently Â£1,971. In October, that will rise to Â£3,549 Prepayment meter customers will pay an extra Â£59 a year from October, taking the new typical bill on a prepayment meter to Â£3,608 TRANSFER TRAGEDY:How did Emiliano Sala end up on that plane?

Pakistan appeals to world for aid amid flood crisis,"This video can not be played Watch: Millions affected by heavy flooding in Pakistan Pakistan is appealing for further international assistance as floods devastate the country, leaving people searching for higher, drier ground. The death toll from the monsoon rains has reached 1,033 - with 119 killed in the last 24 hours, the National Disaster Management Authority says. The US, UK, UAE and others have contributed to a disaster appeal, but more funds are needed, officials say. One man told the BBC his daughter had been swept away by a flooded river. ""She told me: 'Daddy, I'm going to collect leaves for my goat,'"" Muhammad Fareed, who lives in the Kaghan Valley in the northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said. ""She went to the bank of the river and a gush of water followed and took her away."" Muhammad Fareed, whose daughter died in the Kunhar river An aide to Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told the BBC the country was desperate for international support. ""Pakistan has been grappling with economic issues, but now just when we were about to overcome them the monsoon disaster hit,"" Salman Sufi said. Funding from a lot of development projects had been rerouted to the affected people, he added. In pictures: Floods and fear in Pakistan According to reports by the Dawn newspaper, Prime Minister Sharif has announced a grant of 10bn rupees ($45m) for those in the most affected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Every flood-affected family would be given 25,000 rupees ($112), Mr Sharif said, which would be disbursed within a week. Displaced people wait for relief at a flooded area in the Charsadda District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province In the north-west of the country, thousands of people fled their homes after rivers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa burst their banks, causing powerful flash floods. ""The house which we built with years of hard work started sinking in front of our eyes,"" Junaid Khan, 23, told the AFP news agency. ""We sat on the side of the road and watched our dream house sinking."" The province of Sindh in the south-east of the country has also been badly affected,with thousands displaced from their homes. Flood victims queue up outside a bank to receive financial assistance in southern Sindh province Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Sindh There were displaced people in all of the villages we drove through across Sindh. The full scale of the devastation in the province is yet to be fully understood, but on the ground the people describe it as the worst disaster they've survived. Floods are not uncommon in Pakistan but the people here tell us these rains were different. They were more than anything that's ever been seen here. One local official described them as ""floods of biblical proportions"". Near the city of Larkana, thousands of mud homes have sunk under water, and for miles all that's visible is treetops. Where the water level is slightly lower, thatched roofs creep out from underneath the menacing water. The needs of the survivors are varied. In one village we visit, the people sat there are desperate for food. In another they say they've got their grains, but they need money to meet their other needs. We visit one where many children have developed waterborne diseases. A mobile truck pulls over and scores immediately run towards it.  Children carrying other children make their way to the long queue. One 12-year-old girl says she and her baby sister have not eaten in a day. ""No food has come here. But my sister is sick, she has been vomiting, I hope they can help."" Mr Sharif said 33 million people had been hit by the floods - about 15% of the country's population. He said the losses caused by floods this season were comparable to those during the floods of 2010-11, said to be the worst on record. Officials in the country blame climate change for the devastation. But poor local government planning has exacerbated the impact in the past, with buildings often erected in areas prone to seasonal flooding.

Dancing with my nan made TikTok my full time job,"Lewis and his nan agreed that doing TikTok together has made them closer ""The first ever video I did with my Nan on TikTok, I think it's on almost 20 million views now."" During lockdown Lewis Leigh, from Merthyr Tydfil, started posting videos of himself dancing with his family on TikTok. Now, two years after his first post, the 20-year-old has 1.7m followers, and has an agent to represent him. He is one of a growing number of Welsh stars who consider TikTok their full time job. A recent Ofcom report found that young people in Wales spend more time on TikTok than young people in any other part of the UK. They are on the app for more than an hour daily, and 79% of 15-24-year-olds who are online have a TikTok account. From dancing nanas, to short prank videos, what is behind the growing use of the platform in Wales, and why are so many young people quitting their jobs to become TikTok stars? TikTok video of woman harassed gets 2m views Pupils could be excluded for filming videos at school Growing up in a house of dancers, Lewis posted short videos on Facebook of him dancing, which he says his friends loved and thought were really funny. Then when he was in college TikTok became the next big thing, and when his friends encouraged him to give it a go, little did he know his videos would be viewed by millions around the world. This video can not be played Lewis and his nan showed off their dancing skills last year The videos, which take him 10 to 30 minutes to film, often include him dancing with his mum - who used to be a professional dancer - and dad, who did street dance for years. But it's the videos with Phyllis, 77, which have blown up the internet. He said: ""When I first asked her if she wanted to get involved in TikTok, she was like ""yeah whatever Lew"". ""Obviously me and my nan are the TikTok duo that everyone loves."" Social media 'damages teens' mental health' TikTok video of woman harassed gets 2m views Lewis said doing the videos with his nan had made them much closer. Now Lewis, who quit his job in a restaurant after his work started to get in the way with events he needed to attend for social media, has an agent to represent him. He said that even with them taking a percentage of what he earned, it was still worth it. ""Most of my videos are quite family orientated,"" says Lewis Lewis said he believed the popularity of TikTok in Wales was due to people wanting to express themselves. He said: ""Specifically in Wales, maybe younger people find it hard, because obviously there's a lot of villages where everyone knows each other, except for cities like Cardiff and Swansea"". ""I feel like some people may want to use TikTok if they want to express themselves, and aren't comfortable doing it in real life."" This video can not be played WATCH: What is TikTok?

TikTok star and Wales' oldest woman dies at 110 Viral TikTok dances helped me lose 10 stone Catherine said she has seen the platform's popularity boom, which she thinks is partly down to Covid and people spending more time at home during lockdown. She said: ""I don't know if in Wales we've spent more time on TikTok than England because we came out of lockdown later. ""I think TikTok would have done well anyway without Covid, but I think Covid has helped push it that bit further."" Dean Morris holds weekly catch-ups with his fans to check in, and asks users to tag one of their friends that they appreciate Dean Morris, 27, described the TikToks he makes as ""quite geeky humour, mixed with a bit of self-deprecation to make other people laugh"". The Llanelli-based creator has been creating TikToks since 2019, and now has just under 700,000 followers. ""When I first went viral, I loved it, my notifications were popping off. It was a lovely feeling,"" he said. ""You try not to get caught up in numbers but it's a fun feeling when it happens. It's the polar opposite then when the numbers aren't coming in. ""You try not to get sucked in, but you do. You look at the numbers and you're obsessed with it. ""I think my best way of handling it is I just don't look at my notifications because it will mess with my mental health if I do."" Mr Morris, whose TikTok page is called ""dheanasaur"", said he believed the success of TikTok in Wales was due to the Welsh creators' ""fantastic personalities"". ""The Welsh humour and the Welsh way of living is incredible and I genuinely think it's just the personalities of the Welsh people coming through,"" he said. Laura Orgill said she wanted ""to inspire people that they can be themselves no matter what"" through her TikTok Laura Orgill, 28, posts videos of her daily life with her girlfriend at their home in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Ms Orgill got into TikTok during the pandemic and agreed that the popularity of the platform was down to Welsh users' ""unique personalities"", ""and doing everything for the banter"". ""We absolutely love a good laugh and if that includes doing silly TikTok dances we are all for it,"" she said.

"Man dies after entering Thames during arrestThe man, believed to be in his 20s, was not handcuffed at the time, the Metropolitan Police say.London","Officers were flagged down on Kingston Bridge, the Metropolitan Police said A man has died after entering the River Thames while being arrested by police. Officers were flagged down on Kingston Bridge at about 22:30 BST on Friday, the Metropolitan Police said. A ""verbal altercation"" involving a man and a woman known to each other was taking place and an allegation of theft was made, the force added. Officers were in the process of arresting the man, but he had not been placed in handcuffs, when he entered the water, the Met said. The force's Marine Policing Unit, the National Police Air Service, London Fire Brigade and the RNLI were all involved in the search for the man, who was believed to be in his 20s. He was recovered from the water at about 00:30 BST and was treated by paramedics, but was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The man's family had been informed and the force had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), according to the Met. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said: ""My thoughts, and those of the Metropolitan Police Service, are with the friends and family of the man who has sadly lost his life following this incident. ""I fully appreciate the public will be very concerned. We of course share that concern. ""The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards made an immediate referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct as is protocol in any incident in which a person comes to harm following police contact."" The IOPC said its investigators had taken initial accounts from the officers involved. In a statement, an IOPC spokesperson said: ""We have now begun the process of gathering and reviewing evidence, including footage of the interaction between officers and the man.

Next PM will tackle 'eyewatering' bills - Johnson,"Liz Truss would prioritise tax cuts over giving direct payments to every household to help cover the cost of rising energy bills, if she were to become prime minister, a source close to her has told the BBC. Reports suggest Ms Truss is considering cutting VAT across the board by 5%. But her Tory leadership rival Rishi Sunak said the government ""must provide some direct support"" to all. All households are due to receive Â£400 off their energy bills this winter. This was part of a package of help announced by Mr Sunak in May when he was still chancellor. On Friday, energy regulator Ofgem hiked the price cap on household bills by 80%, meaning the typical household gas and electricity bill will rise to Â£3,549 a year from October. Both candidates to succeed Boris Johnson have faced repeated questions about what action they would take. Ms Truss has so far only confirmed she will cut National Insurance and green levies on bills. On Sunday night, a member of Ms Truss's campaign team said: ""Liz has been clear we need to lower the burden of taxation and focus on boosting energy supplies and this will be her priority as prime minister. ""She's also been clear further support may be required to help. Her preference is to target this to those most in need, but isn't ruling anything out."" Earlier on Sunday, a source close to her had said she had ""ruled out"" further direct support for everyone to pay energy bills. It comes as newspaper reports suggest she is ""mulling"" cuts to VAT and increasing the amount of money people have to earn before they start paying income tax. A report in the Sunday Telegraph,externalsuggests she is looking at a ""nuclear"" option to cut VAT by 5%, saying it could save the average household Â£1,300 a year. This video can not be played Watch: Martin Lewis says people are staring into a ""pit of financial doom"" over energy costs Mr Sunak's team has dismissed a cut to all VAT as being ""incredibly regressive"", saying it would cost more than Â£30bn. A source on his campaign team added: ""Tory members will not like the sound of Liz Truss boosting welfare - once it goes up, it's hard to take back down. ""It also means the worst off this winter are hardworking families and pensioners on middle incomes, which are Conservative and swing voters. Truss's plan is a gift to Labour."" The former chancellor has said he will cut VAT on energy bills and - writing in the Times on Saturday - said direct government support must be provided to everyone, with a focus on low-income households and pensioners. He has also indicated that, for the most vulnerable household, he would try to make up the difference between the current energy price cap of Â£1,971 a year and the new cap of Â£3,549 by changing things like welfare benefits and pensioners' winter fuel credits. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,,externalBoris Johnson said his successor would deliver a ""huge package"" of support, without saying what that would be. He said the months ahead were going to be ""tough, perhaps very tough"" and energy bills would be ""eye-watering"". In his last week as prime minister, Mr Johnson is expected to give a speech about the future of energy that is likely to serve as a challenge to his successor not to neglect plans to ramp up other energy sources, like offshore wind and nuclear power. Mr Sunak has already indicated his support for boosting insulation and offshore wind. Ms Truss has voiced support for exploring more North Sea oil and gas and fracking, where communities support it. But she has criticised other forms of energy such as solar farms on agricultural land. Middle-earners need help with bills too - Zahawi What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? What can be done to tackle the energy crisis? What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? All households will get the Â£400 rebate on energy bills, with low income and vulnerable households receiving an additional Â£650. Pensioners will also receive Â£300 along with their winter fuel payment in November, and people on an eligible disability benefit will receive an additional Â£150. This video can not be played Worried about energy bills? The BBC's Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four discounts and payments that could help Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government's response to the growing cost-of-living crisis. Labour has said its plan to freeze energy prices this winter - paid in part by a windfall tax on energy companies - would save someone on the minimum wage more than Â£40 a week. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said the energy price cap rise was ""nothing short of a catastrophe for millions"" and SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford warned businesses could ""go to the wall"" over winter. The price cap, set by Ofgem, is rising by 80% in October The price of electricity will rise on average from 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) to 52p and gas will go up from 7p to 15p per kWh A typical annual energy bill paid by direct debit is currently Â£1,971. In October, that will rise to Â£3,549 Prepayment meter customers will pay an extra Â£59 a year from October, taking the new typical bill on a prepayment meter to Â£3,608 TRANSFER TRAGEDY:How did Emiliano Sala end up on that plane?

Dave raps with fan while making Leeds Festival history,"Dave is the youngest solo headliner of Reading and Leeds Festivals since a Yorkshire site was added in 1999 Dave rapped on stage with a delighted fan while becoming Leeds Festival's youngest headliner on Saturday. ""I feel like I should share this moment with one of you guys for the final time,"" said the 24-year-old Londoner. He then brought out an energetic young Merseysider, Ã  la viral sensation Alex from Glastonbury several years ago, to perform the track Thiago Silva. Earlier, US star Megan Thee Stallion invited ""hot girls"" and ""hot guys"" from the audience up for a dirty dance-off. The Texan hip-hop sensation made history too by becoming the event's first black female co-headliner, as rap music took over from rock and pop. Dave is a born story-teller and clearly now made for the main stage. He arrived wearing a matching green vest top and shorts, with a ""Psycho"" cap on. And backed by a marching band with added strings and brass, situated behind a big metal heart-shaped cage, began to tell his truth. ""It's been a long road,"" he said, displayed in black-and-white on big screens. ""I want to take you guys on a journey."" Stopping only briefly due to a health and safety concern in the crowd, he coolly performed songs from his Mobo Award-winning recent record We're All Alone in this Together, one of the biggest-selling albums of the year, which tackles themes of loneliness, mental health and racism in the UK. As well as material from his Brit Award and Mercury Prize-winning album Psychodrama (hence the cap), which explores issues around grief, domestic abuse and his brother's incarceration. There were good time vibes though, and early in the set he turned Saturday night in west Yorkshire into a Funky Friday, delivering his number one hit. The star took he crowd on an emotinal journey from south London to the Leeds main stage Then came the moment of the night. After his band played a snippet of The White Stripes anthem Seven Nation Army, up came a ""buzzing"" bare-chested young fan who said he had been waiting for seven hours in the hope of being selected. ""You nearly got me up in Newcastle,"" he revealed, excitedly. Then addressing the crowd, added: ""I've been a fan of Dave for so long, I've been to three of his shows, I've been on tour with him... well, notwithhim!"" After going bar for bar with his hero twice, drawing loud cheers, he stopped for a quick selfie video and disappeared off into the night. The limelight then fell back on the headliner, who let fans, old and new, into the secrets of his songwriting process, while switching between the piano and guitar. ""Music is my way of communicating,"" he explained. ""I'm not that good at speaking."" There were camera phones held aloft for as far as the eye could see as he ripped into his Stormzy collaboration Clash. Unlike at Reading, Leeds' sister festival, the night before, there was no cameo from last year's headliner however. Though it didn't really matter, this was Dave's night. ""It's one of the greatest honours in all of our lives,"" he beamed on behalf of himself and his band. Speaking to Radio 1's Newsbeat in December, Dave said headlining a major event like Reading and Leeds would be a completely different challenge and experience to anything he has done before, promising ""the highest quality production value that I can"". It was a promise he very much kept. Marking another big moment for UK grime and rap. Megan Thee Stallion, like Dave, welcomed fans on stage Before Dave there was Megan, who put on a highly sexually-charged HIIT class of a show, which peaked with a rendition of her's and Cardi B's track WAP (which I'm afraid I cannot decode for you here). Her lyrics, filthier than some of the bodies on display that have been on the campsite since Wednesday, gave the brilliant sign language interpreters on the side of the sound stage an unenviable task. ""We here to have a party tonight,"" she announced. ""I hope you all ready."" Twerking throughout in a leather corset and thong, Megan handpicked some ""hotties"" from the crowd - including a woman in a white bikini, another in a cowboy hat and a bloke in Hawaiian shirt - to join her, as one of the main stages was briefly turned into a strip club. ""That's what I'm talking about!"" she yelled, encouragingly, in the direction of her newest dance students, after having warned them not to be shy. It was a warning that was well-heeded by all. Megan, who is currently embroiled in a dispute with her record label, played a career-spanning set that was a joyous sight to behold. Festival organiser Melvin Benn described her booking as ""a good step forward for us"", a nod to the much-needed diversification of the line-up in recent years, reflecting people's changing listening habits in the genre-straddling streaming era. ""Festivals are a reflection of what people are choosing to watch,"" he recently told Music Week. ""As it happens, this year [Friday's co-headliner] Halsey was available and Megan Thee Stallion was available and they both wanted to play. ""Her show is exactly what the Reading and Leeds audience want and I was pleased and surprised that she wanted to do it."" Wolf Alice, who will play at Leeds on Sunday, said last year festival bookers had been playing it safe since Covid, giving preference to heritage acts. And while there is still a long way to go in that regard, Saturday saw an abundance of new talent on display, including PinkPantheress, Griff and Joy Crookes. Little Simz brought great tea-time vibes as the sun began to set Another London rapper/actress Little Simz, who actually features alongside the multi-talented Dave in the cult gang drama Top Boy, set the tone for the evening getting the crowd to put their ""dancing shoes"" on to groove to songs from her critically-acclaimed albums, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert and Grey Area as the sun started to set. After finishing up with the tongue-twisting vocal gymnastics of Venom, she seemed genuinely humbled by the rapturous applause. ""Every time I come to Leeds I have a wonderful time,"" she said. ""I'm so grateful to be here."" She dedicated her penultimate track Woman to all the females in the field, rapping lyrics befitting of the evening ahead: ""All I see is black stars and I love it, yeah / Time's up, tell the people that we coming, yeah, yeah."" Leeds Festival continues on Sunday with performances from Yorkshire rock bands Arctic Monkeys and Bring Me the Horizon, who both performed in Reading on Saturday evening.

Solar panel sales boom as energy bills soarMore people are turning to renewable energy as a way to cut energy costs.Business,"The energy bills crisis has prompted a big rise in demand for solar panels. Just over 3,000 solar installations are being carried out every week, according to trade association Solar Energy UK, up from 1,000 a week in July 2020. One provider said this month it had seenenquiries about solar panels rise tenfold,external. ""More solar panels are being put on British roofs than ever before,"" said Chris Hewett, chief executive of Solar Energy UK. The fact that renewable energy helps protect the planet has always made it an attractive option. The way they work is simple: the panels absorb sunlight through photovoltaic cells which convert it into electricity that can be flowed through your home, or into a battery. The process significantly reduces the amount of electricity you will need from the network. People who have successfully installed solar panels report saving hundreds of pounds on electricity bills. But they are not the answer for everyone, as installing them means an upfront investment of thousands of pounds and you'll need the right type of property. Soaring energy prices, however, have slashed the time taken to recoup your initial costs. 'Lives at risk' without more help on energy bills What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? How high will energy bills go? A decade ago a typical solar panel system cost around Â£20,000 and would take around a decade to cover those set-up costs. But prices for solar panel systems have fallen by more than 60% since then, meaning it takes between four and five years for a system to pay for itself. The price includes installation and the number of panels will depend on how much space you have on a roof. A typical 20sq m roof could hold 12 panels. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests a standard solar panel system costs between Â£9,000 to Â£11,700, while Solar Energy UK lists the cost of a ""typical"" 3.1kWp system for a three-bed house as Â£3,925. What you'll end up paying will depend on the size of the system, the type of panel you choose, the quality of components, the accessibility and state of repair of your roof, and the individual installer, says Which? Why record heat doesn't mean record solar power The price hikes that lie ahead Many houses in the UK are just not designed to cope with a warming climate but homeowners are adapting Not everyone will own a home that can benefit from solar energy, especially if you own a north-facing property, or your home is largely shaded. ""Solar panels are perfect for residential properties with a south, east or west-facing roof, preferably without any shading,"" says Mandip Bhamra, head of renewables at SaveMoneyCutCarbon. ""Depending on how old your house is, you may want to check your roof is structurally sound before fitting the solar panels onto it,"" says Brian Davenport, owner of The Solar Centreâ¯. He says most installers will have access to a structural engineer for calculating the wind-load should a roof show any signs of distress. ""There should also be a small amount of room made available in your loft for the inverter, which is roughly the size of a microwave,"" he adds. If you live in a flat you'd need to discuss the issue of installing solar panels with other residents and the freeholder. ""For a block of flats, most roofing should be fine, and with some flats where there is excess land, these can be placed in the ground too,"" says Mandip Bhamra. The amount of electricity solar panels generate depends on the type and size of system and home. A report for Solar Energy UK suggests that a typical home could cut electricity bills by more than Â£300 a year. Households with electric heating could be more than Â£900 a year better off, the report said, although most UK households remain on gas central heating. If energy bills rise as predicted this winter, then the value of electricity generated through solar panels could almost double, says Kevin Holland, managing director of The Solar Shed, a Norfolk-based renewable energy business. He says a typical solar panel system could generate Â£1,200 worth of electricity in a year at current prices. If energy bills rise by 80% in October plus a further 50% in January, as forecast, then the value of electricity generated by a typical system could climb to around Â£3,240. Also, if you don't actually use all the electricity you generate, you can sell that surplus to an energy firm. Fitting solar panels is a wise move, says Colin Froude Colin Froude installed solar panels on his detached home in Salisbury, Wiltshire 11 years ago. ""I've never regretted it. It paid for itself in about seven or eight years and now my energy bills are just Â£67 a month, a saving of up to Â£80 a month,"" says Colin, who used to be in the Royal Air Force but is now retired. ""Paying that by standing order means I've actually built up a Â£330 credit in recent months so even when bills climb in October I won't increase my standing order as that credit should see me through into the New Year."" He spent Â£18,000 on installing 19 solar panels on his home in 2011 and says that has since generated Â£21,000 worth of electricity. He spent another Â£12,000 installing a battery, new transformer and optimisers fitted to each panel a year ago but says that has improved efficiency enormously. The move paid off. The system generated 1,600kwh in three months this summer. ""I did it to future-proof the house as protection against power cuts but it's rapidly paying for itself."" He cooks with electricity and says the solar panels generate all the hot water the household needs, so in the summer months when the heating is off, he pays nothing for gas. ""Given the rising cost of energy I would recommend solar panels to anyone,"" he says. A great idea... as long as you can't see them? It's a big investment so there are several things to consider. ""Well-chosen solar panel systems can provide a reliable source of renewable electricity for decades, helping to cut your carbon footprint, but buying an inappropriate system could leave you out of pocket,"" says Which? In other words it's important to do thorough research and get a variety of quotes. It is also worth considering that however much you splash out, it may not add an equal value to your home. Ageing, unattractive old solar panels could well put some potential buyers off. ""As long as you can't see them, solar panels are a great idea,"" says Charlie Wells, managing director of estate agency Prime Purchase. ""Estate agents are unlikely to offer a higher valuation if a property already has solar panels installed,"" says Brian Davenport. But some buyers will be attracted by renewable energy and the chance to save cash on energy bills, says Kevin Holland. ""If there are two houses in the street for sale, one has no solar and a Â£4,000 energy bill, the other has solar and a Â£1,500 energy bill, which one are you buying?"" he says.
