MP reveals husband's child porn conviction,"Rachel Carling-Jenkins reported her husband to police An Australian politician has delivered a harrowing speech revealing that her estranged husband was jailed for possessing child abuse images. Rachel Carling-Jenkins, a member of Victoria's state parliament, said she discovered the extensive collection in their family home last year. Her husband was convicted after Dr Carling-Jenkins and her son went to police. She said the discovery had turned her life upside down. ""In this discovery, I personally viewed deeply distressing images which have caused me immediate and ongoing anguish,"" she said. ""My marriage ended instantly and I left home the day I made that discovery and I have not returned to the family home since, except to pick up belongings."" The conservative politician told a sitting of the Victorian upper house on Thursday that she had kept silent on the matter to prevent interfering with police and court proceedings. She had never had suspicions that her husband was addicted to child abuse images. ""I have no regrets as a mother or a wife in reporting and exposing this dreadful crime which occurred within the privacy of my home,"" she said. Dr Carling-Jenkins said her husband had since refused to sign divorce papers and also denied her a property settlement and access to assets. She said she had been financially and mentally abused by her husband, who had been sentenced to prison. She also spoke of the anguish she felt for the young victims. ""The faces of many are etched into my memory for eternity and I pray that the police were able to identify and rescue as many of the poor, helpless, vulnerable victims as possible,"" she said. ""These little girls would not be abused if people like my ex-husband did not provide a market."" Fellow MPs hugged Dr Carling-Jenkins in the chamber after her speech.

PR firm Bell Pottinger 'nearing collapse',"Bell Pottinger's troubles began with a controversial South African campaign Bell Pottinger's Asian unit has said it will separate from its British parent, amid reports the public relations firm is nearing collapse. Bell Pottinger's UK business is expected to go into administration as early as next week, the firm said. The Asian business will begin trading under a new name ""in the coming days"". The PR firm wasexpelled from the industry trade bodyafter being accused of stirring up racial hatred in South Africa. The company's Asian business is seeking to distance itself from the scandal. ""The Asia business is entirely ringfenced and solvent,"" Asia Chief Executive Ang Shih Huei said in a statement sent to clients on Friday seen by the BBC. ""Our teams are intact, we continue to serve our clients and it is entirely business as usual."" Bell Pottinger Asia said it would soon re-launch with a new ownership structure and operate under the name Klareco Communications. Late on Thursday an announcement was made to UK staff saying the firm could go into administration next week, according to the Financial Times and other media outlets. The meeting was attended by a representative of accountants BDO, hired to advise on a potential sale, reports said. However, BDO did not respond to a BBC request for a comment. The company's founder, Lord Bell, who resigned last year, has admitted to the BBC that it is probably ""near the end"". A string of big names have already cut ties with the firm since it was expelled from the Public Relations and Communications Association earlier this week. The company's work on the campaign for Oakbay Capital, a South African company owned by the wealthy Gupta family, was accused of inciting racial hatred. Bell Pottinger and its founder, Lord Bell, have a reputation in the PR industry for taking risks. The firm represented the South African Olympic athlete Oscar Pistoriousafter he was charged with murder. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has used the firm's services, as well as Syria's first lady Asma al-Assad. In the late 1990s the PR firm worked on a campaign to release the former Chilean dictator, General Pinochet,who had been arrested in London,externalon a warrant from Spain requesting his extradition on murder charges. Lord Bell, who founded Bell Pottinger in the 1990s, resigned last year, partly due to his unease with the company's deal with the Guptas. When asked on BBC2's Newsnight this week if he thought the PR company would survive the scandal, he replied: ""I think it is probably getting near the end.""

Crime calculator - what's your risk of being a victim?,"Are you scared of being a victim of crime? Today, for the first time, BBC News, working with the Office for National Statistics, is providing you with a way of understanding your risk of being a victim of crime in England and Wales. If you are interested in Scotland, you can find out more about the Scottish Crime Survey on itsofficial website,external. The tool below uses national crime statistics, your address and your personal characteristics to tell you what's happened to people similar to you in the last year - and therefore something approaching a personal estimate of how likely you are to be a victim. It only takes a moment to fill in, and the BBC does not keep the data, so punch in your details and have a look at the results: Sorry, your browser cannot display this content So were you surprised? Week in, week out, journalists like myself report on the big crime trends across the nation. And you will almost certainly notice the tool tells a different story - a personal one. Now, it's worth pointing out that it has some limitations. The Crime Survey of England and Wales, which provides most of the data in the calculator, captures a wide range of real experiences of crime, but some things are very difficult to measure, such as risky lifestyles and behaviour. Be that as it may, the tool does tell us a lot.  And if you try changing your age - and even your gender - you learn a lot more about how crime affects us depending on who we are and our stage in life. So, for instance, the tool shows that people like me, living in an area like mine, have a very low risk of being a victim of violence. If I were aged between 16 and 29 (sadly those days are gone) and living in the same area, my risk of being assaulted is five times greater. If I were a woman in my 60s, I'd be even less likely to be a victim. Put most simply, young men in areas of higher deprivation are the most likely victims of crime. Old ladies living in the same areas - among those who are most likely to fear crime - have a lower risk. There is a dividend for living in a posher area - but age and gender remain key factors too. Now, there are a lot of nuances in here - and you can drill into theONS's data tables,externalfor the full facts - or read this highlydigestible analysis,externalfrom Victim Support. But many of these differences come down to how we live our lives. Younger people spend more time out at night. They're more likely to come into contact with people who become violent after they have had one too many drinks. How many parents have had to console a teenager who's had their bike or mobile phone stolen? Why nobody seems to know if crime is up or down Homicide and knife crime rates 'up in England and Wales' Theft and assault among children's biggest fears When kids move out of home, start work or become a student, they're likely to be living in cheaper, less-secure, rented accommodation. But as they get older, the security of stable employment leads to security at home and family life. And you're less likely to be burgled if you've sunk into the sofa watching a box set, rather than if you've gone to the pub. Every time a home is renovated, it's harder to break in to than before. Each new car we buy tends to be more secure than its predecessors. But here's the thing. That's not actually how we perceive crime and our personal risk. In fact, what we think is happening can be at complete odds with what is actually going on. According tothe most recent data from the ONS,external, people generally have a pretty good idea about how much crime is close to them. Their perceptions seem to match the reality. But 60% also thought that crime is rising across the country as a whole - even though the long-term trend is down. The people with the highest risk of being a victim - the young - were less likely to be worried than older generations, even though the older you become, the safer things generally become. Dr Jane Wood, a forensic psychologist at the University of Kent, says a range of factors influence this perception gap. Women for instance fear crime because they know they cannot fight off a younger man. But our perceptions are also influenced by what we see around us - and how we hear about. When the ONS asked interviewees to choose from a list of what most influenced their perceptions of national crime levels, people talked about television, radio, newspapers  (tabloid and broadsheet), the internet and word of mouth. And, Dr Wood says, the more we read or watch about crime, the more we think about it. All of which may be an argument for not listening to a word that journalists like me tell you. But while I wait for the hue and cry to drag me from the newsroom, please share a link to the crime risk calculator.

UK increases hurricane relief fund to Â£32m,"The UK territory of the British Virgin Islands is among the areas affected The UK government has increased the relief fund for British overseas territories devastated by Hurricane Irma to Â£32m, Theresa May has said. The announcement - increasing the fund from Â£12m - was made by the prime minister as she said the government had responded ""swiftly"" to the disaster. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the government was doing all it could to help people affected. But Baroness Amos said it was felt the UK ""did not respond"" quickly enough. The former UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs said those in the overseas territories would want an ""urgent and immediate"" response from the UK. ""It's always the people on the ground who respond first. They are looking to their national governments but they are also looking outside for as much help to come as quickly as possible. ""We are now a couple of days in and I think people are feeling Britain did not respond quickly enough given we know that it is hurricane season."" The low-lying British territory of Turks and Caicos is still in the storm's path and evacuations have started. Hurricane Irma has caused widespread destruction across the Caribbean, reducing buildings to rubble and leaving at least 10 people dead. Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said British overseas territory Anguilla received the hurricane's ""full blast"" while the British Virgin Islands would need ""extensive humanitarian assistance"". At least one death has been reported on Anguilla, according to local officials. A third British territory, Montserrat, was ""swiped"" but the damage was not as bad as first thought, Sir Alan said. Deadly Hurricane Irma flattens islands Low-lying islands brace for Irma In pictures: Irma ravages Caribbean Briton Emily Killhoury has lived on Tortola, the main island in the British Virgin Islands, with her husband Michael and their two children, aged nine and 10, for five years. She told the BBC her family bunkered down in a closet when the storm hit. ""Our downstairs doors suddenly blew out which was terrifying. We just stayed hiding,"" she said. ""We eventually emerged at about 7pm to see total devastation. Everybody is shocked but trying to be practical."" Simon Cross, 32, who also lives on Tortola, said it had gone from being a ""lush green tropical island to almost like there's been a fire"". ""There are boats upside down all twisted up. You can see corrugated sheeting littering all of the mountain. ""It's unclear as to how many people are trapped. I can't get hold of any of my friends. ""The island needs additional resources from the UK urgently."" Mrs Killhoury's home was hit by Hurricane Irma Royal Navy ship, the RFA Mounts Bay, is in the region and a second British ship, HMS Ocean, is also being sent, but is not expected to arrive for another two weeks. Speaking after a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee, Sir Michael said the UK's taskforce would help with relief efforts, such as restoring clean water, providing medical assistance and reconstruction work. But Josephine Gumbs-Conner, a barrister from Anguilla, said the UK's preparations for, and response to, the storm had been ""sorely lacking"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK government should have ""done what the French did in St Martin - who made sure that they had military on the ground so that the response given is timely"". International Development Secretary Priti Patel said ""world-leading humanitarian experts"" as well as 200 shelter kits had been sent to the region as part of the UK's response. Significant damage has been reported in the Dutch section of St Martin, known as Sint-Maarten The Queen said she and Prince Philip have been shocked and saddened by reports of the devastation. In a message to the governor-general of Antigua and Barbuda, she said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with all those whose homes and livelihoods have been destroyed or adversely affected by this terrible storm."" Thousands of British tourists are believed to be holidaying in the Caribbean, the travel association Abta said. The Foreign Office had warned Britons to evacuate the area, as the most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade approached. Fears are growing for pregnant Briton Afiya Frank, 27, and her sister Asha Frank, 29, who were preparing for the storm in Barbuda but have not been heard from since Tuesday night. Their aunt, Ruth Bolton, told BBC Radio Suffolk the pair had ""gone completely silent"" since they last messaged on WhatsApp at about 21:00 GMT on Tuesday. She said Afiya had been due to return to Suffolk to give birth. Many expats and tourists have been left stranded as airlines were forced to ground or divert flights. British Airways evacuated 326 passengers from Antigua on Tuesday and has managed to rebook many others across the Caribbean islands on to flights out with alternative airlines. Virgin Atlantic said it had scheduled a relief flight ""loaded with essential items"" to help the recovery effort, including blankets and bottled water, to arrive in Antigua on Thursday. St Barts suffered serious damage to buildings as well as flooding and power cuts Many British tourists staying at resorts in the Dominican Republic, where a hurricane warning is still in place, are being evacuated from coastal areas and moved to temporary shelters. Andrea Fowkes Smith, from Surrey, told the BBC that part of the roof had fallen off the hotel where she was sheltering in Punta Cana. ""We have not been evacuated from our hotel but have just been moved to the steak house as our room was on the third floor,"" she said. ""They say we should all stay on the ground,"" she added. ""It's very strong winds and rain."" Officials in the US have started evacuations of tourists and residents from Florida Keys as the hurricane approaches. Flights to and from several airports in Florida were being suspended, while Orlando's international airport said commercial flights would stop from 17:00 local time on Saturday. A state of emergency has been declared for Florida, Puerto Rico and Cuba. Are you in the region?

Cheers? The priciest pints in the country,"The price difference for a pint of beer is now more than Â£1 across the country London is no longer the most expensive place to buy a pint, a new study says. For the first time, Surrey has overtaken the capital as the most expensive area to buy a drink, with the average pint costing Â£4.40. According to the Good Pub Guide, Herefordshire and Yorkshire have the cheapest pints at Â£3.31. The difference in price for a pint of beer is now more than Â£1 across the country, with the average tipple costing Â£3.60 - up by 13p on 2016. Beer in pubs brewing their own brands was typically Â£3.09 a pint Other cheaper counties where drinkers have a reason to raise a glass include Shropshire at Â£3.33 a pint, Derbyshire at Â£3.36 and Cumbria and Worcestershire, both at Â£3.38. It was bad news for pint-drinkers in Sussex, who pay an average of Â£3.82, while Hertfordshire comes in at Â£3.81 and the Scottish Islands, Â£3.80. However, drinkers in Surrey might not be crying into their beer if they are earning the median full time weekly wage of Â£669.70, as they can more easily absorb the Â£4.40 price of their pint. Beer drinkers in Herefordshire might be paying three quarters as much for their pint at Â£3.31, but their median weekly wage is Â£460 - only two thirds of what people in Surrey can expect to make. This video can not be played The price of beer has changed more than the nation's love of it Blue Dowd, who is the owner of the Basketmakers Arms in Brighton, said the most expensive beer his Sussex pub stocks costs Â£6 per pint. ""It's what's known as a craft beer, and a lot more goes into the making of them,"" he said. ""The people who buy premium beers know they're going to be charged a premium price. They buy it because it's a very fine beer."" Blue Dowd said customers expect to pay higher prices for premium beers Beer in pubs brewing their own brands was typically cheaper at Â£3.09 a pint. The guide also said that increasing numbers of pubs are offering accommodation, food and outside catering services, taking business away from restaurants. Some pubs are also offering delis, book clubs, live music and conferences, it said. Editor Fiona Stapley said: ""You name it and pubs have thought of it.

Hurricane Irma dominates front pages,"Several papers lead on Hurricane Irma.

The Daily Mirror focuses on relief efforts,external- its headline talks of the ""navy's dash to save 185mph storm Brits"". Royal Navy ships, it says, were last night dashing to the Caribbean to help rescue Brits stranded by the killer storm. A picture on the front of theDaily Express shows cars in St Martin,external, smashed about like toys. According to theFinancial Times,external, the prime minister's Brexit strategy has suffered a double blow.

The lead in the Times,externalsays pro-Remain Tory MPs want Theresa May to sack minister Steve Baker and Treasury aide Suella Fernandes, who they claim supported the letter. The Daily Mail hits back,externalat Mr Juncker and chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier for their attacks on Mr Davis. ""Don't treat us with contempt,"" warns the main headline.

The Guardian leads on the report by Labour MP David Lammy,external, commissioned by Downing Street, in which he concludes that black and minority ethnic (BAME) people continue to face bias and overt discrimination in the criminal justice system. It highlights his call for prosecutions against some BAME suspects to be deferred or dropped. The Daily Telegraph believes,external""the Lammy review has good intentions"" but the paper foresees complications.

Commons clash over key Brexit bill,"David Davis has accused Labour of a ""cynical and unprincipled"" bid to block a key piece of Brexit legislation. The Brexit secretary claimed Britons ""will not forgive"" Labour if they try to ""delay or destroy"" the process of leaving the EU. On Thursday MPs began debating the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, which will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK. Labour backs Brexit but says the bill is a ""huge power grab"" by ministers and it will vote against it,  as it stands. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said the bill would ""reduce MPs to spectators"". A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill Davis: Big differences over Brexit bill Brexit: Repeal bill 'not a blank cheque' NI 'to have different Brexit deal' The EU (Withdrawal) Bill overturns the 1972 European Communities Act which took the UK into the then European Economic Community but will also convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones, to ensure there are no gaps in legislation. Mr Davis described it as the next step in the ""historic process"" of honouring the EU referendum decision and argued that it was largely technical in nature and would ensure that ""on the day we leave, businesses know where they stand"". Sir Keir Starmer says it should be called 'the great power grab bill' He urged all parties to work with the government ""in the spirit of collaboration"", rejecting opposition claims that he was attempting to get the power to change laws without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. ""It is only what is necessary for a smooth exit and to provide stability,"" he said. He attacked Labour's position, calling it a ""fundamental misrepresentation of Parliament and our democratic process"" and ""reckless in the extreme"". But Sir Keir said: ""He (Mr Davis) is keen to portray this bill as a technical exercise converting EU law into our law without raising any serious constitutional issues about the role of Parliament. ""Nothing could be further than the truth."" He added: ""It's an unprecedented power grab. Rule by decree is not a mis-description. It's an affront Parliament and accountability."" The European Communities Act passed under Edward Heath will be repealed He said Labour voted for Article 50 Act, triggering the process of Brexit, because it accepted the referendum result. But he claimed the EU (Withdrawal) Bill would hand ""all power and responsibility"" over how Britain left the EU to ministers. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said just six rebels could mean defeat for the bill and ministers privately concede they will have to give some ground. But she said with so much to sort out, the government argues that there is not the time for MPs to pick over every detail, and the bill will allow ministers to make tweaks. Labour argues that it will give the government powers similar to those used by medieval monarchs. It has tabled a series of amendments to the bill and will order its MPs vote against the legislation at second reading on Monday, unless they are accepted. Sir Keir has called for the Withdrawal Bill to spell out that the UK can stay in the EU single market and customs union during the post-Brexit transition period. Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ben Wright The main aim of this legislation is to incorporate, rather than repeal, 40 years of relevant EU law onto the UK statute book. It is intended to ensure there is no legal chaos on the day Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. At the start of its second reading in the Commons, Brexit Secretary David Davis said this ""essential"" bill maximises certainty for businesses and consumers. But unusually, the government is facing a parliamentary battle to clear this early hurdle, with Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish and Welsh Nationalists lined up to oppose the Bill. Their main objection is at what they see as a power grab by ministers who will be able to change some laws without the usual parliamentary scrutiny. Tory MPs sceptical about the government's Brexit will not vote with opposition parties next week. But ministers are braced for an arduous fight as this bill goes through Parliament He has also called for workers' rights and environmental laws to be protected - and has criticised the government for failing to incorporate the EU charter of fundamental rights into domestic law. But some of Jeremy Corbyn's MPs are expected to defy the party's orders to vote against the bill. Pro-Brexit Labour MP Graham Stringer said opposing the Bill would be ""an absolute breach of trust"" with voters. Conservative opponents of a ""hard Brexit"" have indicated they will hold back on any challenge to the Bill until later in its passage through Parliament, although veteran Europhile Ken Clarke hinted he might be prepared to rebel unless he received ""some assurances"". Former attorney general Dominic Grieve described it as an ""astonishing monstrosity"" of a bill and said he would vote against it later on, if it were not improved. The SNP and Lib Dems also plan to vote against the bill after tabling amendments setting out their reasons for opposing it but the government has the support of the Democratic Unionists, with whom they have a Commons pact. Negotiations between the UK and the EU on the terms of exit are on-going, with the European Union publishing its latest set of position papers, including one on the crucial issue of the future of the Irish border, on Thursday.

Workers retiring earlier than in 1950,"Workers are retiring at a younger age now than in 1950, figures show, despite longer life expectancy. Men left the labour market at an average age of 67 in 1950, compared with 65 now, according to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Women typically left at 63 both in 1950 and now, although the current retirees are generally a few months younger. But experts say that we should expect to retire at an increasingly older age as the state pension age is rising. State pension age rise brought forward How to get a pension of Â£20,000 by the time you retire How to be a mum and still get a decent pension The age of retirement has been going up in the last 20 years and this trend is expected to continue. Tom Selby, senior analyst at pension provider AJ Bell, said: ""The rise in average retirement ages is only going to accelerate in the decades to come as the state pension age increases further and the number of people retiring with generous defined benefit entitlements falls away. ""We will also see more people working longer, either full-time or part-time, in order to supplement their retirement income. ""For some this won't be a problem, but for those in more strenuous or physically demanding roles the thought of retiring later will be difficult to stomach. But the stark reality is that, if life expectancy keeps going up, many will be staring a retirement age of 70 or older square in the face."" The government recently announced that the state pension age will rise to 68 for men and women between 2037 and 2039, rather than from 2044 as was originally proposed. The DWP figures simplify a more complex picture, said Nathan Long, senior pension analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Retirement is hugely personal and this data does not show the wide dispersion in ages of people leaving the workforce. There is some clustering to state pension age, but overall there are a wide range of factors that influence when someone stops working,"" he said.

Why is Bulgaria's population falling so fast?,"Bulgaria's current population of about seven million is predicted to be nearer five million by 2050 Bulgaria is projected to have the fastest-shrinking population in the world. It's already lost a fifth of its population since the 1990s. But what does this mean for those who remain? Deep in the Bulgarian countryside, in the western province of Pernik, I make a rare discovery. It's not Stoyan Evtimov's traditional embroidered woollen tunic that makes him unusual. It's the fact he's a thirty-something living in a village. ""All my friends that I grew up with here left long ago,"" he says. Like many young Bulgarians, they moved to towns and cities in search of work. Stoyan considers himself lucky to have employment in the mountain village of Peshtera, leading its folk-singing group and organising an annual music festival in an attempt to revive traditional marriage music, and the village. Even so, he is finding village life unsustainable. Stoyan Evtimov, in his 30s, is resigned to the fact he will have to leave his village ""It's impossible to find someone to marry here in the village, or the villages around, simply because there are no young people. The only chance for me to find someone is in the town,"" he says. ""It would be very sad and hard for me to leave the village, but I will have to do it at some point."" Bulgarian villages have been losing people for decades. When the Communists took power after World War Two, they brought in collective farming and many agricultural workers found work in new factories. After Communism fell, in 1989, and collective farms were broken up, that trend of leaving the countryside for the towns sharpened. And many people don't stop there: they continue their search for work abroad. In 1989, almost nine million people lived in Bulgaria. Now, it is a little over seven million. By 2050, that number is projected to be less than 5.5 million. By the end of the century,it could be close to half what it is now,external. Stefka fears she will have to close her shop This exodus contributes to another factor in Bulgaria's dwindling population numbers - in part because a lot of young adults have left the country, the birth rate is low. The last time a baby was born in the village, recalls shopkeeper Stefka - whose own two sons have moved away to the city - was a decade ago. The little girl and her mother now live in Cyprus, she adds. The vast majority of the people Stefka serves are over the age of 60. The shelves are sparsely stocked, she says, because there aren't many customers, and she worries the shop will have to close. Higher up the mountain, the village shops have already shut, along with schools and bus services. ""This village used to be made up of about 600 people,"" says Boyan, a 70-year-old living in Kalotinsi. ""Now we are 13. Some are in the cemetery, the rest are in towns."" Granny Stanka is now the only person living in her street In the village of Smirov Dol, Stanka Petrova  - Granny Stanka to those who know her - sits under a tree at a bend in the mountain road, patiently waiting for the mobile shop, which serves the area. ""I was born in this village, and I remember the village when it was really full of people. It was such a fun and nice life. Young people, old people,"" she says, explaining that this is the spot where people would come together and enjoy traditional dancing. ""There is no-one in the village, so of course nothing like that can happen now,"" she says. ""In this street, for example, that I came from, in the past there were a lot of people in the houses. Now only I live there."" Abandoned and derelict buildings are a common sight in parts of rural Bulgaria Does she get lonely? ""Of course I'm lonely. It's very hard,"" she says, tearfully. The people in Kalotinsi and surrounding villages buy their groceries from a mobile shop that visits three times a week. The service is run by middle-aged husband-and-wife team Atanas and Lili Borisov. Their unmarked van is well-stocked with everything from bread and yoghurt to cigarettes and beer, and even medicines. In 10 years, they've never missed a delivery, even though in winter the mountain roads are covered in snow. ""Because there are few people, we are friends with all of them, so we're trying to help them with all that we can,"" Lili says. Atanas and Lili's mobile shop visits villages in western Bulgaria three times a week It's obvious they're popular with the people they're serving, but Lili says customer numbers, and profits, are dwindling. In business and personal terms, the mobile shop is at the sharp end of the depopulation of Bulgaria's countryside. ""We start worrying when someone doesn't appear at the normal place we meet them,"" Lili says, ""especially during the winter."" ""We had a case, actually, where we found someone dead."" The government is introducing a number of measures to try to tackle depopulation by increasing the birth rate: offering help with the costs of fertility treatment, giving childcare, and mortgage support. It is also encouraging ethnic Bulgarians who live abroad to return to the country, but no-one else. Bulgaria's Deputy Prime Minister, Valeri Simeonov, rejects the idea of refugees repopulating the country ""Bulgaria doesn't need uneducated refugees,"" says Deputy Prime Minister Valeri Simeonov, a leader of the United Patriots, an anti-immigrant grouping forming part of the coalition government. Nor would Bulgarian society accept educated and skilled migrants, Mr Simeonov says. ""They have a different culture, different religion, even different daily habits,"" he says. ""And thank God Bulgaria so far is one of the most-well defended countries from Europe's immigrant influx."" Mr Simeonov is referring to arazor-wire fence that Bulgaria has been building across its 260km (160 mile) border with Turkeyto discourage immigrants from trying to enter the country. The new razor-wire border fence is a major obstacle for migrants trying to cross from Turkey According to figures from the European Commission,external, Bulgaria had taken in only about 50 of the migrants who arrived in Europe from North Africa and the Middle East between 2015 and July 2017. It is clear that the Bulgarian government does not see immigration as a possible solution to the country's dwindling population. Although the government is full of ideas to boost the number of Bulgarian babies being born, in the countryside the feeling is that politicians talk, but don't act. Before I left the mountains, I bumped into Boyan again, the man living in Kalotinsi, which has shrunk from being a village of 600 people to one of 13. Boyan, 70, believes that people have been abandoned by politicians ""We are abandoned,"" he says. ""Abandoned from everyone - from rulers and from God. ""Politicians will not do anything for us. They're just interested in their own interests. They don't care about the people - especially the old people in the villages. They don't even care about the young people because the young people are abroad. ""So the politicians don't care at all and the Bulgarian state is disappearing.""

Brexiteers' letter adds to pressure on May,"Summer's over and the pushback over Brexit has begun After a summer where Tory supporters of a more gradual Brexit were heartened by statements from ministers, now comes the, probably inevitable, pushback. Aletter leaked to the BBC, signed by dozens of Tory MPs, was scheduled for the pages of a Sunday newspaper, demanding that Theresa May stand firm, and stick to her original plan for Brexit. The letter will be seen as a warning to ministers too, particularly Chancellor Philip Hammond who Eurosceptics see as trying to water down Mrs May's original Brexit plan to leave the single market and customs union. Tory MPs issue Brexit transition warning MPs begin debate on key Brexit bill EU worried by UK's Irish border proposals Businesses warn over immigration plan The letter demands that the government resists any move to keep the UK in the EU ""by stealth"" and is also designed to put pressure on Labour's new position on Brexit, which advocates a more gradual departure. Organisers of the letter say it's designed to be supportive of the prime minister, to bolster her Brexit convictions. But with pressure from Remain sympathisers on one side, this new push from Brexiteers will remind Number 10 in no uncertain terms that the government is under pressure from all sides. You can judge how supportive of the government the letter really is, by reading it yourself: The letter will be seen as a warning to ministers to stick to Mrs May's original Brexit plan ""Dear Sir, Continued membership of the single market, even as part of a transitional arrangement, would quite simply mean EU membership by another name - and we cannot allow our country to be kept in the EU by stealth. The government must respect the will of the British people, and that means leaving the single market at the same time as we leave the EU. Here's why: Continued membership of the 'single market' (the 'Norway option') - thestated goal of the Labour Party,external- would be an historic mistake. The truth is that the 'single market' is a political project, and requires its members to constantly introduce new European Union (EU) laws. Therefore, the longer one remains a member, the harder it is to leave. Contrary to claims that it is a 'sensible' stepping stone to independence, it is in fact a conveyer belt to ever more European integration. What's more, for as long as we remain in the single market, we will have to make payments into the EU budget, and will be unable to take advantage of the freedoms available as a result of leaving the EU - such as the ability to deport foreign criminals. In order to ensure that no-one seeks to use a transition period as means of keeping the UK in the EU by stealth, the government must add the following clauses to any transitional deal: There must be a clearly defined timetable for this country's departure from the single market and customs union. Any deal should also reserve the right for the UK government to unilaterally withdraw from the deal via domestic legislation: we need to be sure that our own government is in charge of the deal - not the EU - and that the deal won't become permanent. We need to make sure the UK is not forced onto a conveyer belt of EU regulation: The European Communities Act 1972 must be repealed, in full, on exit day. Likewise, on exit day, we must ensure we are exempted from Article 3TFEU,external. There can be no Henry VIII laws which automatically add EU/EEA laws onto our statute books, and we must be free to negotiate and sign trade deals during the transition period. Finally, the UK must have the power to take back control of key parts of its immigration system. In short, when we leave in 2019 - we need to make sure we are well and truly out. With these clauses in place, the will of the British people will have been respected, and the country set on a course to make a great success of Brexit.""

"As winter looms, NHS debate warms up","Cooler weather and the first sniff of autumn in the air have been accompanied by the familiar opening salvo of warnings about a difficult winter ahead for the NHS. The body representing hospitals and other trusts in England, NHS Providers, has said that without an emergency cash bailout the service will face unprecedented pressure. At the same time the issue of longer waits for routine surgery has jumped up the political agenda. The government was defeated in the Lords over the failure to meet the 18-week waiting time target in England. So there was plenty to talk about when Theresa May sat down in Downing Street with Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, and Jim Mackey who runs the regulator NHS Improvement. Hospital long waits in England highest since 2008 Long waits for surgery 'have tripled in four years' It was billed as no more than a regular ""situation report"" meeting. Demands for more money from health providers are nothing new and the Prime Minister is known to take a dim view of special pleading in the public sector at a time of financial restraint in Whitehall. As one source put it ""no health secretary over the last decade or more has ever been comfortable ahead of winter with the risk of flu, norovirus and cold weather pushing the system close to the edge"". Recent winters have seen some months when one of those factors has caused problems, but not all three at once. The Department of Health stressed that winter preparations were more extensive than previous years and NHS England said more than 3,000 extra beds would be opened in coming months. There will be a vacuum in the leadership of one part of the service when Jim Mackey leaves his post at NHS Improvement during the autumn. An experienced hospital boss, he knows all about the nuts and bolts of A&E and local social care and how to get the system working effectively in the depths of winter. Mr Mackey is known to believe strongly that more money is urgently needed on the frontline. As he is about to move back to the hospital sector he may have felt the Downing Street meeting was a good opportunity for some straight talking. Simon Stevens, in contrast, is playing a longer game. He will not want to rock the boat too much ahead of the Chancellor's Budget in November and the chance of a higher public spending allocation by the Treasury. The government message conveyed to the NHS leaders is that extra money invested in social care in England will mean councils can get older patients out of hospital more efficiently and so relieve pressure on trusts.  But it's a hope. Making preparations to deal with the winter flow of emergency patients, however, is only one part of the challenge. The waiting list for routine operations has been rising steadily and is now above 4 million in England for the first time in a decade. Simon Stevens has given the nod to hospitalsto sideline for a while the 18-week waiting time target, which has been missed for nearly a year and a half. But that has drawn widespread criticism. The Labour peer Lord Hunt of Kings Heathargued in the House of Lords,externalthat failure to meet the waiting time target was a ""breach of the rights of patients outlined in the NHS Constitution"". He questioned why the government had not instructed NHS England to ensure that the 18-week target was delivered. In reply the health minister Lord O'Shaughnessy said the government remained committed to the waiting time standard. He added that record numbers of people were seen by the NHS, the vast majority within waiting time targets. Lord Hunt's motion was passed by the Lords, inflicting a defeat on the government. Such votes are not binding and defeats for ministers in the Upper Chamber are not unheard of. But this was an important moment in the NHS debate. It demonstrated that hospital performance and the handling of it by the NHS leadership and the government is now under firm scrutiny. The Prime Minister has a lot on her plate with Brexit strategy and the party conference approaching. The Downing Street meeting with NHS chiefs will have given her plenty to think about even before the autumn leaves are falling and the nights drawing in.

Deadly Hurricane Irma flattens islands,"This video can not be played ""It was like a horror movie"" - Residents of Barbuda describe the destruction wrought by Hurricane Irma Hurricane Irma has caused widespread destruction across the Caribbean, reducing buildings to rubble and leaving at least nine people dead. The small island of Barbuda is said to be ""barely habitable"". Officials warn that St Martin is almost destroyed, and the death toll is likely to rise. Irma is a category five hurricane, the highest possible level. It is currently north of the Dominican Republic, heading towards Turks and Caicos. The low-lying Turks and Caicos islands, a British overseas territory, are said to be at risk of a storm surge, with the possibility of destructive waves up to 6m (20ft) higher than usual. Live updates on Irma In pictures: Irma ravages Caribbean Virginia Clerveaux, director of the Turks and Caicos Department of Disaster Management and Emergencies, told the BBC that even inland areas could be inundated. ""We are now trying to remind them [the people of the islands] that this is a category 5, and in the history of the Turks and Caicos islands this is the largest storm we have ever been impacted or threatened by. ""So there is a need to ensure that we have maximum preparations in place... We have been saying to persons to ensure that they are prepared, ensure they can shelter safely, they have sufficient food and drinking water for two to three days."" Meanwhile, the head of the US emergency agency has said that Hurricane Irma will have a ""truly devastating"" impact when it hits southern coastal areas of the United States. This video can not be played The island of Barbuda is ""barely habitable"", says PM Gaston Browne ""The majority of people along the coast have never experienced a major hurricane like this,"" Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) chief Brock Long told CNN. The most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade, Irma has sustained wind speeds of 285km/h (180mph). Hurricane Irma first struck the dual-island nation of Antigua and Barbuda. At least one death, of a child, was reported onBarbuda, where Prime Minister Gaston Browne said about 95% of the buildings had suffered some damage. Irma myths debunked Fears grow for Britons hit by hurricane The areas most at risk ""It's absolute devastation,"" he said after flying over the island, home to some 1,600 people. ""The island is literally under water. In fact, I'm of the view that, as it stands now, Barbuda is barely habitable."" He told the BBC that 50% of the Barbuda population were now homeless and that it would cost $100m (Â£80m) to rebuild the island. However, Antigua, with a population of 80,000, escaped major damage, with no loss of life, he said earlier. St Martin, an island that comprises the French territory of Saint-Martin and the Dutch section Sint-Maarten, suffered terrible damage. French officials have confirmed at least four deaths in Saint-Martin, down from an earlier reported death toll of eight. ""It's an enormous catastrophe - 95% of the island is destroyed,"" top local official Daniel Gibbs said of Saint-Martin. Sint-Maarten's airport, the third largest in the Caribbean, has been seriously damaged. This video can not be played Before and after: Stills and footage show St Martin then and now The Dutch defence ministry said: ""The picture is of many uprooted trees, houses without roofs and pleasure boats on land."" The Dutch navy has sent two ships from nearby Aruba and Curacao to assist locals but they have had trouble docking, according to media in the Netherlands. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: ""The island is not reachable at this point because of the huge damage to the airport and the harbour."" Hurricane Irma: All you need to know How fierce was Irma compared to other storms? French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said efforts were under way to get supplies to Saint-Martin and Saint BarthÃ©lemy. ""There is massive destruction. We'll concentrate our first efforts so that in the next hours people can get access to food and drinking water,"" he told reporters. At least three people had died inPuerto Rico, the governor's office said. The US territory's capital, San Juan, saw waves of up to 30ft. More than 6,000 residents are in shelters, and many more are without power. British overseas territories Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands were also caught in the extreme weather. At least one death has been reported on Anguilla, a local official confirmed. This video can not be played Hurricane Irma heads towards Bahamas One Anguilla resident told the BBC the island looked as if it had been struck by a nuclear bomb, with roofs torn off many of the main buildings, including the hospital. Some residents complained that the UK response was inadequate. British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK had already positioned a landing ship, RFA Mounts Bay, in the disaster zone and its personnel were helping local authorities restore water and sanitation, supply shelter to those made homeless, and offer medical assistance if required. Sir Michael said he had now ordered the deployment of a task group to the region and a second vessel, the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, was being sent. ""Government is working together to support those affected by some of the strongest storms ever seen,"" he said in a statement. ""We know people need help, we have prepared for this and we are putting those plans into action."" US President Donald Trump said he and his aides were monitoring Irma's progress. ""But it looks like it could be something that will be not good,"" he told reporters at the White House. ""Believe me, not good."" Projections suggest it could hit the state of Florida on Sunday. Hurricane Irma: A visual guide How do you calculate the cost of a hurricane? Officials started evacuations of tourists and residents of Florida Keys, a resort archipelago. Flights to and from several airports in Florida were being suspended, while Orlando's international airport said that commercial flights would stop from 17:00 local time on Saturday. A state of emergency had been declared for Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, mobilising federal disaster relief efforts.

Its exact path is as yet unclear but winds are not expected to be as strong. However, it may hit areas already devastated by Irma. Storm Katia, in the Gulf of Mexico, was also upgraded to hurricane status, and a warning was in effect for the coast of the Mexican state of Veracruz. Seeing multiple storms developing in the same area of the Atlantic in close succession is not uncommon at this time of year. Rarer though is the strength of the hurricanes. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in the US as a category four less than two weeks ago. Irma is expected to be at least category four when it arrives in the US. There have never been two category four storms making landfall on the US mainland within the same season, since records began. Are you in the region?

of Hurricane Irma have arrived in 
France and the Netherlands aboard military planes, AFP reports. Some 278 survivors landed in Paris, while another 100 flew into 
Eindhoven which is in the south of the Netherlands, the news agency says. Earlier, French officials said six out of 10 homes on St Martin, an island shared between France and the Netherlands, were now uninhabitable. They said nine people had died and seven were missing in the French territories, while four are known to have died in Dutch Sint Maarten. The Florida Power and Light Company are working to restore power. They have posted a video of crews working on the state's east coast. Earlier on Monday, Florida's State Emergency Response Team said six million homes - 62% of the entire state - were without power.

British territories devastated by hurricane,"The UK territory of the British Virgin Islands is among the areas affected Two British territories in the Caribbean have suffered ""severe"" damage from Hurricane Irma, the UK's Foreign Office has said. Sir Alan Duncan said Anguilla received the hurricane's ""full blast"" while the British Virgin Islands would need ""extensive humanitarian assistance"". At least one death has been reported on Anguilla, according to local officials. The low-lying British territory of Turks and Caicos is still in the storm's path and preparing to be hit. Evacuations have begun, with tropical-force rains expected to begin at around 14:00 local time, or 19:00 BST. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK was sending a task group to the region to help with relief efforts. The RFA Mounts Bay and its crew has arrived in the Caribbean and a second ship, HMS Ocean, is also being sent to the region, Sir Michael said following a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee. Two more helicopters will be sent to the region. Sir Michael said the UK's taskforce would help with relief efforts, such as restoring clean water, providing medical assistance and reconstruction work. The government has pledged Â£12m of disaster relief money. It comes amid some criticism of an ""inadequate"" response by the UK government to the disaster. A third British territory, Montserrat, was ""swiped"" but the damage is not as bad as first thought, Sir Alan said. Deadly Hurricane Irma flattens islands Live updates on Irma In pictures: Irma ravages Caribbean There is widespread destruction across the Caribbean, with buildings reduced to rubble and at least 10 people dead. The small Commonwealth Realm of Barbuda is said to be ""barely habitable"", while officials warn that the French territory of St Martin is almost destroyed. The Queen said she and Prince Philip have been shocked and saddened by reports of the devastation. In a message to the Governor-General of Antigua and Barbuda, she said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with all those whose homes and livelihoods have been destroyed or adversely affected by this terrible storm. ""Please convey my gratitude and good wishes to members of the emergency services and to those who are working on the rescue effort at this very difficult time for you all."" This video can not be played ""It was like a horror movie"" - Residents of Barbuda describe the destruction wrought by Hurricane Irma On Wednesday Sir Richard Branson, who refused to leave his private retreat of Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), said he was ""retreating to a concrete wine cellar"" with his staff as the hurricane approached. His son Sam has since said his father is ""OK"" but there has been ""lots of damage"" to the island. Posting anupdate,externalon Instagram, Mr Branson also said buildings and moorings on the BVI's main islands of Tortola and Jost Van Dyke had been destroyed. On Virgin Gorda - the third largest of the 40 islands and islets - there was no cell, power or wifi coverage, he said. The BVI's largest private island, Peter Island, ""is wrecked"", he added, though people on the island were thought to be safe. Britain's 14 overseas territories are under UK sovereignty and jurisdiction - most are self-governing but they rely on the UK for defence, security and safety - including protection from natural disasters. Josephine Gumbs-Conner, a barrister from Anguilla, claimed the UK's preparations for and response to the storm have been ""sorely lacking"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK government should have ""done what the French did in St Martin - who made sure that they had military on the ground so that the response given is timely"". She said the island's essential services including hospitals and police stations, were now in a ""limping position"", after the hurricane caused ""nuclear bomb devastation"". Significant damage has been reported in the Dutch section of St Martin, known as Sint-Maarten Officials have confirmed several deaths and considerable damage in the French and Dutch territories of Saint-Martin and Saint BarthÃ©lemy, popularly known as St Barts. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he had spoken to the chief minister of Anguilla, while foreign office officials worked through the night to assess and respond to the disaster. Sir Alan said there are four UK aid experts standing ready to co-ordinate relief efforts in the region. He said Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken to her French counterpart and has agreed to co-ordinate closely with the French and Dutch on relief efforts. Thousands of British tourists are believed to be holidaying in the Caribbean, the travel association ABTA said. The UK Foreign Office warned Britons to evacuate the area as the most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade approached, but many expats and tourists were left stranded as airlines were forced to ground or divert flights. Fears are growing for pregnant Briton Afiya Frank, 27, and her sister Asha Frank, 29, who were preparing for the storm in Barbuda but have not been heard from since Tuesday night. Their aunt, Ruth Bolton, told BBC Radio Suffolk the pair had ""gone completely silent"" since they last messaged on WhatsApp at about 21:00 GMT on Tuesday. She said Afiya had been due to return to Suffolk to give birth. Many British tourists staying at resorts in the Dominican Republic, where a hurricane warning is still in place, are being evacuated from coastal areas and moved to temporary shelters. Andrea Fowkes Smith, from Surrey, told the BBC that part of the roof had fallen off the hotel where she is sheltering in Punta Cana. ""We have not been evacuated from our hotel but have just been moved to the steak house as our room was on the third floor,"" she said. ""They say we should all stay on the ground,"" she added. ""It's very strong winds and rain."" St Barts suffered serious damage to buildings as well as flooding and power cuts While the French and the Dutch have permanent military bases in the Caribbean, the British forces are kept at sea ready to respond to UK territories spread out across the region. Meanwhile, British Airways evacuated 326 passengers from Antigua on Tuesday and has managed to rebook many others across the Caribbean islands onto flights out with alternative airlines. Virgin Atlantic said it has scheduled a relief flight ""loaded with essential items"" to help the recovery effort, including blankets and bottled water, to arrive in Antigua on Thursday. Officials in the US have started evacuations of tourists and residents from Florida Keys as the hurricane approaches. Flights to and from several airports in Florida were being suspended, while Orlando's international airport said commercial flights would stop from 17:00 local time on Saturday. A state of emergency had been declared for Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, mobilising federal disaster relief efforts. Are you in the region?

UK 'doing all it can' to help storm victims,"The UK territory of the British Virgin Islands is among the areas affected The UK government has increased the relief fund for British overseas territories devastated by Hurricane Irma to Â£32m, Theresa May has said. The announcement - increasing the fund from Â£12m - was made by the prime minister as she said the government had responded ""swiftly"" to the disaster. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the government was doing all it could to help people affected. But Baroness Amos said it was felt the UK ""did not respond"" quickly enough. The former UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs said those in the overseas territories would want an ""urgent and immediate"" response from the UK. ""It's always the people on the ground who respond first. They are looking to their national governments but they are also looking outside for as much help to come as quickly as possible. ""We are now a couple of days in and I think people are feeling Britain did not respond quickly enough given we know that it is hurricane season."" The low-lying British territory of Turks and Caicos is still in the storm's path and evacuations have started.

She told the BBC her family bunkered down in a closet when the storm hit. ""Our downstairs doors suddenly blew out which was terrifying. We just stayed hiding,"" she said. ""We eventually emerged at about 7pm to see total devastation. Everybody is shocked but trying to be practical."" Simon Cross, 32, who also lives on Tortola, said it had gone from being a ""lush green tropical island to almost like there's been a fire"". ""There are boats upside down all twisted up. You can see corrugated sheeting littering all of the mountain. ""It's unclear as to how many people are trapped. I can't get hold of any of my friends. ""The island needs additional resources from the UK urgently."" Mrs Killhoury's home was hit by Hurricane Irma Royal Navy ship, the RFA Mounts Bay, is in the region and a second British ship, HMS Ocean, is also being sent, but is not expected to arrive for another two weeks.

Why scientists want an outdoor human cadaver lab,"Investigations of murder cases would benefit from the data gathered at a body farm You are dead. Now what? It's the start of a fascinating and eventful - if gory and smelly - journey, at least for your body as it decomposes. Understanding decomposition can hold the key to solving murders, finding missing people and crucially recognising them, and that is why ""body farms"" exist. Body farms are essentially outdoor laboratories where experiments using donated human cadavers investigate taphonomy - the science of decomposition. Worldwide there are several such facilities: one in Australia, the others are in the US. But now UK scientists, including Dr Anna Williams from the University of Huddersfield, are lobbying for one in the UK. This page contains some images a number of readers might find disturbing. At theBritish Science Association's annual Science Festival,externalthis week in Brighton, Dr Williams presented on the importance of body farms to science and why she believes a UK facility is needed. ""Much of what we know about human decomposition was discovered in US body farms,"" she said. Insect clues: The rate at which blowfly pupae grow is dependent on temperature ""We know that the sequence of events in decomposition proceeds along the same path regardless of where the body is, but the timing is very different depending on many factors - moisture, temperature and insects are probably the most important."" But more nuanced factors may also influence decomposition - ""such as bacteria already on, and in, the body; whether the person was obese, had been on antibiotics, was diabetic, or even whether they were a vegetarian or not."" So decomposition is anything but simple. And add in to the mix the fact that the bodies of murder victims can be found on a woodland floor, sealed in a suitcase, buried in a shallow grave, encased in concrete, burnt, dismembered, naked, clothed, wrapped in plastic, and so on. Traumatic injury is also variable: gunshot wound, stabbing, hangingâ¦ the list goes on. Body farm advocates point out the benefits of such facilities, including training dogs to sniff out dead bodies, recognising facial features and ancestry after decay, and even helping to work out how fingerprints change and whether DNA can be recovered after varying intervals of decomposition. But what about the classic detective question on finding a dead body: ""Time of death""? This is much more difficult to pin down than TV dramas would have you believe, especially a few weeks and more after death. Medical examiners often use insect colonisation on the body, but this is notoriously unreliable to apply from place to place as it depends on fickle local weather conditions. Pigs are used in UK experiments, but is their decomposition very different from humans? Exciting new datapublished last year in the journal Plos One,externalsuggests that the succession of bacteria that come and go, feeding on the decaying body, may help scientists to more accurately pinpoint post-mortem interval. This discovery was made by analysing bacteria scraped from the nose and ear canals of decomposing cadavers at the world's first body farm in Tennessee. In the UK, all decomposition experiments use animals - usually pigs. This does have some advantages. Most obviously, rotting animals in our countryside is not as objectionable to people as rotting humans. Indeed, it might be a challenge getting a local community to accept a body farm in its area. The other advantage is that when pigs are used, multiple experiments can be set up where the conditions prior to decomposition can be varied to show different outcomes. This has not been the case with human experiments. As Dr Patrick Randolph-Quinney from the University of Central Lancashire explained, the number of human bodies used in  experiments has rarely exceeded three or four individuals, and this limited number will not catch all of the possible outcomes of decomposition. ""It's little more than anecdotal observation without any real understanding or prediction of underlying processes - you might call it 'anecdata',"" he told BBC News. But, on the flipside, there are big disadvantages to using pigs. Firstly, we really don't know whether pigs decompose similarly to humans, and whether they are a good substitute to use. This is being actively investigated in the newly opened Australian body farm. This video can not be played Australian body farm: More than 500 people have donated their bodies The results are eagerly awaited. But as Dr Williams said in her presentation at the science festival: ""There can be no better substitute for humans in understanding human decomposition"". Dr Williams firmly believes that a UK body farm facility will allow forensic science to flourish in Britain, producing new data on decomposition bespoke to our climate and situation. But she cautioned: ""We need academics to collaborate and share data across the UK, and across the world - that way experiments have the best chance of being rigorous with larger sample sizes."" Dr Randolph-Quinney has a further ambition: ""If we imagine a game of 'fantasy taphonomy', where we had enough money and resources to investigate human decomposition properly, we wouldn't necessarily use outdoor facilities."" ""We might build a grave in the lab, where we could adequately control experimental variables such as temperature, humidity, and recover all the products such as body fluids, DNA, organic gases that a body gives off after death. ""This would allow us to model and predict the underlying processes in a scientific way. We can't do that at present."" Either way human body donations are required. This may not be a big problem: at both US and Australian facilities there is a waiting list of living donors ready, upon death, to give their body to forensic science.
