Venezuela civil war threat 'an invention',"This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa Venezuela's opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ has dismissed warnings from President NicolÃ¡s Maduro the country's political crisis could spark civil war. Mr GuaidÃ³ has declared himself interim president and won support from major powers including the US. Mr Maduro said that whether there was war would depend on the ""madness"" of the US and its allies. But Mr GuaidÃ³ rubbished the suggestion as an ""invention"" of his presidential rival. Who is supporting whom in Venezuela? Why Venezuela's military backs Maduro Pressure grew on Mr Maduro on Monday when more than half of the countries which make up the European Union said they recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim leader. It follows the rejection of of a deadline set by the UK, France, Germany, Spain and others for President Maduro to call new elections. He was sworn in last month for a second term after disputed elections which many opposition leaders did not contest because they were in jail or boycotting them. In response, Mr GuaidÃ³, who is head of Venezuela's National Assembly, said the constitution allowed him to assume power temporarily when the president was deemed illegitimate. Mr GuaidÃ³ was commenting on an interview Mr Maduro gave on Sunday. Asked on Spanish television if the crisis in Venezuela could lead to civil war, Mr Maduro said ""no-one could answer that question with certainty"". ""Everything depends on the level of madness and aggressiveness of the northern empire [the US] and its Western allies. ""We ask that nobody intervenes in our internal affairs... and we prepare ourselves to defend our country."" The US has said military invention remains an ""option"".,external This video can not be played Who is really in charge in Venezuela? But in a speech on Monday, Mr GuaidÃ³ said: ""There is no possibility of a civil war in Venezuela, it is a Maduro invention."" He also accused the Maduro government of trying to move up to $1.2bn (Â£0.9bn) in public funds to Uruguay, but did not offer any evidence. At least 17 EU countries have officially recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president of Venezuela.  Many issued statements urging Mr Maduro to hold new elections. Other EU nations, such as Greece and Ireland, have called for fresh elections but stopped short of recognising Mr GuaidÃ³. Mr Maduro retains powerful allies, most notably China and Russia, who has accused EU countries of interfering in Venezuela's affairs and attempting to ""legitimise usurped power"". The Venezuelan president also retains the crucial support of the army. In his speech Mr GuaidÃ³, who is trying to organise aid deliveries, said the military faced ""an important choice"" when aid arrived at the border. His representatives are to host emergency talks on delivering aid at a conference on 14 February in Washington, AFP reports. Mr Maduro has rejected letting aid into the country, saying it would be a pretext for military intervention. By Gavin Lee, BBC Europe reporter The EU doesn't typically make any decisions on whether or not to recognise a government. What there has been is action from individual member states, a co-ordinated effort by the UK, France, Germany and Spain to persuade all EU countries to take the same position. So far more than half of the 28 member states have declared recognition of Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim leader. Other members are cautious, concerned about setting a precedent of recognising a self-proclaimed leader. Italy's populist coalition government is split, and not likely to back any co-ordinated plan because the leaders of one half of the ruling coalition, the 5 Star Movement, have declared that it's not ""for the EU to tell another nation what to do"". Mr Maduro, who took office in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez, has been condemned for alleged human rights abuses and for his handling of the economy. There are severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food, and an inflation rate that last year saw prices doubling every 19 days on average. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Maduro: Dictator or defender of socialism? Many people have been voting with their feet and leaving Venezuela. According to United Nations figures, three million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 when the economic crisis started to bite.

Bolsonaro in semi-intensive care after op,"The Brazilian leader posted a video of himself in hospital before his operation last week Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro is in semi-intensive care following surgery last week to reverse a colostomy performed after he was stabbed on the campaign trail last year. Doctors had drained an accumulation of liquid in the area where the colostomy bag was removed, his spokesman said. Mr Bolsonaro has no fever or pain but will now not leave hospital before Monday of next week, he added. Mr Bolsonaro took office as the country's new president on 1 January. He has been given antibiotics, and he is continuing to perform breathing and muscle-strengthening exercises in his bedroom, his doctors said in a medical report posted online. Brazil's unlikely president 'A colostomy bag doesn't limit you' Crohn's sufferer: Get your colostomy bag out on holiday The 63-year-old president checked into SÃ£o Paulo's Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein on 27 January in preparation for surgery. He had been expected to make a full recovery, and to leave hospital after 10 days. Earlier on Monday, Mr Bolsonaro posted a video of himself doing physiotherapy exercises in bed.

Customs checks simplified for no-deal Brexit,"Lorries will be able to drive straight off ferries and Channel Tunnel trains without making customs declarations in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government has announced. New guidance for importers and hauliers says firms would file a simplified form online in advance and pay duty later. Hauliers have warned that no-deal could result in long queues at Channel ports. The industry said firms would still not be ready for a ""chaotic"" EU exit - even with these simplified procedures. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March - with or without a deal. Theresa May has said she is ""determined"" to deliver Brexit on time, but a number of cabinet ministers have indicated they would be willing to agree to a short extension to finalise legislation. Brexit: A really simple guide What preparations are being made for a no-deal? Could a no-deal Brexit cause traffic jams? UK to spend Â£800k on Eurotunnel Brexit case Under theHM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) plans,external, what are being called ""transitional simplified procedures"" would be introduced for ferry routes from Europe, and for the Channel Tunnel, for at least a year if the UK leaves without a deal. This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield as part of a no-deal Brexit exercise These would allow an importer to file a very short customs form - a ""simplified frontier declaration"" - only two hours before a lorry is due to cross the Channel by ferry, or one hour via the Channel Tunnel. The truck would then be able to drive straight into the UK without any further paperwork being done at the border. The importer would have to update the computer entry within 24 hours to tell HMRC the goods had arrived, and the duty would be payable as much as a month after the shipment had entered the UK. The temporary system would be reviewed after three months, but is expected to last more than a year. The latest guidance applies only to vehicles entering the UK, but additional customs checks may also be introduced for EU-bound lorries arriving at Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk in the event of no-deal. Charlie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover - home to the UK's busiest Channel port - described the plans as a ""common sense move"". He said he had long argued that ""checks can be done away from the border - so traffic can keep flowing smoothly"". Please upgrade your browser However, Rod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association, said the guidance would not help trucking firms. ""Business is simply not ready for a chaotic no-deal Brexit,"" he said. ""The systems aren't in place, the staff are not trained, there isn't the time in the day for hauliers and businesses to do all the paperwork,"" he told the BBC. Last month, aconvoy of 89 lorries took part in two runsfrom the disused Manston Airport, near Ramsgate in Kent, on a 20-mile route to the Port of Dover as part of an exercise to test plans for border disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

UK to spend Â£800k on Eurotunnel Brexit case,"Seaborne Freight has been given a Â£13.8m contract to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend in the event of a no-deal Brexit The government plans to pay a law firm Â£800,000 for advice in case Eurotunnel decides to sue over the effects of Brexit on its business. The contract description originally said Getlink, previously called Eurotunnel, was ""highly likely"" to go through litigation.

It continued: ""It is highly likely that they would seek to protect their business and profits through litigation against the department."" The contract descriptionwas subsequently changed,externalto say simply that it is to provide ""advice and assistance to DfT on the Cross Channel Rail Services"". Last December, it emerged that the government had awarded contracts worth Â£107m to three companies to provide extra ferry services in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

MMA fighter suspected of murder captured,"Police captured Mr Marks after a nine-hour manhunt A mixed martial arts fighter suspected of two murders had escaped from Texas police, only to be discovered hours later, squatting inside a rubbish bin. Cedric Marks, 44, is accused of killing his ex-girlfriend Jenna Scott and her friend, Michael Swearingin. They were found in a shallow grave last month. Mr Marks escaped from a prison transport vehicle after it stopped at a McDonald's in Conroe, near Houston. He is back in police custody and will face charges in Temple, Texas. Mr Marks was arrested by US Marshals in Michigan last month on suspicion of breaking into Ms Scott's home in Temple, on 21 August, 2018. Murder warrants were also issued for the fighter on Sunday after Ms Scott and Mr Swearingin's bodies were discovered on 15 January,the Associated Press reported,external. He was being transferred to Temple to face these charges on Sunday when he fled. When the prison van, which was transporting two guards and 10 prisoners, stopped at a McDonald's for food, Mr Marks managed to escape on foot, police chief Jeff Christy said. According to KPRC-TV,external, he had been shackled in the van, and police do not yet know how he was able to remove the restraints. After his escape, police warned residents Mr Marks should be ""considered extremely dangerous"" as both a murder suspect and experienced fighter. Following a nine-hour manhunt involving several agencies and canine units, authorities found him hiding in a rubbish bin in the backyard of a nearby home. Mr Marks surrendered without incident, police said, and is back in custody. ""He threw his hands up as far as he could and surrendered. He was worn out,"" Mr Christy said, according to KPRC. ""He was squatting in a 55-gallon (208L) trash can all day, he was pretty tired."" An investigation is under way regarding the incident and will be presented to the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office, Mr Christy said. Mr Marks, who fights under the name Spider-Man, has been involved with MMA for nearly two decades, according toa fighter database,external. He had also worked as a women's self-defence instructor ata boxing club in Killeen, Texas,external. Ms Scott and Mr Swearingin's friends shared photos on social media in a campaign to locate them Just before her disappearance, Mr Marks' former girlfriend Ms Scott had filed for a restraining order against him, alleging he had choked her to the point of unconsciousness twice, but it was denied,KCEN-TV reported,external. Ms Scott had described her ex-boyfriend as a ""pathological liar"" and ""a psychopath"", according to KCEN. The local outlet reported Marks has an extensive criminal history, dating back to his teenage years. Mr Marks is also a person of interest in the missing persons case of April Pease, the mother of one of his children, who vanished in 2009 amid a custody dispute with Mr Marks.

Warwick rape chat students 'won't return',"Two University of Warwick students, who were involved in an online group chat that threatened rape, will not be returning, despite a ban on their attendance being lifted. The pair were barred from the campus for 10 years, but this was reduced to 12 months after they appealed. One of the women targeted had said she felt ""terrified at the prospect of having these boys in my seminars"". Warwick now says the men have confirmed they will not return in September. Last week, students reacted angrily to the news that their bans had been cut, using the hashtag #ShameOnYouWarwick on Twitter. In anupdate published on the university's website,externalon Monday afternoon, Vice Chancellor Stuart Croft said: ""We are committed to ensuring the safety of our community. ""I have today spoken to the two young men concerned and confirm that neither of them will be returning to the university. ""I am continuing to listen to the views of students, staff and all members of our community here at Warwick and support them so that we can learn from this experience."" The update came as one Warwick professor told student newspaper The Boar it would be ""completely untenable"" for them to resume their studies. Responding to the news of the men not returning, one of the women targeted in the Facebook group chat said: ""We still do not know how the men's leaving came about. ""It could simply be that they have decided not to come back amidst public outcry."" Their decision to stay away is ""not a victory for the university,"" she continued, adding: ""A victory will be a complete re-examination of the disciplinary processes which allowed this failure to happen."" 'My disgust at Uni rape chat decision' Rape chat students have bans reduced The chat was first reported last summer byThe Boar,external. Several of those involved encouraged others to rape specific students, while one of the messages said: ""Sometimes it's fun to just go wild and rape 100 girls."" Another said: ""Rape the whole flat to teach them all [a] lesson."" Another post included a racially offensive term and anti-Semitic language. At one point, a user wrote: ""Rape her in the street while everybody watches,"" with another responding it ""wouldn't even be unfair"". Student newspapers obtained the screenshots after complaints were made to the university After a disciplinary investigation by the university, five students were suspended. Two were banned for 10 years, two were excluded for one year, and one was given a lifetime campus ban. This video can not be played A woman discussed in a group chat by Warwick university students says she's terrified two of them will be back In an earlier statement, Prof Christine Ennew, a member of the executive team at Warwick, said the university was clear the behaviour was ""abhorrent and unacceptable"" and it was sorry the decision to reduce the length of the ban had ""upset so many members of our own community and beyond"". She said privacy issues meant they were unable to comment on specific details.

"MP gets two Asian women confused on TwitterConservative Nadine Dorries apologises after being accused of thinking all ""brown"" women look the same.Newsbeat","Faiza Shaheen and Ash Sarkar A Conservative politician, Nadine Dorries, has apologised for mixing up two British Asian women who both work in politics. The MP for Mid Bedfordshire tweeted a video with Ash Sarkar in it - she's a political journalist at Novara Media. The tweet said Ms Sarkar ""may be"" the prospective candidate for Chingford and Woodford Green, but it was actually Faiza Shaheen. Ms Dorries told Radio 1 Newsbeat it was due to the pair's accents. Both women responded to the initial mistake on Twitter. Ms Shaheen accused Ms Dorries of thinking all ""brown women"" look the same. The Tory MP shared and commented on a tweet of a video about the people who support Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. In the video there is a clip of Ms Sarkar but she referred to her as Faiza Shaheen. The tweet has now been deleted from Nadine Dorries' account, but she had shared a video from another account. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It was the accent I was basing the identification on via my phone as I thought I recognised the voice and it sounded like Faiza.""

Hanged girl 'humiliated by stepdad',"Teachers said they were concerned Amber's behaviour could deteriorate if she had to move schools again A girl told her teacher her stepfather forced her to wear ""ridiculous"" trousers to school to humiliate her months before she was found dead, an inquest heard. Amber Peat's body was found in bushes after she went missing in May 2015. Her form tutor Rebecca Beard told the hearing Amber said she had to carry her belongings in a carrier bag as a punishment for bad behaviour. She emailed her concerns to staff at Queen Elizabeth's School. Nottingham Coroner's Court heard Amber had moved to the school in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in July 2014. Ms Beard said she became concerned for Amber's welfare after she came in ""devastated"" while wearing baggy grey jogging bottoms instead of normal school trousers one day in March 2015. ""The other children in the classroom thought that she had actually wet herself, because it was so unusual that someone would be wearing something like that,"" she said. Floral tributes and messages to Amber Peat were left near where her body was found The inquest heard Amber told her teacher she was forced to wear them by her stepfather Daniel Peat, and that she had been punished for bad behaviour over the weekend. Ms Beard said Amber told her she was woken up in the night to finish chores she was told she had not completed, and was not allowed to go to bed until 01:30 after being made to clean the floor for an hour. She said this was ""obviously of concern"", and when Amber later came in with a plastic bag carrying belongings instead of her normal schoolbag, she was told it was another punishment. Ms Beard sent an email on 16 March 2015 to the school's safeguarding staff saying she was concerned Amber was ""being emotionally abused"" at home. The email also highlighted other worries, such as Amber being ""always hungry"", losing weight and wearing school trousers she had outgrown. Amber's body was found in Westfield Lane, about a mile from her home in Bosworth Street Following the email Karen Green, vice principal at Queen Elizabeth's at the time, said she asked Amber's key worker Sharon Clay to contact the Nottinghamshire multi-agency safeguarding hub (MASH). A transcript of the call read in court recorded Ms Clay being advised to contact Amber's mother Kelly about her daughter's account, and if there were any concerns to get back in touch regarding a potential referral. Ms Clay - who told the court she had a good working relationship with both Amber and her family - said she was ""quite uncomfortable"" with contacting Kelly over her daughter's disclosure, and though the mother's account differed from Amber's, she did not get back in touch with MASH.

Backlash over 'single-shaming' banking ad,"Financial technology company Revolut has been accused of ""single-shaming"" after its current promotional campaign sparked a backlash on Twitter. The company, which launched in 2015, bills itself as an alternative to banks and offers app-based current accounts. One ad highlighted the number of people who ordered a takeaway meal for one on Valentine's Day last year. After it was criticised as ""intrusive"" and ""tone-deaf"", Revolut has apologised and said it did not mean to poke fun. Financial commentator Iona Bain, who was among the first people to draw attention to the ads, said it was patronising and unworthy of a firm trying to attract young, tech-savvy customers. ""It doesn't tell you anything about the service,"" she told the BBC. ""It just says they will spy on your spending, so people can laugh at your poor unfortunate single status later on."" Iona Bain is founder of the Young Money Blog Ms Bain, founder ofthe Young Money Blog,external, tweeted that the ad's language was ""more redolent of early 2000s Bridget Jones"" than ""a modern and empowered fintech brand"". ""I knew a lot of people would agree with me, but I have been surprised by the amount of responses,"" she said. She said that those supporting her comments included widows who found such ads unhelpful at this time of year. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""A meal for one, that's a perfectly valid life choice,"" she added. ""It's not their business to be shaming anyone for making that choice."" More importantly, she said, it also played on people's concerns about improper use of their data and whether their financial activity was private. ""It's not just something that triggers a few snowflakes on the London Underground,"" she added. Revolut founder Nikolay Storonsky says his organisation is adding up to 8,000 customers a day Revolut offers a current account service which allows people to make and receive payments, withdraw money from cash machines and transfer money abroad. It was not a bank when it started, but it announced in December that it had been granted an EU banking licence by the European Central Bank. It still aims to acquire a full UK banking licence. It has already attained the status of a tech ""unicorn"" - a term used to describe private start-ups valued at more than $1bn (Â£740m). Revolut's head of global marketing and communications, Chad West, said the offending ad was one of four that had been running and was due to come down anyway. He said that while the other three had been well liked on social media, the fourth one had unfortunately given the impression that the company was ""taking the mickey out of people"". ""We did not pay enough attention to the copy and the tone,"" he said. ""Some people will call that out and we get that."" He said the company promised to learn from the experience and be ""more careful"" in future.

Birmingham braced for new bin strikes,"Unite said workers will stage fresh walkouts for two days a week from later this month Bin workers in Birmingham are to take further strike action after a three-month walkout in 2017 that led to waste piling up in the streets. Up to 300 Unite members have been working to rule since 29 December over a payment given to GMB members who did not take part in previous action. Unite said it was escalating the action, unhappy with Birmingham City Council's response. The council said it was ""extremely disappointed"". John Clancy was forced to resign as leader of the council in the aftermath of the 2017 strike. Unite said its members would now stage walkouts for two days a week from later this month. What caused Birmingham's bin strike? Rubbish piles up again in Birmingham Former council boss criticised over bins Howard Beckett, the union's assistant general secretary, said: ""The council have created this dispute and it is up to the council to resolve this dispute. ""I would say to the people of Birmingham, firstly, I'm sorry that my members have had to take this action, please put yourself in the shoes of my members and please understand why they have had to take this action and please blame the council for it."" A council spokesman said: ""We would urge Unite to continue talks as we want to resolve this matter, so citizens get the refuse collection service they rightly expect and deserve."" Thousands of tonnes of waste were left on Birmingham's streets in 2017 Unite workers initially went on strike in June 2017 in a dispute over job losses. The union claimed restructuring plans threatened jobs, while the council said it would modernise the service and save Â£5m a year. Strike action was suspended in August with the council provisionally agreeing certain posts would not be made redundant but workers continued with the walkout at the beginning of September. The industrial action lasted almost three months and saw thousands of tonnes of rubbish piled up on Birmingham's streets. Residents were urged to take their waste to tips, whilesome volunteers took matters into their own hands and cleared rubbish, saying the city was becoming a ""big skip"". This video can not be played Cat flap locked to stop rodents as bin bags pile up In December, workersvoted overwhelmingly to take industrial actionover claims Unite members had been denied a council payment made to GMB members who did not go on strike in 2017. They agreed on action short of a strike, implementing a work-to-rule from 29 December. On 1 February it wasannounced industrial action by workerswould be ""escalated"" as the union said it had not had a ""satisfactory response"" from the council. The union urged the council to ""drop the pound shop bully boy tactics amid mounting legal costs"", while the authority said it was disappointed its ""reasonable offer"" had been rejected. Could this be a familiar site for Birmingham residents if waste piles up again? Stella Taylor, from Kings Norton, said she sympathised with bin workers, adding: ""If it's true what's happened that the other members of a different union got a payment, well that's not fair. ""I think Birmingham City Council should sort it out because they are always dillying and dallying and after the last bin strike nothing really was changed. I just think it is a complete waste of time for everybody."" Stella Fatta, of Sutton Coldfied, said: ""I am not happy that they haven't been able to resolve this issue because it's a major issue for taxpayers to have to put up with because it's hygiene and you have children walking about, playing in the streets. ""It makes it embarrassing to say you are from Birmingham at the moment."" John and Christina Warner want to see a quick resolution to the dispute John Warner, from the Hall Green area, said it felt like ""the strike hadn't really stopped"" because of the work to rule which had taken place since December. ""We are not very sympathetic [to bin workers] I'm afraid. We do expect them [the bins] to be collected,"" he said. His wife, Christina, added they were lucky to have big wheelie bins but it still led to ""a lot of paper blowing in the wind"". ""We do expect this service, especially in a big city like this,"" she said. Sandra Loutari (right), pictured with her friend Iman, said she wanted to see this action resolved âas soon as possibleâ Sandra Loutari said during the last strike her rubbish was not collected for ""about two months"" and she wanted to see this action resolved ""as soon as possible"". ""We are paying council tax and it's not a small amount. And it has risen as well."" Nav Sadiq, from the Bearded Broz, a volunteer group which helped clear Birmingham's rubbish during the strikes in 2017, said: ""The bin men are not the villains, the real villains are sat in the council. ""I think everyone needs to sit down and come to an amicable agreement."" This video can not be played Birmingham bin strike 2017: 'I'm working next to a bin mountain' Strike dates announced by Unite are scheduled for 19, 22, 27, 28 February and 4, 8, 12, 13, 21, 22 March. The council has said it offered binding arbitration to resolve the row, and talks were held at the conciliation service Acas. It has urged the union to continue talks. A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: ""We utterly refute the allegations made and are extremely disappointed that the reasonable offer we have put forward has been rejected by Unite on behalf of their members.""

Banksy painting shredder 'deactivated',"Museum workers very carefully dismantled the frame The German museum displaying Banksy's painting that partly self-destructed at auction has ""deactivated"" the artwork's shredding device. Love is in the Bin self-shreddedin its frame immediately after selling for Â£860,000 ($1.12m) at Sotheby's auction house in London in October. Banksy then uploaded a videosuggesting the entire canvas was supposed to shred- not just two thirds of it. The museum wanted to prevent the rest of the artwork being destroyed. Henning Schaper, the director of Frieder Burda de Baden-Baden Museum in South West Germany, said they wanted to avoid a visitor setting off the shredder. This video can not be played 'Shed the Love' reveals Banksy stunt did not go to plan ""We have opened the frame, we have all looked and we have seen that the mechanism has been deactivated,"" he said. In front of press and photographers, white-gloved museum workers ""slowly and cautiously"" took apart the canvas on Monday afternoon to deactivate the device, before replacing the painting on the wall. The woman who bought the painting decided to keep it, despite it being partially destroyed. It is now on long-term loan to the Stuttgart museum and currently on display at Frueder Burda de Baden Baden for four weeks. Banksy's video, posted a few weeks after the auction in October, shows the frame, complete with its shredder, being assembled in Banksy's studio. It also shows footage from inside the auction room - including a clip of the button which triggered the shredding being pressed. Allow YouTube content?

Alex Branczik, Sotheby's head of contemporary art in Europe, said that the auction house was not in on the stunt. He said the reason the shredder wasn't detected by Sotheby's staff was that they had been instructed the frame was a key part of the work. Speaking to The Art Newspaper,external, Branczik explained: ""Pest Control [Banksy's authentication board] said very clearly: the frame is integral to the art work. ""Which it was, just not in the sort of way that we thought. ""We also had a third-party conservator look at the work."" Asked how the conservator did not spot the frame's double thickness and apparent weight from the attached shredder, he replied: ""You address what you see, it was more like a sculpture. If it says the frame is integral, you don't rip it apart.""

Fancy a new kitchen? Hire one from Ikea,"Ikea is to start allowing customers to lease rather than buy furniture. A pilot project in Switzerland is looking at hiring out furniture as part of an environmentally-friendly policy by the Swedish flat-pack company. It said it was looking at ways for customers to ""buy, care for and pass on products"". It has already introduced programmes designed to reduce waste, such as services to take back old beds or sofas which it then donates to charity. Kate Hardcastle, retail analyst at Insight With Passion, told the BBC it marked a ""pendulum shift"" for a company which focused on cheap and cheerful furniture but was now trying to take a more sustainable approach to business. Kitchens and office chairs are among the items that could be offered for hire, according to the Financial Times. Torbjorn Loof, chief executive of Inter Ikea, told the FT: ""We will work together with partners so you can actually lease your furniture. When that leasing period is over, you hand it back and might lease something else. ""And instead of throwing those away, we refurbish them a little and we could sell them, prolonging the lifecycle of the product"". Inter Ikea controls the brand rights of the company, which was created in 1943 and is named afterits late founder Ingvar Kamprad(IK) as well as the farm he grew up on - Elmtaryd (E) - and the nearby village Agunnaryd (A). The leasing plan is the first in a series of ideas which could lead to customers subscribing for services with a view to items being refurbished rather than thrown out. While office furniture such as desks and chairs are expected to be the first items to be included in the trials, and targeted at businesses, leases on kitchens are also a possibility. Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad dies in Sweden at 91 ""It's interesting if you as a customer say 'I can change and adapt and modernise my kitchen if that's a subscription model,"" Mr Loof told the FT. An Ikea spokesperson said the business was aiming to encourage ""people to play an active role in making the circular economy a reality, which we can support by developing new ways for people to buy, care for and pass on products."". ""In certain markets, such as Switzerland, we're exploring and testing potential solutions and have a pilot project to look into the leasing of furniture, but it's still too early to confirm exactly what this will look like,"" the spokesperson said. As well as a service to return old furniture, in the UK it offers a service to take back unwanted textiles and, at its new store in London opening on Thursday, it will have its first Learning Lab to examine ways to extend the lifecycle of products. The chain has started to make other adaptations to its model - which was traditionally focused on out-of-town stores by trying new formats.  It opened a small format ""planning Studio"" on London's Tottenham Court Road last year and has said the format could be rolled out more widely.

MP gets two Asian women confused on Twitter,"Faiza Shaheen and Ash Sarkar A Conservative politician, Nadine Dorries, has apologised for mixing up two British Asian women who both work in politics. The MP for Mid Bedfordshire tweeted a video with Ash Sarkar in it - she's a political journalist at Novara Media. The tweet said Ms Sarkar ""may be"" the prospective candidate for Chingford and Woodford Green, but it was actually Faiza Shaheen. Ms Dorries told Radio 1 Newsbeat it was due to the pair's accents. Both women responded to the initial mistake on Twitter. Ms Shaheen accused Ms Dorries of thinking all ""brown women"" look the same. The Tory MP shared and commented on a tweet of a video about the people who support Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. In the video there is a clip of Ms Sarkar but she referred to her as Faiza Shaheen. The tweet has now been deleted from Nadine Dorries' account, but she had shared a video from another account. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It was the accent I was basing the identification on via my phone as I thought I recognised the voice and it sounded like Faiza.""

EU powers recognise GuaidÃÂ³ as Venezuela leader,"This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa The UK, France, Germany, Spain and other European countries have officially recognised opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as interim president of Venezuela.

Russia - a backer of Mr Maduro - accused EU countries of meddling in Venezuela's affairs. Who is supporting whom in Venezuela? Why Venezuela's military backs Maduro On Sunday Mr Maduro dismissed calls for a new presidential vote, saying he would not accept ""ultimatums"". He has denounced Mr GuaidÃ³'s move as a coup. As head of Venezuela's National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ says the constitution allows him to assume power temporarily when the president is deemed illegitimate. After Sunday's deadline passed, a flurry of statements was issued by France, the UK, Germany and Spain and the other countries that now recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president.

Russia has attacked Monday's statements, accusing EU countries of interfering in Venezuela's affairs and attempting to ""legitimise usurped power"". By Gavin Lee, BBC Europe reporter The EU doesn't typically make any decisions on whether or not to recognise a government. What there has been is action from individual member states, a co-ordinated effort by the UK, France, Germany and Spain to persuade all EU countries to take the same position. So far more than half of the 28 member states have declared recognition of Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim leader. Other members are cautious, concerned about setting a precedent of recognising a self-proclaimed leader. Italy's populist coalition government is split, and not likely to back any co-ordinated plan because the leaders of one half of the ruling coalition, the 5 Star Movement, have declared that it's not ""for the EU to tell another nation what to do"".

MPs meeting over backstop alternatives,"Tory MPs Iain Duncan Smith, Nicky Morgan and Steve Baker are all in the meeting at the Cabinet Office Tory MPs have met the government to discuss alternative arrangements to the proposed Irish border ""backstop"", as three days of talks begin. The Alternative Arrangements Working Group, with Leave and Remain MPs, met for the first time after the Commons voted to find another way of avoiding the return of Irish border checks. A government spokesman said the talks had been ""detailed and constructive"". But EU leaders have continued to rule out making changes to the backstop. The Irish PM Leo Varadkar told RTE radio the UK was reviewing ideas that had ""already been rejected"", and it was ""very frustrating"" that the UK government was ""going back to the idea of technology"". Brexit: A really simple guide Katya Adler: EU digs heels in over Brexit deal How ready is UK for a no-deal Brexit? Brexit: All you need to know Is Labour softening on freedom of movement? But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU would listen to proposals to solve the Irish border ""riddle"", although they needed to hear how the UK wanted to do it. The backstop is an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit. Number 10 said the working group of Conservative MPs was set up following ""significant support"" for the so-called ""Malthouse Compromise"" - named after housing minister Kit Malthouse who encouraged talks between different groups of MPs. Engineered by both Leavers and Remainers, the proposal includes extending the transition period for a year until the end of 2021 and protecting EU citizens' rights, instead of using the backstop. Please upgrade your browser Members of the working group include Conservative MPs Steve Baker, Marcus Fysh, Owen Paterson, Damian Green and Nicky Morgan. The group will hold regular meetings with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, as well as senior government officials from HMRC, Cabinet Office Europe Unit and Number 10. Mr Fysh said the group had spoken to the EU and it was ""very open"" to the proposals, adding that they were not based on new technology. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said the group had explored the proposal ""in detail"" on the first day of talks. The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said the government's willingness to provide civil service support to this group of Conservative MPs was an indication of how seriously Downing Street was treating their idea. The backstop insurance policy would kick in if, after almost two years after Brexit, the two sides had not reached a trade agreement with one another that avoided the need for physical border checks. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU and leave Northern Ireland effectively in the EU's single market for goods. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Critics fear the UK could be ""trapped"" in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals on goods with the rest of the world. Unionists also fear it would drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But by changing the backstop, the PM could win support. Ex-Northern Ireland first minister Lord Trimble has said he is planning to take the government to court over the Brexit deal, claiming the Northern Ireland protocol - which includes the backstop - breaches the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Mrs May will visit Northern Ireland on Tuesday to deliver a speech on Brexit and meet business leaders. What are the new ideas for the Irish backstop? Read more: Could technology solve the Irish border problem? Alternatives to the backstop that the prime minister has said she wants to discuss with EU leaders include: a ""trusted trader"" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border ""mutual recognition"" of rules with the EU ""technological"" solutions This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Alternative Brexit backstop ""can be done"" Mr Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that an alternative arrangement to the Irish backstop ""can be done"" using ""existing technology"". He said the attorney general was ""leading on another strand of work"" - looking at whether a ""hard time limit or proper exit mechanism"" was possible. UK 'still safe in no-deal Brexit' - Javid Sheep farmers' post-Brexit tariff fears Customs checks simplified for no-deal Brexit The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, when the two-year time limit on withdrawal negotiations enforced by the Article 50 process expires. Theresa May has said she is ""determined"" to deliver Brexit on time, but a number of cabinet ministers have indicated they would be willing to agree to a short extension to finalise legislation for Brexit. However, a plan to delay Brexit for up to nine months to prevent a no deal - put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper - was voted down by Parliament. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Kier Starmer said he could not see Mrs May negotiating an alternative to the backstop at this late stage, saying the prime minister had effectively ""run down the clock"". Meanwhile, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said contingency plans for Britain's departure from the EU with no deal were ""genuinely astonishing"",in a speech in the US. She warned of food shortages and stockpiling of medicine amid a ""real and growing risk"" of a no deal scenario. Numerous politicians have shut down the idea of looking at the backstop again, saying there was no desire to re-open negotiations on the withdrawal agreement in Brussels. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the EU was not looking for a substitute solution, because they say they've already investigated every other option that exists and none has the same effect as the backstop. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there was ""full agreement"" that the withdrawal agreement ""cannot be reopened"". Allow Twitter content?

Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said the withdrawal agreement rejected by MPs already allowed the EU and UK to work on alternative arrangements for the backstop. He added: ""What Ireland is being asked to do by some in Westminster is to essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK government and EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking and I think that's a very unreasonable request to ask the Irish government to be flexible on."" Speaking during a trip to Japan, German Chancellor Mrs Merkel said: ""To solve this riddle, you have to be creative and you have to listen to one another. ""We can have those conversations... But we must hear from Great Britain how they want to do it."" Labour's Hilary Benn met the Secretary General of the European Commission, Martin Selmayr, in Brussels. Speaking after Monday's meeting, Mr Benn - who chairs the Brexit select committee - said the EU would be prepared to consider an additional legal protocol to the withdrawal agreement if they were convinced it would help a deal get through Parliament. But Mr Selmayr later tweeted,externalthat when asked if such an assurance would help, the response from MPs was ""inconclusive"". He added: ""The meeting confirmed that the EU did well to start its no deal preparations in December 2017."" Leave supporter and Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns - who was also at the meeting - tweeted afterwards that Mr Selmayr revealed the EU had not been asked to remove the backstop or re-open negotiations by the British government.

By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor So. how open does the EU seem almost a week on from parliament narrowly voting in favour of an amendment to find alternatives to the backstop guarantee to keep the Irish border open after Brexit? After all, with every passing day as we've heard, again and again and again, the clock is ticking towards an increased chance of a no-deal Brexit with all the costs and chaos that could involve. Well, if I were to speak in weather forecast terms, I might describe current EU attitudes as frosty with a chance of ice. If Theresa May comes to Brussels later this week, she will be received politely and listened to attentively. But if her EU ask remains centred around getting a time limit to, or allowing the UK a unilateral get-out mechanism from, the Irish border backstop or if she pushes again for pure technology as a means of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, then the likelihood of her being sent home empty-handed - or as good as - is very high indeed.

Fake Xanax deaths an 'escalating crisis',"The US-style bar-shaped version of the drug is the form that is most commonly traded among teenagers - like this group, there are many counterfeit versions The coroner for Northern Ireland has called the rising number of deaths linked to fake versions of the anti-anxiety drug, Xanax, ""an escalating crisis"". Joe McCrisken says he is signing off an alprazolam-related death nearly once a week. He says ""most of the deaths"" are caused by counterfeit versions of Xanax, the brand name for the drug alprazolam. ""The deaths are a very tiny tip of what is a very huge iceberg,"" he says. Xanax is used to treat anxiety and panic attacks. It is not available on the NHS. It is a powerful tranquiliser. But it can be obtained on private prescription in the UK, is widely prescribed in the US, and counterfeit versions circulate on the black market. Last year, the BBC foundthat children as young as 11were being treated by ambulance services after taking fake versions of it. Xanax: Treatment for addiction rises sharply in children Fake Xanax: The UK's largest ever dark net drugs bust Mr McCrisken said the number of deaths linked to alprazolam in Northern Ireland had risen from one in 2015, to 26 in 2017. ""In 2018, it's looking like that might double to somewhere around 50 provisionally. ""That's an indication of not an emerging crisis, but an escalating crisis. It's a very real public health concern."" Paul, 20, started taking counterfeit Xanax from the age of 17 after being introduced to it by a friend. He said he initially took it to help with his anxiety. ""It made me feel happy. It made me feel like a different person, as if all your problems have gone, it made you feel like you needed it. But at the same time like you didn't really need it. But that's when all the bad stuff started happening. ""My head was away. I started fighting with my family, I tried to stab my mum, I was going to stab my dad, getting into fights, getting into debt."" Paul admitted to taking other drugs - but said fake Xanax had the worst effect on him as he had no idea whether it had been cut with other substances. Counterfeit Xanax ""It's made me psychotic and stuff and made me not be able to control my anger. ""People nowadays are just playing Russian roulette with tablets, they're just trying to see what the next hit is. ""But it's not worth it. Too many young people are dying from the fake stuff going about."" Paul says he is exceptionally lucky to still be alive, considering his abuse of the tranquiliser and other drugs. ""One night I took 56 of them. That was on a Friday. And I didn't wake up until the Sunday. That's when I went round to my Mum's and smashed her TV, then had her pinned up against the car. I didn't know what I was doing. ""I didn't think I would make it to the age of 20 because of the stuff I was doing. They make you suicidal. Paul says he would buy fake versions of Xanax ""bars"" to feed his addiction ""Even after I am off it, I still have to deal with the voices in my head. I have to still deal with all the mental health problems."" Paul said dealers would offer the drug to passers-by on the street. ""It's silly because you'll have 13-year-old kids running about trying to sell you the drug on the street corners."" Paul underwent a residential rehab treatment and has been clean for just under a year. Mr McCrisken said when he started the job three years ago, he had never heard of counterfeit Xanax. ""The alprazolam powder is being obtained from the Far East, I was told in one inquest, and then pressed in the UK and sold on the dark web."" Because Xanax is not available on the NHS in the UK, Mr McCrisken believes almost all the deaths linked to the drug in Northern Ireland are from counterfeit versions. ""We can't underplay this; it's hugely concerning. The sheer escalation of deaths, involving alprazolam as well as other drugs, but particularly that one, as a coroner, concerns me. ""This is one that seems to have emerged out of nowhere, really, and it's escalated to a degree where it should be concerning everybody."" He added that the problem was UK-wide. Figures from Scotland showed a four-fold increase in deaths related to alprazolam from 24 in 2016 to 99 in 2017. In 2018, Public Health Wales reportedthat counterfeit Xanax was among the ""most commonly identified"" classes of psychoactive substances,externalanalysed by the Welsh Emerging Drugs and Identification of Novel Substances Project's (WEDINOS) drug testing service. Peter Burkinshaw is the drug and alcohol lead for Public Health England. ""We've got no evidence that there is a very widespread epidemic of its use, but we're certainly clear that its use is increasing,"" he said. ""And we can see it in various data sets, we can see it in police seizures data, we can see it in hospital admissions data and we can see it amongst young people coming into treatment centres for help."" Dr Michael McKenna is concerned about fake Xanax misuse among his patients In December, Public Health England released figures showing the number of young people being treated for addiction to benzodiazepine drugs like alprazolam. The report showed thatalprazolam had the biggest increase,externalin young people seeking help for addiction. Dr Michael McKenna, a GP at Falls surgery in Belfast, said counterfeit Xanax has become a particular problem among his patients over the last six months. He is mainly treating teenagers and people in their early 20s. ""We had a number of drug deaths over the Christmas period and I've heard Xanax being mentioned as one of the drugs that has been taken. ""We'll know when the post-mortem findings come out.""

Neeson sparks race row over rape comments,"Actor Liam Neeson is facing a major racism storm after admitting he once set out to kill an innocent black man. He said he walked the streets with a weapon for a week years ago, hoping to take out his anger after someone close to him was raped by a black man. The Hollywood star said he was ashamed of his actions, but his remarks have sparked widespread outrage. Neeson hasn't commented further since the interview was published byThe Independent,externalon Monday. He was speaking to promote his new film Cold Pursuit, a thriller about a man who seeks retribution after his son is murdered. 'I'm not racist,' says Liam Neeson Asked how his character turns to anger, the actor replied that ""something primal"" kicks in when a someone close to you is the victim of violence. This video can not be played Listen to Liam Neeson's comments that sparked the outrage He said: ""God forbid you've ever had a member of your family hurt under criminal conditions. I'll tell you a story. This is true."" Neeson said the alleged rape took place a long time ago and he found out about it when he came back from a trip abroad. The actor went on to use racially offensive language about the attacker. He said: ""She handled the situation of the rape in the most extraordinary way. ""But my immediate reaction was... I asked, did she know who it was? No. What colour were they? She said it was a black person. ""I went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I'd be approached by somebody - I'm ashamed to say that - and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some [uses air quotes with fingers] 'black bastard' would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him."" Neeson has been subject to huge criticism for the comments. This video can not be played Clemence Michallon, who interviewed Liam Neeson, says she was struck by the ""gravity"" of his thoughts The journalist who did the interview, ClÃ©mence Michallon, told BBC News: ""Anyone hearing the thoughts that he's reporting here would be shocked and appalled in many ways, and he himself says he is ashamed to think of the way he used to think and says it's awful, so of course that shock set in really quickly."" Inan accompanying article in The Independent,external, columnist Kuba Shand-Baptiste wrote: ""What immediately struck me when reading about his revelation was how deeply the white supremacist trope of the 'black brute' versus the 'helpless woman' appears to have permeated society."" Neeson alongside Tom Bateman in Cold Pursuit Los Angeles Times columnist Carla Hall wrote,externalthat his conduct was ""despicable"", adding that she now wants him to talk about whether he has dealt with ""whatever racism he still harbours"". She wrote: ""Was he a racist or just a tightly wound man capable of vindictive violence? Or was he both? Of course, he was a racist. He was roaming the streets trying to find a random black man to kill. ""And he gave every indication of being capable of violence. That's a pretty explosive combination. And his revelation about himself is deeply disturbing. The question is, how much has he changed since then?"" On Twitter, Frederick Joseph, who works for better representation in the media, wrote that Neeson's story ""just shows how meaningless and inconsequential black lives are to some"".

The 66-year-old, who is best known for Schindler's List and the thriller series Taken, also described growing up around violence in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, during the Troubles. ""I knew a couple of guys that died on hunger strike, and I had acquaintances who were very caught up in the Troubles, and I understand that need for revenge, but it just leads to more revenge, to more killing and more killing, and Northern Ireland's proof of that.

Banned airline leaves thousands strandedTurkmenistan Airlines has been grounded after Europe's air regulator suspended permission for it to fly.,"Thousands of passengers have been left stranded after air regulators grounded Turkmenistan Airlines for safety reasons. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority said flights from Birmingham and London's Heathrow to Amritsar, and Heathrow to New Delhi - which fly via Ashgabat, Turkmenistan - had been suspended. The CAA acted after the European Aviation Safety Agency suspended permission for it to fly in the EU. It also flies from Frankfurt and Paris. Set up in 1992 by the former Soviet Union state, its route to Amritsar is popular with the British Punjabi population. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said the European Aviation Safety Agency  had suspended the airline's flights to and from the EU ""pending confirmation that it meets international air safety standards"". ""This means that Turkmenistan Airlines flights between the UK (London Heathrow and Birmingham) and Turkmenistan (Ashgabat), do not have permission to travel to and from the UK,"" the FCO said. Affected passengers are advised to contact Turkmenistan Airlines to seek advice, the FCO said. The budget airline also offers flights from Birmingham and London Heathrow - via Asghabat - to various other locations such as Bangkok and Beijing. The CAA said: ""Passengers who have travelled may need to make their own arrangements to return home"". It lists Air India, British Airways, Jet Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Turkish Airlines as potentially offering alternative routes. Those who have booked but are now unable to fly will have to contact the airline for a refund. ""Passengers who booked directly with the company via either a credit, charge or debit card may alternatively be able to make a claim against their card provider,"" the CAA said. Those who booked through an airline ticket agent, should speak to the agent in the first instance, the CAA said. The was no obvious information on the company's website which also appeared to be allowing new bookings still to be made. Passengers seeking a refund for unused tickets are being advised to contact the airline directly If you've paid by credit card for your flight, and paid more than Â£100, you may be able to claim compensation from your credit card firm under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. If you've paid by debit card, and paid more than Â£100, you could try to contact your bank and ask about ""chargeback"". However, to get this form of compensation, your bank would need to claw back your money from the airline directly. If you booked through a travel agent which is ATOL-protected, you may be able to claim compensation via your travel agent.

Earpieces used to cheat citizenship testA BBC researcher was given a hidden earpiece through which they could receive the answers.London,"This video can not be played The test is required as part of the process to secure UK citizenship Gangs are helping foreign nationals cheat their UK citizenship application test with the use of earpieces, a BBC investigation has revealed. For a fee of up to Â£2,000, criminals secretly listen in and, via a hidden earpiece, give the answers to those taking theLife in the UK test,external. Such an operation was secretly filmed by a BBC journalist, who was given help to pass. The test is failed by about one in five would-be British citizens. The Home Office said it took any cheating ""extremely seriously"". A pass in the test, which assesses candidates' knowledge of UK laws, history and society, is usually required as part of the process to secure UK citizenship or indefinite leave to remain. The number of applications for citizenship made by EU nationals rose by 32% last year and the BBC heard some were paying criminals to cheat the Life in the UK test, as anxiety grows over citizenship rights post-Brexit. One woman, an EU national, told the BBC she decided to cheat after failing first time around, saying she ""felt so much panic"" about her situation. The gang provided an undercover researcher with a hidden two-way earpiece, linked wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection to a concealed mobile phone with an open line Over the past year, nearly 150,000 people have sat the test, which consists of 24 multiple-choice questions. The test, which is taken on a computer and has a pass mark of at least 18 correct answers, is supposed to be held under strict exam conditions. Administration of the tests is outsourced by the government. There are 36 testing centres in the UK. Can you pass the UK citizenship test? Hull-born woman 'facing citizenship test' Call to drop trivia from citizenship test BBC researchers were able to access organised cheating when they went undercover at training academies in and around London, where candidates take classes to prepare for the test. Masoud Abul Raza runs the Ideal Learning Academy in east London. Masoud Abul Raza has denied cheating, despite being caught on camera He was filmed telling an undercover researcher that he could guarantee a pass. ""You have to spend nearly Â£2,000. This is the business, it's completely hidden. But you are getting a result,"" he said. Mr Abul Raza and his gang later provided the undercover researcher with a hidden two-way earpiece, linked wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection to a concealed mobile phone with an open line. This meant the gang outside could hear the audio feed of the test questions and provide the answers. ""Everything will be arranged. He will give you the answer,"" Mr Abul Raza told the undercover journalist. Tony Smith, the former director general of the UK Border Force, was shown the secretly recorded footage and described it as ""clear and blatant cheating by an organised crime gang"". ""One would hope that the standards will change significantly so that the public can be assured that people going through this process are genuinely entitled to stay in this country,"" he said. The BBC researcher received a pass certificate after being given the correct answers The Home Office said test centres were required to put in place stringent measures to prevent cheating, including searches of candidates to ensure no electronic devices enter the test room. ""Unannounced visits"" are also carried out to audit these processes. But the BBC's undercover researcher was not searched or told to hand over all electronic devices. He sat the test, giving the answers provided to him, and within minutes of it ending he had received the pass certificate required to apply for citizenship and a UK passport. Despite being caught on camera, Mr Abul Raza denied cheating, maintaining he only organises legitimate training. When confronted, Mr Abul Raza told the BBC he only organised legitimate training However, he is not the only one profiting from cheating the system. The BBC heard reports of other training academies doing the same thing, with the same method of cheating having been used at testing centres around the UK. At the English Language Training Academy (ELTA) in east London, Ashraf Rahman told the BBC's undercover researcher that he had arranged cheating in Birmingham and Manchester, as well as London. ""I've been here for five years and no-one gets caught,"" he said. Mr Rahman later denied he arranged cheating, claiming he was just discussing what others did. ELTA denied cheating took place on its premises and said Mr Rahman was not an employee.

Instagram boss in talks over self-harm content,"This video can not be played After Molly Russell took her own life, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account The boss of Instagram will meet the health secretary this week over the platform's handling of content promoting self-harm and suicide. It comes after links were madebetween the suicide of teenager Molly Russell and her exposure to harmful material. Instagram's boss, Adam Mosseri, said it would begin adding ""sensitivity screens"" which hide images until users actively choose to look at them. But he admitted the platform was ""not yet where we need to be"" on the issue. The sensitivity screens will mean certain images, for example of cutting, will appear blurred and carry a warning to users that clicking on them will open up sensitive content which could be offensive or disturbing. Molly, 14, took her own life in 2017. When her family looked into her Instagram account they found distressing material about depression and suicide. Her father told the BBC he believed the Facebook-owned platform had ""helped kill my daughter"". Mr Mosseri will meet Matt Hancock on Thursday.The health secretary said recently thatsocial media firms could be banned if they failed to remove harmful content. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalMr Mosseri said Molly's case had left him ""deeply moved"" and he accepted Instagram had work to do. ""We rely heavily on our community to report this content, and remove it as soon as it's found,"" he wrote. ""The bottom line is we do not yet find enough of these images before they're seen by other people."" Instagram boss Adam Mosseri will answer questions over the company's practices He said the company began a comprehensive review last week and was investing in technology ""to better identify sensitive images"" as part of wider plans to make posts on the subject harder to find. ""Starting this week we will be applying sensitivity screens to all content we review that contains cutting, as we still allow people to share that they are struggling even if that content no longer shows up in search, hashtags or account recommendations."" Girl, 12, was 'hooked' on self-harm images Facebook 'sorry' for distressing images Instagram has previously said it doesn't automatically remove distressing content because it had been advised by experts that allowing users to share stories and connect with others could be helpful for their recovery. This video can not be played Libby used to post images of her self-harm injuries on Instagram Mr Hancock's meeting will take place on the same day that chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, will release a report looking into the links between mental health issues and social media. Meanwhile, a government white paper, expected this winter, will set out social media companies responsibilities to its users. A statement from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""We have heard calls for an internet regulator and to place a statutory 'duty of care' on platforms, and are seriously considering all options."" Separate reports by the Children's Commissioner for England andHouse of Commons Science and Technology Committeehave called on social media firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms.

"Blue planet to get even bluerThe oceans will become more blue thanks to rising temperatures in coming decades, say scientists.Science & EnvironmentComments","The blue ocean is likely to get more blue say scientists Rising temperatures will change the colour of the world's oceans, making them more blue in the coming decades say scientists. They found that increased heat will change the mixture of phytoplankton or tiny marine organisms in the seas, which absorb and reflect light. Scientists say there will be less of them in the waters in the decades to come. This will drive a colour change in more than 50% of the world's seas by 2100. Climate secrets of the world's most remote island Plankton named after Blue Planet series Climate stirring change under the waves Phytoplankton play a hugely important role in the oceans. As well as turning sunlight into chemical energy, and consuming carbon dioxide, they are the bottom rung on the marine food chain. Phytoplankton seen under a microscope They also play an important role in how we see the oceans with our eyes. The more phytoplankton in the water, the less blue the seas will appear, and the more likely they will be to have a greenish colour. Previous research has shown that with warming, the oceans will see a reduction in phytoplankton in many places. This new study models the likely impact these changes will have on the colour of the ocean and the planet as the world warms up. ""What we find is that the colour will change, probably not so much that you will see by eye, but certainly sensors will be able to pick up that there's a change,"" lead author Dr Stephanie Dutkiewicz from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US, told BBC News. ""And it will likely be one of the earliest warning signals that we have changed the ecology of the ocean."" As well as changes in the blue of the oceans, we are also likely to see changes in the green The researchers point out that the changes are an indirect impact of climate change, as warming is affecting the circulation of the seas, this is changing the amount of food available for phytoplankton. Another difference from previous studies is that this time, the researchers are looking solely at satellite measurements of reflected light from the phytoplankton. In the past, scientists have used satellite measurements of chlorophyll, a light harvesting pigment found in phytoplankton, to try and understand the impact of climate change. However they've had problems working out the difference between natural variability and human induced warming on this green pigment.  They believe it will be 30-40 years before they can say for definite that climate change is having an impact on chlorophyll. ""What we've shown is that the colour in the blue green range is going to show that signal of change sooner, in some places in maybe the next decade,"" said Dr Dutkiewicz. ""More of the ocean is going to show a change in colour over the next few decades than we would see in chlorophyll, the changing colour is going to be more of a warning signal."" The researchers believe that the North Atlantic will be one of the first places to reflect the change - followed by locations in the Southern Ocean. Natural patterns seen on the Ukrainian river Dnepr covered by cyanobacterias as a result of phytoplankton evolution in hot seasons The team modelled what would happen to the oceans by the end of this century if the world warmed by 3C, which is close to where temperatures are likely to be, if every country sticks to the promises they have made in the Paris climate agreement. ""There will be a noticeable difference in the colour of 50% of the ocean by the end of the 21st century,"" Dr Dutkiewicz said. ""It could be potentially quite serious. Different types of phytoplankton absorb light differently, and if climate change shifts one community of phytoplankton to another, that will also change the types of food webs they can support. "" The team also believe that the world will see changes in some of the green shades seen in the oceans as well. This will happen because some species of phytoplankton will respond well to a warmer environment and will create larger blooms of more diverse marine organisms.  This is likely to show up with more green regions near the equator and the poles, the researchers say. The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications.

Fake Xanax deaths an 'escalating crisis'Northern Ireland's chief coroner speaks out over the rising number of deaths linked to the anti-anxiety drug.Health,"The US-style bar-shaped version of the drug is the form that is most commonly traded among teenagers - like this group, there are many counterfeit versions The coroner for Northern Ireland has called the rising number of deaths linked to fake versions of the anti-anxiety drug, Xanax, ""an escalating crisis"". Joe McCrisken says he is signing off an alprazolam-related death nearly once a week. He says ""most of the deaths"" are caused by counterfeit versions of Xanax, the brand name for the drug alprazolam. ""The deaths are a very tiny tip of what is a very huge iceberg,"" he says. Xanax is used to treat anxiety and panic attacks. It is not available on the NHS. It is a powerful tranquiliser. But it can be obtained on private prescription in the UK, is widely prescribed in the US, and counterfeit versions circulate on the black market. Last year, the BBC foundthat children as young as 11were being treated by ambulance services after taking fake versions of it. Xanax: Treatment for addiction rises sharply in children Fake Xanax: The UK's largest ever dark net drugs bust Mr McCrisken said the number of deaths linked to alprazolam in Northern Ireland had risen from one in 2015, to 26 in 2017. ""In 2018, it's looking like that might double to somewhere around 50 provisionally. ""That's an indication of not an emerging crisis, but an escalating crisis. It's a very real public health concern."" Paul, 20, started taking counterfeit Xanax from the age of 17 after being introduced to it by a friend. He said he initially took it to help with his anxiety. ""It made me feel happy. It made me feel like a different person, as if all your problems have gone, it made you feel like you needed it. But at the same time like you didn't really need it. But that's when all the bad stuff started happening. ""My head was away. I started fighting with my family, I tried to stab my mum, I was going to stab my dad, getting into fights, getting into debt."" Paul admitted to taking other drugs - but said fake Xanax had the worst effect on him as he had no idea whether it had been cut with other substances. Counterfeit Xanax ""It's made me psychotic and stuff and made me not be able to control my anger. ""People nowadays are just playing Russian roulette with tablets, they're just trying to see what the next hit is. ""But it's not worth it. Too many young people are dying from the fake stuff going about."" Paul says he is exceptionally lucky to still be alive, considering his abuse of the tranquiliser and other drugs. ""One night I took 56 of them. That was on a Friday. And I didn't wake up until the Sunday. That's when I went round to my Mum's and smashed her TV, then had her pinned up against the car. I didn't know what I was doing. ""I didn't think I would make it to the age of 20 because of the stuff I was doing. They make you suicidal. Paul says he would buy fake versions of Xanax ""bars"" to feed his addiction ""Even after I am off it, I still have to deal with the voices in my head. I have to still deal with all the mental health problems."" Paul said dealers would offer the drug to passers-by on the street. ""It's silly because you'll have 13-year-old kids running about trying to sell you the drug on the street corners."" Paul underwent a residential rehab treatment and has been clean for just under a year. Mr McCrisken said when he started the job three years ago, he had never heard of counterfeit Xanax. ""The alprazolam powder is being obtained from the Far East, I was told in one inquest, and then pressed in the UK and sold on the dark web."" Because Xanax is not available on the NHS in the UK, Mr McCrisken believes almost all the deaths linked to the drug in Northern Ireland are from counterfeit versions. ""We can't underplay this; it's hugely concerning. The sheer escalation of deaths, involving alprazolam as well as other drugs, but particularly that one, as a coroner, concerns me. ""This is one that seems to have emerged out of nowhere, really, and it's escalated to a degree where it should be concerning everybody."" He added that the problem was UK-wide. Figures from Scotland showed a four-fold increase in deaths related to alprazolam from 24 in 2016 to 99 in 2017. In 2018, Public Health Wales reportedthat counterfeit Xanax was among the ""most commonly identified"" classes of psychoactive substances,externalanalysed by the Welsh Emerging Drugs and Identification of Novel Substances Project's (WEDINOS) drug testing service. Peter Burkinshaw is the drug and alcohol lead for Public Health England. ""We've got no evidence that there is a very widespread epidemic of its use, but we're certainly clear that its use is increasing,"" he said. ""And we can see it in various data sets, we can see it in police seizures data, we can see it in hospital admissions data and we can see it amongst young people coming into treatment centres for help."" Dr Michael McKenna is concerned about fake Xanax misuse among his patients In December, Public Health England released figures showing the number of young people being treated for addiction to benzodiazepine drugs like alprazolam.

Police raids target UK 'web attackers',"International action has targeted lots of sites suspected of making it cheap and easy to launch web attacks UK police have seized more than 60 computers and other gadgets suspected of being used to carry out web attacks. The raids were part of an international operation targeting customers of Webstresser, which Europol calls the ""world's biggest marketplace"" for distributed denial of service attacks. The site was shut down and its suspected operators arrested in April. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it planned further action against another 400 suspected UK Webstresser customers. Europol said Webstresser had helped to launch more than four million DDoS attacks, which funnel huge amounts of data at a target to knock it offline, and had more than 151,000 registered customers. Prices to bombard websites started as low as â¬15 (Â£13) a month, it added. The NCA said it had issued ""cease and desist"" notices to many of the people from whom it had seized gadgets. These warn of future legal action, if the recipient continued to carry out web attacks. ""The action taken shows that although users think that they can hide behind usernames and crypto-currency, these do not provide anonymity,"" said Jim Stokley, deputy director of the NCA's national cyber-crime unit, ""We have already identified further suspects linked to the site, and we will continue to take action,"" he added. The action against Webstresser customers is part of a broader international push against suspected DDoS-for-hire sites and their users. In December, US police forces charged three men accused of running DDoS services. It also shut down 15 sites suspected of offering similar services. Romanian police had also shut down two other suspected DDoS sites and planned to share information seized during raids about their customers, said Europol. Independent security expert Brian Krebs saidprofessional cyber-security organisations had criticised,externalthe co-ordinated action against those running DDoS or ""booter"" services and their customers. ""The vast majority of both groups are young men under the age of 21 and are using booter services to settle petty disputes over online games,"" he wrote. Instead, he said, some had called on police to tackle ""more serious cyber-criminals"".

Instagram boss summoned over self-harm images,"This video can not be played After Molly Russell took her own life, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account The boss of Instagram will meet the health secretary this week over the platform's handling of content promoting self-harm and suicide. It comes after links were madebetween the suicide of teenager Molly Russell and her exposure to harmful material. Instagram's boss, Adam Mosseri, said it would begin adding ""sensitivity screens"" which hide images until users actively choose to look at them. But he admitted the platform was ""not yet where we need to be"" on the issue. The sensitivity screens will mean certain images, for example of cutting, will appear blurred and carry a warning to users that clicking on them will open up sensitive content which could be offensive or disturbing. Molly, 14, took her own life in 2017. When her family looked into her Instagram account they found distressing material about depression and suicide. Her father told the BBC he believed the Facebook-owned platform had ""helped kill my daughter"". Mr Mosseri will meet Matt Hancock on Thursday.The health secretary said recently thatsocial media firms could be banned if they failed to remove harmful content. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalMr Mosseri said Molly's case had left him ""deeply moved"" and he accepted Instagram had work to do. ""We rely heavily on our community to report this content, and remove it as soon as it's found,"" he wrote. ""The bottom line is we do not yet find enough of these images before they're seen by other people."" Instagram boss Adam Mosseri will answer questions over the company's practices He said the company began a comprehensive review last week and was investing in technology ""to better identify sensitive images"" as part of wider plans to make posts on the subject harder to find. ""Starting this week we will be applying sensitivity screens to all content we review that contains cutting, as we still allow people to share that they are struggling even if that content no longer shows up in search, hashtags or account recommendations."" Girl, 12, was 'hooked' on self-harm images Facebook 'sorry' for distressing images Instagram has previously said it doesn't automatically remove distressing content because it had been advised by experts that allowing users to share stories and connect with others could be helpful for their recovery. This video can not be played Libby used to post images of her self-harm injuries on Instagram Mr Hancock's meeting will take place on the same day that chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, will release a report looking into the links between mental health issues and social media. Meanwhile, a government white paper, expected this winter, will set out social media companies responsibilities to its users. A statement from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""We have heard calls for an internet regulator and to place a statutory 'duty of care' on platforms, and are seriously considering all options."" Separate reports by the Children's Commissioner for England andHouse of Commons Science and Technology Committeehave called on social media firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms.

Blue planet to get even bluer,"The blue ocean is likely to get more blue say scientists Rising temperatures will change the colour of the world's oceans, making them more blue in the coming decades say scientists. They found that increased heat will change the mixture of phytoplankton or tiny marine organisms in the seas, which absorb and reflect light. Scientists say there will be less of them in the waters in the decades to come. This will drive a colour change in more than 50% of the world's seas by 2100. Climate secrets of the world's most remote island Plankton named after Blue Planet series Climate stirring change under the waves Phytoplankton play a hugely important role in the oceans. As well as turning sunlight into chemical energy, and consuming carbon dioxide, they are the bottom rung on the marine food chain. Phytoplankton seen under a microscope They also play an important role in how we see the oceans with our eyes. The more phytoplankton in the water, the less blue the seas will appear, and the more likely they will be to have a greenish colour. Previous research has shown that with warming, the oceans will see a reduction in phytoplankton in many places. This new study models the likely impact these changes will have on the colour of the ocean and the planet as the world warms up. ""What we find is that the colour will change, probably not so much that you will see by eye, but certainly sensors will be able to pick up that there's a change,"" lead author Dr Stephanie Dutkiewicz from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US, told BBC News. ""And it will likely be one of the earliest warning signals that we have changed the ecology of the ocean."" As well as changes in the blue of the oceans, we are also likely to see changes in the green The researchers point out that the changes are an indirect impact of climate change, as warming is affecting the circulation of the seas, this is changing the amount of food available for phytoplankton. Another difference from previous studies is that this time, the researchers are looking solely at satellite measurements of reflected light from the phytoplankton. In the past, scientists have used satellite measurements of chlorophyll, a light harvesting pigment found in phytoplankton, to try and understand the impact of climate change. However they've had problems working out the difference between natural variability and human induced warming on this green pigment.  They believe it will be 30-40 years before they can say for definite that climate change is having an impact on chlorophyll. ""What we've shown is that the colour in the blue green range is going to show that signal of change sooner, in some places in maybe the next decade,"" said Dr Dutkiewicz. ""More of the ocean is going to show a change in colour over the next few decades than we would see in chlorophyll, the changing colour is going to be more of a warning signal."" The researchers believe that the North Atlantic will be one of the first places to reflect the change - followed by locations in the Southern Ocean. Natural patterns seen on the Ukrainian river Dnepr covered by cyanobacterias as a result of phytoplankton evolution in hot seasons The team modelled what would happen to the oceans by the end of this century if the world warmed by 3C, which is close to where temperatures are likely to be, if every country sticks to the promises they have made in the Paris climate agreement. ""There will be a noticeable difference in the colour of 50% of the ocean by the end of the 21st century,"" Dr Dutkiewicz said. ""It could be potentially quite serious. Different types of phytoplankton absorb light differently, and if climate change shifts one community of phytoplankton to another, that will also change the types of food webs they can support. "" The team also believe that the world will see changes in some of the green shades seen in the oceans as well. This will happen because some species of phytoplankton will respond well to a warmer environment and will create larger blooms of more diverse marine organisms.  This is likely to show up with more green regions near the equator and the poles, the researchers say. The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications.

Body seen in Emiliano Sala plane wreckage,"This video can not be played The search for answers A body has been seen in the underwater wreckage of the plane that was carrying footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson. A search on Sunday found the Piper Malibu plane on the seabed off Guernsey, almost two weeks after it went missing. The Air Accident Investigation Branch confirmed the sighting on Monday. Rescue teams are now developing a recovery plan for the plane, which is 67m (220ft) below water. The man who found it said it was ""imperative"" it was raised from the seabed soon. ""There's a much greater chance they (the Sala family) will get answers if (the plane is) recovered,"" said shipwreck hunter David Mearns. He added their ""worst fears are confirmed"", saying: ""It's going to take a long time for them to come to terms with the loss."" Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson The flight had been carrying Argentine striker Sala, 28, and Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Nantes, north west France, to Cardiff after Sala completed his Â£15m move to Cardiff City. The ""substantial amount of wreckage"" of the plane, was found on Sunday morning after Mr Mearns' privately-funded search began. He said lifting the plane was now the most important task. Mr Mearns added: ""(The AAIB) will be able to rule things out or rule things in, that's the normal investigative process for any crash, so I think it's imperative that the plane is recovered, and now even more so now we know someone is down there."" The recovery operation would need to take place in ""slack water"" - the point at which the tide is turning, he added. It would be conducted by a Ministry of Defence salvage marine operations vessel and Mr Mearns said one equipped for working in the North Sea with a dive support vessel would be able to lift the plane ""within a matter of days"". Sala plane wreckage found in Channel Who is the man behind the Sala search? Cushions 'from missing Sala plane' found Video footage recorded using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) showed one person in the wreckage. The AAIB said it was consulting with the missing men's families and police about the next step and intends to publish an interim report in the coming weeks. An online appeal started by Sala's agent had raised Â£324,000 (371,000 euros) for the private search, which Mr Mearns offered to help with. Working jointly with the AAIB, his ship and another search vessel, the Geo Ocean III, began combing a four square mile area of the English Channel, 24 nautical miles north of Guernsey. Speaking onRadio 4's Today programmeon Monday, Mr Mearns said the plane was identified by sonar, before a submersible with cameras was sent underwater to confirm this. ""They saw the registration number and the biggest surprise is that most of the plane is there - we were expecting to find a debris field,"" he added. The Geo Ocean III (circled) is at the scene of the wreckage while it is decided what actions will be taken Geo Ocean III sent down a submersible to investigate the wreckage Tributes have been left outside the Cardiff City Stadium Meanwhile, Cardiff City football club said it was ""actively considering"" what to do with the tributes to Sala and Mr Ibbotson, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, which have been left outside the stadium. A growing number of items, such as scarves, flowers and football shirts, have been laid around the statue of the club's FA Cup-winning captain Fred Keenor over the past two weeks. A spokesman said it will make a decision soon. The AAIB released this map of the search area Mr Mearns's boat and the AAIB covered An officialsearch operation was called off on 24 Januaryafter Guernsey's harbour master said the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"".

Nissan Â£61m in doubt after investment U-turn,"Nissan will be forced to reapply for nearly Â£60m of taxpayer support after backtracking on a promise to build its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. A letter from the government to Nissan, written in 2016, revealed that the Japanese carmaker would only get the money if it made the car in the UK. The government clarified that Nissan had received just Â£2.6m of the funds, but would have to reapply for the rest. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the X-Trail would have created 741 UK jobs. But he told the House of Commons that Nissan had committed to building its Qashqai, Juke and Leaf models in Sunderland, where it employs 7,000 workers. Mr Clark also said: ""While the decision was made on broader business grounds, Nissan commented on the need for us to come together and resolve the question of our future trading relationship with the EU. I believe their advice should be listened to and acted upon."" In the 2016 letter from Mr Clark,externalto Nissan's then boss, Carlos Ghosn, he said the funding was contingent ""on a positive decision by the Nissan board to allocate production of the Qashqai and X-Trail models to the Sunderland plant"". Mr Ghosn has since been sacked as Nissan's chairman and is in detention in Japanfollowing claims of financial misconduct. Mr Ghosn has denied the allegations. Simon Jack: The real reasons Nissan pulled its investment Nissan chooses Japan over UK for new car Carmakers fear rising trade barriers after Brexit Nissan had originally asked for Â£80m in state support, but following a review by an independent advisory committee, that figure was reduced to Â£61m. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said Nissan has been given Â£2.6m and would have to reapply for the remaining Â£58.4m. On Sunday, when Nissan announced its decision not to build the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, the firm's Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said that ""the continued uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future"". The government had to clarify its position after Business Minister Richard Harrington told the BBC that Nissan would get the Â£61m support payment. Mr Harrington told BBC Newcastle: ""The Â£60m still stands. It's to do with research and development and developing alternative technologies and making sure Nissan is at the forefront of that. ""This was nothing to do with the X-Trail."" Following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, Mr Ghosn had hinted that he would seek compensation if car exports to Europe were subject to tariffs. Mr Ghosn met Prime Minister Theresa May to discuss the future of Nissan's plant in Sunderland, after which he said he was ""confident"" that the government would keep the UK a competitive place to do business after it leaves the EU. In the letter to Mr Ghosn, Mr Clark said: ""It will be a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK's future relationship with the EU."" Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee said Nissan's decision not to built the X-Trail in the UK ""is a blow to production at Sunderland"". She added: ""The government's mishandling of Brexit, the reluctance to rule out 'no deal' and the lack of certainty around our future trading relationship with our biggest and nearest trading partner has made this decision sadly predictable, no matter what assurances may have been provided in the past.""

Sala plane wreckage found in Channel,"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson Wreckage from a plane carrying Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala has been discovered in the English Channel. The Piper Malibu N264DB was lost on 21 January on its way from Nantes, France, to Cardiff, with the Argentine striker and pilot David Ibbotson on board. David Mearns, who led a privately-funded search for the aircraft, said it was located off Guernsey on Sunday. He said: ""All I will say is that there is a substantial amount of wreckage on the seabed."" David Mearns offered to help look for the plane after a fundraising effort by Mr Sala's family Speaking onRadio 4's Today programmeon Monday, Mr Mearns said: ""We located the wreckage of the plane on the seabed at a depth of about 63m within the first couple of hours [of searching]."" He said the plane was identified by sonar, before a submersible with cameras was sent underwater and was able to confirm it was the plane. ""They saw the registration number and the biggest surprise is that most of the plane is there,"" he added. Mr Mearns's private search has now been stood down and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is at the site working to recover the plane. He said further investigations by the AAIB would be conducted over the next two days in order to determine how it will attempt a recovery operation. Who is David Mearns? Nantes pay tribute to missing Sala Sala's family 'struggling with few answers' In a series oftweets,externalon Sunday, marine scientist Mr Mearns said: ""The families of Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson have been notified by police.""

Mr Mearns said he was in contact with the Sala family after the wreckage was located and said they ""desperately want that plane to be recovered. They feel that is the pathway for them to get the answers that they need to have"". He added he was compelled to help to search for the plane after seeing an emotional plea by Sala's sister Romina. ""I just felt that girl needed help and that's why I offered my assistance,"" he said. ""I am a football fan. Cardiff is not my city, but I follow football. I felt very badly for her, I wanted to help. I just happen to be a person with this experience and skill and I could do that. ""To add to it this was a man in the prime of his life. It is just so tremendously sad."" Cardiff had signed Sala for a club record of Â£15m and he was due to start training last month. The 28-year-old striker and Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, were travelling from Nantes, where he had previously played, when the flight lost contact with air traffic controllers.

Geo Ocean III remains at the wreckage location off Guernsey The AAIB ship has remained at the site where the missing Piper plane was located, to deploy an underwater search vehicle to make a visual confirmation. A recovery operation will then begin. Former air crash investigator Tony Cable told BBC Breakfast on Monday that any examination of the wreckage after it is recovered would take ""considerable time"". ""Certainly the damage can tell you the sort of altitude and vertical speed, horizontal speed that it hit the water."" He added that there may also be signs of anything that was not working properly. ""The difficulty is if you don't have signs of problems before the crash, you're left looking at possible reasons then which are not a failure of the aircraft. The absence of any problem leaves you somewhat in the realm of speculation."" Officials at the AAIB said they expected to give an update on the operation on Monday morning.

Using sonar technology and remote-controlled submersibles, the expeditions have also set records by finding wrecks at extreme depths. HMS Hood during a dockyard refit at Portsmouth in 1930 The Bismarck sent up a wall of ""plunging fire"" which penetrated the weak deck armour of HMS Hood when it was sunk in the Denmark Strait One of Britain's greatest battleships, Hood was sunk by the German navy's Bismarck in May 1941, killing 1,415 men. HMS Hood's remains were found at a depth of 3,000m in the Denmark Strait, between Greenland and Iceland, in 2001. He has continued to make significant discoveries around the world with his company,Blue Water Recoveries,external. In 2008, Mr Mearns led a successful search for the HMAS Sydney, pictured here before it was sunk in November 1941 In 2008 Mr Mearns led the successful search forHMAS Sydney,external, an Australian navy battlecruiser sunk by the Germans off the continent's west coast in November 1941, killing more than 700. And in 2015 his company announced they had found a wreck believed to be theEsmerelda, a ship fromVasco Da Gama's fleet thought to have sunk off the coast of Oman in May 1503. Mr Mearns has also co-ordinated searches for some more modern nautical enigmas. In the early 1990s, he assisted a criminal probe into the foundering of the Lucona, a cargo ship blown up in the Indian Ocean in 1997, killing six men, as part of an insurance scam. He has also been instrumental in searches that have defied the odds. They include locating the SS Rio Grande, the deepest shipwreck ever found. The World War Two German supply ship, sunk by the Americans in 1944, was discovered around three and a half miles below the waves of the south Atlantic Ocean in 1996.

The real reasons Nissan pulled its investment,"Nissan's change of heart over making the X-Trail in Sunderland set Brexit alarm bells ringing over the weekend. It was further evidence, to some, that car investment in the UK is drying up as we head towards the EU exit - ripping up promises made by Margaret Thatcher to Japanese manufacturers that they should consider the UK as their natural manufacturing outpost within the EU. While it is wrong to think that Brexit was the main reasonNissan pulled the X-Trail from Sunderland, it is still right to think that Brexit is proving a powerful deterrent for investment in the UK car industry. Some of the technical issues it throws up could start affecting UK car exports as soon as next week. But there are three other important factors affecting the UK car industry. Nissan is not the only company to have been caught off guard by the sudden and rapid slump in diesel sales across Europe. The VW emissions scandal and the subsequent confusion about diesel among regulators and consumers, have dealt a heavy blow to sales and production with JLR being the most conspicuous casualty. Under current market conditions it simply made no sense for Nissan to invest in a new diesel manufacturing facility in northern Europe. The fact that the UK is about to leave the world's biggest trading bloc creating border uncertainty is an aggravating factor for sure but not Nissan's primary reason. There are other powerful forces at work. As of last week, the free trade agreement between the EU and Japan came into force. Under that deal, tariffs on Japanese car exports to the EU begin to taper towards zero over the next ten years. That means there is a dwindling rationale for Japan to manufacture cars for European customers in the EU. In fact, post Brexit, cars from Japan entering the EU could attract lower tariffs than cars made in the UK. There is another Brexit problem. One of the highest growth areas for UK exports has been South Korea after trade has been stimulated by a trade agreement with the EU. Currently the UK enjoys the preferential terms thanks to its membership of the EU. After March 29th it won't. Given it takes six weeks to transport cars to South East Asia, from mid-February (end of next week) manufacturers face the prospect of loading ships with exports to markets without knowing what tariffs will apply to those products when they come off at the other end. International Trade secretary Dr Liam Fox has been confident that we can replicate this and simply tippex out ""EU"" on the front page of nearly 40 free trade agreements and replace it with ""UK"". It's not that simple. For products to enjoy preferential terms under a trade deal, there is a requirement for them to be predominantly made of components from that country. In the trade deal the EU has with South Korea, 55% of the car components must be from the EU. If the same test was applied to the UK as a stand-alone country, none of the cars manufactured here would pass a test requiring 55% of components to come from the UK. Brexit: A really simple guide Nissan chooses Japan over UK for new car Car investment slumps on Brexit 'red alert' Firms 'may speed up no-deal Brexit plans' It is possible that the terms of a future UK-EU trade deal would include asking South Korea, Morocco, Mexico and others if they would allow UK and EU parts to be added together to pass the test but it's far from clear they would agree. So far Liam Fox has only managed to ensure a trade continuity deal with Chile. In an uncertain world, we can say one thing with certainty. Investment in the UK car industry has collapsed. In 2015, companies invested Â£2.5bn, last year it was less than Â£600m - a fall of nearly 80% in just three years. Brexit may not have done for the X-Trail, but it is having a corrosive effect on the wider car industry.

Nissan ÃÂ£61m in doubt after investment U-turn,"Nissan will be forced to reapply for nearly Â£60m of taxpayer support after backtracking on a promise to build its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. A letter from the government to Nissan, written in 2016, revealed that the Japanese carmaker would only get the money if it made the car in the UK. The government clarified that Nissan had received just Â£2.6m of the funds, but would have to reapply for the rest. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the X-Trail would have created 741 UK jobs. But he told the House of Commons that Nissan had committed to building its Qashqai, Juke and Leaf models in Sunderland, where it employs 7,000 workers. Mr Clark also said: ""While the decision was made on broader business grounds, Nissan commented on the need for us to come together and resolve the question of our future trading relationship with the EU. I believe their advice should be listened to and acted upon."" In the 2016 letter from Mr Clark,externalto Nissan's then boss, Carlos Ghosn, he said the funding was contingent ""on a positive decision by the Nissan board to allocate production of the Qashqai and X-Trail models to the Sunderland plant"". Mr Ghosn has since been sacked as Nissan's chairman and is in detention in Japanfollowing claims of financial misconduct. Mr Ghosn has denied the allegations. Simon Jack: The real reasons Nissan pulled its investment Nissan chooses Japan over UK for new car Carmakers fear rising trade barriers after Brexit Nissan had originally asked for Â£80m in state support, but following a review by an independent advisory committee, that figure was reduced to Â£61m. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said Nissan has been given Â£2.6m and would have to reapply for the remaining Â£58.4m. On Sunday, when Nissan announced its decision not to build the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, the firm's Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said that ""the continued uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future"". The government had to clarify its position after Business Minister Richard Harrington told the BBC that Nissan would get the Â£61m support payment. Mr Harrington told BBC Newcastle: ""The Â£60m still stands. It's to do with research and development and developing alternative technologies and making sure Nissan is at the forefront of that. ""This was nothing to do with the X-Trail."" Following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, Mr Ghosn had hinted that he would seek compensation if car exports to Europe were subject to tariffs. Mr Ghosn met Prime Minister Theresa May to discuss the future of Nissan's plant in Sunderland, after which he said he was ""confident"" that the government would keep the UK a competitive place to do business after it leaves the EU. In the letter to Mr Ghosn, Mr Clark said: ""It will be a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK's future relationship with the EU."" Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee said Nissan's decision not to built the X-Trail in the UK ""is a blow to production at Sunderland"". She added: ""The government's mishandling of Brexit, the reluctance to rule out 'no deal' and the lack of certainty around our future trading relationship with our biggest and nearest trading partner has made this decision sadly predictable, no matter what assurances may have been provided in the past.""

US rapper 21 Savage 'is really from UK',"21 Savage attended the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards Atlanta rapper 21 Savage has been arrested by US immigration officials who say he is actually from the UK. The rapper, Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, came to the US in July 2005 aged 12 and failed to leave when his visa expired a year later, officials said. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesman said he was in the country illegally and a convicted felon. In previous interviews, Abraham-Joseph has described a childhood in Atlanta. 21 questions about 21 Savage In an interview with Fader magazine in 2016he said he had first seen a gun at the age of eight,external- although the article did not specify where this incident had taken place. The 26-year-old is also quoted as saying he was expelled from school in Atlanta aged about 12 or 13 for taking a gun to class. Allow Twitter content?

The ICE spokesman said Abraham-Joseph was convicted of drugs charges in 2014 and arrested on Sunday in a ""targeted operation"". He clarified that when the rapper was first arrested, ICE was not aware of his immigration status.

She said he was a ""role model"" due to his work on financial literacy programs with underprivileged youth. By Kameron Virk, BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat reporter in Atlanta Having just released a hugely popular album that's been praised for its introspection, storytelling, and maturity, 21 Savage is at the peak of his career. Atlanta is arguably the centre of hip-hop in the US and, by extension, the world. He's considered one of the city's greatest - and Atlanta through and through. The rapper is known in the city as a person who frequently donates to charitable causes. He launched his own campaign promoting financial literacy in children on the Ellen show. His raps have mostly painted pictures of a violent upbringing in Atlanta surrounded by drugs and guns, something which up until now nobody had questioned. But his arrest by ICE and links to the UK have definitely left people in the city confused. A fan in Atlanta told the BBC he was treating the details of Savage 21's case with scepticism: ""I find that very hard to believe that he moved from England on his own to Atlanta."" ""He's an icon for here,"" said another fan in the state of Georgia's capital. ""He's making great music. We're losing someone big."" 21 Savage performed onstage during Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest There are 10.6 million undocumented immigrants in the US, according to the Center for Migration Studies. That represents 3.25% of the US population. Although President Donald Trump has blamed the southern border for illegal immigration, most actually arises because people overstay their visas (tourist or other temporary permits). More than 700,000 people who entered the US legally overstayed their expected departure date in 2018, according to the Department of Homeland Security. In the same year, some 396,000 people were held in immigration detention, and some 256,000 people were deported by authorities. Allow Twitter content?

It followed a similar apology by NBA star LeBron James, who had shared 21 Savage's lyric on his Instagram account, where critics drew attention to it. LeBron James said he thought it had been a compliment. 21 Savage said he was ""sorry if I offended everybody"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The rapper, who has collaborated with the likes of Cardi B, Drake and Offset has enjoyed more success in the US than the UK, but is probably best known for the song Rockstar, in which he features with Post Malone. The song reached number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Top 40 and has been streamed on Spotify more than 1.4 billion times. It is also currently nominated for record of the year and best rap/sung performance at the Grammy Awards. His latest album peaked at 33 in the UK, whilst his only other UK Top 40 hit is with Cardi B, for the song Bartier Cardi. Fans expressed concerns over 21 Savage's situation on social media, while others were quick to make memes and poke fun at the revelation. But singer Demi Lovato was in hot water after she said in a now-deleted Tweet: ""So far 21 savage memes have been my favourite part of the Super Bowl."" Other rappers called out Lovato's reaction as insensitive. American rapper Wale asked how a person's freedom could be funny, tweeting, ""I don't get the joke."" He added that when Lovato was going through a rough time, people were supportive of her, not mocking. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

City bin workers to walk out again,"Unite said workers will stage fresh walkouts for two days a week from later this month Bin workers in Birmingham are to take further strike action after a three-month walkout in 2017 that led to waste piling up in the streets. Up to 300 Unite members have been working to rule since 29 December over a payment given to GMB members who did not take part in previous action. Unite said it was escalating the action, unhappy with Birmingham City Council's response. The council said it was ""extremely disappointed"". John Clancy was forced to resign as leader of the council in the aftermath of the 2017 strike. Unite said its members would now stage walkouts for two days a week from later this month. What caused Birmingham's bin strike? Rubbish piles up again in Birmingham Former council boss criticised over bins Howard Beckett, the union's assistant general secretary, said: ""The council have created this dispute and it is up to the council to resolve this dispute. ""I would say to the people of Birmingham, firstly, I'm sorry that my members have had to take this action, please put yourself in the shoes of my members and please understand why they have had to take this action and please blame the council for it."" A council spokesman said: ""We would urge Unite to continue talks as we want to resolve this matter, so citizens get the refuse collection service they rightly expect and deserve."" Thousands of tonnes of waste were left on Birmingham's streets in 2017 Unite workers initially went on strike in June 2017 in a dispute over job losses. The union claimed restructuring plans threatened jobs, while the council said it would modernise the service and save Â£5m a year. Strike action was suspended in August with the council provisionally agreeing certain posts would not be made redundant but workers continued with the walkout at the beginning of September. The industrial action lasted almost three months and saw thousands of tonnes of rubbish piled up on Birmingham's streets. Residents were urged to take their waste to tips, whilesome volunteers took matters into their own hands and cleared rubbish, saying the city was becoming a ""big skip"". This video can not be played Cat flap locked to stop rodents as bin bags pile up In December, workersvoted overwhelmingly to take industrial actionover claims Unite members had been denied a council payment made to GMB members who did not go on strike in 2017. They agreed on action short of a strike, implementing a work-to-rule from 29 December. On 1 February it wasannounced industrial action by workerswould be ""escalated"" as the union said it had not had a ""satisfactory response"" from the council. The union urged the council to ""drop the pound shop bully boy tactics amid mounting legal costs"", while the authority said it was disappointed its ""reasonable offer"" had been rejected. Could this be a familiar site for Birmingham residents if waste piles up again? Stella Taylor, from Kings Norton, said she sympathised with bin workers, adding: ""If it's true what's happened that the other members of a different union got a payment, well that's not fair. ""I think Birmingham City Council should sort it out because they are always dillying and dallying and after the last bin strike nothing really was changed. I just think it is a complete waste of time for everybody."" Stella Fatta, of Sutton Coldfied, said: ""I am not happy that they haven't been able to resolve this issue because it's a major issue for taxpayers to have to put up with because it's hygiene and you have children walking about, playing in the streets. ""It makes it embarrassing to say you are from Birmingham at the moment."" John and Christina Warner want to see a quick resolution to the dispute John Warner, from the Hall Green area, said it felt like ""the strike hadn't really stopped"" because of the work to rule which had taken place since December. ""We are not very sympathetic [to bin workers] I'm afraid. We do expect them [the bins] to be collected,"" he said. His wife, Christina, added they were lucky to have big wheelie bins but it still led to ""a lot of paper blowing in the wind"". ""We do expect this service, especially in a big city like this,"" she said. Sandra Loutari (right), pictured with her friend Iman, said she wanted to see this action resolved âas soon as possibleâ Sandra Loutari said during the last strike her rubbish was not collected for ""about two months"" and she wanted to see this action resolved ""as soon as possible"". ""We are paying council tax and it's not a small amount. And it has risen as well."" Nav Sadiq, from the Bearded Broz, a volunteer group which helped clear Birmingham's rubbish during the strikes in 2017, said: ""The bin men are not the villains, the real villains are sat in the council. ""I think everyone needs to sit down and come to an amicable agreement.""

The council has said it offered binding arbitration to resolve the row, and talks were held at the conciliation service Acas. It has urged the union to continue talks. A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: ""We utterly refute the allegations made and are extremely disappointed that the reasonable offer we have put forward has been rejected by Unite on behalf of their members.""

Police use of crime prediction tech grows,"Liberty is concerned the software's predictions are based on biased data At least 14 UK police forces have made use of crime-prediction software or plan to do so, according to Liberty. The human rights group said,externalit had sent a total of 90 Freedom of Information requests out last year to discover which forces used the technology. It believes the programs involved can lead to biased policing strategies that unfairly focus on ethnic minorities and lower-income communities. And it said there had been a ""severe lack of transparency"" about the matter. Defenders of the technology say it can provide new insights into gun and knife crime, sex trafficking and other potentially life-threatening offences at a time when police budgets are under pressure. One of the named forces - Avon and Somerset Police - said it had invited members of the press in to see the Qlik system it used in action, to raise public awareness. ""We make every effort to prevent bias in data models,"" said a spokeswoman. ""For this reason the data... does not include ethnicity, gender, address location or demographics."" But Liberty said the technologies lacked proper oversight, and moreover there was no clear evidence that they had led to safer communities. ""These opaque computer programs use algorithms to analyse hordes of biased police data, identifying patterns and embedding an approach to policing which relies on discriminatory profiling,"" its report said. ""[They] entrench pre-existing inequalities while being disguised as cost-effective innovations."" Liberty's report focuses on two types of software, which are sometimes used side-by-side. The first is ""predictive mapping"", in which crime ""hotspots"" are mapped out, leading to more patrols in the area. The second is called ""individual risk assessment"", which attempts to predict how likely an individual is to commit an offence or be a victim of a crime. Manchester's police force was identified as one of those to be using historical data to predict where future crimes might take place The report says the following forces had already used one or both types or were planning to do so: Avon and Somerset Cheshire Durham Dyfed Powys Greater Manchester Kent Lancashire Merseyside The Met Norfolk Northamptonshire Warwickshire and West Mercia West Midlands West Yorkshire Companies that develop such applications include IBM, Microsoft, Predpol and Palantir and there are efforts to create bespoke solutions. The BBC contacted each of the named forces and two responded that they had already stopped using the technology. Cheshire Police said it had trialled a mapping program between January and November 2015 but had since stopped using the system. And Kent Police confirmed it had introduced a predictive policing mapping tool in 2013 but had subsequently decided not to renew its contract,as reported last year. Kent Police had used PredPol's predictive software ""The launch of a new policing model that places victims and witnesses at its centre has led Kent Police to evaluate alternative options which will support a focus on both traditional and emerging crime types,"" a spokeswoman said. Several forces, however, are involved in a Â£4.5m ""proof-of-concept project"", called the National Data Analytics Solution (NDAS), which is funded by the Home Office. It draws on information already held by the police about roughly five million people, including incident logs, custody records and conviction histories. Using machine-learning techniques, the aim is to calculate a risk score for individuals as to their likelihood of committing crimes in the future. In addition, the police hope to use the system to identify which members of their own workforce need support to help reduce illness. West Midlands Police leads the effort. The others involved include Metropolitan Police, Greater Manchester Police, Merseyside Police, West Yorkshire Police, Warwickshire and West Mercia Police. ""We want to see analytics being used to justify investment in social mobility in this time of harmful austerity, addressing deep-rooted inequalities and helping to prevent crime,"" said Tom McNeil, strategic adviser to the effort. ""To support this we have appointed a diverse ethics panel placing human rights at the centre."" However, a report by the Alan Turing Institute - which was commissioned by the police - raised concerns that those involved had been too vague abouthow they planned to address the risks involved,external.

"Fancy a new kitchen? Hire one from IkeaThe Swedish retailer is starting a trial to lease furniture, possibly including kitchens.Business","Ikea is to start allowing customers to lease rather than buy furniture. A pilot project in Switzerland is looking at hiring out furniture as part of an environmentally-friendly policy by the Swedish flat-pack company. It said it was looking at ways for customers to ""buy, care for and pass on products"". It has already introduced programmes designed to reduce waste, such as services to take back old beds or sofas which it then donates to charity. Kate Hardcastle, retail analyst at Insight With Passion, told the BBC it marked a ""pendulum shift"" for a company which focused on cheap and cheerful furniture but was now trying to take a more sustainable approach to business. Kitchens and office chairs are among the items that could be offered for hire, according to the Financial Times. Torbjorn Loof, chief executive of Inter Ikea, told the FT: ""We will work together with partners so you can actually lease your furniture. When that leasing period is over, you hand it back and might lease something else. ""And instead of throwing those away, we refurbish them a little and we could sell them, prolonging the lifecycle of the product"". Inter Ikea controls the brand rights of the company, which was created in 1943 and is named afterits late founder Ingvar Kamprad(IK) as well as the farm he grew up on - Elmtaryd (E) - and the nearby village Agunnaryd (A). The leasing plan is the first in a series of ideas which could lead to customers subscribing for services with a view to items being refurbished rather than thrown out. While office furniture such as desks and chairs are expected to be the first items to be included in the trials, and targeted at businesses, leases on kitchens are also a possibility. Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad dies in Sweden at 91 ""It's interesting if you as a customer say 'I can change and adapt and modernise my kitchen if that's a subscription model,"" Mr Loof told the FT. An Ikea spokesperson said the business was aiming to encourage ""people to play an active role in making the circular economy a reality, which we can support by developing new ways for people to buy, care for and pass on products."". ""In certain markets, such as Switzerland, we're exploring and testing potential solutions and have a pilot project to look into the leasing of furniture, but it's still too early to confirm exactly what this will look like,"" the spokesperson said. As well as a service to return old furniture, in the UK it offers a service to take back unwanted textiles and, at its new store in London opening on Thursday, it will have its first Learning Lab to examine ways to extend the lifecycle of products. The chain has started to make other adaptations to its model - which was traditionally focused on out-of-town stores by trying new formats.  It opened a small format ""planning Studio"" on London's Tottenham Court Road last year and has said the format could be rolled out more widely.

"Government 'pledged Â£80m to Nissan'The cash depended on now-abandoned plans to make the X-Trail model in the UK, the FT says.Business","Nissan will be forced to reapply for nearly Â£60m of taxpayer support after backtracking on a promise to build its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland.

British skiers die in Italian avalanche,"Alpine rescue teams on foot work through the deep snow near Courmayeur British and French skiers are among four people found dead after an avalanche near the Italian resort of Courmayeur on Monday. Two people from the UK and two from France were reported missing on Sunday afternoon, when the risk of avalanches in the area was high. Searchers found all four bodies on Monday after a lengthy search. In all, eight people, including a Belgian snowboarder, died in Italy as a result of weekend avalanches. Italy's Ansa news agency said the four dead discovered on Monday were a 39-year-old originally from New Zealand and a 43-year-old originally from Switzerland, who both lived in London; and a 36-year-old Frenchman and a 38-year old Polish man who both lived in France. At least one was a British national. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) earlier said it was ""supporting the family of a British man who has been reported missing, and are in contact with the Italian search and rescue team.""

Italian newspaper La Repubblica said the alarm had been raised by friends of the two skiers from Britain at around noon on Sunday, when the pair failed to arrive at a meeting point. They were on the last day of their holiday, the newspaper said. Italian media also reported that the skiers had gone off-piste in Vel Veny - meaning they were not skiing on the slopes carefully managed by the nearby resort. Search operations were hampered by the continuing risk of avalanches, preventing search teams from going on foot, and search efforts had to temporarily suspended on Sunday. The fourth victim was found on Monday afternoon, hours after the earlier discovery of three bodies, some distance away. Two other avalanche victims had been found dead earlier on Sunday in the same region - the Aosta Valley. Several Italian residents were among the eight killed at the weekend, local media report. The national alpine rescue group has encouraged snowsport enthusiasts to check what level of avalanche warning is in effect every day, and to ""carry out all activities with the greatest caution"".

Australian crocs spotted in flooded streets,"One crocodile was spotted lurking on a suburban driveway in Townsville Authorities in Townsville, Australia have warned residents to beware of crocodiles and snakes spotted in floodwaters in residential areas. More than 1,100 people have been evacuated from the town amid a ""once in a century"" flood. On Sunday, the city authorities released a dam which had swollen to double its capacity following a week of record rainfall. Authorities have said more heavy rain is expected in coming days. Opened dam floods Australian city Up to 20,000 homes are at risk of being inundated. A man wades through flood water up to his thighs in Townsville Emergency workers and the army said they had received more than 1,000 calls for help. They've been using boats and helicopters to move people to higher ground. ""Crocodiles may be seen crossing roads, and when flooding recedes, crocodiles can turn up in unusual places such as farm dams or waterholes,"" said Queensland's Environment Minister Leeanne Enoch. ""Similarly, snakes are very good swimmers and they too may turn up unexpectedly."" One local resident, Erin Hahn, shared pictures of a crocodile sitting in shallow water at the end of her father's drive. Another was photographed climbing a tree in the floodwater.

""Dan is categorically wrong about the Marshall Plan,"" said Dr Warren Dockter, lecturer in international politics at Aberystwyth University. Britain received the largest share, while France received 18% and West Germany received 11%, he said. ""In addition to Marshall Plan money, the UK received favourable loans and grants on top of the Marshall Plan aid,"" he said. Britain made its last repayment on the Marshall Plan loans in 2006. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Dr Charlotte Riley, an expert in modern British history, said Britain waived its rights to collect World War Two reparations from Germany in 1990, in an agreement when the country was reunified. Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski tweeted: ""Britain helped to liberate half of Europe. She mortgaged herself up to eye balls in process. No Marshall Plan for us only for Germany."" The Marshall Plan (officially named the European Recovery Programme) was a post-World War Two package of foreign aid from the US to 16 European countries, to help them rebuild their economies after the war. In fact, Britain was the single largest recipient of the funds. Out of a total of almost $13bn, Britain was given $2.7bn - a third more than West Germany which received $1.7bn. Some of this money was used to give a boost to local industries - for example, car manufacturers Ford Motors in Britain were given money to replace the machines needed to make vehicles for export. A Scottish alcohol production plant was given money to reduce the need to import materials. The raw alcohol was used to make plastic, rayon and pharmaceuticals. Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Mr Kawczynski defended the post, saying: ""The tweet was actually talking about all the things that Britain has done for Europe. Let's not forget we liberated part of Europe in the Second World War. ""Unfortunately, many European countries are not treating us as fairly as Britain has treated Europe over centuries. ""I was trying to get across that Britain has been very fair and very generous.""

Items found in student search ruled out,"Libby Squire, from High Wycombe, was last spotted on CCTV near her student house in Hull The parents of missing Libby Squire have urged their daughter to ""get in touch"" in an emotional appeal to her. Hundreds of people have been involved in searches to find the 21-year-old, who was last seen in Hull on Thursday. Police believe she got a taxi at the Welly Club music venue before arriving at her student house at about 23:30 GMT, where her mobile phone was found. Her mother Lisa Squire said: ""Libby, my darling pie, we just want to know that you are safe."" Humberside Police said it did not believe Miss Squire entered the student house, and she was seen on CCTV on Beverley Road at 23:40. It is thought Miss Squire, from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, was near a bench by the junction with Haworth Street for about 30 minutes, with a motorist stopping to offer her help at one point. Officers said her mobile phone ""has not provided any further insight as to where she may be or her movements that night"". Lisa and Russell Squire launched a video appeal for anyone with information to come forward In a video appeal tweeted by Humberside Police,external, Mrs Squire urged her daughter to ""get in touch with us any way you can"". ""The whole family is missing you, especially me and your dad, your sisters and brother,"" she said. ""I miss you so much, it is breaking my heart not knowing where you are. I love you more."" The motorist who pulled over near the bench has subsequently made contact with police and had ""really helped out"" with the search, officers said. A screwdriver, hammer and lip gloss were retrieved by forensic officers close to the spot where she was last seen. But Humberside Police said they were not ""connected with the inquiry into her disappearance"" and the items were ""part of another investigation"". Appealing to the public earlier, her father Russell Squire said ""we just want Libby home"". Daniel Williams: Vigil held for missing uni student Mum's thanks over missing student hunt 'Significant' fears over missing student He added: ""Libby is our kind, thoughtful, beautiful girl who is loved by so many people. ""As you can appreciate this is a very difficult time for us both."" Mr Squire thanked ""everyone for their help and support"" before asking anyone with information to contact the force. A search has been carried out nearby in the Beverley and Barmston Drain Officers have been searching in drains and wheelie bins along the street, while detectives conducted door-to-door inquiries. Nearby, officers from the police marine unit travelled along a length of the frozen Beverley and Barmston Drain in inflatable rafts, breaking the ice and searching the water. About 200 students were also involved in a search of the university premises. The family previously said Miss Squire's disappearance was ""very out of character"" and they were ""broken without her"". Libby Squire was last seen on Thursday night Police are keen to speak to anyone who was on Haworth Street between 23:30 and 00:30 on the night she disappeared. Ch Supt Phil Ward, of Humberside Police, said: ""While her location is not yet known, this does not mean she has come to harm, but we must carry out a thorough investigation and explore all possibilities. ""I would continue to ask people to please come forward with any information they have, no matter how insignificant or small they feel it may be. It could prove to be vital to the investigation and in finding Libby."" Officers were seen searching bins and drains in the area Miss Squire, who is 5ft 7in tall and has long dark brown hair, had been wearing a black leather jacket, black long-sleeved top and a black denim skirt with lace. The University of Hull has said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the missing student and was working closely with police.

US rapper 21 Savage 'to be deported to UK',"21 Savage attended the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards Atlanta rapper 21 Savage has been arrested by US immigration officials who say he is actually from the UK. The rapper, Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, came to the US in July 2005 aged 12 and failed to leave when his visa expired a year later, officials said. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesman said he was in the country illegally and a convicted felon. In previous interviews, Abraham-Joseph has described a childhood in Atlanta. 21 questions about 21 Savage In an interview with Fader magazine in 2016he said he had first seen a gun at the age of eight,external- although the article did not specify where this incident had taken place. The 26-year-old is also quoted as saying he was expelled from school in Atlanta aged about 12 or 13 for taking a gun to class. Allow Twitter content?

She said he was a ""role model"" due to his work on financial literacy programs with underprivileged youth. By Kameron Virk, BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat reporter in Atlanta Having just released a hugely popular album that's been praised for its introspection, storytelling, and maturity, 21 Savage is at the peak of his career. Atlanta is arguably the centre of hip-hop in the US and, by extension, the world. He's considered one of the city's greatest - and Atlanta through and through. The rapper is known in the city as a person who frequently donates to charitable causes. He launched his own campaign promoting financial literacy in children on the Ellen show. His raps have mostly painted pictures of a violent upbringing in Atlanta surrounded by drugs and guns, something which up until now nobody had questioned. But his arrest by ICE and links to the UK have definitely left people in the city confused. A fan in Atlanta told the BBC he was treating the details of Savage 21's case with scepticism: ""I find that very hard to believe that he moved from England on his own to Atlanta."" ""He's an icon for here,"" said another fan in the state of Georgia's capital. ""He's making great music. We're losing someone big."" 21 Savage performed onstage during Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest There are 10.6 million undocumented immigrants in the US, according to the Center for Migration Studies. That represents 3.25% of the US population. Although President Donald Trump has blamed the southern border for illegal immigration, most actually arises because people overstay their visas (tourist or other temporary permits). More than 700,000 people who entered the US legally overstayed their expected departure date in 2018, according to the Department of Homeland Security. In the same year, some 396,000 people were held in immigration detention, and some 256,000 people were deported by authorities. Allow Twitter content?

The rapper, who has collaborated with the likes of Cardi B, Drake and Offset has enjoyed more success in the US than the UK, but is probably best known for the song Rockstar, in which he features with Post Malone. The song reached number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Top 40 and has been streamed on Spotify more than 1.4 billion times. It is also currently nominated for record of the year and best rap/sung performance at the Grammy Awards. His latest album peaked at 33 in the UK, whilst his only other UK Top 40 hit is with Cardi B, for the song Bartier Cardi. Fans expressed concerns over 21 Savage's situation on social media, while others were quick to make memes and poke fun at the revelation. But singer Demi Lovato was in hot water after she said in a now-deleted Tweet: ""So far 21 savage memes have been my favourite part of the Super Bowl."" Other rappers called out Lovato's reaction as insensitive. American rapper Wale asked how a person's freedom could be funny, tweeting, ""I don't get the joke."" He added that when Lovato was going through a rough time, people were supportive of her, not mocking. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

MPs to discuss backstop alternatives,"Tory MPs Iain Duncan Smith, Nicky Morgan and Steve Baker are all in the meeting at the Cabinet Office Tory MPs have met the government to discuss alternative arrangements to the proposed Irish border ""backstop"", as three days of talks begin. The Alternative Arrangements Working Group, with Leave and Remain MPs, met for the first time after the Commons voted to find another way of avoiding the return of Irish border checks. A government spokesman said the talks had been ""detailed and constructive"". But EU leaders have continued to rule out making changes to the backstop. The Irish PM Leo Varadkar told RTE radio the UK was reviewing ideas that had ""already been rejected"", and it was ""very frustrating"" that the UK government was ""going back to the idea of technology"". Brexit: A really simple guide Katya Adler: EU digs heels in over Brexit deal How ready is UK for a no-deal Brexit? Brexit: All you need to know Is Labour softening on freedom of movement? But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU would listen to proposals to solve the Irish border ""riddle"", although they needed to hear how the UK wanted to do it. The backstop is an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit. Number 10 said the working group of Conservative MPs was set up following ""significant support"" for the so-called ""Malthouse Compromise"" - named after housing minister Kit Malthouse who encouraged talks between different groups of MPs. Engineered by both Leavers and Remainers, the proposal includes extending the transition period for a year until the end of 2021 and protecting EU citizens' rights, instead of using the backstop. Please upgrade your browser Members of the working group include Conservative MPs Steve Baker, Marcus Fysh, Owen Paterson, Damian Green and Nicky Morgan. The group will hold regular meetings with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, as well as senior government officials from HMRC, Cabinet Office Europe Unit and Number 10. Mr Fysh said the group had spoken to the EU and it was ""very open"" to the proposals, adding that they were not based on new technology. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said the group had explored the proposal ""in detail"" on the first day of talks. The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said the government's willingness to provide civil service support to this group of Conservative MPs was an indication of how seriously Downing Street was treating their idea. The backstop insurance policy would kick in if, after almost two years after Brexit, the two sides had not reached a trade agreement with one another that avoided the need for physical border checks. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU and leave Northern Ireland effectively in the EU's single market for goods. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Critics fear the UK could be ""trapped"" in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals on goods with the rest of the world. Unionists also fear it would drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But by changing the backstop, the PM could win support. Ex-Northern Ireland first minister Lord Trimble has said he is planning to take the government to court over the Brexit deal, claiming the Northern Ireland protocol - which includes the backstop - breaches the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Mrs May will visit Northern Ireland on Tuesday to deliver a speech on Brexit and meet business leaders. What are the new ideas for the Irish backstop? Read more: Could technology solve the Irish border problem? Alternatives to the backstop that the prime minister has said she wants to discuss with EU leaders include: a ""trusted trader"" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border ""mutual recognition"" of rules with the EU ""technological"" solutions This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Alternative Brexit backstop ""can be done"" Mr Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that an alternative arrangement to the Irish backstop ""can be done"" using ""existing technology"". He said the attorney general was ""leading on another strand of work"" - looking at whether a ""hard time limit or proper exit mechanism"" was possible. UK 'still safe in no-deal Brexit' - Javid Sheep farmers' post-Brexit tariff fears Customs checks simplified for no-deal Brexit The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, when the two-year time limit on withdrawal negotiations enforced by the Article 50 process expires. Theresa May has said she is ""determined"" to deliver Brexit on time, but a number of cabinet ministers have indicated they would be willing to agree to a short extension to finalise legislation for Brexit. However, a plan to delay Brexit for up to nine months to prevent a no deal - put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper - was voted down by Parliament. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Kier Starmer said he could not see Mrs May negotiating an alternative to the backstop at this late stage, saying the prime minister had effectively ""run down the clock"". Meanwhile, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said contingency plans for Britain's departure from the EU with no deal were ""genuinely astonishing"",in a speech in the US. She warned of food shortages and stockpiling of medicine amid a ""real and growing risk"" of a no deal scenario. Numerous politicians have shut down the idea of looking at the backstop again, saying there was no desire to re-open negotiations on the withdrawal agreement in Brussels. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the EU was not looking for a substitute solution, because they say they've already investigated every other option that exists and none has the same effect as the backstop. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there was ""full agreement"" that the withdrawal agreement ""cannot be reopened"". Allow Twitter content?

Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said the withdrawal agreement rejected by MPs already allowed the EU and UK to work on alternative arrangements for the backstop. He added: ""What Ireland is being asked to do by some in Westminster is to essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK government and EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking and I think that's a very unreasonable request to ask the Irish government to be flexible on."" Speaking during a trip to Japan, German Chancellor Mrs Merkel said: ""To solve this riddle, you have to be creative and you have to listen to one another. ""We can have those conversations... But we must hear from Great Britain how they want to do it."" Labour's Hilary Benn met the Secretary General of the European Commission, Martin Selmayr, in Brussels. Speaking after Monday's meeting, Mr Benn - who chairs the Brexit select committee - said the EU would be prepared to consider an additional legal protocol to the withdrawal agreement if they were convinced it would help a deal get through Parliament. But Mr Selmayr later tweeted,externalthat when asked if such an assurance would help, the response from MPs was ""inconclusive"". He added: ""The meeting confirmed that the EU did well to start its no deal preparations in December 2017."" Leave supporter and Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns - who was also at the meeting - tweeted afterwards that Mr Selmayr revealed the EU had not been asked to remove the backstop or re-open negotiations by the British government.

By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor So. how open does the EU seem almost a week on from parliament narrowly voting in favour of an amendment to find alternatives to the backstop guarantee to keep the Irish border open after Brexit? After all, with every passing day as we've heard, again and again and again, the clock is ticking towards an increased chance of a no-deal Brexit with all the costs and chaos that could involve. Well, if I were to speak in weather forecast terms, I might describe current EU attitudes as frosty with a chance of ice. If Theresa May comes to Brussels later this week, she will be received politely and listened to attentively. But if her EU ask remains centred around getting a time limit to, or allowing the UK a unilateral get-out mechanism from, the Irish border backstop or if she pushes again for pure technology as a means of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, then the likelihood of her being sent home empty-handed - or as good as - is very high indeed.

Cystic fibrosis drug deadlock 'must end',"This video can not be played Luis tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme: âI wish I could just have a normal life"" The government must use its powers to break a deadlock in making a life-extending drug available to people with cystic fibrosis, campaigners say. Vertex, which makes Orkambi, has refused a Â£500m offer for the drug over five years - the ""largest commitment"" the NHS has ever made. Those affected want other drug firms to be asked to make a cheaper version. The Department of Health said its approach ""remains urging Vertex to accept NHS England's generous offer"". Vertex said it was ""determined to find a solution that allows the NHS to provide patient access to our precision medicines across the UK with budget certainty, and also allows Vertex to continue its research and focus on a cure for CF [cystic fibrosis] and other serious diseases"". It currently charges Â£100,000 for a year's treatment with Orkambi. Luis has previously written to the drug company and Prime Minister Theresa May Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening genetic condition that causes fatal lung damage and affects around 10,400 people in the UK. Only around half of those with the condition live to celebrate their 40th birthday. Christina Walker's son Luis, eight, was born with it. She told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmehis medical regime takes up to four hours a day. ""Every day he takes 22 tablets, three nebulisers, two inhalers, nasal sprays and lots of supplements,"" she said. ""Those are the good days. ""A bad day will see Luis in hospital. A cough or cold will have turned serious, his lung function will plummet, he'll be off school for weeks, missing not just classes, but birthdays and time spent with friends - the little things that make being eight years old so much fun. ""Or it might be like last week when he had a stomach bug and was reduced to skin and bones as his weak body sheds the tiny amount of weight he'd been able to put on previously."" The drug Orkambi is licensed to treat cystic fibrosis in patients from two-year-olds to adults, who have a specific genetic mutation known as F508del. This causes the production of an abnormal protein that disrupts how water and chloride are transported in the body. The drug has been shown in clinical trials to improve lung function and respiratory symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. It is the first of a string of drugs that have been developed, with newer ones expected to be even more effective. Ms Walker said for Luis it would be ""life-changing"". The manufacturers Vertex Pharmaceuticals want the NHS to pay Â£105,000 per patient per year, and have rejected the NHS's offer of Â£500m over five years. Campaigners want the government to set aside Vertex's patent to allow cheaper versions of Orkambi to be made. This is backed by Conservative MP Bill Wiggin, who will ask the government to invoke Crown Use in an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on Monday - which would allow this to happen. Vertex said in a statement: ""To invoke Crown Use and provide third parties access to Vertex's intellectual property would seriously undermine our ability to achieve these goals and would significantly weaken incentives for future innovation."" Eight-year-old Luis has been given a life expectancy of 38 Ms Walker - who campaigns on the issue - told Victoria Derbyshire: ""[Other] suppliers are making the drug already for Â£5,000."" She added: ""We have a chance for [Luis's] future to be different."" The Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement that ""it is absolutely right that patients should have access to cost-effective, innovative medicines on the NHS at a price we can afford. ""Despite being offered in the region of Â£500m over five years - the largest ever commitment of its kind in the 70-year history of the NHS - Vertex has refused to accept, putting Orkambi out of reach of patients. ""We're aware there may be other avenues open to resolve this issue, but our approach remains urging Vertex to accept NHS England's generous offer."" A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""We understand how difficult it must be for families affected by cystic fibrosis. ""This is why it is so important that as with all companies seeking NHS approval for treatments of this kind, Vertex must fully engage with the NICE [The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] process.""

Backlash at 'single-shaming' banking ad,"Financial technology company Revolut has been accused of ""single-shaming"" after its current promotional campaign sparked a backlash on Twitter. The company, which launched in 2015, bills itself as an alternative to banks and offers app-based current accounts. One ad highlighted the number of people who ordered a takeaway meal for one on Valentine's Day last year. After it was criticised as ""intrusive"" and ""tone-deaf"", Revolut has apologised and said it did not mean to poke fun. Financial commentator Iona Bain, who was among the first people to draw attention to the ads, said it was patronising and unworthy of a firm trying to attract young, tech-savvy customers. ""It doesn't tell you anything about the service,"" she told the BBC. ""It just says they will spy on your spending, so people can laugh at your poor unfortunate single status later on."" Iona Bain is founder of the Young Money Blog Ms Bain, founder ofthe Young Money Blog,external, tweeted that the ad's language was ""more redolent of early 2000s Bridget Jones"" than ""a modern and empowered fintech brand"". ""I knew a lot of people would agree with me, but I have been surprised by the amount of responses,"" she said. She said that those supporting her comments included widows who found such ads unhelpful at this time of year. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Foreign skiers die in Italian avalanche,"Alpine rescue teams on foot work through the deep snow near Courmayeur British and French skiers are among four people found dead after an avalanche near the Italian resort of Courmayeur on Monday. Two people from the UK and two from France were reported missing on Sunday afternoon, when the risk of avalanches in the area was high. Searchers found all four bodies on Monday after a lengthy search. In all, eight people, including a Belgian snowboarder, died in Italy as a result of weekend avalanches. Italy's Ansa news agency said the four dead discovered on Monday were a 39-year-old originally from New Zealand and a 43-year-old originally from Switzerland, who both lived in London; and a 36-year-old Frenchman and a 38-year old Polish man who both lived in France. At least one was a British national. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) earlier said it was ""supporting the family of a British man who has been reported missing, and are in contact with the Italian search and rescue team.""

Italian newspaper La Repubblica said the alarm had been raised by friends of the two skiers from Britain at around noon on Sunday, when the pair failed to arrive at a meeting point. They were on the last day of their holiday, the newspaper said. Italian media also reported that the skiers had gone off-piste in Vel Veny - meaning they were not skiing on the slopes carefully managed by the nearby resort. Search operations were hampered by the continuing risk of avalanches, preventing search teams from going on foot, and search efforts had to temporarily suspended on Sunday. The fourth victim was found on Monday afternoon, hours after the earlier discovery of three bodies, some distance away. Two other avalanche victims had been found dead earlier on Sunday in the same region - the Aosta Valley. Several Italian residents were among the eight killed at the weekend, local media report. The national alpine rescue group has encouraged snowsport enthusiasts to check what level of avalanche warning is in effect every day, and to ""carry out all activities with the greatest caution"".

FGM 'being performed on UK babies',"Dr Charlotte Proudman says FGM performed on babies is ""almost impossible"" for the authorities to detect Female genital mutilation (FGM) is increasingly being performed on babies and infants in the UK, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has been told. FGM expert and barrister Dr Charlotte Proudman said it was ""almost impossible to detect"" as the girls were not in school or old enough to report it. In one report, in Yorkshire, a victim was just one month old. The National FGM Centre said it was ""not surprised"" that victims may be younger now. Charity Barnardo's and the Local Government Association - which together run the centre - said its community engagement was ""key to protecting girls"". Their comments follow the first UK conviction for FGM. The mother of a three-year-old girl was found guilty at the Old Bailey on Friday of mutilating her daughter. Her partner was acquitted. FGM includes the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Dr Proudman said there was ""a lot of anecdotal data which shows FGM is now being performed on babies. ""These girls are not at school, they are not at nursery, and so it's very difficult for any public authority to become aware,"" she added. ""By performing it at such a young age, they're evading the law."" In response to a Freedom of Information request, West Yorkshire Police said a quarter of its FGM reports (17) between 2015 and 2017 involved victims aged three or under. The National FGM Centre said there was ""anecdotal evidence from some communities that FGM laws can be circumnavigated by performing the procedure on girls at a much younger age"". ""The girls are unable to report, the cut heals quicker and prosecution is much harder once evidence comes to light and the girl is older. ""There needs to be much greater recognition of this issue across different areas of the UK."" Experts say authorities need a more joined-up approach when dealing with FGM. It is claimed children's services can be unsure when to intervene. Doctors are not always reporting it to the police - and even if they do, officers do not always know what to do. ""People are concerned about cultural sensitivities, worried about being branded racist, and it's being performed on a very private area,"" Dr Proudman said, explaining why it has taken many years for the first UK conviction to arrive. Figures seen by the Victoria Derbyshire programme show that 939 calls were made to emergency services to report FGM between 2014 and 2018. But the Crown Prosecution Service has only received 36 referrals for FGM from the police since 2010. One 2015 report by City, University of London,externalestimated 137,000 women and girls in England have been victims of FGM. This video can not be played Hibo Wadere on FGM: 'The cruellest thing' Hibo Wadere was six when she was forced to undergo FGM. Some may find her words distressing. Ms Wadere said she was told a special party was being thrown for her. She described how that morning she was ""held down, your legs yanked apart and your genitals being ripped apart. ""You saw the blood, you saw the cutter with blood on her hands,"" she added. ""She just kept on cutting as if it was normal for her to hear the screams. ""It was the cruellest thing for a child to experience. ""It stays with you for life. It's a life sentence."" Lawyer Linda Weil-Curiel, whose work has led to more than 100 FGM convictions in France, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme the UK should follow the country's tougher stance. In France, all children undergo regular genital checks until the age of six and doctors are expected to report any cases of physical abuse. ""In [the UK] system you need the victim to come and complain, but how can you expect a child to complain against her parents?,"" she asked. ""It's for society to protect children, to take the initiative as soon as mutilation is documented - and the only way that happens is to have a medical examination. Linda Weil-Curiel's work has led to more than 100 FGM convictions in France ""There might be people horrified at the thought of their child undergoing a check. I don't understand that - we are talking about the health of children and babies,"" she added. But the National FGM Centre said the key way to prevent instances of the abuse was to change ""the views of affected communities"" and to form ""a huge cultural shift in groups where FGM is commonly practised"". It said it was helping to train professionals to be ""aware of how to broach the topic, spot the signs and respond appropriately when there is a concern"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We will not tolerate FGM and not rest until perpetrators of this horrific crime are brought to justice. He said the UK's first conviction for FGM came after ""the government introduced tougher rules to criminalise this medieval practice.""

'Ground-breaking' pay deal for Hermes staff,"Hermes, the delivery firm, has struck a deal with the GMB union to offer couriers paid holiday and guaranteed wage rates. Under its new ""self-employed plus"" status, Hermes workers can opt to receive up to 28 days of paid leave. They can also choose pay rates of at least Â£8.50 an hour over the year - more than the minimum wage of Â£7.83 an hour, which rises to Â£8.21 in April. The GMB called the deal ""ground-breaking"". However an employment expert raised questions about the tax implications. Hermes's 15,000 couriers can deliver parcels in whichever order they want and will be able to continue to do so if they take up the new arrangement. New couriers wishing to take up the pay holiday terms will have to follow routes specified by Hermes. The company said that if it is guaranteeing hourly rates of pay, it needs to ensure that couriers are taking the most efficient route. Why so many young workers have 'side hustles' Does flexible working come at a cost? Uber loses latest legal bid over driver rights The GMB said that the collective bargaining agreement is on an opt-in basis and ""will not affect those couriers who wish to retain their current form of self-employed status and earn premium rates"". Martijn de Lange, chief executive of Hermes UK, said: ""We have listened to our couriers and are wholeheartedly committed to offering innovative ways of working to meet peoples' differing needs."" The so-called gig economy means that people are paid for the ""gigs"" they do such as delivering a parcel or a car journey, rather than their time. Some workers are pushing companies to offer better conditions such as paid leave and the minimum wage. But Matthew Taylor, author ofan independent review in 2017 into working practices, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that Hermes' new arrangement could raise questions about whether it was ""sustainable"" as it may be of interest to HM Revenue & Customs. ""I'm afraid.. I think the HMRC...will be looking at this very closely because if somebody has most of the benefits of being an employee and if the employer has most of the benefits of employing somebody, then the tax authorities will want the employee to be paying national insurance as an employee and they'll want the company in particular to be paying national insurance on those people,"" he said. Hermes said it was ""totally surprised"" by Mr Taylor's comments and ""100% disagreed"" with them.  It said Hermes had received legal advice that under its new offer its couriers would remain self-employed. Mark Rix, GMB's national officer told the BBC that there were tax implications only for those receiving a ""full suite"" of benefits. Ed Cross has been a Hermes courier for ten years and his route is in North Yorkshire. He says he hasn't had a holiday for ten years, partly because he will no longer have to find someone to cover his route when he is away. ""It's a huge deal because we've been self employed, basically on our own, we've nobody to turn to, if Hermes say 'no' or they treat us wrongly, we have nowhere to go, nothing, up until now."" In December, Uber, the ride-sharing service,lost an appeal against a ruling in 2016which said drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam were entitled to benefits. Uber said it would appeal to the Supreme Court. Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB, said: ""Full credit to Hermes. They're showing that the gig economy doesn't have to be an exploitative economy and we look forward to working with them through this ground-breaking agreement. ""Other employers should take notice, this is how it's done.""

Why US sanctions will hurt,"The United States announced sanctions this week that are intended to produce the most damage possible to the government of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro: the oil sector and its state company, PDVSA. Up until now White House executive orders were only targeting government officials and certain sectors of the economy. Now new sanctions will finally hurt the one sector that is responsible for more than 90% of the government's revenues. Many outstanding contracts are still expected to be honoured in the coming days, but new deals with PDVSA are being subjected to restrictions. From April sanctions are expected to kick in. A new phase in the Venezuela crisis started last month when Washington recognised opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ - who is the leader of the National Assembly - as the rightful head of state. Venezuela's Congress, which has been stripped of most of its powers by the government, says Mr Maduro is a ""usurper"". Washington has embarked on an open campaign with Mr GuaidÃ³ to oust Mr Maduro. The White House is trying to do a difficult thing: to make oil revenues directly reach ordinary Venezuelans and bypass the government of Mr Maduro, which owns most of the oil industry through PDVSA. Sanctions are meant to oust Mr Maduro and lead to new elections in Venezuela. The opposition led by Juan GuaidÃ³ is trying to set up a parallel government US National Security Adviser John Bolton says the US wants oil revenue to reach Mr GuaidÃ³, giving his National Assembly some economic power to combat Mr Maduro. One of the ways of doing so is through PDVSA-owned refineries based in Texas, through a subsidiary called Citgo. Mr Bolton has already met Citgo executives and there is an effort to change its management with executives appointed by Mr GuaidÃ³'s National Assembly. In effect the opposition is trying to set up a parallel government to Mr Maduro's with its own cabinet. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Maduro: Dictator or defender of socialism? Mr Bolton said the sanctions would block $7bn (Â£5.4bn) in PDVSA's assets and more than $11bn in lost export proceeds over the next year. At this stage, with Venezuela's oil output on a downward spiral and the country facing severe shortages, sanctions have the power to be ""calamitous for Venezuelan finances"", says Helima Croft from RBS Capital Markets. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro still has significant support But some analysts believe Mr Maduro still has a few options. ""The oil that Venezuela currently exports to the US will be diverted to other countries and sold at lower prices. For countries like China and India, the news was akin to Black Monday. They will be able to pick up these oil volumes at great discounts,"" writes Venezuelan-born analyst Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, from Rystad Energy. She adds that the impact of sanctions will be substantially lower than the ones predicted by Washington. Venezuela exports to the US about 450,000 barrels of oil per day, a little under half of its total output. This is the amount of new oil that will flood the markets. Venezuela's market share in the US will be up for grabs, favouring Saudi, Mexican and Iraqi oil companies. Mrs Rodriguez-Masiu says that so far, oil markets have largely shrugged off this new oversupply as investors have been pricing in Venezuela's crisis for a long time. China and Turkey are some of the government's main allies but Russia is today seen as the key player. Moscow has repeatedly provided financial lifelines to Caracas at times when the country was about to face serious defaults. Who is supporting whom in Venezuela? Why Russia has so much to lose Turkey warned over Venezuela gold trade But it hasn't acted purely out of friendship alone. Russia's oil company Rosneft (which itself has been subject to US sanctions since 2014 because of the Ukraine crisis) already has a 49% stake in Citgo. It also has some collateral on Citgo, which means it could seize control of the refineries in Texas were Venezuela's government to run into trouble. Washington has its own grievances with Russia and it is not happy about the prospects of Rosneft gaining a foothold in refineries in Texas. It is unclear whether the US can successfully redivert resources from Mr Maduro to Mr GuaidÃ³. Idriss Jazairy, a special UN rapporteur who reports to the Human Rights Council, says the people of Venezuela are the ones who will ultimately bear the brunt of sanctions. ""Sanctions which can lead to starvation and medical shortages are not the answer to the crisis in Venezuela,"" he said. ""Precipitating an economic and humanitarian crisis is not a foundation for the peaceful settlement of disputes."" Mr Bolton said on Friday that the US would send humanitarian aid, medicine, surgical supplies and nutritional supplements for the people of Venezuela. But it is unclear whether it can successfully circumvent the Maduro government. These sanctions could last for quite a while, and they depend largely on a political solution to the stand-off between the opposition and Mr Maduro. In the past, the US had been hesitant about imposing sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry because it knows this has the potential to seriously affect living standards of ordinary people, which are already low. This video can not be played Desperate Venezuelan women are selling their hair at the border Now Washington is in uncharted territory, because it still has to work out in detail how to make oil revenues and humanitarian aid reach Mr GuaidÃ³ and the National Assembly. The end goal is to force Mr Maduro out of power either through a negotiated solution or by giving incentives for a military coup. With Mr GuaidÃ³ leading the charge with protests in Venezuela and a wide range of international support - which includes the European Union and regional players like Brazil, Argentina and Colombia - Washington hopes it won't be long before it achieves its goals. But these sanctions could be a dangerous gamble. In the past, US action in Venezuela helped Mr Maduro - and President Hugo ChÃ¡vez before him - to rally Venezuelans behind a common enemy, giving them a temporary boost in popularity. That could be the case now. Also, the worsening of living standards now would be directly blamed by Mr Maduro on the US. Furthermore, these actions serve the argument that Mr Maduro has been making: that Mr GuaidÃ³ is a mere puppet of the Americans.

Where they stand on Venezuela,"The ongoing political crisis in Venezuela has divided the international community - some back President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and others support the man challenging him. Juan GuaidÃ³, who is head of the National Assembly, declared himself interim president on 23 January and vowed to oversee fresh elections. Here is a guide to which countries are backing each of them and a look at the possible reasons why. The United States Relations between the US and Venezuela were already fraught before President Trump backed Mr GuaidÃ³ as leader. Why does the military back Maduro? What's behind the political crisis? Profile: Juan GuaidÃ³ Tensions began to grow in 1998 when socialist leader Hugo ChÃ¡vez was elected. ChÃ¡vez overhauled the country's economic system and was increasingly opposed to US foreign policy. Relations have continued to worsen under Mr Maduro who came to power in 2013 after ChÃ¡vez died. The US has criticised Mr Maduro's increased use of the country's courts and security forces to suppress political opposition. They declared his re-election last year as ""illegitimate"" and imposed a raft of economic measures against Venezuela. The US houses about 100,000 Venezuelans - many who oppose Mr Maduro In turn, US sanctions have been used as a scapegoat by Mr Maduro to shift blame for the country's economic woes. Amid a deepening economic crisis, Venezuela has struggled to utilise its supply of the world's largest proven oil reserves. US purchases of that oil have declined sharply - but companies still import about 500,000 barrels from the country daily. This amounts to about 41% of Venezuela's total oil exports, the Associated Press reports. Crucially, unlike other countries that Venezuela is indebted to, American firms pay for that oil in cash. Why US sanctions will hurt Fresh Trump administration sanctions aim to frustrate that source of income by targeting PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company.  Some refineries have already said they will source oil elsewhere. One US company, Citgo, is a subsidiary of PDSVA. Under new sanctions it is only allowed to operate if its earnings are deposited into an account blocked from President Maduro. President Trump has refused to take any option off the table in response to the country's crisis, and his administration had pledged to try and divert oil earnings to Mr GuaidÃ³ instead. European Union countries Austria, Britain, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,  Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Poland, Spain and Sweden all say they recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president. It comes after Mr Maduro ignored an EU ultimatum calling for free, transparent and credible presidential elections. Latin American governments Most have come out in support of opposition leader Mr GuaidÃ³. Unsurprisingly, this includes a number of more right-leaning Latin American nations who would be keen, strategically, to reduce the left's influence in Venezuela. All of the Lima Group, with the exception of Mexico, have voiced their support for the opposition leader. This video can not be played Thousands more leave Venezuela amid new crisis This includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay and Peru. Some of those countries have felt the direct impact of Venezuela's crisis. Amid financial turmoil, hyperinflation and shortages of food - three million Venezuelans have fled across its borders as refugees. Australia,CanadaandIsrael,have also backed Mr GuaidÃ³'s claim. Russia Russia has continued to back President Maduro. It has warned the US against military action, and has accused the country of ""crudely violating norms"" in international law to pursue a course toward ""illegal regime change"" in Venezuela. President Vladimir Putin met with Mr Maduro only last month For an increasingly isolated Mr Maduro - Russia has provided a source of military and economic support. Last monthit flew two nuclear-capable bombers to the regionin a show of support for him. There was even some suggestion in recent days, from the Reuters news agency, that private Russian contractors had been flown in to protect Mr Maduro - though a Kremlin spokesman has denied the report. ""Putin is giving us support on all levels and we have received it with much pleasure and gratitude,"" Mr Maduro told Russian media recently. Economically, Russia has become a crucial lender to Venezuela's stricken economy. Why Russia has so much to lose The government, along with state owned oil company Rosneft, has handed billions of dollars in loans to Mr Maduro's government. Reuters has estimated at least Â£17bn of these have been credited since 2006. In recent days, Russian officials have made clear they expect Venezuela to continue its repayments, despite the deepening crisis. Part of the collateral Rosneft has over its loans to PDVSA comes in the form of a 49.9% stake in US oil firm Citgo - a potential source of further tension between the US and Russia if it moves to seize those assets. China Though Russia has invested heavily in the country, China is by far Venezuela's largest foreign creditor. Chinese companies have invested billions in projects in the Latin American nation, including in oil ventures. The country is estimated to have supplied more than $62bn in loans since 2007 - a third of which is reportedly outstanding. President Xi Jinping pledged to help Venezuela In September last year, President Xi Jinping promised to ""provide whatever help it can offer"" to the struggling nation - and extended another $5bn credit line. Responding to escalating tensions, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called on ""all parties to remain rational and keep calm"" to reach a peaceful political settlement. ""China opposes foreign forces from interfering into Venezuela affairs,"" she said, clarifying their support of Mr Maduro. Both China and Russia serve as permanent members, with veto powers, at the UN Security Council. After the crisis was brought up at the UN by the US, both countries' ambassadors criticised international interference in Venezuela's internal affairs. Cuba Cuba is also a strong supporter of Mr Maduro's position as president. With similar ideologies, the two countries are allies whose governments have become increasingly interdependent across the last two decades. A billboard in Havana shows the close friendship between Castro and Chavez Venezuela has reportedly subsidised oil exports to Cuba in exchange for support in areas like medicine and military advisors. Luis Almagro, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), likened the depth of Cuba's military support to Venezuela as an ""occupation army"" - estimating the number is as high as 15,000. At the Security Council, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Cuba of having ""directly made things worse"" in Venezuela. The country's foreign minister reacted furiously, accusing Washington of designing, financing and arranging the ""alleged usurpation"" of the Venezuelan presidency through Mr GuaidÃ³. Longstanding socialist allies Nicaragua and Bolivia have voiced direct support for President Maduro. Mexico has said it will maintain a position of ""neutrality"" but said ""there is no change in its diplomatic relations"" with the government. Maduro: Dictator or defender of socialism? How Venezuelans stave off hunger Venezuela's crisis in nine charts It and Uruguay have issued a joint statement asking all sides to defuse tensions and find a peaceful solution to the crisis Turkey Mr Maduro also has a backer in Turkey. The two countries' leaders have embarked on a flurry of recent visits and trade agreements with each other. Fury over Venezuela leader's Salt Bae 'feast' President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who survived an attempt to thwart his own power in 2016, has told Mr Maduro to ""stand tall"". ""You will respect the results of elections. Trump's remarks shocked me, as someone who believes in democracy,"" he told a press conference on Thursday.

Why Russia has so much to lose,"As the political and economic pressure on NicolÃ¡s Maduro mounts, Venezuela's president believes there is one person he can rely on - Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has accused the opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ of an ""illegal attempt to seize power"", backed by the United States. Moscow says it will do ""everything required"" to support NicolÃ¡s Maduro as Venezuela's ""legitimate president"". But Russia's appetite for protecting relations with Caracas may be more limited than its rhetoric suggests. Moscow has long been a key ally of President Maduro, and Hugo ChÃ¡vez before him - as fierce critics of Washington, right in America's backyard. ""The relationship is symbolically important. It's about saying 'we're not alone, there are others who are very critical of the US and Western policy',"" explains Andrei Kortunov of the Russian International Affairs Council. That's partly why Moscow has expanded co-operation with Caracas in recent years - increasing arms sales, extending credit and even flying in two bombers last December in a show of support. Venezuela's defence minister welcomed the two long-range Russian bombers when they flew to Caracas in December Its backing for NicolÃ¡s Maduro in the current crisis is also fuelled by a horror of popular uprisings, particularly those supported openly by the West. More on the Venezuela crisis: Who is supporting whom in Venezuela? All you need to know in nine charts Why Venezuela's military is backing Maduro What's behind Venezuela's political crisis? Will the US target Venezuelan oil? ""Unpopular social policies, an impoverished population and economic crisis - against a background of battling the whole world and corruptâ¦ politicians. Guess which country this refers to?"" independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta wondered this week. It was drawing the parallels with Russia that it believes the Kremlin sees - and fears - in Caracas. Moscow also has money at stake. It has sunk significant amounts into backing NicolÃ¡s Maduro, much of that in loans it stands to lose if he is forced from office. The full extent of Russia's exposure isn't clear. This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains Analysts talk of $17bn (Â£13bn), mostly dished out in credit to the Maduro government. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to put a figure on it when questioned by journalists earlier this week. He was even more tight-lipped on whether Russia worried about losing that investment. ""I won't respond to that,"" Mr Peskov said. Venezuela sits on the largest proven oil reserves in the world. ""When we sent weapons, no-one thought of collecting the debt. What was really in mind, I think, was access to the oil wells, to production,"" argues Carnegie Centre economist Andrei Movchan. Russia's state-owned firm, Rosneft, now has stakes in multiple projects in Venezuela and has issued significant loans to the country's oil giant, PDVSA. Rosneft's chief executive Igor Sechin (L) has overseen much of Russia's oil investment in Venezuela ""Venezuela was in a bad shape, so it was easy to agree terms,"" Mr Movchan says. But whilst state television programmes here have been blasting headlines, slamming the US ""intervening in the affairs of a sovereign state"", others have been questioning the wisdom of Russia's own Venezuela policy. ""Venezuela is a black hole for Russia, where billions of dollars have been sunkâ¦ and the effect is zero,"" analyst Mikhail Krutikin told Kommersant newspaper. He talked of ""utter incompetence and squandering."" This video can not be played Juan GuaidÃ³: ""Maduro's regime is killing young, poor people on the streets"" ""It's a very unfortunate situation,"" Andrei Kortunov says. ""We knew this was coming, so I wonder what the fall-back position is of those who invested there, but I don't see it."" Russia is now advocating political negotiations in Venezuela, with international mediation. It presents the opposition, and the US, as intransigent for continuing to call for fresh elections. Meanwhile, with no sign of imminent mass defection by the military, reports have emerged suggesting Moscow may be upping its support for NicolÃ¡s Maduro. As fresh US sanctions were imposed on Caracas this week, Novaya Gazeta suggested that Russia had helped fly Venezuelan gold from storage in the Russian Central Bank for sale in Dubai. Turkey warned over Venezuela gold trade Venezuela's GuaidÃ³ says family threatened Spat over Russian bombers in Venezuela The paper's sources claimed over $1bn in cash was then taken on to Caracas. The Central Bank chairwoman said that did not ""correspond to reality"". There have also been reports that Moscow has deployed private military contractors, possibly as protection for President Maduro. The Kremlin has rebutted that, too, though Mr Maduro himself was simply evasive. ""I'm not making any comment,"" he told Russian reporters this week. The foreign ministry pledge to do ""everything"" to back NicolÃ¡s Maduro does seem to have limits. ""I don't think Russia would defend Maduro militarily. We are for a political settlement,"" argues retired Lieutenant-General Evgeny Buzhinsky. He describes those bombers sent to Caracas last year as simply ""symbolic"". One Russian tabloid mocked the number of opposition protesters who turned out on Wednesday ""It would be madness for Russia to try to intervene with force,"" Andrei Movchan agrees. ""Venezuela is not Syria. The Chinese are there and the Americans are much closer."" At least in public, Russia has settled for condemning US pressure, calling for dialogue - and waiting. Perhaps it is hoping its ally can weather the storm. As one tabloid newspaper here argued, opposition rallies on Wednesday were smaller than expected. ""They heldthe decisive protest- and then they called the next one,"" Komsomolskaya Pravda joked, suggesting ""something went wrong"". Another paper, though, is convinced President Maduro's days in office are numbered, suggesting the Kremlin should simply offer ""its friend"" political asylum. ""The long, cold Moscow winter is not ideal of course for Maduro, used to palm trees and a year-round average of 25C,"" Moskovsky Komsomolets reasoned. ""But it's still better than a warm prison cell in Caracas."" What's behind Venezuela's political crisis?

Debenhams may close stores this year,"Debenhams is exploring a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) which could bring forward the closure of around 20 of its department stores this year. The company is in talks with its banks to increase its borrowings ahead of a quarterly rent payment due on 25 March. A CVA would allow Debenhams to renegotiate its rent with landlords and speed up shop closure plans. It is understood that the company is running out of headroom on its Â£520m borrowing facilities with its banks. Debenhams closure plan threatens 4,000 jobs Debenhams 'trying to make shopping fun again' Christmas retail winners and losers Debenhams declined to comment on store closure plans. The department store chain announced in October that it was increasing its store closure plans from 10 to 50 shops - putting 4,000 jobs at risk - which would take place between three and five years. At the time Debenhams said it was not ready to release a list of those stores it was looking to shut. However, under a CVA, that closure programme would be accelerated and 20 shops could be shut in 2019. It is expected to update shareholders on its progress within the next few weeks. Debenhams has 165 stores and employs around 25,000 people. Sergio Bucher was recently voted off Debenhams' board but continues as chief executive High Street retailers have been under increasing pressure as more people choose to shop online and visit stores less. Debenhams reported a record pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m last year and more recently said sales had fallen sharply over Christmas. Last year, House of Fraser fell into administration before Mike Ashley, the billionaire Sports Direct founder, bought the department store's assets for Â£90m. Mr Ashley is also a major shareholder in Debenhams, with a 29% stake, and he recently joined together with investor Landmark Group to vote the retailer's chairman and chief executive off the board. Sergio Bucher is continuing as chief executive of Debenhams but will no longer sit on the board while Sir Ian Cheshire stepped down immediately as chairman.

The man behind the Sala search?,"David Mearns is a renowned marine scientist and oceanographer David Mearns has become the face of the private search for the plane which was carrying Argentine footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson. The Piper Malibu N264DB, which went missing on 21 January on its way from Nantes, France, to Cardiff, wasfound in the English Channel on Sunday. Mr Mearns stepped in to lead a privately-funded search, and located the wreckage within a couple of hours. But who is the man nicknamed the ""shipwreck hunter""? Found: The plane wreck that could solve a 50-year-old mystery Sonar mapping project highlights sunken ships Lottery grant to fund WWI shipwreck search project American-born Mr Mearns has helped solve a number of major maritime mysteries. The UK-based marine scientist and oceanographer led the successful hunt forHMS Hoodand claims to have spearheaded a further 20 historic discoveries. Using sonar technology and remote-controlled submersibles, the expeditions have also set records by finding wrecks at extreme depths. HMS Hood during a dockyard refit at Portsmouth in 1930 The Bismarck sent up a wall of ""plunging fire"" which penetrated the weak deck armour of HMS Hood when it was sunk in the Denmark Strait One of Britain's greatest battleships, Hood was sunk by the German navy's Bismarck in May 1941, killing 1,415 men. HMS Hood's remains were found at a depth of 3,000m in the Denmark Strait, between Greenland and Iceland, in 2001. He has continued to make significant discoveries around the world with his company,Blue Water Recoveries,external. In 2008, Mr Mearns led a successful search for the HMAS Sydney, pictured here before it was sunk in November 1941 In 2008 Mr Mearns led the successful search forHMAS Sydney,external, an Australian navy battlecruiser sunk by the Germans off the continent's west coast in November 1941, killing more than 700. And in 2015 his company announced they had found a wreck believed to be theEsmerelda, a ship fromVasco Da Gama's fleet thought to have sunk off the coast of Oman in May 1503. Mr Mearns has also co-ordinated searches for some more modern nautical enigmas. In the early 1990s, he assisted a criminal probe into the foundering of the Lucona, a cargo ship blown up in the Indian Ocean in 1997, killing six men, as part of an insurance scam. He has also been instrumental in searches that have defied the odds. They include locating the SS Rio Grande, the deepest shipwreck ever found. The World War Two German supply ship, sunk by the Americans in 1944, was discovered around three and a half miles below the waves of the south Atlantic Ocean in 1996.

Cushions 'from missing plane' found,"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson (right) An underwater search for footballer Emiliano Sala's plane will take place after cushions were found on a beach. They were discovered near Surtainville on France's Cotentin Peninsula, on Monday, by French authorities. Following this, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has identified an area of four square nautical miles for a search. The plane disappeared with Sala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, on board last week. Nantes pay tribute to missing Sala Due to weather and sea conditions, an underwater search is not expected to start until the end of the week and will take up to three days, an AAIB spokesman said. Unverified photographs of cushions, taken on Wednesday, were captured by a woman taking a walk on the beach near Surtainville. Investigators believe the two seat cushions pictured came from the aircraft. Josette Bernard shows a photograph she took of debris she found on the beach at Surtainville This unverified image shows a cushion which was found on the beach, believed to be from the plane Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson were flying on The AAIB will now use sonar equipment to locate any wreckage on the sea bed. A spokesman said French safety authorities found the two seat cushions, which preliminary examinations suggested were likely from the missing aircraft. Following this, detailed assessments of the flight path and last known radar position were carried out, which identified the search area. The PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft Sala and Mr Ibbotson were on board Through the Ministry of Defence's salvage and marine operations team, a special survey vessel has now been commissioned to look for wreckage. If it is found, a remotely operated vehicle will be sent down to examine it. Emiliano Sala: Tributes to striker at Arsenal v Cardiff game Emiliano Sala's family view search area off Guernsey Argentine Sala signed for Cardiff City and was travelling from Nantes, where he previously played, when the flight was lost over the English channel. An official search for it was called off with Guernsey officials saying there was little chance those on board survived, however,more than Â£290,000 was raisedfor a private search to continue. The cushions were found on a stretch of the Normandy coast near Surtainville ""We are aware that a privately operated search is also being conducted in the area,"" an AAIB statement said.

EU powers recognise GuaidÃÂ³ as leader,"This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa The UK, France, Germany, Spain and other European countries have officially recognised opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as interim president of Venezuela. It comes after President NicolÃ¡s Maduro defiantly rejected a deadline they set for Sunday to call fresh elections. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim leader last month and won US backing. Russia - a backer of Mr Maduro - accused EU countries of meddling in Venezuela's affairs. Who is supporting whom in Venezuela? Why Venezuela's military backs Maduro On Sunday Mr Maduro dismissed calls for a new presidential vote, saying he would not accept ""ultimatums"". He has denounced Mr GuaidÃ³'s move as a coup. As head of Venezuela's National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ says the constitution allows him to assume power temporarily when the president is deemed illegitimate. After Sunday's deadline passed, a flurry of statements was issued by France, the UK, Germany and Spain and the other countries that now recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president. Many of them pressed Mr Maduro to call new elections. Mr GuaidÃ³'s mother was among the crowds at protests on Saturday French President Emmanuel Macron said Venezuelans had the right to ""express themselves freely and democratically"",external, announcing his support for an EU contact group. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Venezuela ""should be the author of its own destiny"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said that ""further steps"" were being considered, including the use of sanctions, without outlining what form any possible sanctions might take. While a majority of EU members back Mr GuaidÃ³, others such as Greece and Ireland called for fresh elections but stopped short of recognising him. Russia has attacked Monday's statements, accusing EU countries of interfering in Venezuela's affairs and attempting to ""legitimise usurped power"". By Gavin Lee, BBC Europe reporter The EU doesn't typically make any decisions on whether or not to recognise a government. What there has been is action from individual member states, a co-ordinated effort by the UK, France, Germany and Spain to persuade all EU countries to take the same position. So far more than half of the 28 member states have declared recognition of Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim leader. Other members are cautious, concerned about setting a precedent of recognising a self-proclaimed leader. Italy's populist coalition government is split, and not likely to back any co-ordinated plan because the leaders of one half of the ruling coalition, the 5 Star Movement, have declared that it's not ""for the EU to tell another nation what to do"". The Venezuelan government said it would ""fully review"" its relations with the European governments who had recognised Mr GuaidÃ³. A foreign ministry statement said those governments were ""officially submitting to the United States administration's strategy to overthrow the legitimate government of President Nicolas Maduro"". This video can not be played Desperate Venezuelan women are selling their hair at the border In an interview with Spanish television programme Salvados broadcast on Sunday, Mr Maduro was asked if the crisis in Venezuela could result in civil war. ""Everything depends on the level of madness and aggressiveness of the northern empire [the US] and its Western allies,"" he said. President Trump has told US broadcaster CBS thatthe use of military force remains ""an option"",external. Mr Maduro says he will start collecting signatures from Venezuelans for an open letter to Mr Trump rejecting foreign military intervention. This video can not be played Who is really in charge in Venezuela? In another development, Mr Maduro has written to the Pope asking for help in renewing dialogue, Vatican officials said. Mr Maduro, who took office in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez, has been condemned for alleged human rights abuses and for his handling of the economy. There are severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food. The annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018, according to a study by the National Assembly. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Maduro: Dictator or defender of socialism? By the end of 2018, prices were doubling every 19 days on average. The price of a cup of coffee in the capital Caracas doubled to 400 bolivars ($0.62; Â£0.50) in the space of just a week last December, according to Bloomberg. Many people have been voting with their feet and leaving Venezuela. According to United Nations figures, three million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 when the economic crisis started to bite.

Earpieces used to cheat citizenship test,"This video can not be played The test is required as part of the process to secure UK citizenship Gangs are helping foreign nationals cheat their UK citizenship application test with the use of earpieces, a BBC investigation has revealed. For a fee of up to Â£2,000, criminals secretly listen in and, via a hidden earpiece, give the answers to those taking theLife in the UK test,external. Such an operation was secretly filmed by a BBC journalist, who was given help to pass. The test is failed by about one in five would-be British citizens. The Home Office said it took any cheating ""extremely seriously"". A pass in the test, which assesses candidates' knowledge of UK laws, history and society, is usually required as part of the process to secure UK citizenship or indefinite leave to remain. The number of applications for citizenship made by EU nationals rose by 32% last year and the BBC heard some were paying criminals to cheat the Life in the UK test, as anxiety grows over citizenship rights post-Brexit. One woman, an EU national, told the BBC she decided to cheat after failing first time around, saying she ""felt so much panic"" about her situation. The gang provided an undercover researcher with a hidden two-way earpiece, linked wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection to a concealed mobile phone with an open line Over the past year, nearly 150,000 people have sat the test, which consists of 24 multiple-choice questions. The test, which is taken on a computer and has a pass mark of at least 18 correct answers, is supposed to be held under strict exam conditions. Administration of the tests is outsourced by the government. There are 36 testing centres in the UK. Can you pass the UK citizenship test? Hull-born woman 'facing citizenship test' Call to drop trivia from citizenship test BBC researchers were able to access organised cheating when they went undercover at training academies in and around London, where candidates take classes to prepare for the test. Masoud Abul Raza runs the Ideal Learning Academy in east London. Masoud Abul Raza has denied cheating, despite being caught on camera He was filmed telling an undercover researcher that he could guarantee a pass. ""You have to spend nearly Â£2,000. This is the business, it's completely hidden. But you are getting a result,"" he said. Mr Abul Raza and his gang later provided the undercover researcher with a hidden two-way earpiece, linked wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection to a concealed mobile phone with an open line. This meant the gang outside could hear the audio feed of the test questions and provide the answers. ""Everything will be arranged. He will give you the answer,"" Mr Abul Raza told the undercover journalist. Tony Smith, the former director general of the UK Border Force, was shown the secretly recorded footage and described it as ""clear and blatant cheating by an organised crime gang"". ""One would hope that the standards will change significantly so that the public can be assured that people going through this process are genuinely entitled to stay in this country,"" he said. The BBC researcher received a pass certificate after being given the correct answers The Home Office said test centres were required to put in place stringent measures to prevent cheating, including searches of candidates to ensure no electronic devices enter the test room. ""Unannounced visits"" are also carried out to audit these processes. But the BBC's undercover researcher was not searched or told to hand over all electronic devices. He sat the test, giving the answers provided to him, and within minutes of it ending he had received the pass certificate required to apply for citizenship and a UK passport. Despite being caught on camera, Mr Abul Raza denied cheating, maintaining he only organises legitimate training. When confronted, Mr Abul Raza told the BBC he only organised legitimate training However, he is not the only one profiting from cheating the system. The BBC heard reports of other training academies doing the same thing, with the same method of cheating having been used at testing centres around the UK. At the English Language Training Academy (ELTA) in east London, Ashraf Rahman told the BBC's undercover researcher that he had arranged cheating in Birmingham and Manchester, as well as London. ""I've been here for five years and no-one gets caught,"" he said. Mr Rahman later denied he arranged cheating, claiming he was just discussing what others did. ELTA denied cheating took place on its premises and said Mr Rahman was not an employee.

'The day I went to prison I got my life back',"For many people, receiving a jail sentence would be the worst thing that ever happened to them. But when you've been experiencing domestic abuse - as most female prisoners have - you may see things slightly differently. As she sat in the dock, waiting for the judge to send her to prison, Lilly Lewis found to her surprise that she couldn't stop laughing. She didn't understand why. It wasn't nerves, exactly, and there wasn't anything remotely funny about her situation. Lilly's lawyer had warned she was looking at an eight-year sentence. But somehow the entire court case had seemed unreal to her, like a huge, elaborate joke. Each time the prosecuting barrister stood in front of her, clutching his lapels for emphasis, she'd think how absurdly theatrical the whole thing was. Next to Lilly, one of her co-defendants was crying. ""I'm scared,"" she told Lilly between sobs. Lilly tried to pacify her, but didn't see what there was to be frightened of. Outside, Lilly had been used to being shouted at, bullied and assaulted. She'd been a victim of domestic violence - like 57% of woman prisoners, according to the Prison Reform Trust. She'd overcome addiction and attempted suicide numerous times. In prison, she'd be safe from the man who'd beaten and raped her, the boyfriend who'd held her at gunpoint, the partner she says preyed on her addictions and ended up as another co-accused. Her children had already been taken from her, and the pain of the separation gnawed at her relentlessly. So what else was there to lose? Just get me to jail now, she thought.I'm ready, take me now. And then it was time for Lilly to stand up and hear her sentence. She wore black trousers, an orange jumper from Matalan and a fake hair bun - her real hair was thin from where she'd pulled at it over and over again. She'd spent the weekend in a prison cell for the first time, after the guilty verdicts had been handed down. Lilly had sat there in her grey prison clothes and thought how easy it would be to fall into a routine here. It would be just like school, she decided. ""Seven years,"" the judge told her. The charge was conspiracy to defraud. She'd been given a reduction for changing her plea to guilty during the trial. The smile didn't leave Lilly's face. ""At least it wasn't eight,"" she thought. Half of seven was three-and-a-half years, so she might get out then if she behaved herself. She could do that, she told herself. It was manageable. Then she was in the van, on her way to begin her sentence. The other prisoners called the prison guard ""miss"" -How far, miss? I need the toilet, miss. Lilly silently vowed never to speak in such a servile way. She thought about her four children, and how they would cope for so much longer without their mum. What would happen next, she wondered? When would she get her uniform? What job would she do in prison? Lilly started laughing again, and she didn't understand why this time, either. From inside the van, Lilly looked up to God with a feeling of gratitude. ""You've given me all this time,"" she thought. ""What am I going to do with it?"" Lilly was born in 1971 and grew up on the Wirral in Merseyside. She was the youngest of three sisters by seven years, the baby of the family. Her dad was Ghanaian and her mum was white, and she was the only mixed-race girl at her primary school. All through her childhood she felt keenly aware that she was different. At school she didn't have many friends. One morning, when she was seven years old, Lilly ran into the school playground. A group of girls stood in a semi-circle, singing: Where's your mama gone? Where's your mama gone? Far, far awayâ¦ The girls looked at Lilly and laughed. They knew something that she didn't. That afternoon, when her mum picked her up from school, Lilly asked her mum what the girls had meant. For the first time, Lilly says, her mum told her she was adopted. She said it was as though she and her husband had chosen Lilly off the shelf like she was a little doll. When they'd taken her home, Lilly's mum said, she'd smelt so terrible they'd had to throw her clothes away. When Lilly pushed for more information about her birth mother, she only remembers her mum saying: ""She didn't want you."" The birth mother had been given the opportunity to say goodbye and hadn't taken it. There was no mention of her birth father. Lilly tried to absorb this. She couldn't understand why her birth parents hadn't wanted her. She wondered what had caused her to smell.  Lilly would try to make herself look like a doll, because, she reasoned, if you were the prettiest doll on the shelf, then you'd be picked. Above all else, she feared being abandoned again. Later, looking back on her life, Lilly realised she'd never really developed emotionally after that point. Her terror of being rejected or left alone never went away. From the age of 15, she was introduced to alcohol, and when she drank she wouldn't stop. She had a chain of boyfriends. ""I became quite promiscuous, really, and just felt that was love - when somebody was showing me that affection, it felt like I was being loved and wanted."" When her boyfriends beat her, she rationalised it as an act of love, too. The wardens walked Lilly to the induction wing of the women's prison. They led her along a narrow corridor, underground. The ceiling was low and the walls were yellow. Every few yards she heard the doors slam behind her: BANG. BANG. BANG. It looks like Death Row, she thought. Then she was in her cell. She looked at the bars on the window, the metal toilet in the corner. Even compared to the police station cells she'd been inside, or the prison in which she'd been held the weekend before being sentenced, this was austere. Shereallywas in jail now, she thought. A week later, Lilly was moved to a different wing. She had a cellmate now, a woman who self-harmed. Lilly looked out the window. It was March and bitterly cold outside. She could see a group of inmates walking in the snow. Their hair was cut boyishly short above their red uniforms. They reminded Lilly of prisoners of war. She might as well have been in Siberia. Lilly was given a job on reception. She'd welcome new prisoners as they arrived. Many of them were heroin addicts. Often, they had soiled themselves or vomited on the journey and had to be taken straight to the shower. Anxiously, they'd tell her: ""We need our meds"" - meaning their methadone, the heroin substitute. They'd cry and shake as they waited for it. Other inmates were clearly mentally ill. One tugged and twirled at her hair so much that it looked as though it was in dreadlocks, interspersed with bald patches. Another sucked on her pillowcase and spoke in a baby language. Lilly couldn't believe that, in 2018, these women were being held in a prison - they should be somewhere they could get help, she thought. Very quickly, she settled into a routine. She went from reception to a job as a wing cleaner. It kept her busy. She'd forget which day it was, which month it was sometimes. The only date that mattered was the date she would leave prison, and that was still years away. She never once cried about her sentence. Before it began, Lilly had known that she'd be doing it alone. There wouldn't be any visitors. Her children had been taken from her and she'd had limited contact with them ever since, which made her desperately sad. But otherwise, she thrived. She wasn't drinking or taking drugs. She'd been overweight when she arrived in prison, but now she was visiting the gym every day and eating a diet of porridge, eggs and fish. She read self-help books and wrote lists of things she felt grateful for. She studied for qualifications and passed the exams. Putting her life straight felt achievable. Six months into her sentence, Lilly sat down and wrote a letter to the judge who had jailed her, thanking him for what she called ""the gift of time"". She went on: ""In my experience prison does not work for most, however it has worked for me."" To Lilly, it was clear that the system was doing little to rehabilitate most of the women she encountered. It seemed nobody was encouraged to take showers, and plenty of the inmates didn't. There was a lot of focus on studying for maths and English qualifications, she noticed, but where was anyone teaching these women how to take care of themselves? Drugs seemed more prevalent inside prison than out. On some wings they'd be locked up for 19 hours a day. One woman she knew had come in with a drink problem, and because she couldn't get access to alcohol, had become addicted to the opioid Subutex instead. Another prisoner told her she was on her 32nd sentence, and many of the inmates Lilly encountered seemed to be on one short sentence after another. ""There's no rehabilitation for those prisoners whatsoever - there's no point doing anything because they're not there long enough,"" Lilly says. (The Ministry of Justice isconsideringending jail terms of six months and below.) Lilly reasoned that as she was coping, she should use her time to help those who weren't, in whichever modest ways she could. There was a pregnant woman who barely ate, and Lilly would cajole her to have some food. She volunteered as a Samaritans listener, on call 24 hours a day to provide emotional support for other prisoners. She helped teach inmates to read. She was also given two youth offenders to mentor. Her goal was to get to an open prison as soon as possible. There she could walk around and fetch herself a cup of coffee, maybe even get a day-release job on the outside. But for now she was still behind locked doors, surrounded by women deep in the throes of addiction. On New Year's Eve she heard an ambulance approaching the prison at 8:30pm to deal with the first suicide attempt of the evening. Throughout the rest of the night, Lilly listened as the sirens blared again and again. Many female offenders experience chaotic lifestyles involving substance misuse, mental health problems and homelessness, says the government'sFemale Offender Strategy,external(2018), noting that these are often the product of a life of abuse and trauma According to the Prison Reform Trust, 57% of woman prisonersreport having been victims of domestic abuse,externaland 53% report having experienced emotional, sexual or physical abuse The rate of self-harm isnearly five times higher in women's prisons,externalthan in men's prisons Almost half of female prisoners say they committed their offence to support the drug use of someone else About three-quarters of women given custodial sentences get six months or less, and between a quarter and a third of female offenders have dependent children Prison reform campaigners were dismayed whenthe government dropped plans,externallast year to build ""community prisons"" for women - it said it would trial five residential drug rehab centresbut news of these is still awaited,external The more women Lilly spoke to in prison, the more she realised that most of them had something in common - like her, they were victims of domestic violence, but hadn't felt able to seek help. ""Women are petrified to come forward because they know that social services are going to be involved and your kids are going to be swiped from under your feet,"" she says. Abuse had been part of Lilly's relationships since she was a teenager. For most of her adult life, she had been smartly dressed, confident and gregarious. She'd run her own businesses and held down professional jobs. And as a result, everyone had believed her when she said her bruises came from falling over. No-one had realised she was anaesthetising her pain every night with alcohol and drugs. There was Michael (not his real name). One morning, while she was heavily pregnant, he grabbed her by the throat and threw her down the stairs, she says. Hours later, she gave birth. The regular beatings began six weeks after that, she says. Once, he beat her so badly that neighbours called the police. When they arrived, Lilly's daughter Issy, who was at primary school at the time, told them: ""Please help, my mum's dead."" As well as hitting and punching Lilly, Michael would regularly rape her, she says. ""If he wanted sex, he was having it,"" she says. After each attack, he'd say he was sorry and Lilly would forgive him: ""I didn't feel a victim in any way at all. I thought this was my life."" After he was jailed for attacking her, she found a new boyfriend, a gangland enforcer. ""Because he didn't physically beat me, it didn't feel like abuse,"" she recalls. But he would point his gun at her and threaten to shoot. The only time she cried was when the barrel got caught in her new hairdo, messing it up. He left her soon after their son was born. Then came the man who later became her co-accused. She'd been drinking to blot out the pain for as long as she could remember, and after he became her lover, he plied her with alcohol, waking her up in the morning with a glass of wine. He disappeared for long periods without notice, not telling Lilly where he was, and each time she'd descend into a depression until he returned. She worked from home, although now she was often too drunk in the daytime to function. Her partner had access to her laptop and all her emails. ""What I didn't realise he was doing was forwarding all my data to friends of his,"" she says. They'd ring customers of the company she worked for and scam them. Lilly agreed to open a bank account and a limited company in her name. She had an idea of what was going on by this stage, but it was all too easy to turn a blind eye - nobody was getting shot or killed, so it didn't feel like a crime. Lilly loved him, but the final straw came when he offered marijuana to Issy, who was now 14. The relationship was over. Lilly says she called the police at this point and told them about the fraud. He was arrested, and she knew that sooner or later they would come for her, too. Eventually, they did - she was charged and bailed, and she knew she was facing a lengthy prison sentence. Then the police raided the home of her previous ex - the one who worked as an enforcer for gangsters, the father of her son. Two days after that, officers took away her children. ""Evidence clearly shows that putting women in prison can do more harm than good for society, failing to cut the cycle of reoffending and exacerbating often already difficult family circumstances. That is why we have shifted our emphasis from custody to the community and are investing in women's centres which offer a wide range of support including services around substance misuse and mental health problems. Overall we have invested Â£5m in community provision for female offenders to ensure women are given the support they need to address their offending and turn away from a life of crime."" From this point, Lilly's life spiralled further downwards. ""I just drank,"" she says. ""I was being arrested every week and locked up every week."" She attempted suicide five times and was sectioned twice under the Mental Health Act. After the final time she tried to kill herself, she thought about how much pain it would have caused her children if she'd succeeded. It was a turning point for Lilly. ""From that day I just thought: 'I've got a bit of a challenge ahead of me. So let's do it.'"" Lilly had been placed in a women's refuge where she'd tried to engage with substance misuse workers, but each time she'd relapsed. Now she was determined to stay clean. ""I thought: 'God, I'm tougher than this. I can do it,'"" she says. ""I got my act together."" For the first time in her adult life, she managed to stay completely free of drink and drugs. Her trial was six months away. It wasn't until the day she was sentenced, when she learned how long she would spend locked away, that she finally felt she'd got her life back. It was a bright day in June and sunlight flooded into the prison van as it pulled over. From her seat inside, Lilly could see inmates tending flower beds. She had been re-categorised as an open prisoner, and this was to be her new jail. Quickly, she realised the 20 months she'd spent in closed conditions had institutionalised her. She'd been looking forward to walking around freely and going to the coffee shop, but now it unnerved her. Once she'd vowed never to call the officers ""sir"" or ""miss"", but now it felt strange to her when other inmates addressed them by their first names. And it suddenly seemed that no-one needed her. In the closed prison, she'd had a role. Helping prisoners worse off than herself had given her a sense of purpose, but what was there for her to do now? Ever since the trial, Lilly had thought about her victims every day. Their testimony in court, as they told how they had been robbed of trust as well as their savings, was the only part of the trial that had seemed real to her, painfully so. ""Obviously I'm sorry because they lost the money, but it's deeper than that - I think more of what they lost of themselves,"" she says. ""I'm sad because of what I've done to them personally."" Christmas decorations glittered in each shop window as Lilly inched her way through York city centre. It was raining but she walked slowly, taking in every sight and sound. This was her first resettlement day, part of the programme to re-integrate her into the community. It was as though she was looking at the streets with an entirely new set of eyes. She felt light-headed with excitement. Everything seemed to be sparkling. Lilly navigated the pavement tentatively. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" she said to everyone who came past her. But her awkwardness was overwhelmed by a deep feeling of joy. She bought a pink umbrella from one shop, a bunch of grapes from another. She stopped a shop assistant so she could ask him something, but she didn't know how to start the conversation. She'd forgotten about ""Excuse me"". Later, Lilly sat in a coffee shop drinking a hot chocolate with marshmallows. She couldn't believe it cost Â£3.80. She'd never had to think about money before. A drunk man stumbled into the cafe and told Lilly that she was beautiful. The other customers glared, but Lilly thanked him. She was glad someone had recognised her presence. Before returning to the prison that evening, she repeated a mantra in her head: ""I love life. I love life. I love life."" After that, she was allowed to go outside for work placements. She cried when staff at one workplace invited her to their Christmas party. She took on another role at a project mentoring children and young people who had been drawn into crime. Lilly hoped she could help them make better choices than she had. She and Issy had become closer than ever. ""If a woman's in a violent relationship and they're getting violently beat up, it is sometimes hard for them to think about their children as well, because they're just thinking about surviving,"" says Issy, now 18. It had been difficult for her when her mum had been sent to prison. Now the two had the space to bond as mother and daughter. Some nights Lilly was allowed to stay overnight at Issy's flat, and they'd sit all evening on the sofa, savouring each other's presence. Lilly had also begun getting help, attending counselling for domestic abuse. The therapist talked to her about controlling behaviour and how to recognise it. They also spoke about the role that her family background had played - the sense of abandonment she'd felt ever since she learned about her adoption. She was put in touch with a family worker who would help her trace her birth parents. Finally, the questions she had asked since childhood were about to be answered. Lilly was told that her birth mother had died some years previously. But her father was still alive. He'd recently been widowed and the funeral directors gave Lilly his address. She wrote to him to say she had no bad feelings towards him, that she wouldn't get in touch again if he didn't want her to, that all she wanted to do was reach out. Three months later, he phoned her. He spoke with a gentle Jamaican lilt. It turned out he had spent his working life 10 minutes away from Lilly's old school, in a factory next door to the one where her adoptive mother had been employed. He told Lilly that her birth mum had been in an abusive marriage, too. He had met her while her husband was in prison and they had had a brief affair - but she was white, and when she discovered she was pregnant, there was no question of her keeping a mixed-race child. ""She suffered from depression, so a very similar character to me,"" Lilly says. ""Her biggest concern was keeping her husband happy - and I got that, because I've done that all my life."" As she listened, Lilly wished she could have been there to protect her birth mum. The first time Lilly met her birth dad in person, she sat in his car and asked if she could hold his hand. She told him everything - the fraud, the addiction, the abusive men she'd stayed with because she'd learned to see their coercion and violence as perverse expressions of love.  He cried and told her he was sorry. When she rang him later, he told her she was amazing, that he felt a father's love for her. They were the words she'd wanted to hear all her life. One afternoon, Lilly sits with a coffee in front of her in the centre of a northern English city. She's on a break from her work placement, and none of the shoppers milling around her would imagine this smartly dressed, composed-looking woman will be returning that night to a prison cell. Freedom is still a long way ahead of her. But her work with young offenders gives meaning to her days. Her relationship with Issy is flourishing. Above all, she says, she had discovered something that had eluded her all her life, that she'd been searching for but that had always seemed beyond her grasp. Self-respect. ""I never used to like me,"" she says, and then smiles: ""Now I really like me.""

Ryanair posts first loss since 2014,"Ryanair posted a net loss of â¬19.6m (Â£17.2m) for the last three months of the year, its first quarterly loss since March 2014. The airline carried 32.7 million passengers compared with 30.4 million for the same period a year earlier as revenue rose 9% to â¬1.53bn. But the airline said ""excess winter capacity in Europe"" cut its profit. Ryanair said chairman David Bonderman will leave in the summer of 2020. While the company blamed too many airlines chasing too few passengers, costs may be the real problem, industry experts said. The company's fuel bill leapt 32% and its staff costs rose 31%. In total, Ryanair's operating costs rose 20% to â¬1.54bn. ""The heart of the big drop in their profitability is that their fuel costs are very high this year,"" HSBC transport analyst Andrew Lobbenberg told the Today programme. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary -who suggested last year that he could step downin the next five years - has agreed a new five-year contract, the firm said. But his role will change slightly, in that Mr O'Leary will become group CEO and will manage chief executives for each airline brand: Ryanair, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK. In September, at the firm's annual meeting, almost 30% of shareholders voted against the re-election of Mr Bonderman as chairman after a summer of flight cancellations. He has spent 23 years in the job. Michael O'Leary, the outspoken boss of low-cost airline Ryanair, has been no stranger to controversy. Mr O'Leary,who has agreed to stay on for another five years, is well-known for not being shy about expressing his views, famously excoriating his staff, his customers, competitors, regulators, governments, and groups such as environmentalists and scientists. He once said of passengers looking for a refund,external: ""We don't want to hear your sob stories. What part of 'no refund' don't you understand?"" and has said he doesn't believe in man-made climate change. Read more here The new company structure is similar to that of IAG, the company that owns British Airways. Mr O'Leary will oversee costs, aircraft purchases and buying rival airlines. It could be good for industrial relations after a series of strikes over the summer, said transport analyst Mr Lobbenberg. ""It puts more distance between him and the unions,"" he said. Mr O'Leary, who has been chief executive for 24 years, told September's annual meeting he had concerns about committing to a new five-year contract telling shareholders: ""I'm not sure Mrs O'Leary would be happy."" He said the airline's loss was ""disappointing"", but ""we take comfort that this was entirely due to weaker than expected air fares"". While higher oil prices and lower fares reduced the firm's profitability, they were creating even bigger problems for rivals, Ryanair pointed out. Firms like Wow, Flybe and Germania are seeking buyers.

Venezuela's Maduro warns of civil war,"NicolÃ¡s Maduro has retained the support of the Venezuelan military Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has said he cannot rule out the possibility of civil war as pressure mounts on him to stand down. In a TV interview, he warned that US President Donald Trump would leave the White House ""stained with blood"" if he intervened in the crisis. He also defiantly rejected the EU's Sunday deadline to call snap elections. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim president last month and won US backing. He said on Sunday he would build an international coalition to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuelans but Mr Maduro has accused him of organising a coup. In the interview with Spanish television programme Salvados, broadcast on Sunday, Mr Maduro was asked if the crisis in Venezuela could result in civil war. ""Today no-one could answer that question with certainty,"" he said.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Mr GuaidÃ³ had the ""legitimacy to organise presidential elections."" ""People are on the streets, people want change,"",externalhe told broadcaster France Inter. But Mr Maduro responded: ""We don't accept ultimatums from anyone.

""No, international politics can't be based on ultimatums. That was the era of empires and colonies."" Thousands took to the streets of the capital Caracas on Saturday for protests in support of both President Maduro and Mr GuaidÃ³. Mr Maduro retains the support of the military, but ahead of the demonstrations Mr GuaidÃ³ received a boost when an air force general - Francisco Yanez - became the highest-ranking military official yet to pledge support for him. Mr GuaidÃ³ says he has held private meetings with the military to win support for ousting Mr Maduro. He says he has also reached out to China, one of Mr Maduro's most important backers. He does not control any territory in Venezuela, so instead he plans to set up collection centres in neighbouring countries where Venezuelans have fled to. He said he wanted to set up an international coalition,externalto gather aid at three points, and press Venezuela's army to let it into the country.

Why Venezuela's military backs Maduro On Sunday Mr Maduro dismissed calls for a new presidential vote, saying he would not accept ""ultimatums"". He has denounced Mr GuaidÃ³'s move as a coup. As head of Venezuela's National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ says the constitution allows him to assume power temporarily when the president is deemed illegitimate. After Sunday's deadline passed, a flurry of statements was issued by France, the UK, Germany and Spain and the other countries that now recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president. Many of them pressed Mr Maduro to call new elections. Mr GuaidÃ³'s mother was among the crowds at protests on Saturday French President Emmanuel Macron said Venezuelans had the right to ""express themselves freely and democratically"",external, announcing his support for an EU contact group. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Venezuela ""should be the author of its own destiny"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said that ""further steps"" were being considered, including the use of sanctions, without outlining what form any possible sanctions might take. While a majority of EU members back Mr GuaidÃ³, others such as Greece and Ireland called for fresh elections but stopped short of recognising him. Russia has attacked Monday's statements, accusing EU countries of interfering in Venezuela's affairs and attempting to ""legitimise usurped power"". By Gavin Lee, BBC Europe reporter The EU doesn't typically make any decisions on whether or not to recognise a government. What there has been is action from individual member states, a co-ordinated effort by the UK, France, Germany and Spain to persuade all EU countries to take the same position. So far more than half of the 28 member states have declared recognition of Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim leader. Other members are cautious, concerned about setting a precedent of recognising a self-proclaimed leader. Italy's populist coalition government is split, and not likely to back any co-ordinated plan because the leaders of one half of the ruling coalition, the 5 Star Movement, have declared that it's not ""for the EU to tell another nation what to do"". The Venezuelan government said it would ""fully review"" its relations with the European governments who had recognised Mr GuaidÃ³. A foreign ministry statement said those governments were ""officially submitting to the United States administration's strategy to overthrow the legitimate government of President Nicolas Maduro"". This video can not be played Desperate Venezuelan women are selling their hair at the border In an interview with Spanish television programme Salvados broadcast on Sunday, Mr Maduro was asked if the crisis in Venezuela could result in civil war. ""Everything depends on the level of madness and aggressiveness of the northern empire [the US] and its Western allies,"" he said. President Trump has told US broadcaster CBS thatthe use of military force remains ""an option"",external. Mr Maduro says he will start collecting signatures from Venezuelans for an open letter to Mr Trump rejecting foreign military intervention. This video can not be played Who is really in charge in Venezuela? In another development, Mr Maduro has written to the Pope asking for help in renewing dialogue, Vatican officials said. Mr Maduro, who took office in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez, has been condemned for alleged human rights abuses and for his handling of the economy. There are severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food. The annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018, according to a study by the National Assembly. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Maduro: Dictator or defender of socialism? By the end of 2018, prices were doubling every 19 days on average. The price of a cup of coffee in the capital Caracas doubled to 400 bolivars ($0.62; Â£0.50) in the space of just a week last December, according to Bloomberg. Many people have been voting with their feet and leaving Venezuela. According to United Nations figures, three million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 when the economic crisis started to bite.

Obesity-related cancers 'rise in millennials',"Cancers linked to obesity are rising at a faster rate in millennials than in older generations in the United States, the American Cancer Society has said. It said a steep rise in obesity in the past 40 years may have increased cancer risk in younger generations. And it warned the problem could set back recent progress on cancer. The Society studied millions of health records from 1995 to 2014,publishing its findings in The Lancet Public Health.,external In the last few decades, there has been mounting evidence that certain cancers can be linked to obesity. Researchers found that the rates of six out of 12 obesity-related cancers (colorectal, uterine, gallbladder, kidney, pancreatic and multiple myeloma - a blood cancer) all went up, particularly in people under the age of 50. And they found steeper rises in successively younger generations aged 25 to 49 - and particularly in millennials, in their 20s and 30s. For example, the risk of colorectal, uterine and gallbladder cancers has doubled for millennials compared to baby boomers, now aged 50 to 70, at the same age. Some of these cancers increased in people over 50 too, but the rises were not as steep. Researchers say this trend may be down to the rapid rise in obesity in the last few decades with ""younger generations worldwide experiencing an earlier and longer exposure to the dangers of extra weight"". Dr Ahmedin Jemal, from the American Cancer Society, said: ""Our findings expose a recent change that could serve as a warning of an increased burden of obesity-related cancers to come in older adults. ""Most cancers occur in older adults, which means that as the young people in our study age, the burden of obesity-related cancer cases and deaths are likely to increase even more."" But the researchers could not explain why the rates of only half of the 12 obesity-related cancers had increased. Meanwhile, they found cancers linked to smoking and infections were declining in younger age groups. Dr Brenda Birmann, from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told the Lancet Public Health that it was possible that risk factors other than obesity could play a part and this warranted further investigation. ""Importantly, the findings suggest the need for further close epidemiological monitoring of cancer incidence trends in younger adults,"" she said. Liver cancer is one of a list of cancers linked to obesity According to the charity Cancer Research UK, obesity is the second biggest preventable cause of cancer in the UK, after smoking. Research suggests bowel cancer, womb cancer, oesophageal (food pipe) cancer, cancer of the kidney, liver, upper stomach, gallbladder, ovarian, thyroid, meningioma (a type of brain tumour) and multiple myeloma (a type of blood cancer) and breast cancer in women after the menopause have all been linked to obesity. Researchers say the risk increases as people get more overweight. But of course, obesity is only one factor - the environment, genetics and other issues can also come into play. Not everyone who gets these cancers will be overweight and everyone who is obese will not necessarily get these cancers. And scientists are clear that losing even small amounts of weight can help reduce the risk of cancer. Scientists still have a lot of questions to answer but there are currently three main theories about this. Extra body fat does not just sit in the body doing nothing. Fat cells help store energy, but they can also send chemical signals to other parts of the body. These signals may tell cells to divide more quickly, which can put people at risk of cancer. In other words: fat cells make extra hormones and growth factors growth factors and hormones tell cells in the body to divide more rapidly this increases the chance of cancer cells being produced and these can continue to divide and cause a tumour Why obesity increases cancer risk Obesity cancer link 'not well known' The Lancet Public Health, January 2019, Volume 4, Issue 1, Pages e1-e73 Does obesity cause cancer?

MPs to discuss backstop alternativesThe government gathers Leave and former Remain Conservatives to try to find a way forward on Brexit.UK Politics,"Tory MPs Iain Duncan Smith, Nicky Morgan and Steve Baker are all in the meeting at the Cabinet Office Tory MPs have met the government to discuss alternative arrangements to the proposed Irish border ""backstop"", as three days of talks begin. The Alternative Arrangements Working Group, with Leave and Remain MPs, met for the first time after the Commons voted to find another way of avoiding the return of Irish border checks. A government spokesman said the talks had been ""detailed and constructive"". But EU leaders have continued to rule out making changes to the backstop. The Irish PM Leo Varadkar told RTE radio the UK was reviewing ideas that had ""already been rejected"", and it was ""very frustrating"" that the UK government was ""going back to the idea of technology"". Brexit: A really simple guide Katya Adler: EU digs heels in over Brexit deal How ready is UK for a no-deal Brexit? Brexit: All you need to know Is Labour softening on freedom of movement? But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU would listen to proposals to solve the Irish border ""riddle"", although they needed to hear how the UK wanted to do it. The backstop is an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit. Number 10 said the working group of Conservative MPs was set up following ""significant support"" for the so-called ""Malthouse Compromise"" - named after housing minister Kit Malthouse who encouraged talks between different groups of MPs. Engineered by both Leavers and Remainers, the proposal includes extending the transition period for a year until the end of 2021 and protecting EU citizens' rights, instead of using the backstop. Please upgrade your browser Members of the working group include Conservative MPs Steve Baker, Marcus Fysh, Owen Paterson, Damian Green and Nicky Morgan. The group will hold regular meetings with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, as well as senior government officials from HMRC, Cabinet Office Europe Unit and Number 10. Mr Fysh said the group had spoken to the EU and it was ""very open"" to the proposals, adding that they were not based on new technology. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said the group had explored the proposal ""in detail"" on the first day of talks. The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said the government's willingness to provide civil service support to this group of Conservative MPs was an indication of how seriously Downing Street was treating their idea. The backstop insurance policy would kick in if, after almost two years after Brexit, the two sides had not reached a trade agreement with one another that avoided the need for physical border checks. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU and leave Northern Ireland effectively in the EU's single market for goods. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Critics fear the UK could be ""trapped"" in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals on goods with the rest of the world. Unionists also fear it would drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But by changing the backstop, the PM could win support. Ex-Northern Ireland first minister Lord Trimble has said he is planning to take the government to court over the Brexit deal, claiming the Northern Ireland protocol - which includes the backstop - breaches the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Mrs May will visit Northern Ireland on Tuesday to deliver a speech on Brexit and meet business leaders. What are the new ideas for the Irish backstop? Read more: Could technology solve the Irish border problem? Alternatives to the backstop that the prime minister has said she wants to discuss with EU leaders include: a ""trusted trader"" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border ""mutual recognition"" of rules with the EU ""technological"" solutions This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Alternative Brexit backstop ""can be done"" Mr Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that an alternative arrangement to the Irish backstop ""can be done"" using ""existing technology"". He said the attorney general was ""leading on another strand of work"" - looking at whether a ""hard time limit or proper exit mechanism"" was possible. UK 'still safe in no-deal Brexit' - Javid Sheep farmers' post-Brexit tariff fears Customs checks simplified for no-deal Brexit The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, when the two-year time limit on withdrawal negotiations enforced by the Article 50 process expires. Theresa May has said she is ""determined"" to deliver Brexit on time, but a number of cabinet ministers have indicated they would be willing to agree to a short extension to finalise legislation for Brexit. However, a plan to delay Brexit for up to nine months to prevent a no deal - put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper - was voted down by Parliament. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Kier Starmer said he could not see Mrs May negotiating an alternative to the backstop at this late stage, saying the prime minister had effectively ""run down the clock"". Meanwhile, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said contingency plans for Britain's departure from the EU with no deal were ""genuinely astonishing"",in a speech in the US. She warned of food shortages and stockpiling of medicine amid a ""real and growing risk"" of a no deal scenario. Numerous politicians have shut down the idea of looking at the backstop again, saying there was no desire to re-open negotiations on the withdrawal agreement in Brussels. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the EU was not looking for a substitute solution, because they say they've already investigated every other option that exists and none has the same effect as the backstop. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there was ""full agreement"" that the withdrawal agreement ""cannot be reopened"". Allow Twitter content?

Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said the withdrawal agreement rejected by MPs already allowed the EU and UK to work on alternative arrangements for the backstop. He added: ""What Ireland is being asked to do by some in Westminster is to essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK government and EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking and I think that's a very unreasonable request to ask the Irish government to be flexible on."" Speaking during a trip to Japan, German Chancellor Mrs Merkel said: ""To solve this riddle, you have to be creative and you have to listen to one another. ""We can have those conversations... But we must hear from Great Britain how they want to do it."" Labour's Hilary Benn met the Secretary General of the European Commission, Martin Selmayr, in Brussels. Speaking after Monday's meeting, Mr Benn - who chairs the Brexit select committee - said the EU would be prepared to consider an additional legal protocol to the withdrawal agreement if they were convinced it would help a deal get through Parliament. But Mr Selmayr later tweeted,externalthat when asked if such an assurance would help, the response from MPs was ""inconclusive"". He added: ""The meeting confirmed that the EU did well to start its no deal preparations in December 2017."" Leave supporter and Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns - who was also at the meeting - tweeted afterwards that Mr Selmayr revealed the EU had not been asked to remove the backstop or re-open negotiations by the British government.

By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor So. how open does the EU seem almost a week on from parliament narrowly voting in favour of an amendment to find alternatives to the backstop guarantee to keep the Irish border open after Brexit? After all, with every passing day as we've heard, again and again and again, the clock is ticking towards an increased chance of a no-deal Brexit with all the costs and chaos that could involve. Well, if I were to speak in weather forecast terms, I might describe current EU attitudes as frosty with a chance of ice. If Theresa May comes to Brussels later this week, she will be received politely and listened to attentively. But if her EU ask remains centred around getting a time limit to, or allowing the UK a unilateral get-out mechanism from, the Irish border backstop or if she pushes again for pure technology as a means of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, then the likelihood of her being sent home empty-handed - or as good as - is very high indeed.

Venezuela's Maduro warns of civil warThe embattled leader says he cannot rule out a conflict as he defies calls to step down.Latin America & Caribbean,"NicolÃ¡s Maduro has retained the support of the Venezuelan military Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has said he cannot rule out the possibility of civil war as pressure mounts on him to stand down. In a TV interview, he warned that US President Donald Trump would leave the White House ""stained with blood"" if he intervened in the crisis. He also defiantly rejected the EU's Sunday deadline to call snap elections. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim president last month and won US backing. He said on Sunday he would build an international coalition to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuelans but Mr Maduro has accused him of organising a coup.

""No, international politics can't be based on ultimatums. That was the era of empires and colonies."" Thousands took to the streets of the capital Caracas on Saturday for protests in support of both President Maduro and Mr GuaidÃ³. Mr Maduro retains the support of the military, but ahead of the demonstrations Mr GuaidÃ³ received a boost when an air force general - Francisco Yanez - became the highest-ranking military official yet to pledge support for him. Mr GuaidÃ³ says he has held private meetings with the military to win support for ousting Mr Maduro. He says he has also reached out to China, one of Mr Maduro's most important backers. He does not control any territory in Venezuela, so instead he plans to set up collection centres in neighbouring countries where Venezuelans have fled to. He said he wanted to set up an international coalition,externalto gather aid at three points, and press Venezuela's army to let it into the country.

Patriots claim record sixth Super Bowl triumphNew England Patriots produce a defensive masterclass to beat the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 in Super Bowl 53 and equal Pittsburgh Steelers' record of six titles.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Super Bowl 53: Bill Belichick's New England Patriots beat LA Rams to win sixth title The New England Patriots produced a defensive masterclass to beat the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and equal Pittsburgh Steelers' record of six Super Bowl titles. The victory also gave Patriots quarterback Tom Brady a sixth Super Bowl ring - an outright record for an individual player, eclipsing the mark he shared with Charles Haley. Bill Belichick - the most successful coach in Super Bowl history and now, at 66, the oldest man to win it - again came up with the perfect gameplan in Atlanta as the Patriots stifled a Rams offence that averaged 32.9 points per game in the regular season. The defensive strength of both sides resulted in the lowest-scoring Super Bowl of all time, with the 16 total points scored comfortably below the previous record of 21, set as Miami defeated Washington 14-7 in 1973. The score was just 3-0 until late in the third quarter through Stephen Gostkowski's 42-yard field goal. The Patriots' defence piled the pressure on 24-year-old quarterback Jared Goff and the Rams had to punt from their first eight possessions. Sean McVay's side finally got their offence moving in the third and drew level through a 53-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein. But Brady lofted a perfect 34-yard pass to Rob Gronkowski to set up Sony Michel to burrow over the line for the game's only touchdown with seven minutes left. Gostkowski added gloss with a late field goal as the Patriots ground out a hard-fought win. ""It was an unbelievable year, we fought through it more than anything,"" said 41-year-old Brady. ""They [the Rams] played so well, their defence was great, they made it tough on every play."" Before the game the American National Anthem was performed by legendary soul singer Gladys Knight, while the traditional half-time show duties fell to Maroon 5, whose set alongside Travis Scott and Big Boi met with only a lukewarm reception. Relive the Patriots' historic win Maroon 5's Super Bowl show fails to catch fire Male cheerleaders feature at Super Bowl for first time This video can not be played Super Bowl 53: Sixth ring 'doesn't change anything' - Tom Brady Brady was struggling as much as Goff in the early stages as the Rams produced a series of defensive plays that clearly fazed the veteran. For the first time all season, Brady threw an interception on the Patriots' opening drive and he was forced to call two timeouts to help him adjust to the Rams' gameplan. Brady has made a habit of recovering from a slow starts in Super Bowls - in the nine he and Belichick have reached together, the Pats have scored just three first-quarter points - and once he made the required adjustments, the improvements came. After Brady picked out a 25-yard pass to Julian Edelman, later named the game's most valuable player, Gostkowski's field goal from 42 yards opened the scoring. Indeed, if it was not for the safe hands of Edelman there would barely have been any offence to speak of in the first half, with Brady repeatedly hitting his go-to guy as the wide receiver moved into second place on the all-time list of post-season NFL receiving yards. And although the Rams finally got a foothold in the game thanks to Zuerlein's field goal, Brady took control when it mattered most, orchestrating the game-winning drive midway through the final quarter. He found Edelman once and Gronkowski twice - the reliable pair en route to combining for 228 of New England's 262 receiving yards - before rookie running back Michel punched in his sixth touchdown of the post-season. He may not have scored a touchdown, but Edelman was vital to the Patriots' win, the wide receiver time and again offering an outlet for Brady. The 32-year-old, now a three-time Super Bowl winner, had 10 receptions for 141 yards while also rushing once for eight yards Although the Rams' defence posed Brady some early problems, the Patriots had also managed to shut down the Rams' running game, putting the impetus on Goff, 24,  to find a solution through the air. But the first half finished with the Rams having claimed only two first downs and 57 yards of offence, having been in possession almost half as long as the Pats - just over 10 minutes compared to the Pats' 19 minutes and 52 seconds. It could have been even worse. Dont'a Hightower should have claimed an interception from the very first play of the second half, before a couple of runs from Todd Gurley - so impressive in the regular season but anonymous in the play-offs - finally gave the Rams some respite. But from their next possession Goff was forced to throw out of bounds from his own end zone and it was not until there was less than five minutes remaining in the third quarter that the Rams managed to convert on third down for the first time. Goff spotted Brandin Cooks open during that drive, only for Jason McCourty to make a crucial tackle as Cooks attempted to make the catch deep in the end zone, although the Rams gained some reward with Zuerlein's field goal. And even after Michel put the Pats back in front, the Rams could have hit straight back with a touchdown had Cooks hung on to a 24-yard pass into the corner, but Goff tried a similar pass with the next play and Stephon Gilmore intercepted to deal a fatal, decisive blow. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick:""It's sweet. Everybody counted us out, from the beginning of the season to midseason, but we're still here."" Rams head coach Sean McVay:""I'm pretty numb right now. Definitely I got out-coached, and I didn't do nearly enough for our football team."" Patriots wide receiver and MVP Julian Edelman:""It wasn't pretty, but I'll take that ugly win over a pretty loss any day."" Patriots quarterback Tom Brady:""I'm so happy for my team-mates. This is a dream come true for all of us."" Rams quarterback Jared Goff:""It kills. It hurts... It hurts me knowing how well our defence played, against that team, against Tom, and us not holding up our end of the bargain. It's our job to score points and we didn't do that tonight.""

Ryanair posts loss amid fare cuts,"Ryanair posted a net loss of â¬19.6m (Â£17.2m) for the last three months of the year, its first quarterly loss since March 2014. The airline carried 32.7 million passengers compared with 30.4 million for the same period a year earlier as revenue rose 9% to â¬1.53bn. But the airline said ""excess winter capacity in Europe"" cut its profit. Ryanair said chairman David Bonderman will leave in the summer of 2020. While the company blamed too many airlines chasing too few passengers, costs may be the real problem, industry experts said. The company's fuel bill leapt 32% and its staff costs rose 31%. In total, Ryanair's operating costs rose 20% to â¬1.54bn. ""The heart of the big drop in their profitability is that their fuel costs are very high this year,"" HSBC transport analyst Andrew Lobbenberg told the Today programme. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary -who suggested last year that he could step downin the next five years - has agreed a new five-year contract, the firm said. But his role will change slightly, in that Mr O'Leary will become group CEO and will manage chief executives for each airline brand: Ryanair, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK. In September, at the firm's annual meeting, almost 30% of shareholders voted against the re-election of Mr Bonderman as chairman after a summer of flight cancellations. He has spent 23 years in the job. Michael O'Leary, the outspoken boss of low-cost airline Ryanair, has been no stranger to controversy. Mr O'Leary,who has agreed to stay on for another five years, is well-known for not being shy about expressing his views, famously excoriating his staff, his customers, competitors, regulators, governments, and groups such as environmentalists and scientists. He once said of passengers looking for a refund,external: ""We don't want to hear your sob stories. What part of 'no refund' don't you understand?"" and has said he doesn't believe in man-made climate change. Read more here The new company structure is similar to that of IAG, the company that owns British Airways. Mr O'Leary will oversee costs, aircraft purchases and buying rival airlines. It could be good for industrial relations after a series of strikes over the summer, said transport analyst Mr Lobbenberg. ""It puts more distance between him and the unions,"" he said. Mr O'Leary, who has been chief executive for 24 years, told September's annual meeting he had concerns about committing to a new five-year contract telling shareholders: ""I'm not sure Mrs O'Leary would be happy."" He said the airline's loss was ""disappointing"", but ""we take comfort that this was entirely due to weaker than expected air fares"". While higher oil prices and lower fares reduced the firm's profitability, they were creating even bigger problems for rivals, Ryanair pointed out.

Worboys prompts Parole Board system review,"Black cab rapist John Worboys was convicted of 19 offences against 12 women in 2009 The way the Parole Board of England and Wales operates is to be reviewed to see whether it needs ""fundamental"" reform. The government probe comes a year after the board caused an outcry by ruling that the so-called black-cab rapist John Worboys was safe to be freed. That decision was lateroverturned by the High Court. One of the options to be considered in the review would be for every parole hearing to be conducted like a court or tribunal, with a judge in charge. On Sunday, Justice Secretary David Gaukeannounced new rights for victimsto challenge violent offender releases. He said the changes should prevent the mistakes in the Worboys case from happening again. 'Black cab rapist' to stay in prison Cabbie who preyed on young women Worboys ruling quashed as parole head quits Mr Gauke said the review would consider whether the Parole Board needed extra powers or if it should be ""reconstituted"". He said no ""profound deficiencies"" in the way the parole process worked had been identified since theHigh Court overturned the board's decisionto release Worboys, but improvements were needed. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""It is important to note that for an arms-length body like the Parole Board we should do a tailored review every parliament. ""But it follows on from a number of reforms that we have already made."" Ministers previously scrapped a rule banning the Parole Board from disclosing information about the reasons behind its findings. The 246 members of the Parole Board make risk assessments and decisions on whether prisoners can be safely released or moved to an open jail. A judge or former judge is sometimes involved. Theydeal with about 25,000 cases a year,external, and in 2016-17 about 80% of decisions were made by reviewing case papers, rather than at an oral hearing. The justice secretary said he was determined to rebuild trust in the system Mr Gauke said instead of having to go to court to contest Parole Board decisions - which can be ""expensive and high-risk"" - victims will now be able to raise their concerns with the Ministry of Justice. He told Today: ""If the MoJ takes the view that there is an arguable case that there is something wrong with the process or the decision, it is then put back to the Parole Board, maintaining their independence."" The new system will apply from this summer to the most serious offenders - those serving indeterminate sentences, such as life terms, and people jailed under imprisonment for public protection, or serving extended sentences. The Ministry of Justice said it was currently ""not viable"" to hold parole hearings in public and acknowledged the changes might not go as far as some people wish. It said it had considered opening up appeals to the public, but after a consultation decided only parties in the case should be involved. Other measures will see the Parole Board ""clearly"" set out how its members should assess wider allegations of offending made against a prisoner. Kim Harrison, a lawyer from Slater and Gordon which helped a number of Worboys' victims bring civil claims, said the changes were a ""massive step in the right direction"". But she questioned why legal aid was not being made available to help victims through the ""complex process"" of challenging a release. The victims support charity Solace Women's Aid welcomed the plans, but said people should be able to challenge the early release of prisoners serving less severe terms. ""Any crime that creates a victim is important enough to include their voice and consider their wellbeing,"" it said. Solace said improvements were also needed in the way victims were notified of a release. It highlighted the case of one woman who only found out her ex-partner - who had raped her daughter - was free when a friend saw him in the street. This video can not be played Victim: 'The police assumed I was some drunk' Black-cab rapist Worboys, 61, was convicted of 19 offences against 12 women in 2009 at Croydon Crown Court and ordered to serve at least eight years in jail. The following year police said a number of women had come forward and that his alleged victims now numbered more than 100. Worboys would win passengers' trust before uncorking miniature bottles of champagne. Little did they know the cheap Tesco bubbly was laced with date-rape drug Temazepam, or over-the-counter sleeping medication, from the ""tool-kit"" he kept in the passenger footwell.

US boosts troop numbers at Mexico border,"Soldiers are helping to lay miles of razor wire along the border The US is to send an additional 2,000 troops to its border with Mexico, the Pentagon has announced. It will bring the total number of troops stationed on the southern border to about 4,300. The Pentagon said the soldiers would help border-patrol agents, carry out surveillance work and install miles of razor wire. It comes as President Donald Trump battles Congress for funds to build a wall along the border. He says such a measure is needed to stop illegal immigration. Mr Trump's insistence that the lower house of Congress, now controlled by his Democratic opponents, include funds for the wall in the US budget recently led to the longest government shutdown in US history. New border migrant separations revealed Trump stands firm over travel ban Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? He struck a temporary deal last month to reopen government departments but hasthreatened to trigger another shutdown or declare a national emergencyif his demands are not met. The current agreement expires on 15 February. Mr Trump is expected to again highlight the issue in his annual State of the Union speech on Tuesday. The US defence department said 3,750 extra soldiers would be sent to the border, although many will replace troops already there. The first deployments took place in November. ""Additional units are being deployed for 90 days, and we will continue to evaluate the force composition required to meet the mission to protect and secure the southern border,"" a Pentagon statement said. Many migrants seeking a better life try to cross into the US from Mexico Their tasks will include ""a mobile surveillance capability through the end of September 2019, as well as the emplacement of approximately 150 miles of concertina wire between ports of entry"". Last Thursday, President Trump tweeted that extra forces were being sent to the border to stop migrants who he said were travelling in ""caravans"" and threatening an ""invasion"".

Mr Trump has repeatedly described the situation on the Mexican border as a ""crisis"", although his critics have dismissed the use of troops as a political stunt. Mr Trump is, however, not the first US president to send troops to the border with Mexico. President Barack Obama sent some 1,200 National Guard soldiers to guard the boundary while President George W Bush deployed about 6,000 troops to help Border Patrol agents in what was called Operation Jump Start. Officials in Texas recently revealed that nine migrants on hunger strike at an immigration detention centre were being force-fed. Immigration officials are using plastic nasal tubes to feed some of the men, but relatives say it is causing severe nosebleeds and vomiting. The detainees have refused food in protest against conditions at the El Paso Processing Center. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) says a federal judge authorised the force-feeding last month.

Police said there were a number of leads they were pursuing over the 21-year-old's disappearance on Thursday. She was last seen getting into a taxi near the Welly Club music venue in Beverley Road at about 23:00 GMT.

Her mum said it had given them ""great comfort"" to know how much her daughter was thought of. Search teams are scouring the area where the 21-year-old was last seen Police have been carrying out house-to-house inquiries in Hull The family said Miss Squire's disappearance was ""very out of character"" and they were ""broken without her"". More than 70 police officers have been out making inquiries, including knocking door-to-door around the area where the student vanished. About 200 students have also been involved in the search of the university premises, organised by student Ryan Tweddell. Speaking earlier, Det Supt Simon Gawthorpe said: ""There are a number of leads we are following up and I want to offer my thanks to everyone who has come forward with information, your help has been invaluable.""

Worboys prompts Parole Board system reviewFurther changes could be introduced following the case of black-cab rapist John Worboys.UK,"Black cab rapist John Worboys was convicted of 19 offences against 12 women in 2009 The way the Parole Board of England and Wales operates is to be reviewed to see whether it needs ""fundamental"" reform. The government probe comes a year after the board caused an outcry by ruling that the so-called black-cab rapist John Worboys was safe to be freed. That decision was lateroverturned by the High Court. One of the options to be considered in the review would be for every parole hearing to be conducted like a court or tribunal, with a judge in charge. On Sunday, Justice Secretary David Gaukeannounced new rights for victimsto challenge violent offender releases. He said the changes should prevent the mistakes in the Worboys case from happening again. 'Black cab rapist' to stay in prison Cabbie who preyed on young women Worboys ruling quashed as parole head quits Mr Gauke said the review would consider whether the Parole Board needed extra powers or if it should be ""reconstituted"". He said no ""profound deficiencies"" in the way the parole process worked had been identified since theHigh Court overturned the board's decisionto release Worboys, but improvements were needed. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""It is important to note that for an arms-length body like the Parole Board we should do a tailored review every parliament. ""But it follows on from a number of reforms that we have already made."" Ministers previously scrapped a rule banning the Parole Board from disclosing information about the reasons behind its findings. The 246 members of the Parole Board make risk assessments and decisions on whether prisoners can be safely released or moved to an open jail. A judge or former judge is sometimes involved. Theydeal with about 25,000 cases a year,external, and in 2016-17 about 80% of decisions were made by reviewing case papers, rather than at an oral hearing. The justice secretary said he was determined to rebuild trust in the system Mr Gauke said instead of having to go to court to contest Parole Board decisions - which can be ""expensive and high-risk"" - victims will now be able to raise their concerns with the Ministry of Justice. He told Today: ""If the MoJ takes the view that there is an arguable case that there is something wrong with the process or the decision, it is then put back to the Parole Board, maintaining their independence."" The new system will apply from this summer to the most serious offenders - those serving indeterminate sentences, such as life terms, and people jailed under imprisonment for public protection, or serving extended sentences. The Ministry of Justice said it was currently ""not viable"" to hold parole hearings in public and acknowledged the changes might not go as far as some people wish. It said it had considered opening up appeals to the public, but after a consultation decided only parties in the case should be involved. Other measures will see the Parole Board ""clearly"" set out how its members should assess wider allegations of offending made against a prisoner. Kim Harrison, a lawyer from Slater and Gordon which helped a number of Worboys' victims bring civil claims, said the changes were a ""massive step in the right direction"". But she questioned why legal aid was not being made available to help victims through the ""complex process"" of challenging a release. The victims support charity Solace Women's Aid welcomed the plans, but said people should be able to challenge the early release of prisoners serving less severe terms. ""Any crime that creates a victim is important enough to include their voice and consider their wellbeing,"" it said. Solace said improvements were also needed in the way victims were notified of a release. It highlighted the case of one woman who only found out her ex-partner - who had raped her daughter - was free when a friend saw him in the street. This video can not be played Victim: 'The police assumed I was some drunk' Black-cab rapist Worboys, 61, was convicted of 19 offences against 12 women in 2009 at Croydon Crown Court and ordered to serve at least eight years in jail. The following year police said a number of women had come forward and that his alleged victims now numbered more than 100. Worboys would win passengers' trust before uncorking miniature bottles of champagne. Little did they know the cheap Tesco bubbly was laced with date-rape drug Temazepam, or over-the-counter sleeping medication, from the ""tool-kit"" he kept in the passenger footwell.

Patriots claim record sixth Super Bowl win,"This video can not be played Super Bowl 53: Bill Belichick's New England Patriots beat LA Rams to win sixth title The New England Patriots produced a defensive masterclass to beat the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and equal Pittsburgh Steelers' record of six Super Bowl titles. The victory also gave Patriots quarterback Tom Brady a sixth Super Bowl ring - an outright record for an individual player, eclipsing the mark he shared with Charles Haley. Bill Belichick - the most successful coach in Super Bowl history and now, at 66, the oldest man to win it - again came up with the perfect gameplan in Atlanta as the Patriots stifled a Rams offence that averaged 32.9 points per game in the regular season. The defensive strength of both sides resulted in the lowest-scoring Super Bowl of all time, with the 16 total points scored comfortably below the previous record of 21, set as Miami defeated Washington 14-7 in 1973. The score was just 3-0 until late in the third quarter through Stephen Gostkowski's 42-yard field goal. The Patriots' defence piled the pressure on 24-year-old quarterback Jared Goff and the Rams had to punt from their first eight possessions. Sean McVay's side finally got their offence moving in the third and drew level through a 53-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein. But Brady lofted a perfect 34-yard pass to Rob Gronkowski to set up Sony Michel to burrow over the line for the game's only touchdown with seven minutes left. Gostkowski added gloss with a late field goal as the Patriots ground out a hard-fought win. ""It was an unbelievable year, we fought through it more than anything,"" said 41-year-old Brady. ""They [the Rams] played so well, their defence was great, they made it tough on every play."" Before the game the American National Anthem was performed by legendary soul singer Gladys Knight, while the traditional half-time show duties fell to Maroon 5, whose set alongside Travis Scott and Big Boi met with only a lukewarm reception. Relive the Patriots' historic win Maroon 5's Super Bowl show fails to catch fire Male cheerleaders feature at Super Bowl for first time This video can not be played Super Bowl 53: Sixth ring 'doesn't change anything' - Tom Brady Brady was struggling as much as Goff in the early stages as the Rams produced a series of defensive plays that clearly fazed the veteran. For the first time all season, Brady threw an interception on the Patriots' opening drive and he was forced to call two timeouts to help him adjust to the Rams' gameplan. Brady has made a habit of recovering from a slow starts in Super Bowls - in the nine he and Belichick have reached together, the Pats have scored just three first-quarter points - and once he made the required adjustments, the improvements came. After Brady picked out a 25-yard pass to Julian Edelman, later named the game's most valuable player, Gostkowski's field goal from 42 yards opened the scoring. Indeed, if it was not for the safe hands of Edelman there would barely have been any offence to speak of in the first half, with Brady repeatedly hitting his go-to guy as the wide receiver moved into second place on the all-time list of post-season NFL receiving yards. And although the Rams finally got a foothold in the game thanks to Zuerlein's field goal, Brady took control when it mattered most, orchestrating the game-winning drive midway through the final quarter. He found Edelman once and Gronkowski twice - the reliable pair en route to combining for 228 of New England's 262 receiving yards - before rookie running back Michel punched in his sixth touchdown of the post-season. He may not have scored a touchdown, but Edelman was vital to the Patriots' win, the wide receiver time and again offering an outlet for Brady. The 32-year-old, now a three-time Super Bowl winner, had 10 receptions for 141 yards while also rushing once for eight yards Although the Rams' defence posed Brady some early problems, the Patriots had also managed to shut down the Rams' running game, putting the impetus on Goff, 24,  to find a solution through the air. But the first half finished with the Rams having claimed only two first downs and 57 yards of offence, having been in possession almost half as long as the Pats - just over 10 minutes compared to the Pats' 19 minutes and 52 seconds. It could have been even worse. Dont'a Hightower should have claimed an interception from the very first play of the second half, before a couple of runs from Todd Gurley - so impressive in the regular season but anonymous in the play-offs - finally gave the Rams some respite. But from their next possession Goff was forced to throw out of bounds from his own end zone and it was not until there was less than five minutes remaining in the third quarter that the Rams managed to convert on third down for the first time. Goff spotted Brandin Cooks open during that drive, only for Jason McCourty to make a crucial tackle as Cooks attempted to make the catch deep in the end zone, although the Rams gained some reward with Zuerlein's field goal. And even after Michel put the Pats back in front, the Rams could have hit straight back with a touchdown had Cooks hung on to a 24-yard pass into the corner, but Goff tried a similar pass with the next play and Stephon Gilmore intercepted to deal a fatal, decisive blow. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick:""It's sweet. Everybody counted us out, from the beginning of the season to midseason, but we're still here."" Rams head coach Sean McVay:""I'm pretty numb right now. Definitely I got out-coached, and I didn't do nearly enough for our football team."" Patriots wide receiver and MVP Julian Edelman:""It wasn't pretty, but I'll take that ugly win over a pretty loss any day."" Patriots quarterback Tom Brady:""I'm so happy for my team-mates. This is a dream come true for all of us."" Rams quarterback Jared Goff:""It kills. It hurts... It hurts me knowing how well our defence played, against that team, against Tom, and us not holding up our end of the bargain. It's our job to score points and we didn't do that tonight.""

Singer Adam Levine threw himself into the show, dropping to his knees, bashing out guitar solos and running up and down the M-shaped stage - but the band tried to cram in too much material (nine songs in 13 minutes) to create a coherent, enjoyable show. It didn't help that they had to make room for rapper Travis Scott, who arrived on stage by ""crash-landing"" in a comet, and local star Big Boi, formerly of Outkast, who drove onto the field to perform Kryptonite and I Like The Way You Move.

'PMS shouldn't be shrugged off'Flat-faced dog operations increasingFast food giants under fire on climate,"Emily Fazah says premenstrual syndrome (PMS) ""shouldn't be shrugged off"" ""I'm out for a week sometimes because I feel so low"". Emily Fazah has suffered from intense symptoms ever since she started her periods - from anxiety and fatigue, to mood swings and cramps. The 29-year-old says she ""suffered in silence"" for years, but is determined to no longer be embarrassed. She has set up an online community called Moody Girl, inspired by her childhood nickname, to ""get the world"" talking about premenstrual syndrome (PMS). ""Women have been feeling isolated for so long,"" says Miss Fazah, who lives in Ipswich, Suffolk. ""It shouldn't be embarrassing talking in front of men about suffering.

""From a young age, I learned to suppress it, not talk about it and suffer in silence,"" she says. Although she could turn to her mum, no-one at her school had the same problems. It was not until she began working full-time in London that she reached ""breaking point"". ""I was trying to keep down my emotions and the way it was making me feel,"" she says. It made going to client meetings difficult, and with a male boss, she felt she ""couldn't really open up about it"". Moody Girl provides an online platform for women to share their experiences That's when the seed for Moody Girl was sown. Miss Fazah thought to herself: ""What if there are other women out there that maybe I haven't met yet who have been going through the same thing as me? How do I connect with them?"" She made the decision to move back to Suffolk to set up the website, which shares her own story as well as experiences from other women, and a playlist which reflects her current mood. ""I wanted to open up that dialogue which was so desperately needed."" She says her aim is ""getting the word out, making a community of other women who are suffering, raising money and raising awareness, and not being embarrassed"". Miss Fazah launched Moody Girl in Ipswich The Facebook page has more than 1,100 followers, some from as far afield as the USA, and a further 600 people follow the Instagram site. Izzy Finbow, 29, from London, says she has found the Moody Girl community ""enlightening"" and ""inspiring"". The digital content editor says her PMS was ""ridiculous"", leaving her feeling bleakly depressed and ""irrational to new levels"". Being a part of the online social sites and seeing Miss Fazah's Instagram photos has helped her realise she is not alone, and given her tips such as using an app to track her periods. Eileen Murphy, 37, from Cambridge, says through the forum she has found ""solidarity"" with other women, while her partner now has a greater understanding of her symptoms and mood.

Flat-faced dog operations increasingFast food giants under fire on climate,"Operations can help open up a dog's airway Battersea Dogs and Cats Home carried out more operations to help flat-faced dogs breathe in 2018 than at any other time in its history, it has revealed. The south-west London shelter performed 62 lifesaving operations on breeds such as bulldogs and pugs last year, compared to seven in 2015. Brachycephalic dog breeds are increasingly popular but suffer from having short, obstructed airways. Battersea called the breeds an ""example of irresponsible, selective breeding"". The Kennel Club found French bulldogs to be the UK's most popular dog breed in 2018 Brachycephalic dog breeds tend to have big eyes, snub noses, and are compact in size. The British Veterinary Association haswarned people against buying flat-faced breedsbut Battersea has nonetheless taken in increasing numbers in recent years. The shelter took in 40 French bulldogs and 47 pugs in 2018, compared to eight and 36 respectively in 2014. According to Battersea vets, the way many are bred means they often have airways so narrow that it is ""the equivalent of us breathing through a drinking straw"". ""Over the years, breeders have chosen the flattest-faced dogs in the litter to breed, and this has created traits that are dangerous and damaging to the dog's health,"" head vet Shaun Opperman said. This video can not be played The Today programme explains why pugs' tongues shouldn't actually stick out Other dogs that can suffer from the problem, which makes it difficult for them to run or play, include English bulldogs, Boston terriers, shih tzus and boxers.

Hermes to offer pay benefits to couriers,"Hermes, the delivery firm, has struck a deal with the GMB union to offer couriers paid holiday and guaranteed wage rates. Under its new ""self-employed plus"" status, Hermes workers can opt to receive up to 28 days of paid leave. They can also choose pay rates of at least Â£8.50 an hour over the year - more than the minimum wage of Â£7.83 an hour, which rises to Â£8.21 in April. The GMB called the deal ""ground-breaking"". However an employment expert raised questions about the tax implications. Hermes's 15,000 couriers can deliver parcels in whichever order they want and will be able to continue to do so if they take up the new arrangement. New couriers wishing to take up the pay holiday terms will have to follow routes specified by Hermes. The company said that if it is guaranteeing hourly rates of pay, it needs to ensure that couriers are taking the most efficient route. Why so many young workers have 'side hustles' Does flexible working come at a cost? Uber loses latest legal bid over driver rights The GMB said that the collective bargaining agreement is on an opt-in basis and ""will not affect those couriers who wish to retain their current form of self-employed status and earn premium rates"". Martijn de Lange, chief executive of Hermes UK, said: ""We have listened to our couriers and are wholeheartedly committed to offering innovative ways of working to meet peoples' differing needs."" The so-called gig economy means that people are paid for the ""gigs"" they do such as delivering a parcel or a car journey, rather than their time. Some workers are pushing companies to offer better conditions such as paid leave and the minimum wage. But Matthew Taylor, author ofan independent review in 2017 into working practices, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that Hermes' new arrangement could raise questions about whether it was ""sustainable"" as it may be of interest to HM Revenue & Customs. ""I'm afraid.. I think the HMRC...will be looking at this very closely because if somebody has most of the benefits of being an employee and if the employer has most of the benefits of employing somebody, then the tax authorities will want the employee to be paying national insurance as an employee and they'll want the company in particular to be paying national insurance on those people,"" he said. Hermes said it was ""totally surprised"" by Mr Taylor's comments and ""100% disagreed"" with them.  It said Hermes had received legal advice that under its new offer its couriers would remain self-employed. Mark Rix, GMB's national officer told the BBC that there were tax implications only for those receiving a ""full suite"" of benefits. Ed Cross has been a Hermes courier for ten years and his route is in North Yorkshire. He says he hasn't had a holiday for ten years, partly because he will no longer have to find someone to cover his route when he is away. ""It's a huge deal because we've been self employed, basically on our own, we've nobody to turn to, if Hermes say 'no' or they treat us wrongly, we have nowhere to go, nothing, up until now."" In December, Uber, the ride-sharing service,lost an appeal against a ruling in 2016which said drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam were entitled to benefits. Uber said it would appeal to the Supreme Court. Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB, said: ""Full credit to Hermes. They're showing that the gig economy doesn't have to be an exploitative economy and we look forward to working with them through this ground-breaking agreement.

Parole Board system to be reviewed,"Black cab rapist John Worboys was convicted of 19 offences against 12 women in 2009 The way the Parole Board of England and Wales operates is to be reviewed to see whether it needs ""fundamental"" reform. The government probe comes a year after the board caused an outcry by ruling that the so-called black-cab rapist John Worboys was safe to be freed. That decision was lateroverturned by the High Court. One of the options to be considered in the review would be for every parole hearing to be conducted like a court or tribunal, with a judge in charge. On Sunday, Justice Secretary David Gaukeannounced new rights for victimsto challenge violent offender releases. He said the changes should prevent the mistakes in the Worboys case from happening again. 'Black cab rapist' to stay in prison Cabbie who preyed on young women Worboys ruling quashed as parole head quits Mr Gauke said the review would consider whether the Parole Board needed extra powers or if it should be ""reconstituted"". He said no ""profound deficiencies"" in the way the parole process worked had been identified since theHigh Court overturned the board's decisionto release Worboys, but improvements were needed. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""It is important to note that for an arms-length body like the Parole Board we should do a tailored review every parliament. ""But it follows on from a number of reforms that we have already made."" Ministers previously scrapped a rule banning the Parole Board from disclosing information about the reasons behind its findings. The 246 members of the Parole Board make risk assessments and decisions on whether prisoners can be safely released or moved to an open jail. A judge or former judge is sometimes involved. Theydeal with about 25,000 cases a year,external, and in 2016-17 about 80% of decisions were made by reviewing case papers, rather than at an oral hearing. The justice secretary said he was determined to rebuild trust in the system Mr Gauke said instead of having to go to court to contest Parole Board decisions - which can be ""expensive and high-risk"" - victims will now be able to raise their concerns with the Ministry of Justice. He told Today: ""If the MoJ takes the view that there is an arguable case that there is something wrong with the process or the decision, it is then put back to the Parole Board, maintaining their independence."" The new system will apply from this summer to the most serious offenders - those serving indeterminate sentences, such as life terms, and people jailed under imprisonment for public protection, or serving extended sentences. The Ministry of Justice said it was currently ""not viable"" to hold parole hearings in public and acknowledged the changes might not go as far as some people wish. It said it had considered opening up appeals to the public, but after a consultation decided only parties in the case should be involved. Other measures will see the Parole Board ""clearly"" set out how its members should assess wider allegations of offending made against a prisoner. Kim Harrison, a lawyer from Slater and Gordon which helped a number of Worboys' victims bring civil claims, said the changes were a ""massive step in the right direction"". But she questioned why legal aid was not being made available to help victims through the ""complex process"" of challenging a release. The victims support charity Solace Women's Aid welcomed the plans, but said people should be able to challenge the early release of prisoners serving less severe terms. ""Any crime that creates a victim is important enough to include their voice and consider their wellbeing,"" it said. Solace said improvements were also needed in the way victims were notified of a release. It highlighted the case of one woman who only found out her ex-partner - who had raped her daughter - was free when a friend saw him in the street. This video can not be played Victim: 'The police assumed I was some drunk' Black-cab rapist Worboys, 61, was convicted of 19 offences against 12 women in 2009 at Croydon Crown Court and ordered to serve at least eight years in jail. The following year police said a number of women had come forward and that his alleged victims now numbered more than 100. Worboys would win passengers' trust before uncorking miniature bottles of champagne. Little did they know the cheap Tesco bubbly was laced with date-rape drug Temazepam, or over-the-counter sleeping medication, from the ""tool-kit"" he kept in the passenger footwell.
