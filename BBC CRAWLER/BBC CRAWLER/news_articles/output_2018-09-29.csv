Tory app security breach reveals MPs' numbersBoris Johnson was among those whose details could be accessed through the party's conference app.UK Politics,"The Tory party's app for the conference was readily available to download on the Apple app store Conservative MPs including Boris Johnson have had their phone numbers and other personal details revealed by the party's conference app. A Guardian columnist highlighted the security breach on Twitter and the BBC was also able to access private details of people attending the event. The Conservative Party apologised for ""any concern caused"" and said ""the technical issue has been resolved"". The Information Commissioner's Office said it would be making inquiries. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the technical glitch was ""deeply, deeply embarrassing"" for the party. The Guardian's Dawn Foster, who is attending the conference, tweeted about the security breach and said she had been able to access the former foreign secretary's personal details, including his mobile phone number. She shared a redacted picture of Mr Johnson's profile, which did not reveal his phone number. It appears that people could access an MP's personal details by entering their email address, without a password, when pressing the attendee's button in the app. This button has since been removed on the app, which was created by Australian firm Crowd Comms. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the app was ""now functioning securely"" and the party would be ""investigating the issue further"".

Tom Daley felt 'inferior' over sexuality,"Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success. The 24-year-old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that ""not everyone is like me"". Speaking on the firstRadio 4 Desert Island Discspresented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others ""hope"". He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics. The regular presenter of the long-running show,Kirsty Young, has taken a number of months off because of illness. Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt ""less than"" everyone else growing up because ""it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls"". He said: ""To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed."" He wanted to prove that he was ""something"", he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality. Daley and partner marry at luxury hotel Tom Daley and husband become parents Champion Daley in gay rights plea The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australiato appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality. He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others ""hope"". The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - ""caught me by surprise"". Tom Daley says falling in love with Dustin Lance Black had taken him by surprise Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age gap had never been an issue. ""When you go through so much at such a young age"" - he went to his first Olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows. The couple became parents in June, to a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his ""whole perspective"" had changed. When they announced their baby news, Daley posted a picture of the couple holding up to the camera and black and white image from their baby scan ""If you had asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal',"" he said. ""You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals. My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."" His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer. Daley said his dad did not accept he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets yet for London 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row. Tom Daley says his dad (left) was his biggest supporter ""I couldn't say to him 'you're not going to be around to be on the front row dad',"" he said. ""I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he'd actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged he wasn't invincible,"" he said. The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze. ""I just knew that this is what I had dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,"" he said. It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had resonated with him in the build up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.

Musk out as Tesla chair over fraud case,"This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Elon Musk must step down as Tesla chair and pay a fine after reaching a deal with US regulators over tweets he posted about taking the firm private. It follows Thursday's decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sue Mr Musk for alleged securities fraud. Under the deal, Mr Musk will remain as Tesla CEO but has to step down as chairman for three years. Both he and Tesla will also have to pay a $20m (Â£15m) fine. The SEC's chairman Jay Clayton said that he supported the deal, and felt that it was in the best interests of US markets and investors, including the shareholders of Tesla. ""This matter reaffirms an important principle embodied in our disclosure-based federal securities laws,"" he said. ""Specifically, when companies and corporate insiders make statements, they must act responsibly, including endeavouring to ensure the statements are not false or misleading and do not omit information a reasonable investor would consider important in making an investment decision."" The fraud allegation relates to his August tweet in which Mr Musk said he was considering taking electronic car maker Tesla off the stock market and into private ownership. He wrote he had ""funding secured"" for the proposal, which would value Tesla at $420 per share. Shares in the company briefly rose after his announcement, but later fell again. The SEC said those claims were ""false and misleading"". The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk ""In truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,"" the regulator said. Mr Musk initially responded to the charges by saying the action was ""unjustified"" and he acted in the ""best interests of truth, transparency and investors"". In addition to the fines, Mr Musk will also have to comply with company communications procedures when tweeting about the firm. He now has 45 days to leave his role as chairman of Tesla. The SEC had initially sought to ban Mr Musk from working on the board of any publicly traded company, but under the deal he will now be able to stay on as Tesla's chief executive officer. A new ""independent chairman"" for the company will be appointed, who will preside over the company's board. Forcing Tesla to separate the roles of CEO and chairman should limit Mr Musk's power within the company. Despite this, many analysts say the outcome is a good one for Mr Musk, given he remains in charge of day-to-day operations as CEO. Born in South Africa, Mr Musk made millions from online payments firm PayPal before moving on to Tesla and rocket company SpaceX. He is the 25th richest person in the world, according to Forbes, which estimates his net worth to be $19.7bn  (Â£15.1bn). But it has been a volatile summer for the entrepreneur. Mr Musk is being sued for defamationafter making allegations against a British diver involved in the Thai cave rescue. Earlier this month,he found himself in another controversy after appearing on a podcast while smoking marijuana. Although the drug is legal in California, where the podcast was recorded, shares in Tesla fell more than nine per cent after his appearance.

Russian woman 'identifies' Salisbury suspect,"The Bellingcat website released a photo of the man it says is Anatoliy Chepiga (left), while Russia Today named him as Ruslan Boshirov (right) A woman in the far east of Russia has told the BBC she recognises one of the key suspects in the Salisbury attack as a military intelligence officer. The woman identified him immediately from photographs as Anatoliy Chepiga, a decorated ""Hero of Russia"". Her assertion supports research by the Bellingcat online investigations team,which also identified Col Chepiga,externalas one of the Salisbury suspects. The man told Russian state TV he was Ruslan Boshirov, a civilian. The BBC understands that British officials do not dispute the findings by Bellingcat. British police believe the suspects were not using their real names. Russia denies any involvement in the Novichok nerve agent attack, in which former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned on 4 March. Skripal suspect was 'honoured by Putin' The website behind the Skripal revelation Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? A BBC team travelled some 5,000 miles east of Moscow to the village of Beryozovka, where Anatoliy Chepiga grew up, close to Russia's border with China. This video can not be played A BBC team showed photographs to residents in Anatoliy Chepiga's old village There, a woman identified a young Anatoliy in the photographs discovered and published by Bellingcat. She then confirmed that a mugshot released by British police of ""Ruslan Boshirov"" was also Col Chepiga. ""I know where his parents used to live, that he was a military man. An officer. He fought in war zones, then he was in Moscow,"" she told the BBC - the first foreign journalists to visit since the Bellingcat report. Nervous about speaking, she asked to remain anonymous, but said she had seen Col Chepiga as an adult, with his child, and she was sure he and ""Boshirov"" were one and the same. She added: ""It's him in the photos, of course."" Locals say the family moved out of Beryozovka several years ago. Villagers told the BBC that Col Chepiga's family no longer live in Beryozovka While Col Chepiga's parents were well known, he was not a regular visitor himself as an adult. Many residents had no idea what he looked like. Not all had heard of the Salisbury poisoning. One man who had, and studied with Anatoliy Chepiga at the village school, swore at the BBC team and claimed the allegations were false. He instructed another local not to talk to journalists. An elderly woman, speaking only through her window, was non-committal about the photographs, insisting that images could be doctored. She did not want to give her name but could not believe the ""horrible story"" about someone she said she had ""valued, respected and liked"". That woman confirmed Anatoliy Chepiga was a ""Hero of Russia"", a title bestowed by the country's president. The BBC showed photos of the Salisbury suspect to various villagers in Beryozovka, Russia On Friday, Vladimir Putin's spokesman said he had ""no information"" about any such person being decorated. He declined to say whether that meant the award was for secret missions. The announcement, though, is still included on the webpage of a local veterans group. The group's leader told the BBC the information on Col Chepiga was sent to them for inclusion. No one there knew him personally. At the construction company the BBC Russian service believes was founded and run by Col Chepiga's father in the 1990s, staff would not speak to journalists. When we called a mobile phone number linked to the parents, a man picked up and claimed to be from Uzbekistan. He said he had bought the phone ""on the street"" three months ago from ""a Russian"". The line was then disconnected. Two weeks ago, President Putin himself said the suspects wanted by British police were civilians. Nothing special and nothing criminal, he said. On Friday, his spokesman told journalists that the Kremlin would not discuss any further what he called ""informal investigations"" into the poisoning. But the questions over Russia's explanations, and the true identity of the Salisbury suspects, are only mounting. Additional research by the BBC Russian service.

UK would 'forever regret' losing carmakers,"This video can not be played Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota's Burnaston plant near Derby The UK ""would regret it forever"" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said. He added it was ""concerning"" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby. ""We need a deal,"" Mr Clark said. The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs. The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union. ""My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory,"" said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston. Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, includingHonda, BMW andJaguar Land Rover. BMW, for example, says it willclose its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit. Brexit: All you need to know Honda: No-deal Brexit 'would cost millions' What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Toyota's production line is run on a ""just-in-time"" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts. It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped. Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is ""precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border"". ""We need to have a deal... we want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."" Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs. Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: ""In my experience once these jobs go they never come back. ""And that's why we have to do everything possible to keep these jobs in the area."" A government spokesperson said: ""We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU. ""As part of this we have proposed a UK-EU free trade area underpinned by a common rulebook on manufactured goods, such as automotives.""

Claire Foy reveals struggles with anxiety,"Foy played The Queen in the first two seasons of The Crown Actress Claire Foy has opened up about her struggles with anxiety, revealing how her career worsened her condition. In an interview with the Guardian,externalthe 34-year-old said she had suffered anxiety since she was a child but it ""exploded"" when she became an actress. Foy recentlywon an Emmyfor her role as Queen Elizabeth II in the Netflix series The Crown. But the star admitted the condition meant she doubted her ability and was plagued by negative thoughts. ""When you have anxiety, you have anxiety about - I don't know - crossing the road,"" she told the Guardian's Weekend magazine. ""The thing about it is, it's not related to anything that would seem logical. It's purely about that feeling in the pit of your stomach, and the feeling that you can't, because you're 'this' or you're 'that'. It's my mind working at a thousand beats a second, and running away with a thought."" Anxiety is a natural human response when we perceive we are under threat It can be experienced through thoughts, feelings and physical sensations Most people feel anxious at times but it becomes a mental health problem if it impacts on your ability to live your life as fully as you want to Treatments available include talking therapies, such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) or medication Symptoms include: feeling light-headed or dizzy; feeling restless or unable to sit still; faster breathing and a fast, thumping or irregular heartbeat; and panic attacks. More symptoms can be foundhere,external Source:Mind,external The actress said her condition also contributed to her struggling with self-doubt, including when she auditioned for the role of Anne Boleyn in the 2014 BBC adaptation of Wolf Hall. ""I'd read Hilary Mantel's novel. And I just thought: 'I'm not her. Not in any way, shape or form.' ""Anne was so intelligent, so alluring, so able to be mysterious and have people be fascinated with her. Anne knew she was special... I just didn't see it."" Foy said she developed anxiety as a child as ""a tool to survive"" and ""try to feel safe"". Her parents separated when she was eight years old and she said her response was to try to ""make everybody happy. Never be angry. Be really sweet and well-behaved"". Claire Foy: 'I didn't want to play the perfect housewife' Fame, fortune, fear: Why do pop stars struggle with anxiety? As an adult she eventually saw a therapist and said her anxiety had now ""plateaued"". ""It's still there, but I guess I don't believe it so much any more. ""I used to think that this was my lot in life, to be anxious. And that I would struggle and struggle and struggle with it, and that it would make me quite miserable, and that I'd always be restricted.

"'Don't bother' Benny the beluga, fans urged","The whale has been seen ""swimming strongly"" Benny the beluga is spending his fifth day in the Thames but appears to be healthy and swimming normally, the Port of London Authority (PLA) has said. The latest sighting of Benny came just after midday, with reports it had stayed in a one-mile stretch of river. Whale-spotters are being urged to keep to the riverbank near Gravesend and not venture on to the water in boats. The PLA said no-one had attempted to take a boat near Benny, but it was a situation they hoped to avoid. A spokesman said: ""The first confirmed sighting was just after 12:00 BST. ""To the best of our knowledge, the whale is healthy and swimming, although obviously this is an unusual situation."" As whale-watchers gathered on the banks of the Thames, people took to social media to give the beluga its nickname. It breeched near a buoy on the River Thames The PLA spokesman said: ""The biggest obvious hazard is people wanting to come in small boats to have a look, so we have asked people not do that to the whale and to watch safely without bothering it from the shore."" No-one had yet tried to take a small boat on to the river, he added, however that was what happened in 2006 whena bottle-nosed whale became stranded,externalin the Thames. It later died. The estuary where the whale is feeding is a busy shipping channel Benny was first spotted in the Thames estuary on Tuesday, ""swimming strongly and feeding normally"" near barges. On Thursday, it was sighted slightly further upstream. Experts said the whale appeared to be a sub adult - an older juvenile but not a fully-formed adult. Benny has been seen feeding around barges near Gravesend According to the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR), Benny has been foraging, surfacing and diving - behaviour consistent with a healthy animal. River users and shipping companies have been urged to steer clear of the whale, which is thousands of miles away from its Arctic habitat. Benny has been foraging in the river Beluga whales can grow up to 20ft in length and are usually at home in the icy waters around Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea. Rescue teams have been on standby in case the animal gets into danger.

N Korea 'won't disarm if sanctions stay',"Mr Ri said sanctions would not ""bring North Korea to its knees"". North Korea's foreign minister has warned that there is ""no way"" his country will disarm while the US continues to enforce sanctions. Ri Yong-ho told the UN General Assembly the sanctions were deepening North Korean mistrust of the US. Pyongyang has repeatedly appealed for UN and US sanctions to be lifted and has support from Russia and China. But the Trump Administration has said that sanctions should stay in place until North Korea denuclearises. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met at a landmark summit in June, which saw Mr Kim pledge to work towards nuclear disarmament. Tangible progress since then though has been scant. He said the US was insisting on a ""denuclearisation first"" policy that ""increased the level of sanctions"". ""The recent deadlock is because the US relies on coercive measures which are lethal to trust-building,"" Mr Ri told the assembly. Seeing through Kim's new friendly image Can Moon and Kim create long-term Korean peace? How Kim the outcast became popular North Korea's missile and nuclear programme ""Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."" ""The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us,"" he added. An agreement reached there said North Korea would work towards denuclearisation but it did not include any timeline, details or mechanisms to verify the process. In AugustPresident Trump accused North Korea's ally China of undermining progresson denuclearisation because of its trade dispute with the US. This video can not be played Kim Jong-un and I ""fell in love"" - Trump on the North Korean leader at a rally in West Virginia However, earlier this month South Korean leader Moon Jae-in completed a high-profile, three-day visit to Pyongyang - the first by a Southern leader to the North's capital in a decade. Mr Moon said that he had been ""able to confirm Chairman Kim's firm commitment to complete denuclearisation"" and that he had also expressed his wish to meet Mr Trump again soon. Mr Kim has also promised to dismantle North Korea's main missile testing and launching site, and said he could decommission the main nuclear test site, if the US took some reciprocal action. Mr Trump meanwhile has saidhe expects to have a second summit with Mr Kimin the ""not too distant future"".

'I lost my girlfriend and sister in the same car crash',"Caitlin Huddleston and Skye Mitchell were both 18 when they died Aidan Huddleston was lying in bed on a Friday evening when he got a call telling him his girlfriend Skye and his sister Caitlin were dead. ""I kind of realised in that moment in time, my future that I'd had with Skye, and my sister's future, had just been completely removed - and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Skye Mitchell had been driving her friends Caitlin Huddleston and Ellis Marr to a restaurant near Millom in Cumbria, where they lived in July last year. The road was new to Skye, who had passed her test only four months earlier. She was travelling fast, but within the speed limit. It was wet. As she turned a corner, she lost control of her car, and hit a van. Skye and Aidan had been together for eight months ""I'd just got home from work, was lying in bed, falling asleep actually,"" says Aidan. ""Then the light of my phone lit up, and I noticed I had numerous messages and missed calls."" Aidan, 24, found out that night that his girlfriend and his sister had died at the scene. They were both 18. Ellis, who was in the back seat, and the 51-year-old driver of the van were both airlifted to hospital. Ellis stayed in hospital for five months. The van driver is still there, 14 months after the crash. Caitlin (left) and Skye (right) had been friends since primary school, they met Ellis (centre) in Secondary school ""We do not blame Skye whatsoever for what happened,"" says Aidan. ""There was nothing she could have done I believe on that night. It was all down to inexperience."" That's the reason Skye and Caitlin's families are calling for graduated driving licences (GDLs). A GDL scheme would mean restrictions for new drivers - for example a night curfew and a limit on the number of passengers they can carry. Those restrictions could last one or two years and then be lifted as drivers gain more experience. Aidan says that ""this whole situation wouldn't have occurred"" if GDLs were already in place. ""It would prevent injuries to people and it would stop families having to go through what mine and Skye's family has gone through,"" he says. AnRAC Foundation report,externalearlier this year estimated 281 fewer people a year would be killed or seriously injured if GDLs were introduced in England, Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland, which already hassome limitson new drivers, including a 45mph speed cap for the first year, plans to introduce the GDL in 2020. Data from other countries which have GDLs, such asthe US,externalandNew Zealand,external, seems to suggest it lowers the number of people killed or seriously injured by young drivers. Trudy Harrison MP was driving nearby on the night of the crash Trudy Harrison, Conservative MP for the area where Caitlin and Skye were from, was driving near her office in Bootle on the night of the crash, and was diverted as a result. ""I later learned that Skye and Caitlin were involved because my daughters came rushing downstairs to tell me about it,"" she tells Newsbeat. ""These young girls were very much part of our community."" Although Ms Harrison agrees ""something needs to be done"" to protect young drivers, she's ""not in favour of all aspects of the graduated driving licence"". ""I represent a very rural area in West Cumbria, and I'm very concerned that whatever is brought in should not disadvantage young people economically, in an area where we just cannot rely upon public transport."" Some examples she gives are of young parents with their children in the car or people who work outside normal hours. She would like to see better tuition for learner drivers, cheaper insurance on safer cars - and even suggests virtual reality technology as a way to help hazard perception. There are already voluntary measures you can take, such as displaying green probationary P plates - which show others that you've just passed your test. The crash happened on the A595 near Bootle The coroner who carried out an inquest into the deaths of Skye and Caitlinhas also called forGDLs to be brought into the whole of the UK. ""This isn't a punishment on young drivers,"" says Aidan. ""This whole graduated driving licence is here to help save lives."" He does say that if the GDL was in place when he was a new driver ""it would be more difficult socialising with friends, but still not impossible"". But he wouldn't trade the lives that would be saved ""for a bit of a laugh with my friends"". Road safety charity Brake supports GDLs. ""The government must act now to put an end to this daily tragedy and introduce graduated driver licensing, a safety measure which is proven to work and reduce young driver crashes,"" Joshua Harris, Brake's director of campaigns, said in a statement. The Department for Transport says it has decided to use the introduction of GDLs in Northern Ireland as a pilot to gather evidence on the potential for GDL across the rest of Great Britain. Caitlin, Aidan and their sister Hannah More than a year on from the crash, Aidan says: ""It certainly doesn't get easier, you just cope with it better. ""Some days you wake up and you don't want to do anything, but you've got to keep going."" ""We truly were in love with each other,"" he says about Skye. ""It would only ever get easier again if they were back here."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

The students opting for booze-free halls at university,"For many students, drinking and parties are a big part of the freshers' experience. But with more than one in five students saying they are teetotal, the demand for alcohol-free accommodation is on the rise. Mohamed is 19 and about to start his second year at Aberdeen University. He describes himself as talkative and easy to get along with. His only concern when starting university? He doesn't drink. As a Muslim he is teetotal for religious reasons so he opted for alcohol-free halls of residence. ""I would have felt uncomfortable living in a place where people were drinking. I didn't want to be in that environment,"" he says. 'Generation Sensible' in five charts What's it like being young and teetotal? But far from being a boring place to be, he says he loved living there. ""I could still meet lots of people and get involved in activities"". ""Some of my friends went straight into private accommodation and they missed out on stuff because they were living further away from the campus."" The alcohol-free block at Aberdeen University was relatively small when it was introduced last year and the 30 rooms available were only half full. But at other universities the idea has proved more popular. More than 400 students applied for alcohol-free accommodation at St Andrews University last year - far exceeding the 132 rooms available. Other universities which now offer booze-free living options include Chester, Bristol, Canterbury Christ Church and the University of West England. Aberdeen student Lachlan Shanks says he wanted to avoid booze-fuelled parties in his flat The rise in accommodation options comes asa growing number of young people are choosing not to drink,external. More than a fifth say they are teetotal, with financial pressures, a wider diversity of faiths and increased health awareness thought to be contributing factors. Mohamed says: ""There were quite a few people who did drink but only in moderation. A couple of my flatmates still went to parties and clubs. I think they were mainly worried about being in a noisy flat."" Lachlan Shanks, 19, also chose the alcohol-free block at Aberdeen University. He prefers not to drink himself and says he is a quiet person. ""If I had flatmates that liked drinking and clubbing I wouldn't have had much in common with them,"" he says. ""I thought if I picked the alcohol-free block people wouldn't be coming home late or having parties in the flat."" Nearly four in five students surveyed by the National Union of Students (79%) still believe that getting drunk is part of university culture - and only one in 10 are aware of responsible drinking activities or campaigns on campus. Lauren Seward says she spent a lot of time on her own during freshers week because she didn't drink. Lauren Seward, 22, is teetotal and says she would ""definitely"" have considered alcohol-free accommodation if the option had been available. She graduated from the University of Kent in 2017 and lived in halls in her first year but often felt lonely because so many activities revolved around drinking. ""Freshers' week was the worst because at that point everyone is really obsessed about going out and drinking so I spent a lot of time on my own,"" she says. Although she eventually made friends outside her halls she said an alcohol-free option would have been appealing. ""On the one hand it's good to meet different people and plenty of my friends drink. But in first year it would give some reassurance that at least at home you won't have to deal with people drinking all the time."" Eva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare for the NUS says if students are asking for these sorts of spaces, universities should offer them as an option. ""We also need to foster more responsible drinking cultures amongst students and offer more events and activities which aren't centred on drinking that everyone can enjoy."" But Georgia, 19, who is also teetotal, says she didn't want to live somewhere that marked her out as different. Her university, Plymouth Marjon, didn't have an alcohol-free option so she lived in ordinary halls in her first year. Although initially quite nervous about being around big groups drinking and worries about feeling left out, she soon made friends and found not drinking ""wasn't an issue"". ""I feel like if I'd been in alcohol-free halls I would have been judged by other students when I told them where I lived and subject to more scrutiny about 'why don't you drink?'. ""It could work for some people but I wouldn't want to be labelled like that,"" she says. Mohamed says he didn't find this a problem. ""It wasn't segregated at all. I don't think that many people actually knew there was an alcohol-free block in my halls. I had friends living in other halls and other blocks. The only difference is there isn't alcohol in your own flat,"" he says. 'Generation Sensible' in five charts What's it like being young and teetotal?

Here are the answers: Distance runner Mo Farah's full name is Sir Mohamed Muktar Jama Farah CBE Oliver held its position as the most popular boys' name since 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). A number of readers asked whether adding together all of the different spellings of Muhammad would mean more babies were given that name than Oliver. Muhammad, the most common spelling given to babies born in 2017, was the 10th most popular name for boys overall. Oliver topped the 2017 list with 6,259 babies while Muhammad was registered 3,691 times - not including hyphenated names, such as Muhammad-Ali. If we combine 14 different spellings included in the data we get 7,307 boys, which is more than 1,000 ahead of Oliver. Variations included Muhammad, Mohammed, Mohammad, Muhammed, Mohamed, Mohamad, Muhamad, Muhamed, Mohamud, Mohummad, Mohummed, Mouhamed, Mohammod and Mouhamad. However the ONS treats each spelling of a name separately and ranks them according to the number of times that individual spelling appears on birth certificates. ""Combining spellings of one particular name distorts the list - for example combining Sophie, Sophia and Sofia on the 2015 girls list would knock Amelia off the top spot,""the ONS said in 2016.,external Statisticians say combining names which have a similar spelling would require individuals to make a ""subjective decision"" about whether certain names are distinctive or not. For example, they would have to decide whether or not to treat Sara and Sarah as variations of the same name, even though many people would pronounce them differently.

Sneezing buck 'one-in-a-million shot',"Sneezing white fallow buck, Bradgate Park, Leicestershire, UK A 19-year-old university student has described his photograph of a white fallow buck sneezing as a ""one-in-a-million shot"". Oban van Schie took the snap of the deer at Bradgate Park in Leicestershire while taking a ride in the countryside on his motorbike following a ""stressful"" day. He took along an old SLR camera and a few 20-year-old lenses given to him by his parents. He says he spotted what he believed to be an ""elusive"" white fallow buck after it moved away from a herd of other deer. Oban told the BBC: ""I managed to get to a safe distance of about 10 metres without disrupting the herd and captured the photo of the fallow buck sneezing by pure chance. ""I didn't realise what I had until hours later when I began editing my photos."" Afterposting the image on Reddit,external, the white fallow buck's sneeze has been upvoted - a sign of popularity - almost 90,000 times on the Mildly Interesting and Photoshop Battles subsections of the site. New York-born Oban has been taking photographs as a hobby for the last 15 months On Reddit people have been referencing a joke in Netflix cartoon series BoJack Horseman whereby the title character - a celebrity talking horse - is dismayed the news continues to use a stock picture of him sneezing at a party. As Isperfectlycromulent quoted: ""Why do they always use the sneezing picture?"" Several other posters pointed out Oban should have watermarked the image, as it was ""something that literally no other photographer has captured"". Although another Redditor was happy that ""finally, my Venn diagram of 'albino stag pictures' and 'sneezing stag pictures' can intersect"".

UK would 'forever regret' losing carmakersThe business secretary says a no-deal Brexit could threaten the UK's status as a world-leading car maker.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota's Burnaston plant near Derby The UK ""would regret it forever"" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said. He added it was ""concerning"" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby. ""We need a deal,"" Mr Clark said. The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs. The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union. ""My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory,"" said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston. Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, includingHonda, BMW andJaguar Land Rover. BMW, for example, says it willclose its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit. Brexit: All you need to know Honda: No-deal Brexit 'would cost millions' What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Toyota's production line is run on a ""just-in-time"" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts. It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped. Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is ""precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border"". ""We need to have a deal... we want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."" Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs. Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: ""In my experience once these jobs go they never come back. ""And that's why we have to do everything possible to keep these jobs in the area."" A government spokesperson said: ""We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU. ""As part of this we have proposed a UK-EU free trade area underpinned by a common rulebook on manufactured goods, such as automotives.""

Father describes 'terror' of Madeleine case,"Madeleine McCann has been missing since 2007 Madeleine McCann's father has described the ""terror"" and ""disbelief"" at first realising his daughter was missing. Madeleine, then aged three, disappeared from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2007, sparking a worldwide search for her whereabouts. Gerry McCann said he had not thought about ""those moments"" for a long time because they were too ""painful"". Mr McCann wasspeaking to BBC Radio 4for a programme about the relationship between fathers and daughters. He said that he was sure immediately that his daughter had been abducted. After being told by his wife Kate that their daughter was missing, Mr McCann said ""automation kicked in"" and he began searching the apartment. ""We started searching more widely really quickly and then very quickly raised the alarm,"" he said. ""You're in this quiet little holiday resort - that seemed idyllic - out of season and I certainly didn't speak Portuguese so I asked [our friend] Matt to go to reception and ask them to call the police."" Madeleine McCann: Timeline of first night Mr McCann said he remembered him and his wife being back in the bedroom ""completely distraught"", adding their reaction was ""almost feral"". ""I couldn't get the darkest thoughts out of our minds, that somebody had taken her and abused her,"" he continued. ""I felt that every moment that we couldn't find her was worse. ""I remember being slumped on the floor and starting to call some of my family members and just saying: 'Pray for her.'"" Mr McCann, from Rothley, Leicestershire, added that some parts of that night 11 years ago are ""blurred"", but he remembers waiting ""forever"" for the police to arrive. ""It just felt terrible. We went then to another apartment, by which time it was three or four in the morning and Kate was saying, 'I want to go back out and search.' ""I was saying: 'Just wait until it gets light,' and Kate kept saying: 'It's so cold.'"" The Metropolitan Police inquiry into the disappearance - known as Operation Grange - has been ongoing since 2011. Four people were identified as suspects in 2013, but no further action was taken after they were interviewed by Portuguese officers and the Met Police, who visited the holiday resort in 2014. The Home Office said last week it is currently considering a police request for an extra six months' funding for Operation Grange. 20:30Kate and Gerry McCann leave their apartment to have dinner at a Tapas bar 21:05Gerry McCann checks on Madeleine and her siblings 22:00A man is seen carrying a child wearing pyjamas heading towards the ocean (E-fit images of the suspect were releasedas part of a 2013 Crimewatch appeal) 22:00Kate McCann raises the alarm that Madeleine has gone missing Clickable map and timeline Police granted Madeleine inquiry funds Madeleine McCann: Timeline and search maps New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Danish police free manhunt suspects,"Authorities shut down transport links to and from Denmark's largest island Danish police have questioned and released two suspects travelling in a Swedish car that was the subject of a huge manhunt on Friday. The pair were detained after they were seen acting in a way that suggested an imminent attack, officers said. It comes amid a continuing probe into death threats, local media quoted police as saying. Authorities briefly closed off transport links to and from Denmark's largest island Zealand in their search. Chief Police Inspector Jorgen Bergen Skov told reporters that police had been responding to a ""worst-case scenario"". ""The Volvo was located nearby, and its behaviour close to the people under threat... indicated that an attack was about to happen,"" he said. Police now say thatthe people in the Volvo are linked to criminal activity,externalbut are not connected to the specific death threats being investigated, Politiken newspaper reported. Two separate investigations were now under way as a result, Chief Inspector Skov said, adding that there was no threat to the general public. The black Volvo had been rented in the Swedish capital Stockholm and was subsequently reported stolen from the airport in Malmo, which lies in Sweden across the Oresund Strait from the Danish capital Copenhagen. Denmark's Justice Minister Soren Poulsen has thanked the police for the way they conducted Friday's search, Politiken reported.

Tory MP Heidi Allen backs new Brexit vote,"Demonstrators called for a vote on the final outcome of the government's Brexit negotiations during the March for the Many protest in Liverpool on 23 September A Conservative MP says she sees no alternative other than backing another referendum on leaving the EU. Heidi Allen becomes the latest Tory to support a new vote, saying the ""right-wing"" of her party had made Theresa May's Chequers Brexit plan - ""dead"". ""They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,"" she told the BBC. The prime minister has ruled out a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. Mrs May's Chequers plan - which would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in trade in goods - has been heavily criticised by Tory Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson. Ms Allen - who campaigned to Remain in the EU in 2016 - told Radio 4's Today programme that while she would still support in principle an ""11th hour"" deal from Mrs May and the EU, ""too many"" of her party - especially those on the right - would not. Attacks on May 'unacceptable' - Major Conservative Party Conference: Brexit and Boris Johnson The truth about young people and Brexit Toyota UK warns hard Brexit could halt work The South Cambridgeshire MP said she had been left with ""no alternative other than asking - should we come to that, no deal, that looks like that's what's going to happen - then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next."" On what a further referendum could look like, Ms Allen suggested that it should include the option of staying in the EU under existing terms. By Jessica Parker, political correspondent Heidi Allen joins a handful of Tory backbenchers who've openly said a so-called people's vote may now be needed. And as someone who supported Remain, her comments may come as no surprise. But, perhaps more significantly, she is the latest person to suggest that Theresa May's Chequers plan is dead. The blueprint, for our future relationship with the EU, has never been liked by the Leave supporting contingent. But people like Heidi Allen had previously said that they would at least give Chequers a chance. No more. It comes as Labour - not to mention the EU - has also declared that the proposals are unworkable in their current form. And while Number 10 is sticking to its guns, there must be a big question as to how long this situation can be sustained. The People's Vote campaign group wants to give the public the final say over whether the UK leaves the EU, arguing that voters should be given a choice  between leaving with or without a deal or staying on current terms. Anna Soubry, Justine Greening and Sarah Wollaston are among the Conservative MPs who have supported a further referendum. Ms Allen's comments come after ex-PMSir John Major also made the case for another Brexit voteand highlighted the ""completely unacceptable"" attacks by certain Tory MPs on Mrs May. Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson set out his ""better Brexit plan"" andrefused to rule out a leadership challenge. Last weekLabour members votedto keep the option of another referendum on the table if parliament is deadlocked over the final outcome the government's Brexit negotiations. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations on the terms of exit and future co-operation are continuing.

Are warnings effective?,"MyShake: An app which allows users' phones to act as seismometers Earthquake early warning detection is more effective for minor quakes than major ones. This is according toa new study,externalfrom the United States Geological Survey. Seismologists modelled ground shaking along California's San Andreas Fault, where an earthquake of magnitude 6.5 or more is expected within 30 years. They found that warning time could be increased for residents if they were willing to tolerate a number of ""false alarms"" for smaller events. This would mean issuing alerts early in an earthquake's lifespan, before its full magnitude is determined. Those living far from the epicentre would occasionally receive warnings for ground shaking they could not feel. ""We can get [greater] warning times for weak ground motion levels, but we can't get long warning times for strong shaking,"" Sarah Minson, lead author of the study, told BBC News. ""Alternatively, we could warn you every time there was an earthquake that might produce weak ground shaking at your location... A lot of baby earthquakes don't grow up to become big earthquakes,"" she added. 'Phone seismometers' prove their worth Gravity signals show true size of giant earthquakes History of deadly earthquakes California: Earthquake drills have been run in anticipation of ""the big one"" Earthquake early warning systems have been in place in Mexico and Japan for years. Now, a system called ShakeAlert is being developed for the west coast of North America. So how can it predict the unpredictable? In short, it can't. ""It's a misnomer... because it's not earthquake early warning, the earthquake has already happened... It's ground motion early warning,"" said Dr Minson. Earthquakes occur along tectonic plate boundaries and faults in the Earth's crust - long fractures where friction has built up over time. Dr Lucy Jones, a seismologist who was not involved in the study, explained: ""The whole fault doesn't move at once. It starts at an epicentre and the rupture moves down the fault like how you would rip a piece of paper."" This release of energy moves in two parts. Seismic activity is closely monitored around the world Primary waves (p-waves) accordion out first and fastest. They are followed by slower secondary, or s-waves, which cause the ground to ripple up and down - the shaking that people experience during a quake. The physics of earthquakes is one of the reasons why a single, universal warning system hasn't been rolled out across all quake prone countries. California and Japan have populations living directly alongside fault lines, and cannot waste precious seconds before warning their citizens. In both countries, the p-waves and some very rapid algorithms determine the potential magnitude and dispatch an alert. But in Mexico, the capital city is about 300km from the nearest tectonic plate boundary. This allows geologists to use a system that can take some more time to issue a warning. They wait to detect the s-waves. Sirens blare in the streets of Mexico City whenever ground shaking above M5 is detected. However, the country's usually robust SASMEX early warning system didn't have sufficient time to respond to last September's second earthquake. Mexico City: extensive damage was caused by two earthquakes in September 2017 The system can usually provide up to a minute's warning but the M7.1 earthquake originated much nearer the city than usual. The ground began to shake almost immediately after the alarm was triggered. A new algorithm was being tested for the SASMEX system at the time, which could, in the future, issue a warning 8-10 seconds earlier. Similarly, Japanese seismologists have looked to improve their early warning system after the devastating 2011 M9 earthquake. Japan 2011: Early warning systems gave residents a brief evacuation window Dr Mitsuyuki Hoshiba, who has developed the new PLUM algorithm launched this week, explained. ""In PLUM method: strength of shaking is predicted directly from observed shaking, skipping the process of estimation of epicentre and magnitude."" This will, Dr Hoshiba says, reduce the problem of missed alarms for future earthquakes. Back in California, work continues on ShakeAlert. It is due to have a limited public rollout later this year, supported by federal funding which was approved on Friday 23 March. The system will use both ground-based seismometers and satellite observations to provide the maximum warning time to populations on the west coast. The work done by Dr Minson and her colleagues shows that for San Francisco this may be about 50 seconds for minor shaking, or as little as eight seconds for a major earthquake. If the system is to be as sensitive as possible, false alerts may also become a necessary part of life for Californians in the future. San Francisco is expected to experience a M6.5 earthquake within the next 30 years Dr Cochran, who spent time in Mexico following the 2017 earthquakes, noted that ""people wanted as much information as they could get, and they were not particularly bothered as long as they heard there was an earthquake associated with that alert."" Dr Jones agrees: ""I do not believe that is a great shortcoming of early warning systems as long as it is understood... we need to invest in appropriate education for the general public about early warning for the information to be most effectively used.""

Hundreds dead in Indonesia quake and tsunami,"This video can not be played Dramatic video shows buildings being knocked down More than 380 people have been confirmed dead after a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit an Indonesian city on Friday. Waves up to 3m (10ft) high swept through Palu on Sulawesi island. Video on social media shows people screaming and fleeing in panic and a mosque among the buildings damaged. Strong aftershocks rocked the city on Saturday. Thousands of homes have collapsed, along with hospitals, hotels and a shopping centre. Rescue efforts are under way, though hampered by a major power cut. The main road to Palu has been blocked due to a landslide, and a key bridge is out of action. Indonesia's disaster agency said at least 384 people had been killed, but the number is expected to rise. At least 540 have been injured, and 29 are listed as missing. Locals check bodybags in the streets of Palu as they search for lost relatives ""Many bodies were found along the shoreline because of the tsunami, but the numbers are still unknown,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told Reuters. ""When the threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,"" he told a news briefing. ""The tsunami didn't come by itself - it dragged cars, logs, houses - it hit everything on land."" In pictures: Indonesia earthquake and tsunami Some survived by climbing 6m (18ft) trees to escape the huge waves, the spokesman said. Homes, hotels, and shopping centres have collapsed in the ""extensive"" damage, officials said A less powerful quake earlier on Friday had killed at least one person and injured at least 10 in the smaller fishing town of Donggala. In Palu, hundreds of people had been preparing for a beach festival that was due to start on Friday night. The city's main hospital was damaged in the quake, and TV footage showed dozens of injured people being treated outside in makeshift medical tents. Medical teams are treating patients in the open air At least 384 people have been killed in the quake Palu and Donggala are home to more than 600,000 people. President Joko Widodo said troops were en route to the area to reinforce rescue teams and help retrieve bodies. The main airport in Palu has been closed since the tsunami hit. A minister said the runway had been damaged but that it was hoped helicopters would still be able to land. The country's military is sending cargo planes of relief aid from the capital, Jakarta. Officials are urging locals not to enter their homes and to sleep away from buildings, due to the risk of aftershocks. Relief aid is packed into a military plane bound for Palu Indonesia's disaster agency said some people scaled trees to escape the huge waves The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just before 18:00 on Friday (10:00 GMT), the US Geological Survey said. A tsunami warning was issued, but lifted within the hour. Indonesia's meteorological agency has been criticised for its response, but officials said the waves struck while the warning was in place. Are earthquake warnings effective? Dramatic video of the tsunami hitting Palu shows the high waves sweeping away several buildings and then the large tilted mosque in the town, about 80km from the quake's epicentre. ""The situation is chaotic, people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore,"" said Dwikorita Karnawati, head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency. A 2004 tsunami triggered by an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra killed 226,000 across the Indian Ocean, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

"'Don't bother' Benny the Beluga, fans urged","The whale has been seen ""swimming strongly"" Benny the beluga is spending his fifth day in the Thames but appears to be healthy and swimming normally, the Port of London Authority (PLA) has said. The latest sighting of Benny came just after midday, with reports it had stayed in a one-mile stretch of river. Whale-spotters are being urged to keep to the riverbank near Gravesend and not venture on to the water in boats. The PLA said no-one had attempted to take a boat near Benny, but it was a situation they hoped to avoid. A spokesman said: ""The first confirmed sighting was just after 12:00 BST. ""To the best of our knowledge, the whale is healthy and swimming, although obviously this is an unusual situation."" As whale-watchers gathered on the banks of the Thames, people took to social media to give the beluga its nickname. It breeched near a buoy on the River Thames The PLA spokesman said: ""The biggest obvious hazard is people wanting to come in small boats to have a look, so we have asked people not do that to the whale and to watch safely without bothering it from the shore."" No-one had yet tried to take a small boat on to the river, he added, however that was what happened in 2006 whena bottle-nosed whale became stranded,externalin the Thames. It later died. The estuary where the whale is feeding is a busy shipping channel Benny was first spotted in the Thames estuary on Tuesday, ""swimming strongly and feeding normally"" near barges. On Thursday, it was sighted slightly further upstream. Experts said the whale appeared to be a sub adult - an older juvenile but not a fully-formed adult. Benny has been seen feeding around barges near Gravesend According to the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR), Benny has been foraging, surfacing and diving - behaviour consistent with a healthy animal. River users and shipping companies have been urged to steer clear of the whale, which is thousands of miles away from its Arctic habitat. Benny has been foraging in the river Beluga whales can grow up to 20ft in length and are usually at home in the icy waters around Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea. Rescue teams have been on standby in case the animal gets into danger.

No-deal Brexit 'would disrupt Toyota plant',"This video can not be played Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota's Burnaston plant near Derby Toyota UK has told the BBC a no-deal Brexit would temporarily halt output at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby. The Japanese carmaker is one of the biggest in the UK and Burnaston produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% for export to the European Union. Business Secretary Greg Clark told the BBC ""we need to have a deal"". To see Britain's place as a world leader in automotive technology ""slip through our fingers"" would be something ""we would regret forever"", he added. Toyota says it cannot predict how long a stoppage would last, but unions fear that if long-term damage is inflicted it could result in job losses. Its ""just-in-time"" production relies on components imported from the EU. Brexit: All you need to know Honda: No-deal Brexit 'would cost millions' What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? The Burnaston plant produces the Auris and the Avensis. Toyota is investing Â£250m there to enable the production of the new Corolla from the end of this year. It is taking on 400 new staff, in addition to the 2,500 currently employed there. ""My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory,"" said Marvin Cooke, managing director at Burnaston. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clark said the consequences of a no-deal Brexit were ""concerning"". ""The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains,"" he said. ""We need to have a deal... we want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity."" Stopping a production line is expensive - the plant produces cars worth about Â£12m every day. The plant is finely tuned, with components arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU. Lorries that supply the plant contain a collection of different components, not a single job lot of brake parts, for instance. That's because every car is, in effect, built to order. Customers, including dealers, will select the body style, the engine type and size, the colour, the options, making hundreds of variables. Toyota has been making cars in Burnaston for more than 25 years Other manufacturers have said they are making contingency plans. Last week, Honda told the Reuters agency it was identifying components it might stockpile. Earlier this month, the boss of Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's biggest carmaker, said if the ""wrong decisions"" were taken it could result in the ""worst of times"" for the UK and cost the company more than Â£1.2bn a year. BMW said it was looking for car parking space on either side of the Channel, and has also saidit will close its Mini plant for a month following Brexit. Toyota told the BBC it was looking at different scenarios, but that it would be impossible for the company to hold more than a day's worth of inventory, and stopping production was inevitable. The firm employs 2,500 people at the Burnaston plant Over time, Mr Cooke said he was concerned it might affect the plant's future, despite the recent investment. Burnaston is one of nine Toyota manufacturing sites in the EU. Every time there is a new project, the different locations compete for the work. Mr Cooke said: ""In the longer term the burden of import and export costs would add permanent costs to our business, it would reduce our competitiveness. Sadly that would reduce the number of cars made in the UK and that would cost jobs."" Peter Tsouvallaris, the Unite union convenor at the plant, has been working there for 24 years, and says his members are increasingly concerned: ""What we have here are high-value, well-paid jobs. ""And in my experience once these jobs go they never come back. And that's why we have to do everything possible to keep these jobs in the area."" Started production December 1992 Employs 2,564 (inc 322 agency) Produces Auris and Avensis - including pressing body panels, welding and assembly Site is 580 acres - 2.35 million square metres Total vehicles produced: 144,077, of which Avensis: 25,057, Auris: 34,899 and Auris Hybrid: 84,121 A spokesperson for the UK government said: ""We are determined to ensure that the UK continues to be one of the most competitive locations in the world for automotive and other advanced manufacturing. ""We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU. As part of this we have proposed a UK-EU free trade area underpinned by a common rulebook on manufactured goods, such as automotives."" Toyota UK warns hard Brexit could halt work.

Tory conference app reveals MPs' numbersA security breach with the Tory Party conference app reveals contact details for MPs and journalists.UK Politics,"The Tory party's app for the conference was readily available to download on the Apple app store Conservative MPs including Boris Johnson have had their phone numbers and other personal details revealed by the party's conference app. A Guardian columnist highlighted the security breach on Twitter and the BBC was also able to access private details of people attending the event. The Conservative Party apologised for ""any concern caused"" and said ""the technical issue has been resolved"". The Information Commissioner's Office said it would be making inquiries. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the technical glitch was ""deeply, deeply embarrassing"" for the party. The Guardian's Dawn Foster, who is attending the conference, tweeted about the security breach and said she had been able to access the former foreign secretary's personal details, including his mobile phone number. She shared a redacted picture of Mr Johnson's profile, which did not reveal his phone number. It appears that people could access an MP's personal details by entering their email address, without a password, when pressing the attendee's button in the app. This button has since been removed on the app, which was created by Australian firm Crowd Comms. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the app was ""now functioning securely"" and the party would be ""investigating the issue further"". On Thursday theEvening Standard reported Mr Lewis,externalwas set to ""unveil the first 'interactive' conference app"" on Sunday in a bid to overhaul the Conservatives image, and appealing to the younger voter.

Prime Minister Theresa May, who was arriving at the conference in Birmingham, ignored questions from reporters about the security blunder. The Press Association said the details of Environment Secretary Michael Gove had also been shared online. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent, in Birmingham On the very day Business Secretary Greg Clarkexpressed concern about Facebook's security breach, the Conservative Party has had to say sorry for its own. This conference hasn't even started yet, but officials are already rattled. One Conservative source described it to me in very colourful, unbroadcastable terms, in a text message he sent me by accident. Was this a breach of national security? No. Was it an unforced error the party could do without, and a bumpy start to what was already likely to be a bumpy conference? Yes. And this may well not be the end of it, with the Information Commissioner's Office now involved. Pictures on Twitter show people apparently changing individuals' profile pictures and leaving messages on the app's internal messaging system. One Twitter user posted a snapshot of Mr Gove's profile picture, which had been changed to a snap of media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Mr Gove previously worked as a journalist at The Times, one of Mr Murdoch's papers. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it would be making inquiries about the breach and added that ""organisations have a legal duty to keep personal data safe and secure"". The ICO's statement added under the EU's new GDPR regulation, the Conservative Party has 72 hours to notify the regulator of a personal data breach that ""could pose a risk to people's rights and freedoms"". One of Labour's shadow cabinet, Jon Trickett, criticised the Conservatives for the breach and said: ""How can we trust this Tory government with our country's security when they can't even build a conference app that keeps the data of their members, MPs and others attending safe?"" Labour's grassroots campaign group Momentum said their party's app had been developed by a team of volunteers, adding: ""I'm sure they'd be happy to give the Tories a few tips next year."" The Conservative Party conference is being held in Birmingham and is due to start on Sunday.

PC and two men attacked by dogs,"The three men were bitten by the dogs in the early hours of Saturday morning Three men including a police officer have suffered serious injuries after they were attacked by two dogs. A 59-year-old man and a 79-year-old man were found injured in Garth Walk, Moortown, Leeds, at about 04:40 BST. The younger man received potentially life-changing injuries, police said. A male officer was bitten during attempts to catch one of the dogs in a garden. Two people, thought to be the owners of the dogs, have been arrested in connection with the incident. Garth Walk, in the Moortown area of Leeds, was closed for police to gather evidence Two members of the public heard dogs barking in the back garden of a house on the road, with the pets believed to have got out from a separate property. The 79-year-old man went to check on the noise and suffered serious bite injuries to one of his arms, officers said. It is thought the dogs then left the garden and bit the younger man as he approached the house. Latest news and stories from West Yorkshire All three men were taken to hospital for treatment, with the dogs seized. West Yorkshire Police said it was too early to comment on the breed of dogs involved, with inquiries continuing. Det Insp Richard Holmes said: ""We appreciate there will be understandable concern in the community following this incident. ""We will have extra police patrols in the area to offer reassurance and I would urge anyone who has any concerns to speak with officers.""

Small boat alert as whale swims on,"The whale has been seen ""swimming strongly"" Benny the beluga is spending his fifth day in the Thames but appears to be healthy and swimming normally, the Port of London Authority (PLA) has said. The latest sighting of Benny came just after midday, with reports it had stayed in a one-mile stretch of river. Whale-spotters are being urged to keep to the riverbank near Gravesend and not venture on to the water in boats. The PLA said no-one had attempted to take a boat near Benny, but it was a situation they hoped to avoid. A spokesman said: ""The first confirmed sighting was just after 12:00 BST. ""To the best of our knowledge, the whale is healthy and swimming, although obviously this is an unusual situation."" As whale-watchers gathered on the banks of the Thames, people took to social media to give the beluga its nickname. It breeched near a buoy on the River Thames The PLA spokesman said: ""The biggest obvious hazard is people wanting to come in small boats to have a look, so we have asked people not do that to the whale and to watch safely without bothering it from the shore."" No-one had yet tried to take a small boat on to the river, he added, however that was what happened in 2006 whena bottle-nosed whale became stranded,externalin the Thames. It later died. The estuary where the whale is feeding is a busy shipping channel Benny was first spotted in the Thames estuary on Tuesday, ""swimming strongly and feeding normally"" near barges. On Thursday, it was sighted slightly further upstream. Experts said the whale appeared to be a sub adult - an older juvenile but not a fully-formed adult. Benny has been seen feeding around barges near Gravesend According to the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR), Benny has been foraging, surfacing and diving - behaviour consistent with a healthy animal. River users and shipping companies have been urged to steer clear of the whale, which is thousands of miles away from its Arctic habitat. Benny has been foraging in the river Beluga whales can grow up to 20ft in length and are usually at home in the icy waters around Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea. Rescue teams have been on standby in case the animal gets into danger.

'Use some EpiPens past expiry date',"People with severe allergies have been told they can use their EpiPens past their normal expiry date, amid a continuing shortage of the devices. The medicines regulator said it had agreed to extend the use-by date of some 0.3mg EpiPens by four months. It comes as parents told the BBC their children's supplies were due to expire in a few days, and they had been unable to get replacements. The government says it is working with EpiPen's makers to resolve the issue. EpiPens are the most common adrenaline auto-injectors (AAIs) and are prescribed to people with potentially serious allergies, such as to nuts, milk, fish, shellfish, eggs and some fruits. People are recommended to keep two of the devices with them at all times for cases of anaphylaxis - a severe and sometimes life-threatening reaction often caused by allergies - as one is not always enough. They can only be used once and usually have an expiry date that lasts for a minimum of 12 months. There have been shortages of EpiPens in the UK and other countries for months. There has also been a shortage of the alternative AAIs prescribed in the UK - Jext and Emerade - amid a surge in demand for them. In response to the shortages, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it had agreed to a request by Mylan, the company behind EpiPen, to extend the expiry date of some batches of the 0.3mg version of the device. The MHRA said it made the decision after it was given evidence that showed the shelf life of the 0.3mg pen was 20 months from the date it was manufactured. It said the devices would work ""just as effectively"" during the extended expiry period. Click here to see which batches have been extended,external But the extension does not apply to the 0.15mg version, given to children under 30kg. EpiPens should not be used if the solution is discoloured, brown, there are solid particles, or signs of leakage or damage. Other AAIs should never be used after their expiry date without first checking with your medical practitioner. Lynne Riles said she had been trying to get an EpiPen prescription for her seven-year-old daughter for the past six weeks. ""The pens we have now expire at the end of September, and I just feel at my wits' end."" Sal Smith said her four-year-old's EpiPens were also due to expire at the end of the month, after she had tried for four weeks to get more. ""Still no sign of them... I'm getting worried now."" Nuts, shellfish and eggs are among the foods that can trigger allergies food - such as peanuts, milk/dairy foods, egg, wheat, fish and seafood, sesame and soya insect stings - from bees and wasps medication - such as antibiotics and ibuprofen latex - rubber gloves, balloons, swimming caps Q&A: What is anaphylaxis? Mylan has no stock of the 0.15mg pens left, the Department of Health and Social Care said inguidance to healthcare professionals,external. More of these pens are due in October but this is not expected to meet normal demand, the department said. Emma Cummings, whose 10-year-old son Loui has severe allergies, said if supply problems continued and she had no AAIs left that were in date, she would be forced to keep her son indoors, as he is at risk from airborne allergens. ""Loui wouldn't be allowed out of the four walls of our own house, where I can categorically state that there is nothing in the house to trigger any allergies for him. ""That will restrict his education, his after-school activities, but you would. ""Parents such as ourselves, with a child like Loui, would have no choice."" The DHSC guidance said that if people were left with nothing but expired AAIs they should keep them - until they get replacements - and be prepared to use them. While AAIs lose their potency and become less effective after their expiry date, they are not harmful, and it is better to use an expired AAI than none at all, it said. It said at present it was believed that ""careful management"" of existing supplies would prevent the need for using expired pens. Health minister Lord O'Shaughnessy told the BBC: ""We are doing everything we can to ensure patients continue to access the medications they need, and we have issued detailed guidance to healthcare professionals."" Mylan,externalsaid Pfizer (which manufactures the drug) was ""working hard"" to increase production, and supply would stabilise between October and December this year.

Jefferson Airplane's Marty Balin dies,"Marty Balin was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 Marty Balin - the co-founder and vocalist-guitarist of the psychedelic rock band Jefferson Airplane - has died aged 76, his family and publicist say. They did not specify the cause of death of the US musician. Balin, real name Martyn Jerel Buchwal, found fame with the group in the 1960s with hits such as White Rabbit. He left the San Francisco-based band in 1970 - but later got back together with some of its members under the name Jefferson Starship. He was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Marty Balin co-founded Jefferson Airplane in 1965 In Friday's statement, Marty Balin's family said: ""Marty's fans describe him as having had a substantial impact for the better of the world: 'One of the greatest voices of all time, a writer of songs that will never fade, and founder of the quintessential San Francisco band of the sixties.' ""His music is known for being the soundtrack to all of life's monumental moments."" Jefferson Airplane formed in 1965 when folk artist Balin decided to create a rock group in response to the Beatles-led British Invasion. The band quickly attracted a local following - and when fledgling promoter Bill Graham opened his legendary Fillmore Auditorium, Jefferson Airplane served as the first headliner. Signed to RCA Records for the then-princely sum of $25,000, the band scored five gold albums in the US, including 1967's Surrealistic Pillow and 1968's Crown of Creation in their first run of success. The band advocated sex, psychedelic drugs, rebellion and a communal lifestyle. Paul Kantner, another co-founder of Jefferson Airplane, died in 2016.

Trump's top court pick faces FBI probe,"Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford both gave evidence on Thursday President Donald Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against his nominee for the US Supreme Court. A Senate committee earlier voted to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the top US court. But a Republican member only backed the move on the understanding that such an inquiry would occur. As a result, a full Senate vote on Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation has been delayed for up to a week. Judge Kavanaugh, an appeal court judge, denies allegations from at least three women. What will the FBI inquiry actually do? Who is Brett Kavanaugh? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Kavanaugh deploys Trump and Clinton playbook On Thursday, the committee heard testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, a professor of psychology in California, who says Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers in the 1980s. Judge Kavanaugh also testified, angrily rejecting the allegation he had ever assaulted her or anyone else. He accused Democrats of politicising the process and harming his family and good name. Despite ordering the FBI investigation, President Trump has continued to defend Judge Kavanaugh. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Announcing the move on Friday, President Trump said: ""I've ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file. As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week."" The inquiry will involve the FBI reopening its previously completed background check on Judge Kavanaugh. This might mean going back to old witnesses - or speaking to new ones. Friday saw Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee throw out Democrat attempts to subpoena Mark Judge, a friend of Judge Kavanaugh who Dr Ford said had witnessed the assault on her 36 years ago. This video can not be played Trump: 'Ford's testimony was very compelling' Mr Judge had told the committee in a written statement that he did not recall any such incident. Mr Judge's lawyer Barbara Van Gelder said: ""If the FBI or any law enforcement agency requests Mr Judge's co-operation, he will answer any and all questions posed to him."" Responding to President Trump's statement, Judge Kavanaugh said ""I've done everything they have requested and will continue to co-operate"". Dr Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, said her client welcomed the step but questioned the time limit of a week. ""A thorough FBI investigation is critical to developing all the relevant facts... No artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation."" Friday saw the Senate Judiciary Committee split along party lines in a vote on passing the nomination to the full Senate. Democrats accused the 11 Republicans of attempting to rush the process, while Republicans countered that the 10 Democrats were using the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh in an attempt to delay - and ultimately block - the conservative judge from joining the Supreme Court.

Tory MP Heidi Allen backs new Brexit voteThe Cambridgeshire MP is the latest Tory MP to support another referendum in the event of a no-deal Brexit.UK Politics,"Demonstrators called for a vote on the final outcome of the government's Brexit negotiations during the March for the Many protest in Liverpool on 23 September A Conservative MP says she sees no alternative other than backing another referendum on leaving the EU. Heidi Allen becomes the latest Tory to support a new vote, saying the ""right-wing"" of her party had made Theresa May's Chequers Brexit plan - ""dead"". ""They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,"" she told the BBC. The prime minister has ruled out a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. Mrs May's Chequers plan - which would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in trade in goods - has been heavily criticised by Tory Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson. Ms Allen - who campaigned to Remain in the EU in 2016 - told Radio 4's Today programme that while she would still support in principle an ""11th hour"" deal from Mrs May and the EU, ""too many"" of her party - especially those on the right - would not. Attacks on May 'unacceptable' - Major Conservative Party Conference: Brexit and Boris Johnson The truth about young people and Brexit Toyota UK warns hard Brexit could halt work The South Cambridgeshire MP said she had been left with ""no alternative other than asking - should we come to that, no deal, that looks like that's what's going to happen - then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next."" On what a further referendum could look like, Ms Allen suggested that it should include the option of staying in the EU under existing terms. By Jessica Parker, political correspondent Heidi Allen joins a handful of Tory backbenchers who've openly said a so-called people's vote may now be needed. And as someone who supported Remain, her comments may come as no surprise. But, perhaps more significantly, she is the latest person to suggest that Theresa May's Chequers plan is dead. The blueprint, for our future relationship with the EU, has never been liked by the Leave supporting contingent. But people like Heidi Allen had previously said that they would at least give Chequers a chance. No more. It comes as Labour - not to mention the EU - has also declared that the proposals are unworkable in their current form. And while Number 10 is sticking to its guns, there must be a big question as to how long this situation can be sustained. The People's Vote campaign group wants to give the public the final say over whether the UK leaves the EU, arguing that voters should be given a choice  between leaving with or without a deal or staying on current terms. Anna Soubry, Justine Greening and Sarah Wollaston are among the Conservative MPs who have supported a further referendum. Ms Allen's comments come after ex-PMSir John Major also made the case for another Brexit voteand highlighted the ""completely unacceptable"" attacks by certain Tory MPs on Mrs May. Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson set out his ""better Brexit plan"" andrefused to rule out a leadership challenge. Last weekLabour members votedto keep the option of another referendum on the table if parliament is deadlocked over the final outcome the government's Brexit negotiations. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations on the terms of exit and future co-operation are continuing.

F-35 fighter jet suffers first crash,"A US F-35B carried out its first combat operation in Afghanistan on Thursday The US military has suffered the first crash in its hugely expensive F-35 fighter jet programme. A F-35B jet came down in South Carolina, the Marine Corps said. The pilot managed to safely eject and there were no injuries. The Marines said in a statement that an investigation into the cause of the crash is underway. The F-35 is the largest and most expensive weapons programme of its type in the world. Global sales are projected at more that 3,000 aircraft, and the programme is likely to last for some 30 to 40 years. But the programme has been criticised both for cost and combat effectiveness. The jet involved in the incident is believed to have cost around $100m (Â£77m), although a new Pentagon contract announced on Friday for a record 141 F-35 jets has brought the cost down to around $89.2m per aircraft, according to Reuters. The model is one of three varieties of the F-35 series in operation. On Thursday, the US carried out its first operation using the F-35B against Taliban targets in Afghanistan, four months afterthe Israeli military announced it had used the F-35A to carry out two separate strikes. US President Trump has repeatedly praised the F-35, saying that the enemy ""cannot see"" it. While the jet is not invisible, its primary contractor Lockheed Martin has said its ""advanced stealth"" enables it to avoid radar. The fighter, first flown in 2006, was developed by Lockheed Martin as a versatile aircraft that could be used by the US Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy It has three variants: conventional takeoff and landing (A); short takeoff and vertical landing (B) and carrier-based catapult (C) Stealth is clearly a key factor, its airframe and design materials allow pilots to penetrate areas without being detected by radar This gives it a small radar cross-section, which is said to allow it to engage enemy aircraft before they see it. A helmet-mounted display system means the jet does not have to be pointing at its target to fire weapons But it's the sensors, communications and avionics that it trumpets the most - data is shared immediately with operational commanders, and pilots can track the enemy, jam radars and thwart attacks Four RAF F-35 fighter jets land in UK World's most advanced jet in first combat New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

No-deal Brexit 'would disrupt Toyota plant'Toyota UK tells the BBC a no-deal Brexit would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.,"This video can not be played Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota's Burnaston plant near Derby Toyota UK has told the BBC a no-deal Brexit would temporarily halt output at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby. The Japanese carmaker is one of the biggest in the UK and Burnaston produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% for export to the European Union. Business Secretary Greg Clark told the BBC ""we need to have a deal"". To see Britain's place as a world leader in automotive technology ""slip through our fingers"" would be something ""we would regret forever"", he added. Toyota says it cannot predict how long a stoppage would last, but unions fear that if long-term damage is inflicted it could result in job losses. Its ""just-in-time"" production relies on components imported from the EU. Brexit: All you need to know Honda: No-deal Brexit 'would cost millions' What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? The Burnaston plant produces the Auris and the Avensis. Toyota is investing Â£250m there to enable the production of the new Corolla from the end of this year. It is taking on 400 new staff, in addition to the 2,500 currently employed there. ""My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory,"" said Marvin Cooke, managing director at Burnaston. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clark said the consequences of a no-deal Brexit were ""concerning"". ""The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains,"" he said. ""We need to have a deal... we want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity."" Stopping a production line is expensive - the plant produces cars worth about Â£12m every day. The plant is finely tuned, with components arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU. Lorries that supply the plant contain a collection of different components, not a single job lot of brake parts, for instance. That's because every car is, in effect, built to order. Customers, including dealers, will select the body style, the engine type and size, the colour, the options, making hundreds of variables. Toyota has been making cars in Burnaston for more than 25 years Other manufacturers have said they are making contingency plans. Last week, Honda told the Reuters agency it was identifying components it might stockpile. Earlier this month, the boss of Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's biggest carmaker, said if the ""wrong decisions"" were taken it could result in the ""worst of times"" for the UK and cost the company more than Â£1.2bn a year. BMW said it was looking for car parking space on either side of the Channel, and has also saidit will close its Mini plant for a month following Brexit. Toyota told the BBC it was looking at different scenarios, but that it would be impossible for the company to hold more than a day's worth of inventory, and stopping production was inevitable. The firm employs 2,500 people at the Burnaston plant Over time, Mr Cooke said he was concerned it might affect the plant's future, despite the recent investment. Burnaston is one of nine Toyota manufacturing sites in the EU. Every time there is a new project, the different locations compete for the work. Mr Cooke said: ""In the longer term the burden of import and export costs would add permanent costs to our business, it would reduce our competitiveness. Sadly that would reduce the number of cars made in the UK and that would cost jobs."" Peter Tsouvallaris, the Unite union convenor at the plant, has been working there for 24 years, and says his members are increasingly concerned: ""What we have here are high-value, well-paid jobs. ""And in my experience once these jobs go they never come back. And that's why we have to do everything possible to keep these jobs in the area."" Started production December 1992 Employs 2,564 (inc 322 agency) Produces Auris and Avensis - including pressing body panels, welding and assembly Site is 580 acres - 2.35 million square metres Total vehicles produced: 144,077, of which Avensis: 25,057, Auris: 34,899 and Auris Hybrid: 84,121 A spokesperson for the UK government said: ""We are determined to ensure that the UK continues to be one of the most competitive locations in the world for automotive and other advanced manufacturing. ""We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU. As part of this we have proposed a UK-EU free trade area underpinned by a common rulebook on manufactured goods, such as automotives."" Toyota UK warns hard Brexit could halt work.

Trump's top court pick faces FBI probeBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote must wait as the FBI investigates alleged sexual misconduct.US & Canada,"Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford both gave evidence on Thursday President Donald Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against his nominee for the US Supreme Court. A Senate committee earlier voted to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the top US court. But a Republican member only backed the move on the understanding that such an inquiry would occur. As a result, a full Senate vote on Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation has been delayed for up to a week. Judge Kavanaugh, an appeal court judge, denies allegations from at least three women. What will the FBI inquiry actually do? Who is Brett Kavanaugh? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Kavanaugh deploys Trump and Clinton playbook On Thursday, the committee heard testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, a professor of psychology in California, who says Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers in the 1980s. Judge Kavanaugh also testified, angrily rejecting the allegation he had ever assaulted her or anyone else. He accused Democrats of politicising the process and harming his family and good name. Despite ordering the FBI investigation, President Trump has continued to defend Judge Kavanaugh. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Announcing the move on Friday, President Trump said: ""I've ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file. As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week."" The inquiry will involve the FBI reopening its previously completed background check on Judge Kavanaugh. This might mean going back to old witnesses - or speaking to new ones. Friday saw Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee throw out Democrat attempts to subpoena Mark Judge, a friend of Judge Kavanaugh who Dr Ford said had witnessed the assault on her 36 years ago. This video can not be played Trump: 'Ford's testimony was very compelling' Mr Judge had told the committee in a written statement that he did not recall any such incident. Mr Judge's lawyer Barbara Van Gelder said: ""If the FBI or any law enforcement agency requests Mr Judge's co-operation, he will answer any and all questions posed to him."" Responding to President Trump's statement, Judge Kavanaugh said ""I've done everything they have requested and will continue to co-operate"". Dr Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, said her client welcomed the step but questioned the time limit of a week. ""A thorough FBI investigation is critical to developing all the relevant facts... No artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation."" Friday saw the Senate Judiciary Committee split along party lines in a vote on passing the nomination to the full Senate.

Up to 50m Facebook accounts attacked,"Facebook says almost 50 million of its users were left exposed by a security flaw. The company said attackers were able to exploit a vulnerability in a feature known as âView Asâ to gain control of people's accounts. The breach was discovered on Tuesday, Facebook said, and it has informed police. Users that had potentially been affected were prompted to re-log-in on Friday. Tech Tent: Facebook's family feud Facebook hate speech glitch investigated by firm The flaw has been fixed, wrote the firmâs vice-president of product management, Guy Rosen, adding all affected accounts had been reset, as well as another 40 million ""as a precautionary step"". Facebook - which saw its share price drop more than 3% on Friday - has more than two billion active monthly users. The company has confirmed to reporters that the breach would allow hackers to log in to other accounts that use Facebook's system, of which there are many. This means other major sites, such as AirBnB and Tinder, may also be affected. The firm would not say where in the world the 50 million users are, but it has informed Irish data regulators, where Facebook's European subsidiary is based. The company said the users prompted to log-in again did not have to change their passwords. ""Since weâve only just started our investigation, we have yet to determine whether these accounts were misused or any information accessed. We also donât know whoâs behind these attacks or where theyâre based. â He added: ""Peopleâs privacy and security is incredibly important, and weâre sorry this happened."" The company has confirmed that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and its chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg were among the 50 million accounts affected. Facebook's ""View As"" function is a privacy feature that allows people to see what their own profile looks to other users, making it clear what information is viewable to their friends, friends of friends, or the public. Attackers found multiple bugs in this feature that ""allowed them to steal Facebook access tokens, which they could then use to take over people's accounts"", Mr Rosen explained. ""Access tokens are the equivalent of digital keys that keep people logged in to Facebook so they don't need to re-enter their password every time they use the app,"" he added. The breach comes at a time when the firm is struggling to convince lawmakers in the US and beyond, that it is capable of protecting user data. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call on Friday that the firm took security seriously, in the face of what he said were constant attacks by bad actors. But Jeff Pollard, vice-president and principal analyst at Forrester, said the fact Facebook held so much data meant it should be prepared for such attacks. ""Attackers go where the data is, and that has made Facebook an obvious target,"" he said.  ""The main concern here is that one feature of the platform allowed attackers to harvest the data of tens of millions of users. ""This indicates that Facebook needs to make limiting access to data a priority for users, APIs, and features."" When asked by the BBC, Facebook was unable to say if the investigation would look into why the bugs were missed, or if anyone at the company would be held accountable for the breach.

"'I'm a Muslim, visually-impaired boxer'","This video can not be played Sannah Hussain tells how she ""just fell in love with boxing"" Fit, strong, and with a steely determination behind her eyes, Sannah Hussain has many of the traits you need to be successful in the boxing ring. But she is very different to your average amateur boxer. Sannah is a Scottish Muslim who wears a headscarf and dresses modestly and also lives with a series of debilitating health conditions. The 25-year-old was born with Albinism, a condition which affects the colour of her hair, the pigment in her skin and has caused a serious visual impairment. She also has an autoimmune condition, called Myasthenia Gravis, which causes muscle weakness and fatigue. But the Glasgow-based charity worker is adamant her health conditions will not prevent her from stepping into the ring for her first exhibition fight this weekend. ""I've always been an active person regardless of my vision, regardless of my muscles,"" she told BBC Scotland. ""I've always been a go-getter, I've always wanted to be up and about, doing things."" Sannah has a severe visual impairment and suffers from a muscle condition which causes fatigue Her passion for the sport developed after she set up a class for women from minority groups as part of her job with the Human Appeal charity earlier this year. She wanted to provide safe, friendly, and empowering fitness sessions for women who might normally wear the hijab. The Saturday morning sessions at the Kynoch Boxing gym in Glasgow's Kinning Park have been popular with women uneasy in a ""normal"" Lycra-dominant gym environment. ""We arranged to have the gym closed off to anybody else at that time of day, so the girls could come in, take their hijabs off and feel comfortable with what they're wearing and focus purely on the working out and not feel self-conscious,"" Sannah said. ""It's really helped break that barrier that women can't do this, or women of this community can't do this, because they certainly can. ""Like everything in life, it's just about finding a way around the things that are challenging."" She fell in love with the sport after taking part in a class for black and minority ethnic (BME) women at a Glasgow gym But the project has had an unexpected effect on Sannah herself. ""I didn't realise how much I would fall in love with it,"" she said. ""Even though it makes me tired and sometimes sick of being here, overall I love doing something that makes me feel independent. ""This isn't about being part of a team, it's about what you put into it is what you'll get out of it. ""Although I may never be as successful as other people, I can certainly see an improvement in myself, in my own happiness."" Sannah says she has lost weight, gained confidence and seen her overall fitness improve since setting up the classes in February. It's been a remarkable journey for a woman whose sight is so bad she struggles to catch the right bus or train because she can't see the signs. Her ability to see detail or read small writing is limited and it took her an additional two years to complete her degree. And she takes strong daily medication for a muscle condition which can cause extreme fatigue in her arms and legs, and even slurred speech. But she says her new training regime has given her confidence to push herself further, despite the limitations of her medical conditions. ""Coming in here, you're training so hard sometimes that you really just want to stop,"" she said. ""But the coaches, they're not going to let you stop, they know that there's more in you and there's more that they're going to get out of you and they'll keep pushing you. ""When you overcome that barrier, it makes you realise that there's so much more you can probably do that you didn't realise and you want to discover those things."" Sannah and her sparring partner Sophie Paton are among an increasing number of women who are taking up boxing Now she has signed up to fight at Judgement Night, a boxing event in Glasgow which includes a series of exhibition clashes featuring beginners like Sannah. She has been training hard for the clash against an as-yet unknown opponent and she is determined to give her best performance. But she admitted: ""I am really nervous, I am really scared, but if I let that stuff stop me then I'd never leave the house."" Sannah wants to use the fight to break down barriers to the sport and raise money for children who don't get similar opportunities. The female boxer with cerebral palsy Why more women are getting into boxing Get Inspired: How to get into boxing Organisers SK Promotions are allowing her flexibility in everything from the length of the rounds, to what she wears in the ring. ""If I want to wear leggings and a long-sleeved t-shirt they'll let me do that,"" she said. ""If I'm going to wear my sports hijab, they'll let me do that because they understand from speaking to me how important this is to show to other people there's no limits, there's always a way round something."" The cash she raises by taking part in the fight will help child welfare around the world. ""I'm literally fighting for their right for survival,"" she said. ""If it wasn't for me being in this country, having the healthcare system that we have, having the family that I have, and the opportunities that I have, I wouldn't be who I am today.

As the hit series finishes filming in Northern Ireland after a decade, fans will be given the opportunity to visit sets from the show. Formal tours of Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge, where some of the action is shot, are among the attractions. Each site will also feature displays of costumes, props and weapons. Game of Thrones 'big business' for NI Sets for locations such as Winterfell, Castle Black, and Kings Landing will be opened to the public. It is hoped they will open some time in 2019.

Dozens dead in Indonesia quake and tsunami,"This video can not be played Dramatic video shows buildings being knocked down More than 380 people have been confirmed dead after a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit an Indonesian city on Friday. Waves up to 3m (10ft) high swept through Palu on Sulawesi island. Video on social media shows people screaming and fleeing in panic and a mosque among the buildings damaged. Strong aftershocks rocked the city on Saturday. Thousands of homes have collapsed, along with hospitals, hotels and a shopping centre. Rescue efforts are under way, though hampered by a major power cut. The main road to Palu has been blocked due to a landslide, and a key bridge is out of action. Indonesia's disaster agency said at least 384 people had been killed, but the number is expected to rise. At least 540 have been injured, and 29 are listed as missing. Locals check bodybags in the streets of Palu as they search for lost relatives ""Many bodies were found along the shoreline because of the tsunami, but the numbers are still unknown,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told Reuters. ""When the threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,"" he told a news briefing. ""The tsunami didn't come by itself - it dragged cars, logs, houses - it hit everything on land."" In pictures: Indonesia earthquake and tsunami Some survived by climbing 6m (18ft) trees to escape the huge waves, the spokesman said. Homes, hotels, and shopping centres have collapsed in the ""extensive"" damage, officials said A less powerful quake earlier on Friday had killed at least one person and injured at least 10 in the smaller fishing town of Donggala. In Palu, hundreds of people had been preparing for a beach festival that was due to start on Friday night. The city's main hospital was damaged in the quake, and TV footage showed dozens of injured people being treated outside in makeshift medical tents. Medical teams are treating patients in the open air At least 384 people have been killed in the quake Palu and Donggala are home to more than 600,000 people. President Joko Widodo said troops were en route to the area to reinforce rescue teams and help retrieve bodies. The main airport in Palu has been closed since the tsunami hit. A minister said the runway had been damaged but that it was hoped helicopters would still be able to land. The country's military is sending cargo planes of relief aid from the capital, Jakarta. Officials are urging locals not to enter their homes and to sleep away from buildings, due to the risk of aftershocks. Relief aid is packed into a military plane bound for Palu Indonesia's disaster agency said some people scaled trees to escape the huge waves The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just before 18:00 on Friday (10:00 GMT), the US Geological Survey said. A tsunami warning was issued, but lifted within the hour. Indonesia's meteorological agency has been criticised for its response, but officials said the waves struck while the warning was in place. Are earthquake warnings effective? Dramatic video of the tsunami hitting Palu shows the high waves sweeping away several buildings and then the large tilted mosque in the town, about 80km from the quake's epicentre. ""The situation is chaotic, people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore,"" said Dwikorita Karnawati, head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency.

Defiant Sorrell defends legacy and empire,"This video can not be played Martin Sorrell addresses WPP allegations Sir Martin Sorrell has defended his behaviour while in charge of WPP in an exclusive interview with the BBC. Sir Martin, who built a Â£15bn advertising giant from an old shopping basket company, said his only regret was the way WPP handled his departure. He left amid allegations of bullying subordinates and using company funds to pay for prostitutes. He strenuously denies those charges and points to a company investigation which found no material misconduct. As a result, he was able to leave and remain eligible for continued bonus payments for the next four years. If anyone was expecting an apology from Sir Martin Sorrell, they will be disappointed. After 33 years, one of the very few UK business leaders known around the world left suddenly and dramatically under a cloud of controversy - and a shroud of secrecy. It was a spectacular fall from grace, a classic tale of hubris according to his detractors. The allegations against him were many but his response was defiant. Poor treatment of subordinates? - ""Not true."" Sacking a driver because he wouldn't pick his wife up at 2am? - ""Not true."" Spending Â£274,000 of company money on travel expenses for his wife in a year he was paid Â£70m? - ""True, but it was agreed, and she made an important contribution to the company."" Using company money to pay for prostitutes? - ""Not true. There was an investigation and it turned up nothing."" Sorrell: Triumphant return or expensive tantrum? Martin Sorrell beats WPP in takeover battle WPP chief Sir Martin Sorrell quits advertising agency How about running the company like an emperor when in fact it was a public company of which he owned less than 2%? This is where there is a tacit admission that he didn't behave like your average chief executive - but for understandable reasons, he argued. ""Founding a company is the nearest a man can come to giving birth.  Emotionally rather than physically obviously - but it's your baby."" That is Sorrell's explanation of why he admits he micro-managed WPP - a company with 200,000 employees. ""I asked myself this question - who is really looking out for this company? And the answer is, no one apart from me. And by the way, micro-management is not a fault."" That's not what the head of one of the many companies he owned told me. ""Sir Martin's departure from WPP will be liberating for employees,"" said Steve Allen, head of Mediacom, when Sir Martin left in April. What did he make of that? - ""I was perplexed by that comment,"" Sir Martin replied. Defiant - and not about to go quietly into obscurity. At the age of 73, Sir Martin is having another ""baby"". S4 Capital was founded with Â£40m of his own money and up to Â£150m of other people's. Sir Martin is building a new digital empire with S4 The new empire is already under construction. He bought digital agency Mediamonks from under the noses of his old firm - a move that WPP sources say is a breach of his departure terms, and may result in the company trying to stop Â£19m in payments that Sir Martin is still owed for previous years' service. His new strategy is pretty simple. He quotes legendary investor Warren Buffett - Sorrell is very fond of quoting very rich people, so Buffett and Amazon founder Bezos come up a lot. The advertising world of the last 30 years was built on the growth of US-based multinationals around the world - WPP benefitted hugely from that growth. S4 intends to piggyback on the growth of a few very powerful companies. S4 is a way of earning a royalty on the future of seven companies - Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Alibaba and Tencent, he says. ""The seven sisters,"" he calls them. ""Having a small company like S4 we can respond quickly to the fortunes of these companies."" But why bother? He's got hundreds of millions of pounds, his children are very successful in their own right, and he's 73 - is it revenge? He laughs: ""There may be a bit of that - but what I'm most interested in is building a business to scale. ""Some people found things and move on, others build businesses, very few can do both."" What does this globetrotting dealmaker make of the UK's future post-Brexit? The primary focus after Brexit shouldn't be Europe - it will have to be Asia, South America and the Middle East, he says. We need to think like him. ""Focus on Asia - become like Singapore."" Does that mean low tax, low regulation? ""Exactly,"" says Sir Martin. Sir Martin met with Theresa May and other business leaders at Downing Street in October 2017 There are few industries in the UK which rely as heavily on foreign talent as much as advertising and media. The creative agencies which he once collected are chock-a-block of EU and non-EU migrants. The prospect of Brexit is already proving a turn-off, says Sir Martin. ""There's no doubt that the UK is less attractive to investors and to EU and non-EU staff. It is a real worry and flies in the face of some of the pro-business things Theresa May has been saying."" There is no doubt that Sir Martin Sorrell remains a giant of the advertising world. His drive and deal-making appetite show no sign of fading. But for many in the advertising world, his legacy is one that took creativity out of a creative industry. When he talks about his new ambitions, traditional creative ad agencies don't figure at all. Again, he bats away the criticism. ""There are new forms of creativity in things like data analysis, in digital transformation. People look back at the Don Draper/madmen-era with rose-tinted glasses,"" he says. Some in the industry will think his own view of what he did for the advertising business is rose-tinted as well. I doubt he would care. After all - he's got a new baby to look after. Martin Sorrell addresses WPP allegations.

Attacks on May 'unacceptable' - Major,"Sir John said the attacks were not in the spirit of politics Taunts being made against Theresa May and ""routine attacks"" on her leadership by some Tory MPs are ""completely unacceptable"", Sir John Major has said. The ex-PM called those challenging Mrs May ""inexperienced"", adding that he felt ""even more closely drawn"" to her when he looked at the alternatives. Speaking in South Shields, he also made the case for another Brexit vote. It comes after Boris Johnson set out a ""better Brexit plan"" andrefused to rule out a leadership challenge. The former foreign secretary quit the cabinet in July in protest at Mrs May's plan for future economic co-operation with the EU - known as the Chequers plan - a strategyMr Johnson described on Friday as ""simply intolerable"". It has also been fiercely criticised by some Brexiteers, who say her proposal for a ""common rulebook"" on goods would compromise the UK's sovereignty and betray the 2016 referendum vote.

He did not mention any MP by name, but said: ""When I look at the alternatives to the prime minister I am drawn even more closely to her."" He added that ""the threats that come in her direction of a leadership election unless she delivers a certain sort of Brexit...

He also restated his opposition to Mrs May's Chequers plan, warning it would be ""a political and economic disaster"" for the country.

At least 30 killed in Indonesia earthquake,"This video can not be played Dramatic video shows buildings being knocked down More than 380 people have been confirmed dead after a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit an Indonesian city on Friday. Waves up to 3m (10ft) high swept through Palu on Sulawesi island. Video on social media shows people screaming and fleeing in panic and a mosque among the buildings damaged. Strong aftershocks rocked the city on Saturday. Thousands of homes have collapsed, along with hospitals, hotels and a shopping centre. Rescue efforts are under way, though hampered by a major power cut. The main road to Palu has been blocked due to a landslide, and a key bridge is out of action. Indonesia's disaster agency said at least 384 people had been killed, but the number is expected to rise. At least 540 have been injured, and 29 are listed as missing. Locals check bodybags in the streets of Palu as they search for lost relatives ""Many bodies were found along the shoreline because of the tsunami, but the numbers are still unknown,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told Reuters. ""When the threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,"" he told a news briefing. ""The tsunami didn't come by itself - it dragged cars, logs, houses - it hit everything on land."" In pictures: Indonesia earthquake and tsunami Some survived by climbing 6m (18ft) trees to escape the huge waves, the spokesman said. Homes, hotels, and shopping centres have collapsed in the ""extensive"" damage, officials said A less powerful quake earlier on Friday had killed at least one person and injured at least 10 in the smaller fishing town of Donggala. In Palu, hundreds of people had been preparing for a beach festival that was due to start on Friday night. The city's main hospital was damaged in the quake, and TV footage showed dozens of injured people being treated outside in makeshift medical tents. Medical teams are treating patients in the open air At least 384 people have been killed in the quake Palu and Donggala are home to more than 600,000 people. President Joko Widodo said troops were en route to the area to reinforce rescue teams and help retrieve bodies. The main airport in Palu has been closed since the tsunami hit. A minister said the runway had been damaged but that it was hoped helicopters would still be able to land. The country's military is sending cargo planes of relief aid from the capital, Jakarta. Officials are urging locals not to enter their homes and to sleep away from buildings, due to the risk of aftershocks. Relief aid is packed into a military plane bound for Palu Indonesia's disaster agency said some people scaled trees to escape the huge waves The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just before 18:00 on Friday (10:00 GMT), the US Geological Survey said. A tsunami warning was issued, but lifted within the hour. Indonesia's meteorological agency has been criticised for its response, but officials said the waves struck while the warning was in place. Are earthquake warnings effective? Dramatic video of the tsunami hitting Palu shows the high waves sweeping away several buildings and then the large tilted mosque in the town, about 80km from the quake's epicentre. ""The situation is chaotic, people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore,"" said Dwikorita Karnawati, head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency. A 2004 tsunami triggered by an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra killed 226,000 across the Indian Ocean, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

Body found in student river searchThomas Jones disappeared after a night out during his first week at university in Worcester.Hereford & Worcester,"Thomas Jones, 18, from Bromsgrove, has not been heard from since 19 September Officers searching for missing student Thomas Jones have found a body in the River Severn. The 18-year-old went missing in the early hours of 19 September after a night out during his first week at the University of Worcester. Since then, hundreds of people have joined the search for Mr Jones, from Bromsgrove in Worcestershire. West Mercia Police said a body had been recovered and Mr Jones' next of kin had been informed.

In the Find Jonah Facebook group, set up by friends to help in the search for the teenager, Harley Hetherington said the news from police was ""not the outcome we wanted but we all did our best and Tom would be so proud"". Directly addressing his friend Mr Jones, he said: ""The whole country loves you mate and even further beyond. ""You were and always will be in every single one of our hearts and we all love you forever."" Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Mr Hetherington thanked everyone for their help and support, adding it showed ""not only how amazing Tom was as a person but how amazing all of you are"". Supt Damian Pettit said as formal identification had not yet taken place he could not make any further comment, but gave ""sincere thanks"" to the public for the overwhelming support. It is believed Mr Jones crossed the Sabrina footbridge over the river near to Worcester Racecourse, and then walked on to a footpath that runs along the top of the flood defences in Hylton Road in the direction of Hallow, just before 03:50 BST. He was starting a primary teaching course at the University of Worcester and had moved to the city on 16 September. Thomas Jones' parents had previously thanked people for their help and support Two 20-year-old men arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with his disappearance on Sunday were later released without charge, the force said. Since his disappearance, more than 11,000 people have signed a petition calling for CCTV to be placed along the River Severn in the city. Mr Jones' parents Ian and Vicki had previously thanked people for their help in coming out to look for their son, saying the support from friends and strangers had been immense. Ian Jones said they had had to ""dig deep"" for their daughter Ellie. Uncle Chris Rogers said the family had been through a ""rollercoaster of emotions"" since the disappearance. Search teams have been checking the River Severn since Mr Jones went missing The university extended a free taxi service that runs during 'freshers' week following Mr Jones' disappearance to ""reassure"" students. The scheme sees uniformed security staff directing students to taxis which take them back to campus from 01:30 BST to 3:30 BST every day.

Attacks against PM are unacceptable - Major,"Sir John said the attacks were not in the spirit of politics Taunts being made against Theresa May and ""routine attacks"" on her leadership by some Tory MPs are ""completely unacceptable"", Sir John Major has said. The ex-PM called those challenging Mrs May ""inexperienced"", adding that he felt ""even more closely drawn"" to her when he looked at the alternatives. Speaking in South Shields, he also made the case for another Brexit vote. It comes after Boris Johnson set out a ""better Brexit plan"" andrefused to rule out a leadership challenge. The former foreign secretary quit the cabinet in July in protest at Mrs May's plan for future economic co-operation with the EU - known as the Chequers plan - a strategyMr Johnson described on Friday as ""simply intolerable"". It has also been fiercely criticised by some Brexiteers, who say her proposal for a ""common rulebook"" on goods would compromise the UK's sovereignty and betray the 2016 referendum vote. Earlier this month Conservative MPs opposed to the PM's plan met to discuss how and when they could force her to stand down. Johnson refuses to rule out May challenge What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? European Research Group Tories won't back PM's plan Speaking at an event in South Shields alongside the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, Sir John said: ""I do not think routine attacks on the PM in the most lurid fashion is either the spirit of politics that one would wish to see, or is it in the interest of the negotiating posture of the United Kingdom."" He did not mention any MP by name, but said: ""When I look at the alternatives to the prime minister I am drawn even more closely to her."" He added that ""the threats that come in her direction of a leadership election unless she delivers a certain sort of Brexit... [went] far beyond anything that I would think was remotely acceptable in behaviour towards any prime minister"". And he underlined the ""inability of those who level these taunts to actually come up with any coherent plan of any sort themselves"". This video can not be played Johnson refuses to rule out challenging PM In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Friday, Mr Johnson repeatedly refused to rule out challenging Mrs May for the Tory leadership, instead saying, ""My job is to speak up for what I believe in"". Mrs May would stay in office ""as long as she feels it necessary"", he added. He also restated his opposition to Mrs May's Chequers plan, warning it would be ""a political and economic disaster"" for the country. Elsewhere, Sir John reiterated his belief that the UK public should be allowed to vote again on leaving the EU - because the argument made in favour of Brexit at the 2016 referendum had been ""a fantasy"". ""Almost nothing that was said has turned out to be the case,"" he said. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations on the terms of exit and future co-operation are continuing. The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Birmingham. Johnson refuses to rule out May challenge What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? What happens now that a deal's been done?

Malia Obama appears in music videoThe former first daughter is seen lip-syncing and playing the harmonica in the indie rock video.US & Canada,"Malia Obama lip-syncs in the video America's former first daughter has stepped back into the limelight - with a cameo in a music video. A beanie-clad Malia Obama has been spotted lip-syncing and apparently playing the harmonica in the latest offering by Boston's The New Dakotas. Never heard of them? You're not alone. Their songs have yet to make much of a splash on music app Spotify, where the most popular got just more than 2,000 listens. Their last video, meanwhile, got 1,500 views on video site YouTube. The one featuring Barack Obama's oldest daughter -entitled Walking on Air,external- has racked more than four times as many in a week. According to US website The Hill, the band attend Harvard University, which is where Miss Obama is currently in her second year. The music video appearance is unusual - as a general rule, Miss Obama and her younger sister Sasha have kept a low profile, despite their father being one of the most famous men on the planet.

'I lost my girlfriend and sister in the same car crash'VideoVideoStabbed police dog back on the beatThe students opting for booze-free halls at universityIs Muhammad the most popular boys' name?Game of Thrones sites to open to public,"Caitlin Huddleston and Skye Mitchell were both 18 when they died Aidan Huddleston was lying in bed on a Friday evening when he got a call telling him his girlfriend Skye and his sister Caitlin were dead. ""I kind of realised in that moment in time, my future that I'd had with Skye, and my sister's future, had just been completely removed - and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Skye Mitchell had been driving her friends Caitlin Huddleston and Ellis Marr to a restaurant near Millom in Cumbria, where they lived in July last year. The road was new to Skye, who had passed her test only four months earlier. She was travelling fast, but within the speed limit. It was wet. As she turned a corner, she lost control of her car, and hit a van. Skye and Aidan had been together for eight months ""I'd just got home from work, was lying in bed, falling asleep actually,"" says Aidan. ""Then the light of my phone lit up, and I noticed I had numerous messages and missed calls."" Aidan, 24, found out that night that his girlfriend and his sister had died at the scene. They were both 18. Ellis, who was in the back seat, and the 51-year-old driver of the van were both airlifted to hospital. Ellis stayed in hospital for five months. The van driver is still there, 14 months after the crash. Caitlin (left) and Skye (right) had been friends since primary school, they met Ellis (centre) in Secondary school ""We do not blame Skye whatsoever for what happened,"" says Aidan. ""There was nothing she could have done I believe on that night. It was all down to inexperience."" That's the reason Skye and Caitlin's families are calling for graduated driving licences (GDLs). A GDL scheme would mean restrictions for new drivers - for example a night curfew and a limit on the number of passengers they can carry. Those restrictions could last one or two years and then be lifted as drivers gain more experience. Aidan says that ""this whole situation wouldn't have occurred"" if GDLs were already in place. ""It would prevent injuries to people and it would stop families having to go through what mine and Skye's family has gone through,"" he says. AnRAC Foundation report,externalearlier this year estimated 281 fewer people a year would be killed or seriously injured if GDLs were introduced in England, Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland, which already hassome limitson new drivers, including a 45mph speed cap for the first year, plans to introduce the GDL in 2020. Data from other countries which have GDLs, such asthe US,externalandNew Zealand,external, seems to suggest it lowers the number of people killed or seriously injured by young drivers. Trudy Harrison MP was driving nearby on the night of the crash Trudy Harrison, Conservative MP for the area where Caitlin and Skye were from, was driving near her office in Bootle on the night of the crash, and was diverted as a result. ""I later learned that Skye and Caitlin were involved because my daughters came rushing downstairs to tell me about it,"" she tells Newsbeat. ""These young girls were very much part of our community."" Although Ms Harrison agrees ""something needs to be done"" to protect young drivers, she's ""not in favour of all aspects of the graduated driving licence"". ""I represent a very rural area in West Cumbria, and I'm very concerned that whatever is brought in should not disadvantage young people economically, in an area where we just cannot rely upon public transport."" Some examples she gives are of young parents with their children in the car or people who work outside normal hours. She would like to see better tuition for learner drivers, cheaper insurance on safer cars - and even suggests virtual reality technology as a way to help hazard perception. There are already voluntary measures you can take, such as displaying green probationary P plates - which show others that you've just passed your test. The crash happened on the A595 near Bootle The coroner who carried out an inquest into the deaths of Skye and Caitlinhas also called forGDLs to be brought into the whole of the UK. ""This isn't a punishment on young drivers,"" says Aidan. ""This whole graduated driving licence is here to help save lives."" He does say that if the GDL was in place when he was a new driver ""it would be more difficult socialising with friends, but still not impossible"". But he wouldn't trade the lives that would be saved ""for a bit of a laugh with my friends"". Road safety charity Brake supports GDLs. ""The government must act now to put an end to this daily tragedy and introduce graduated driver licensing, a safety measure which is proven to work and reduce young driver crashes,"" Joshua Harris, Brake's director of campaigns, said in a statement. The Department for Transport says it has decided to use the introduction of GDLs in Northern Ireland as a pilot to gather evidence on the potential for GDL across the rest of Great Britain. Caitlin, Aidan and their sister Hannah More than a year on from the crash, Aidan says: ""It certainly doesn't get easier, you just cope with it better. ""Some days you wake up and you don't want to do anything, but you've got to keep going."" ""We truly were in love with each other,"" he says about Skye. ""It would only ever get easier again if they were back here."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

The students opting for booze-free halls at universityIs Muhammad the most popular boys' name?Game of Thrones sites to open to public,"For many students, drinking and parties are a big part of the freshers' experience. But with more than one in five students saying they are teetotal, the demand for alcohol-free accommodation is on the rise. Mohamed is 19 and about to start his second year at Aberdeen University. He describes himself as talkative and easy to get along with. His only concern when starting university? He doesn't drink. As a Muslim he is teetotal for religious reasons so he opted for alcohol-free halls of residence. ""I would have felt uncomfortable living in a place where people were drinking. I didn't want to be in that environment,"" he says. 'Generation Sensible' in five charts What's it like being young and teetotal? But far from being a boring place to be, he says he loved living there. ""I could still meet lots of people and get involved in activities"". ""Some of my friends went straight into private accommodation and they missed out on stuff because they were living further away from the campus."" The alcohol-free block at Aberdeen University was relatively small when it was introduced last year and the 30 rooms available were only half full. But at other universities the idea has proved more popular. More than 400 students applied for alcohol-free accommodation at St Andrews University last year - far exceeding the 132 rooms available. Other universities which now offer booze-free living options include Chester, Bristol, Canterbury Christ Church and the University of West England. Aberdeen student Lachlan Shanks says he wanted to avoid booze-fuelled parties in his flat The rise in accommodation options comes asa growing number of young people are choosing not to drink,external. More than a fifth say they are teetotal, with financial pressures, a wider diversity of faiths and increased health awareness thought to be contributing factors. Mohamed says: ""There were quite a few people who did drink but only in moderation. A couple of my flatmates still went to parties and clubs. I think they were mainly worried about being in a noisy flat."" Lachlan Shanks, 19, also chose the alcohol-free block at Aberdeen University. He prefers not to drink himself and says he is a quiet person. ""If I had flatmates that liked drinking and clubbing I wouldn't have had much in common with them,"" he says. ""I thought if I picked the alcohol-free block people wouldn't be coming home late or having parties in the flat."" Nearly four in five students surveyed by the National Union of Students (79%) still believe that getting drunk is part of university culture - and only one in 10 are aware of responsible drinking activities or campaigns on campus. Lauren Seward says she spent a lot of time on her own during freshers week because she didn't drink. Lauren Seward, 22, is teetotal and says she would ""definitely"" have considered alcohol-free accommodation if the option had been available. She graduated from the University of Kent in 2017 and lived in halls in her first year but often felt lonely because so many activities revolved around drinking. ""Freshers' week was the worst because at that point everyone is really obsessed about going out and drinking so I spent a lot of time on my own,"" she says. Although she eventually made friends outside her halls she said an alcohol-free option would have been appealing. ""On the one hand it's good to meet different people and plenty of my friends drink. But in first year it would give some reassurance that at least at home you won't have to deal with people drinking all the time."" Eva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare for the NUS says if students are asking for these sorts of spaces, universities should offer them as an option. ""We also need to foster more responsible drinking cultures amongst students and offer more events and activities which aren't centred on drinking that everyone can enjoy."" But Georgia, 19, who is also teetotal, says she didn't want to live somewhere that marked her out as different. Her university, Plymouth Marjon, didn't have an alcohol-free option so she lived in ordinary halls in her first year. Although initially quite nervous about being around big groups drinking and worries about feeling left out, she soon made friends and found not drinking ""wasn't an issue"". ""I feel like if I'd been in alcohol-free halls I would have been judged by other students when I told them where I lived and subject to more scrutiny about 'why don't you drink?'. ""It could work for some people but I wouldn't want to be labelled like that,"" she says. Mohamed says he didn't find this a problem. ""It wasn't segregated at all. I don't think that many people actually knew there was an alcohol-free block in my halls. I had friends living in other halls and other blocks. The only difference is there isn't alcohol in your own flat,"" he says. 'Generation Sensible' in five charts What's it like being young and teetotal?

Is Muhammad the most popular boys' name?Game of Thrones sites to open to public,"Boxer Cassius Clay Jr changed his name to Muhammad Ali when he converted to Islam Oliver was declared the most popular boys' name for the fourth year running, but some readers asked if there were actually more babies called Muhammad. They also wanted to know which names were given to an equal number of girls and boys and when the name Doris was popular. Here are the answers: Distance runner Mo Farah's full name is Sir Mohamed Muktar Jama Farah CBE Oliver held its position as the most popular boys' name since 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). A number of readers asked whether adding together all of the different spellings of Muhammad would mean more babies were given that name than Oliver. Muhammad, the most common spelling given to babies born in 2017, was the 10th most popular name for boys overall. Oliver topped the 2017 list with 6,259 babies while Muhammad was registered 3,691 times - not including hyphenated names, such as Muhammad-Ali. If we combine 14 different spellings included in the data we get 7,307 boys, which is more than 1,000 ahead of Oliver. Variations included Muhammad, Mohammed, Mohammad, Muhammed, Mohamed, Mohamad, Muhamad, Muhamed, Mohamud, Mohummad, Mohummed, Mouhamed, Mohammod and Mouhamad. However the ONS treats each spelling of a name separately and ranks them according to the number of times that individual spelling appears on birth certificates. ""Combining spellings of one particular name distorts the list - for example combining Sophie, Sophia and Sofia on the 2015 girls list would knock Amelia off the top spot,""the ONS said in 2016.,external Statisticians say combining names which have a similar spelling would require individuals to make a ""subjective decision"" about whether certain names are distinctive or not.
