"Lebanon PM quits, fearing for own life","Mr Hariri has been in charge for less than a year Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri has resigned, saying in a televised broadcast from Saudi Arabia that he feared for his life, while also fiercely criticising Iran. He accused Iran of sowing ""fear and destruction"" in several countries, including Lebanon. Mr Hariri's father, former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, was assassinated in 2005. The Hariri family is close to Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional competitor. Mr Hariri has been prime minister since December 2016, after previously holding the position between 2009 and 2011. ""We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri,"" he said in the broadcast from the Saudi capital Riyadh. ""I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life."" Mr Hariri also attacked the Iran-backed Shia movement Hezbollah, which wields considerable power in Lebanon. Addressing ""Iran and its followers"" he said Lebanon would ""cut off the hands that wickedly extend into it"". Iran said the resignation would create regional tensions and rejected Mr Hariri's accusations as ""unfounded"". What is Hezbollah? Read more about Lebanon Mr Hariri has made several visits in the past few days to Saudi Arabia, whose leadership is strongly opposed to Iran. His announcement came a day after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Kahmenei. Taking up the prime minister's office last year, Mr Hariri promised a ""new era for Lebanon"" after two years of political deadlock. The coalition government he led brought together almost all of the main political parties in Lebanon, including Hezbollah. Rafik al-Hariri was killed by a bomb in 2005in an attack widely blamed on Hezbollah. By Martin Patience, BBC News, Beirut The prime minister's resignation has opened up a chasm of uncertainty in Lebanon. It's still not clear why he announced his decision in Saudi Arabia - an extraordinary move that left even his own MPs bewildered. But the move will be seen through the lens of the great Shia-Sunni divide that's fuelling much of the violence across the Middle East. It's pitted the Sunni power, Saudi Arabia, against the Shia power, Iran - with both sides backing different players to wield influence. In Lebanon, the Saudis support Mr Hariri while Iran backs the Shia movement, Hezbollah. In recent years, Lebanon has largely been spared the violence seen elsewhere in the region. But with this stunning resignation, many Lebanese will now fear that their country is firmly in the crosshairs of the two regional superpowers.

Saudi princes held in corruption probe,"Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is among those held The heir to the throne in Saudi Arabia has consolidated his hold on power with a major purge of the kingdom's political and business leadership. A new anti-corruption body, headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, detained 11 princes, four sitting ministers and dozens of ex-ministers. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire with investments in Twitter and Apple, is among those held. Separately King Salman replaced the national guard and the navy chiefs. The new anti-corruption committee has the power to issue arrest warrants and travel bans. Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said the status of the detainees would not influence ""the firm and fair application of justice"", AFP news agency reports. Saudi broadcasterAl-Arabiya said fresh investigations had been launched,externalinto the 2009 Jeddah floods and the outbreak of the Mers virus which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 - but analysts see the detentions as a clear move by the crown prince to strengthen his power base. Who is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? End of Saudi women driving ban reflects deep changes in society Saudi Arabia profile Analysis by Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The events of Saturday night in Saudi Arabia are nothing short of seismic for that country. In a bold, pre-planned move, the 32-year old Crown Prince has removed the final obstacles to his gaining total control over the world's richest oil producer and home to the holiest shrines in Islam. Presented to the world as an anti-corruption drive, the arrests of princes, ministers and the billionaire tycoon Prince Alwaleed bin Talal have shocked Saudis unused to sudden change. The crown prince is largely popular, especially amongst young Saudis, but many older, more conservative citizens think he is moving too far too fast. He has started an unwinnable war in Yemen while still fighting the extremists of so-called Islamic State. He has also backed a damaging boycott of Gulf neighbour Qatar. But his supporters hail his efforts to modernise Saudi Arabia and, after decades of rule by old men, they welcome a fresh vision from a man who could well be king for the next 50 years. The owner of London's Savoy hotel isone of the richest men in the world, with a net worth of $17bn (Â£13bn),externalaccording to Forbes. Shares in Kingdom Holding, the investment firm owned by the prince, plunged 9.9% in early trade on the Saudi stock market after news of his detention emerged. The firm is one of Saudi Arabia's most important investors. Apart from Twitter and Apple, it has shares in Citigroup bank, the Four Seasons hotel chain and ride-sharing service Lyft. The Saudi prince made the news in the past for employing women, who make up two-thirds of his staff. But he was also known for his hundred-million-dollar desert resorts, where he employed dwarves for entertainment purposes. Two years ago he offered luxury cars to fighter pilots participating in a bombing campaign in Yemen, where the Saudi-led coalition continues to bomb Houthi rebels, killing 26 people in an attack on a  hotel and market on Wednesday. Profile: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal The Saudi prince who offered Bentleys to bombers Saudis 'intercept missile' near capital Prince Alwaleed once bought control of a hotel and a yacht from Donald Trump, when he had yet to enter politics, but clashed with him publicly on Twitter in 2015 over his decision to stand for president,the New York Times notes,external.

National guard minister Prince Miteb bin Abdullah and navy commander Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan were both replaced, with no official explanation given. Prince Miteb bin Abdullah has been replaced as head of the powerful national guard Prince Miteb, son of the late King Abdullah, was once seen as a contender for the throne and was the last member of Abdullah's branch of the family in the highest echelons of Saudi government.

Few people outside Saudi Arabia had heard of Prince Mohammed bin Salman before his father became king in 2015. But since then, the 32-year-old has become the most influential figure in the world's leading oil exporter Last year, the crown prince unveiled a wide-ranging plan to bring social and economic change to the oil-dependent kingdom. The anti-corruption committee was formed by royal decree and is headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman He recently said the return of ""moderate Islam"" waskey to his plans to modernise Saudi Arabia.

Mystery behind 'Sue' field message solved,"This video can not be played Meaning of Sue field message revealed The identity of a woman whose first name was emblazoned in huge letters in a farmer's field has been revealed. A frenzy was sparked on social media, spawning the hashtag #WhoIsSue, after the letters ""SUE x"" were spotted by a police pilot flying over Oxfordshire. It turns out that farmer Murray Graham created the message for his wife as a way of apologising for being ""grumpy"". His son George Graham said: ""I suppose Dad wanted to express his love in the most creative way he could."" Sue Graham's husband Murray created the message to make up for his grumpiness Mr Graham's handiwork was spotted on Thursdayby a helicopter pilot with the National Police Air Service (NPAS) flying just south of Tetsworth, near Thame. A photo of the message then posted on the NPAS BensonTwitter page,externalwas shared more than 650 times. The Twitterati explored various theories, ranging from aliens accused of making crop circles wanting to ""sue"" for defamation to a PR stunt by the Field Museum, which houses aT-Rex skeleton called SUE,external.

But on Friday evening the crop conundrum was solved: it was a romantic gesture to appease a disgruntled farmer's wife. Mr Graham told BBC Radio Oxford that he used his GPS-operated tractor to spray the crops in the shape of his wife's name. He said he wanted to prove ""I'm not quite as grumpy and old as perhaps I make out occasionally."" The farmer added: ""As ever, everything has its ups and downs, so I thought I'd try and make a gesture at some point, and that was the one I chose."" He had intended for his son George, a pilot, to take a photo and show it to his wife as an apology, but the passing police helicopter beat him to it. George Graham revealed his father had been ""in the doghouse"" after not ""pulling his weight"" at home. He added: ""I don't know if what he's done is sufficient appeasement for Mum, but it certainly caused a stir on social media.""

"This is not a witch hunt, says Harman","Labour MP Harriet Harman has told BBC News that the string of allegations of sexual abuse and harassment against MPs is not a witch hunt. She said: ""There are a lot of men saying this has been blown out of all proportion, it's a witch hunt. No, it's not a witch hunt, it's long overdue."" Her comments follow the suspensions of a Conservative and a Labour MP. Meanwhile,SNP MSP Mark McDonald has quit as a Scottish government minister over ""inappropriate"" behaviour. Ina statement,externalhe said it had been brought to his attention that some of his ""previous actions have been considered to be inappropriate"". ""I apologise unreservedly to anyone I have upset or who might have found my behaviour inappropriate,"" Mr McDonald, who represents Aberdeen Donside at Holyrood, said. Conservative MPCharlie Elphickeand Labour's Kelvin Hopkins were suspended from their parties on Friday, while Defence SecretarySir Michael Fallon resignedearlier this week. On Saturday morning, Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet, urged people ""not to rush to judgement"", telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he believes the scandal is turning into a ""witch hunt"". ""I don't think there's anybody who would seek to defend rape or sexual abuse in the context there's no proof that I can see yet of any wrongdoing. How does a member of Parliament refute that?"" What counts as inappropriate behaviour? Harassment in Westminster: the allegations and denials Tories publish new code of conduct On Friday, the Conservatives published anew code of conductand are immediately adopting a new complaints procedure. Mrs May is also meeting opposition party leaders on Monday to discuss proposals to bring forward a new grievance system for Westminster staff and MPs. Ms Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, said that she thought Prime Minister Theresa May took ""very bold action"" in relation to Sir Michael's resignation. Sir Michael, who quit office on Wednesday saying his general conduct fell short of expected standards, has ""categorically denied"" allegations over his conduct. This video can not be played The scandal is turning into a ""witch hunt"", says Tory MP Ms Harman told BBC Radio 4's Week in Westminster that Mrs May's actions have made her ""hopeful"" that the parties can work together to change standards. She said people were put off from making complaints for fear of being disloyal to their party and ""helping"" the other side. But now, she said, ""there's a bigger fight"". ""We're all tribal beasts, that's why we're there [in parliament] and that has dampened down any ability to speak out,"" she said. ""I think that's changed after this week."" Ms Harman said that Parliament has a ""sea change opportunity"" to address the issue - and to help those who speak out. She added: ""If you point your finger at a powerful man, they won't just sit there, they will fight back. So there will be some backlash about this amongst the corridors [of Westminster]."" Dover MP Charlie Elphicke denies any wrongdoing On Friday, Charlie Elphicke, a former party whip who has been the Conservative MP for Dover since 2010, was suspended by the party after ""serious allegations"" were referred to the police. Denying any wrongdoing in a post on Twitter, the married 46-year-old wrote: ""The party tipped off the press before telling me of my suspension. I am not aware of what the alleged claims are."" LabourMPs Clive Lewis and Kelvin Hopkins are being investigatedby the party over allegations about their behaviour. But Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale told BBC Radio 4: ""We're in danger of getting into a situation where nobody half bright, half sensible, half decent, will want to go into the House of Commons - and that will not be good for democracy. ""We should look at the facts...by all means throw book at them, but don't throw the book at them until the case is proven."" This video can not be played I was groped and flashed at - Emily Thornberry Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, told BBC Breakfast that the House of Commons has ""no real structure"" for complaints. She said it is ""the most unusual workplace"" where the rules around sexual harassment are ""lax if not non-existent"". ""In this sense it needs to get into line. Other big companies have a sexual harassment policy, they have a staff handbook. All those things do not exist for MPs"", she said. On top of that, she added, ""you've got a whole political culture which has thrived on favours and bullying"" as well as partisan ""one-upmanship"" where people are ""incredibly loyal to their parties"". This video can not be played Labour's shadow chancellor says Parliament must 'give women the confidence to work in safety' Alongside the new code of conduct and complaints procedure, the Conservatives have set up a a hotline for reporting potential breaches and a more detailed investigatory process. Labour has introduced a new complaints procedure, while the Liberal Democrats continue to review their complaints procedures. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said any complaints system has to apply to all political parties, and must be ""fair and objective"". ""There should be an element of independence [in the system], particularly for support as well, so people can feel confident about where they can report these things and at the same time how it can be dealt with."" Mrs May said Parliament must do its bit as well as the individual parties - as it was not fair to expect potentially vulnerable people to ""navigate different grievance procedures according to political party"". Lord Bew, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told the Today programme that the ""burning issue"" at stake is the reputation of parliament. He said it was vital that cases were not dealt with internally by the parties, but by those outside parliament who could ""give some reassurance to the public that this is not just another cover-up"".

A British actor said he had woken up to find Spacey performing a sex act on him in 2008, the Sun newspaper reported. The man is said to have run from the property after Spacey allegedly said: ""Don't tell anyone about this."" Spacey said on Thursday he was seeking treatment after facing allegations of sexual misconduct from a string of men. Netflix suspended production on House of Cardson 31 October followingallegations by Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp,external, who said Spacey had tried to ""seduce"" him when he was 14. Spacey said he was ""beyond horrified"" to hear of the incident, which he said he did not remember. House of Cards, which is based on a BBC programme, was first broadcast in 2013. The first season garnered nine Emmy nominations, becoming the first online streaming series to win such mainstream accolades. ""Netflix will not be involved with any further production of House of Cards that includes Kevin Spacey,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement. ""We will continue to work with MRC [series producer Media Rights Capital] during this hiatus time to evaluate our path forward as it relates to the show. ""We have also decided we will not be moving forward with the release of the film Gore, which was in post-production, starring and produced by Kevin Spacey."" MRC said in a statement earlier that it was ""deeply troubled"" about the allegations against Spacey. It said it had dealt with one incident in 2012 in which an unnamed crew member ""shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey"", that immediate action had been taken and that the issue had been resolved. Spacey had ""willingly participated in a training process"", it added.

'Why I'm Charles Bronson's wife-to-be',"Paula Williamson describes her fiancÃ© as ""charismatic, witty and cheeky"" - a man who likes llamas and is passionate about his art. For most, her soon-to-be-husband Charles Bronson - now called Charles Salvador - is one of the UK's most violent prisoners. ""It's a marvel we make it work,"" says Paula, 37, who marries Bronson, 64, in the confines of HMP Wakefield in Yorkshire next Tuesday. Bronson, a former bare-knuckle boxer who was first jailed for armed robbery in 1974, will not be able to attend his own wedding reception. So what brought the couple together and what will their nuptials be like? Paula, a former soap actress, first wrote to Bronson in 2013 after reading his book on living in Broadmoor psychiatric hospital. ""I wanted to thank him - it had hope, and really helped me mentally,"" she says. They exchanged letters for the next three years, before he asked to meet - by which time he had changed his last name to Salvador and broken off an engagement with another woman, Lorraine. ""I never spoke to him about Lorraine, as that's his own business,"" Paula says. She describes their first meeting at HMP Wakefield: ""I wasn't nervous until I heard the slamming of gates and went through security. ""Then I heard this booming cockney voice shouting out my name. ""He was in a segregation unit - a prison within a prison - and stood in the corner sparring in mid-air, I thought he seemed like a nervous boy. ""I said to him, 'Charlie, come here and give me a hug, it's bloody me'."" She has visited Bronson once a week since then. She says the ""hours fly by"" during their meetings, as they talk about the meals she plans to cook him and he makes her a cup of tea. ""A few weeks in I asked Charlie, 'What are we?' And he replied, 'Well you're my soulmate of course, we are in a relationship - I adore you.'"" Bronson, who was jailed in 1974, will not be able to go to his wedding reception To outsiders, it may seem an unlikely match. Luton-born Bronson, a petty criminal since his teens, had his original seven-year sentence increased after a string of violent outbursts, with his time inside dramatised in a 2009 film starring Tom Hardy. Paula, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent with her four cats, studied acting at university, before landing minor roles in Coronation Street and Emmerdale. But she insists they are ""very similar creatures"", with a shared experience of mental health problems. ""I've suffered from awful depression and anxiety following a relationship breakup,"" she said. When Bronson proposed to Paula over the phone on Valentine's Day, he said they had ""both been to dark places"". 1974First jailed, age 22, for armed robbery and wounding 1975Attacked a fellow prisoner with a glass jug 1985Carried out a three-day rooftop protest 1988Returned to prison for robbing a jewellery shop 1992Released, but found guilty shortly afterwards of conspiracy to rob 1994Holds a prison librarian hostage, demanding a helicopter and tea 1998Takes three inmates hostage at Belmarsh 1999Given a life sentence with a three-year tariff for kidnapping 2014Assaulted prison governor Alan Parkins Five friends will attend the wedding on 14 November, to be held in a parole hearing room. Afterwards, Bronson will go back into solitary confinement and the celebrations will continue at a nearby pub. ""We have a bit of time together after the wedding, then he goes back to his cell, which is heartbreaking,"" Paula says. But the reception will be a less private affair. Paula has agreements with tabloid newspapers to write stories about the wedding - having previously invited theDaily Mirror,externalto film the moment Bronson proposed. ""People say I've courted the media,"" says Paula, who insists she is a ""solitary person"". ""I want to show Charlie's not forgotten about."" Charles Bronson in 1992 - that year, he spent 53 days outside prison before being arrested again One important person will be avoiding the cameras: the mother of the bride. ""Mum's not coming to the wedding as she's a private person,"" Paula says, admitting her family have objected to the match. ""Mum was a bit concerned as he has this awful reputation, but she knows I'm a strong-willed character with my head screwed on,"" she adds. She says the backlash from strangers is far worse - claiming she has lost acting jobs over the relationship and is trolled on social media. ""I've had a hell of a lot of hatred towards me for being with him,"" says Paula, who spends her time answering people's letters to Bronson and campaigning for him to be released. ""It's madness at the moment,"" she adds. ""I've said to Charlie, 'do you want to swap places for a bit'?"" Prison governors can approve a prisoner's request to marry, if they are unlikely to be released or deported within three months There are dispensations for inmates with less than three months to serve - such as if they are having a baby or if someone is terminally ill The prisoner and their partner are expected to pay any costs associated with the marriage, like transport to the ceremony if it takes place outside prison Governors can object to a marriage - including if they are worried about a convicted sex offender or if they think the couple is colluding to commit an offence Source: Ministry of Justice Bronson has a parole hearing on 7 November to determine whether it is safe for him to mix with other prisoners. The couple can currently only kiss and hold hands between bars during Paula's visits to Wakefield - one of the most secure prisons in the UK and one that counts paedophiles and serial killers among its inmates. ""He's locked up for 22 hours a day,"" says Paula. ""If I thought he'd be in prison the rest of his life, it would be a strange thing to marry."" Despite the separation, Paula insists they are like ""any other couple"". ""We have little fall outs and tiffs,"" Paula says. ""But after 10 minutes of seeing him I'll smile and say 'for goodness' sake Charlie, stop being such a stupid git!'"" She adds: ""I know I'm not 19 any more, but we've also discussed having children one day."" Paula is confident Bronson will be released one day, and is campaigning for his rehabilitation Paula admits living together would be ""very different"" from their current life of letters, phone calls and weekly visits. ""I've said to Charlie, when you get out, you will have a room, and that will be your sanctuary,"" she says. They want to live in a cottage, keep llamas and go on cruise holidays, while Bronson does his art and gives talks to young offenders. In the book Paula first read in 2013, Bronson said his troubles were behind him - and described himself as a ""prolific artist"". ""I'll carry on campaigning for him until we get that life,"" Paula says.

Mexico fuel theft boss killed during surgery,"Jesus Martin was a gang leader for ""Huachicoleros"" who live from stealing fuel mostly from pipelines in Puebla state A gang leader in Mexico has been killed while undergoing plastic surgery to disguise his identity by changing his face and erasing his fingerprints. Officials said gunmen burst into the clinic in the city of Puebla and killed Jesus Martin, known as El Kalimba, while he was on the operating table. Police said the murder seemed to result from a dispute between rival gangs. They said Martin had been running an operation illegally siphoning fuel from pipelines. The business has become Mexico's second-biggest organised crime after drug trafficking. Jesus Martin wasn't the first crime boss in Mexico to use plastic surgery to avoid death or arrest. One feared Juarez drug cartel boss, Amado Carrillo, died from surgical complications in 1997. Mexico's state oil company Pemex and local firefighters struggle to control a fire believed to have been started in a pipe due to fuel theft in Puebla earlier this year The notorious  Joaquim GuzmÃ¡n, known as El Chapo, was captured in 2014 despite changing the shape of most of his features while on the run. Jesus Martin was known as a ""Huachicolero"" or a ""chupaducto"" (pipesucker). He had been running an operation that illegally tapped pipelines, stealing fuel for cheap resale. The ""Huachicoleros"" siphon off the fuel and then sell it on at half the market price on busy highroads, costing Mexico's oil company millions of dollars in lost revenue. The gang bosses also donate fuel on special holidays to local communities to garner favour. Thousands of families are now engaged in this illegal activity. The new business has inspired its own subculture and saint, ""The Infant Huachicolero"", to whom locals pray and make offerings in the hope of receiving protection and prosperity. It mostly takes place in an area of central Puebla state where pipelines carry 40% of the country's fuel and has begun to have a significant economic impact for Mexico's oil company, Pemex, and local governments. In April, the Mexican Congress approved a bill to increase sentences for fuel stealing to up to 25 years in prison.

Half of UK speed cameras are inactive,"Only around half of fixed speed cameras on British roads are switched on, according to new data. Figures released by 36 police forces in the UK show that of a total 2,838 cameras, just 1,486 - or 52% - are active and catching law-breakers. Some forces have turned all their cameras off, according to information obtained by the Press Association (PA). Northamptonshire police said its were shut off in 2011, but they left the structures in place to deter speeding. PA sent a freedom of information to all 45 police forces in the UK and their speed camera partnership, of which 36 responded with details of their fixed speed cameras. It did not include data on the mobile devices forces use to catch offenders. Staffordshire police said it has 272 cameras across its region but that only 14 are active. While Derbyshire said just 10 of its 112 cameras were active. In common with Northamptonshire, Cleveland, Durham and North Yorkshire said that none of their fixed cameras were switched on. A spokeswoman for the National Police Chiefs' Council said the decision to use cameras was ""an operational matter"", adding that ""all forces have individual responsibility for their use of speed cameras"". Fixed speed cameras in Cleveland, Durham, North Yorkshire and Northamptonshire are all inactive Staffordshire Police has 272 fixed cameras across the region, of which 14 are active In Scotland,less than 29% of fixed cameras are switched on Forces where less than 25% of fixed cameras are active: West Yorkshire, Kent, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Cheshire Derbyshire force operates 112 cameras, of which 10 are switched on Gwent police force has 17 fixed speed cameras of which 8 are active while South Wales has 88, 59% of which are switched on Police forces with all fixed speed cameras switched on include: the City of London, the Metropolitan Police/Transport for London, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Suffolk and Northern Ireland Edmund King, president of the AA, said: ""Many of the empty yellow cases are due to cuts in road safety grants and the fact that digital cameras, although more effective, are very expensive."" He added: ""It has long been the case that cameras were moved between sites, depending on need. When it comes to the chances of being caught on camera, it is a postcode lottery. All cameras in City of London and Suffolk are working whereas only 5% are active in Staffordshire."" ""However, drivers should remember that lack of a yellow fixed camera doesn't mean they are immune from mobile hidden cameras. Best advice is stick to the limits rather than gambling on the yellow boxes."" Claire Armstrong, co-founder of the lobby group Safe Speed, which campaigns for more traffic police officers, said that fixed speed cameras ""are nothing to do with road safety"". She claimed that ""average cameras have a 5% negative effect on road safety, Gatso [yellow box cameras] have a 13% negative effect and a policeman on the side of the road will have a 27% benefit, so why are we using policies that are not effective and that we know have a negative effect on road safety?"". However, Neil Greig, director of policy and research for the charity IAM Road Smart, said: ""There's clear evidence at locations where cameras are located, they are there for road safety reasons. ""They don't just appear out of nowhere. They have to go through a process involving looking at the road accident record at that location. ""Each of these locations is a site that has got some kind of accident problem and that's why we want to be sure that there's protection there all the time for the people who live around those sites.""

White House downplays US climate report,"Rising sea levels linked to climate change threaten coastal areas like the Marshall Islands The White House has sought to downplay a major climate change report, which was compiled by 13 US federal agencies. The study is at odds with assertions from President Donald Trump and several members of his administration. It says it is ""extremely likely"" human activity is the ""dominant cause"" of global warming. A spokesman for the White House said it supported ""rigorous scientific analysis and debate"" but added that the climate was ""always changing"". White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah said it was not certain how sensitive the Earth's climate was to greenhouse gas emissions. Mr Trump, who has embarked on a tour of Asia, once said the concept of global warming was created by the Chinesein order to make American manufacturing  less competitive. Earlier this year, he announced he was pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement to cut global emissions. What is climate change? Five effects of US pullout from Paris climate deal Record surge in atmospheric C02 in 2016 The Climate Science Special Report, which was approved by the White House, was compiled by US government scientists.,external It argues that it is ""extremely likely"" that human activity is causing rapid global warming with dire consequences for the US and the world. The scientists' predictions include: A global sea level rise of up to 8ft (2.4 metres) cannot be ruled out by the end of the century Risks of drought and flooding will increase There will be more frequent wildfires and devastating storms Running to nearly 500 pages, the report concludes that the current period is ""now the warmest in the history of modern civilisation"". It is ""extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause"", it finds, adding that ""there is no convincing alternative explanation"". President Trump has made it easier for industry to pollute and he has appointed to key government positions men who are sceptical of their own scientists, the BBC's James Cook, in Los Angeles, says. Only on Thursday,Mr Trump's Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, told US media that while he thought climate change was real and humans had an ""impact on it"", he still thought ""the science [was] out,externalon"" whether humans cause 100% of it. The researchers say there was no political interference in, or censorship of, their report.

A beginner's guide to Trump in Asia,"US President Donald Trump is on his first official trip to Asia, passing through Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. From trade to etiquette, each stop will have its own challenges. So here is a (non-exhaustive) beginner's guide to the issues at stake. Mr Trump starts off by visiting Washington's closest Asian friends: Japan and South Korea. But it's North Korea they will be talking about. Pyongyang has already sent two long range missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test. Despite harsher sanctions, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has shown no sign of slowing down the pace of weapons development. Skittish observers wonder if the visit will prompt Pyongyang to do something rash. But if talks with almost every leader are about how to deal with North Korea, there is unlikely to be any real consensus. Here are some key questions from this leg of the trip: How much reassurance can Trump provide?With Japanese citizens rehearsing drills in case of a nuclear attack, Tokyo will want to know the US will provide military co-operation.  Seoul, literally in the firing line of its northern neighbour with artillery positioned over the border, will want the same. Will Trump tweet while so close to the North?After anunprecedented personal warning to Mr Trump from Kim Jong-un, Seoul will want him to tone down his rhetoric and keep options for dialogue open. Any threats exchanged when he is literally over the border won't go down well. How will he like the viral Pen Pineapple song?In Tokyo he is also set to meet Piko Taro, singer of the Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Penearworm that swept the globe. What about that awkward handshake?Mr Trump and Japan's PM Shinzo Abe are thought to have a strong relationship, but people will watch closely after thepatting and twitching of their last 19-second handshake. 'I have a pen... I have an apple...' China is North Korea's chief economic supporter and Mr Trump is likely to seek continued support for sanctions. But Chinese leader Xi Jinping has just emerged from a Communist Party Congress that saw his power reach unprecedented levels, so he may not feel the need to compromise. Few observers expect radical shifts in the US-China relationship, but they will be watching for any clues to shifts in the global balance of power. China set out its stall earlier this year with a push to its 2013Belt and Road project, a vast global trade network with China at its heart. Here are other things to look out for: Will he assert US military dominance?The South China Sea dispute may have been quiet over the last few months as North Korea rumbled, but nonetheless China is going ahead with development in the disputed sea. Will he talk tough on trade?Mr Trump is known for lambasting China overallegedly unfair trade policies, currency manipulation and stealing US jobs. He has just called the US trade deficit with China ""embarrassing"" but what can he achieve in practice? Will Chinese social media meme the meet?Chinese social media is known for its creative memes (remember theWinnie the Pooh and Tigger memeswhen Mr Xi met President Obama?) Will they move faster than the censors this time? Will the internet rise to the challenge and come up with a new version of this? By the time Mr Trump gets to Vietnam and the Philippines we should know more about how the US is positioning itself in Asia. Trade is likely to be key. Mr Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal, frustrating many, including Vietnam, his host at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) Economic Leaders' meeting. Even Japan and Korea are nervous the US will back off from bilateral trade agreements. His ""America First!"" slogan is aimed at a domestic audience but does not go down well with trade partners abroad. And there are other questions from this leg: Will he speak out on human rights?Both Vietnam, which puts dissenting bloggers in jail, and the Philippines, with its controversial drug war, have a patchy rights record - but will Mr Trump speak out? What happens when Trump and Duterte meet?They are the two most outspoken leaders in the world, so expect colourful talk. But Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has shown he is just as willing to woo China as the US, the Philippines' traditional ally. What does Asia want from Donald Trump?

What will happen in Syria following IS defeats?,"Civil wars that spread devastation and suffering across a whole country have no real victors. But one war in Syria - that against the Islamic State (IS) group's so-called caliphate - is well on the way to being won. Earlier this weekIS's last urban bastion in eastern Syria, Deir al-Zour, hard up against the Iraqi border, fell to Assad government forces. IS will remain in some form or another as an insurgency and source of ideological inspiration but as a territorial entity or physical caliphate, it is finished. But what of Syria's other war, the uprising against the Assad regime and its efforts - aided by Iran and Russia - to crush the opposition? The current situation on the ground means that forces from the above countries will be in close proximity to United States troops, who are supporting some of the anti-Assad groups. Joshua Landis, a Syria expert and professor at Oklahoma University, summed it up in simple terms. ""Assad has won the Syria war militarily,"" he told me. ""He has defeated the original uprising or revolution. The rebel groups that remain have been pushed to the margins of Syria. ""The international community has all but abandoned them as a lost cause. The rebel militias,"" he argues, ""still have some teeth in defence, but cannot mount a credible offensive against Assad's military."" Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, and another close watcher of Syria, has a slightly more cautious assessment. ""President Assad,"" he notes, ""sits more comfortably in Damascus than at any time since 2011."" But having said that, he argues that ""it would be inaccurate to suggest Assad had won the war. He's simply avoided losing it."" ""The Assad regime has a stated intent to recapture every inch of Syria. If that goal is to ever be met, we're talking years at least,"" he explained. But the crucial take-away from all this is that Syria is entering a new phase of conflict. The territorial defeat of IS, says Charles Lister, ""will throw an awful lot of potential sources of hostility up into the air and nobody really knows right now how they'll land"". What is emerging is a new strategic map with Syria divided into different zones: One controlled by the Assad regime (with the support of Russia and Iran), another controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (an amalgam of Kurdish, Arab and other groups supported by the US), and others run by various elements of the Syrian opposition, backed to varying degrees by Turkey and Jordan. The rise and fall of the Islamic State group What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? Raqqa: IS 'capital' falls to US-backed Syrian forces How much territory have Russia and Syria recaptured from IS? Having helped Assad restore his control over a significant part of the Syrian population, Moscow has also manoeuvred itself into holding the best cards in the putative diplomatic end-game. As Joshua Landis told me, the Astana peace process, led by the Russians, ""is the only one worth anything at the moment. ""The Geneva process, led by the US,"" he notes, ""has been about grandstanding and sticking to talking points that no longer have any relevance on the ground, such as demanding that Assad step aside and that democratic elections be held in Syria. Everyone knows this will not happen."" With the demise of IS, Syria's future will continue to be determined by a variety of external players, fighting out their own strategic battles and seeking local advantage. The four key actors are the US, Russia, Turkey and Iran. The United States Special forces from Western countries, including the US, have supported Kurdish-Arab forces in Syria Its initial half-hearted efforts to galvanise a democratic opposition to defeat the Syrian regime failed dramatically. Its focus has largely been on the defeat of the IS caliphate. But now, Joshua Landis says, Washington must make a decision: ""Will it stay in Northern Syria to defend the gains of the Syrian Democratic Forces that it has armed, trained and propelled to victory in Raqqa and the region north of the Euphrates River?"" The difficulty, as Charles Lister told me, is that ""beyond fighting IS, it is sadly very hard to determine whether the US really has a Syria policy."" And he says that what policy there is is full of contradictions. For example, Washington continues to say Assad must leave and that his days are numbered, and yet the US has ceased all support to anyone opposed to Assad. Turkey Turkish President Erdogan's main concern is with the Kurds If US policy could be said to be in a mess, so too could that of Turkey. Ankara's goal, says Joshua Landis, is to retrench. ""It seriously overreached in Syria,"" he told me, ""almost to the point of destabilising Turkey."" He believes that President Erdogan ""must make sure that theKurdishquestion in Turkey does not lurch toward civil war. He will increasingly normalise relations with Assad in order to contain the independence of Syria's Kurds."" Turkish troops have moved a small way into northern Syria to achieve this goal. Indeed, after posing as a champion of the opposition against the Assad regime, Charles Lister says, that ""at times, Turkey has directly betrayed the opposition groups it had stood by for so long, merely to secure a more favourable position against the Kurdish YPG, which it views as a terrorist organisation. Iran Shia militias, backed by Tehran, have played a prominent role in the campaign against IS In backing the Assad regime (and offering significant support to the Shia-dominated government in Iraq) Tehran has had one clear goal - to secure its hegemony in the northern Middle East: the lands stretching from Lebanon through Syria and Iraq, all the way to Iran's own borders. ""This,"" says Joshua Landis, ""is the new security architecture that Iran has fought so vigorously for and it is within its reach today. This means that Iran can counter-balance Israel. It means that Iran can establish oil pipelines running to the Mediterranean coast, trade routes, highways, and pilgrimage routes."" This, he says, means ""Iran is no longer cut out of the Middle East."" And Tehran has troops to back up its position. Charles Lister notes that Iran ""commands tens of thousands of Shia militiamen inside Syria, which gives Tehran more influence than any other actor, bar none."" Russia Russian troops have been on the ground in Syria Russia, after Iran, is the other great winner from the Syrian conflict, reviving its role in the region, securing important military bases, and making itself a key diplomatic player. It wants to ""solve"" Syria on its terms and with its favoured actors ending up the victors and it seems to be well on the way to achieving this goal. But the growing proximity of Russian and Iranian-backed pro-regime forces and those backed by the US raises the possibility of some dangerous encounters. The US and Russia can agree on the need to defeat IS but on little else. Moscow's ""side"" has the military and diplomatic advantage on the ground. Will the US seek to bolster its position in Syria, perhaps as part of a broader policy to ""roll back"" Iranian influence, as US conservatives are hoping? This may be easier said than done and might require many more resources and boots-on-the-ground than the Trump administration is prepared to put in harm's way.

My life as a hostage of al-Qaeda," It is a clear cold night in the Sahara desert and Stephen McGown lies on his back gazing up at the stars. Pulling his blanket under his chin he traces out the constellations he learned as a boy in South Africa. “What a holiday of a lifetime this would be,” he thinks, “if I wasn't a hostage of al-Qaeda.” It is early 2017 and the London banker’s fifth year in captivity. He is the only one in the camp who prefers to sleep outside even in winter. But despite living in a vast open space, his life has become “very small and routine”. (Credit: Al Jazeera) Each day Stephen rises before the sun for the Islamic dawn prayer, which he performs kneeling in the sand alongside a fellow hostage, Johan, and their jihadist kidnappers. A breakfast of bread and powdered milk follows, after which the hostages either go back to sleep or exercise. “We were free to move around an area the size of Twickenham Stadium,” Stephen recalls. But if you went too far you'd be reprimanded and the friendly faces would become very stern.” Lunch is spaghetti or rice, stored in giant camouflaged bins and served with meat - goat, sheep or camel. The hostages often cook this for themselves on wood fires as the jihadists prefer their food “swimming in cooking oil”. “The mujahideen would also kill and eat anything that wandered past our camp,” Stephen says. “Once a tortoise came by and they asked me if I would slaughter it. But you had to poke it with sticks to make its head come out. I found it too cruel and let it crawl away.” The hostages spend the hottest part of the day inside their huts resting, and learning and reciting the Koran. “I would often recite in my hut because if I recited around the jihadists they would laugh, as I couldn't get the Arabic sounds quite right,"" Stephen says. “When visitors came they would ask how you were, and then they would always ask, ‘How is the memorising going?’” Later on Stephen gets to work improving hisaabuugi- a hut he has built from broken tree branches. With little else to concentrate on, he is obsessive about the smallest details. “I'd test whether it was better to have higher or lower ventilation, with or without grass in the doorway and try different ways of reducing the glare off the sand,” he says. In the evening everyone unwinds and Stephen makes an effort to socialise with his captors. “They would make tea and watch al-Qaeda videos or sometimes listen to French radio. There were times when I needed my space though. I got tired of them horsing around and joking about death and beheadings.” He goes to bed after the final ritual prayer of the day. “I'd think about my family - whether they were still waiting for me and if they were alive.” Five years earlier, Stephen and his wife Catherine had been packing up their flat in Putney for their move back to Johannesburg. The couple had met in 2006 after moving in to the same shared house in London. Stephen was doing contract work in the City while Catherine was a children’s speech therapist working for the National Health Service. At Catherine's insistence, Stephen moved out while they were dating. They married a year later. Stephen and Catherine loved their time in the UK. “We had a big group of friends,"" Stephen says. “We’d head in to the countryside at weekends and cycle across the South Downs, stopping at a pub midway."" Stephen would also hop on his prized motorbike, taking a fly rod to go fishing in Surrey. But in 2011 the couple decided to head back to South Africa, where they had both grown up. Now in their early thirties, they were ready to settle down and start a family. Stephen also wanted to set up a business exporting jojoba oil from his father’s farm. But while Catherine planned to fly home, Stephen would ride his motorbike through Europe and Africa on a “last big adventure”. Stephen with his mother, Beverley, in London The idea had come to him after watching Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman’s travel documentary, Long Way Down, on the BBC. Cath said I could take six months - but no longer - for my trip.” He left the UK on 11 October 2011 and travelled through France and Spain to Gibraltar where he crossed to Morocco. He then pushed down to Mauritania before heading east into Mali on 9 November. For much of the route he rode with a Dutch motorcyclist called Fokke, although they would separate occasionally if Stephen stopped off to do some birdwatching. After picking up visas in the capital Bamako, the pair planned to continue south to Burkina Faso but decided at the last minute to take a detour and join some tourists heading to Timbuktu. “It was a little off my route but I figured I could go up, get a photo of it and carry on,” Stephen says. Stephen in Mali He arrived in the ancient trading city a day ahead of Fokke, whose bike had broken down en route. Stephen then checked into a cheap traveller’s hotel with Sjaak and Tilly Rijke, a Dutch couple he had met in Morocco. They were joined by a Swedish tourist called Johan Gustafsson and a German traveller called Martin. On 25 November the tourists got up early and went for a walk around Timbuktu. The sun was out and they enjoyed visiting the market and having lunch before returning to the hotel. Stephen was relaxing out on the patio when a group of men rushed through the gate. One guy was waving a pistol and another stayed at the entrance with a Kalashnikov. I thought it might be police.” In the confusion Stephen heard Tilly shout for everyone to get on the floor and under the table. He found himself being dragged out towards a car behind Sjaak and Johan and forced to lie underneath a net. “The German gentleman was putting up a bit of a fight. Then I heard gunshots from the back of the car,” Stephen says. “I told the other guys, ‘I think they’ve killed Martin.’” Malcolm McGown was relaxing at home in Johannesburg when the phone rang. He was half expecting to hear his son's voice. “He had Skyped us a few days earlier from Mali,” Malcolm says. Malcolm McGown “I remember him saying, ‘Dad, I’m not looking to be a hero. If anything looks too dangerous I’ll be on the next flight home.’” But instead it was a Dutch woman calling from the Netherlands, Fokke's mother. “She asked me if I was Stephen’s father. Then she told me he had been taken by al-Qaeda,” Malcolm says. “I was in shock. I wasn’t sure what to do."" After breaking the news to his wife, Beverley, Malcolm rang a few government departments he found in the phone book. ""I got no response. In the end I rang a radio station and asked them for a government phone number,"" he says. Malcolm then rang his daughter who was staying in London with Stephen's wife, Catherine. “I didn’t sleep much in the first few days,” Catherine says. “It was frantic but I was very hopeful. I thought it would be only a few weeks before I saw Steve again. My mind couldn’t get around the concept he would be apart from me for longer than a few months.” A still from the first hostage video released by al-Qaeda Back in Mali, Stephen was bumping along a rough desert road. “Our car had met up with some others and headed north for maybe 15 hours,” Stephen says. The three hostages had been forced to lie down in the car. Stephen got a bloody eye from bouncing against the wheel arch while Sjaak bruised his ribs. Sjaak’s wife Tilly wasn’t with them. She had managed to escape detection by hiding in a tent on top of a van at the hostel. “The journey didn’t feel real,” Stephen says. “I’ve got dual nationality and when I realised I had my British passport in my pocket my blood ran cold. I knew what had happened to other British hostages in the past.” Stephen, Sjaak and Johan were let out somewhere in the Sahara desert in northern Mali. They were told they had been kidnapped by the Islamic militant organisation, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Members of al-Qaeda in northern Mali (Photo: Al Jazeera) The group had grown out of Islamic groups fighting the Algerian government in the 1990s. It had taken to kidnapping Western citizens in northern Africa and exchanging them for Islamist prisoners or money. “We were told in very bad English that they wouldn’t kill us. But maybe they were telling us that because then we wouldn’t make problems and do what they wanted. We were petrified but also slightly numb,” Stephen says. That first evening they slaughtered an animal in front of us and I remember thinking, ‘Yep that’s going to be me.’” When the kidnappers came across Stephen’s British passport they began praying and bowing down in the sand. “They were very pleased and excited. I explained I was South African and had been born and educated there, but they kept referring to me as British, which scared me.” The three hostages were guarded by about 17 jihadists who carried weapons including Kalashnikovs and hand grenades. A member of the al-Qaeda group holding the hostages (Photo: Al Jazeera) They had to ask to go to the toilet and were chained up in the evenings. Every two weeks, when they were moved between camps, they were blindfolded. In the early weeks they discussed whether they thought they would live or die, where they might be, and the potential for escape. “Sometimes one of us would say, ‘I’m going to escape.’ But then we’d talk about how it would put the others in danger, how we didn’t speak the language or know where to find water,” Stephen says. While Johan thought negotiations might take years, Stephen and Sjaak were both more optimistic. So was Stephen’s father, Malcolm, who had met the South African police colonel with responsibility for hostages. “It is possible to get hostages out quickly and we were looking at Stephen coming out in February or March 2012,” Malcolm says. “Then there was a coup in Mali and all bets were off.” In March 2012 the elected government of Mali was overthrown. Simultaneously, ethnic Tuaregs took control of northern towns and cities. Power was then wrested from them by jihadist groups including al-Qaeda. The chaos meant the link with the kidnappers was lost and Stephen’s family could only wait as months passed with no word about the hostages. Then in July a video showing Stephen and Johan was posted on YouTube. They had long beards and each was holding an A4 manila envelope. Behind them stood four masked, heavily-armed men. “Today I received this letter from my country. I am healthy and they are treating me well,” Stephen says in the video. The letter had been written by his family but he never got to read it. It was whisked away as soon as the cameras were turned off. ""I felt I had lied on camera,"" he says. The hostages would go on to make at least 15 videos, although only a handful reached the outside world. “A guy would arrive and tell us how negotiations were doing. Then he’d tell us to ask certain people to help and thank other people,” Stephen says. Stephen (centre) in a hostage video Stephen made a conscious decision to build a relationship with his captors. “Although they would come and go, some would die and some would be recruited, I would see many of them over and over again,” he says. I decided I didn’t want to go into the Sahara as a fairly balanced person and come out as a wreck who was angry and hated people.” This was one reason why he decided to convert to Islam six months into his captivity. “I was also Christian and a lot of the stories in Islam are the same. Religion gave me stability in the desert,” he says. Sjaak and Johan also converted and they all noticed an immediate improvement in their treatment. They would pray and eat alongside their captors, who also taught them some classical Arabic to help them understand the Koran. “I would mostly learn it by pointing at things and memorising words and there would also be hand signals and drawing in the sand,” he says. They were never taught the Hassaniya dialect, which the kidnappers spoke to each other. The next time a letter arrived from home Stephen was allowed to read it. “It was really feel good stuff. My mum wrote how someone had come around to fix my bike and that everyone sent their love,"" he says. ""My wife told me she had gone to a wedding of some friends of ours and joined a running club. She said they were doing all they could to get us released.” Armed Islamists in Gao in September 2012 In January 2013 French troops entered Mali in response to an appeal from the Malian president. They rapidly recaptured Gao and Timbuktu. This was Stephen’s “darkest hour”, a time when he believed he would never be released. He thought few governments would consider negotiating with al-Qaeda while they were fighting Western forces in Mali. No-one was going to pay money for me as that meant more money for the mujahideen.” The hostages were now being moved weekly by al-Qaeda and Johan decided to try and escape. “I thought he was crazy. He didn’t seem to understand Africa and the distances involved. They brought him back the next day,” Stephen says. Johan in a hostage video Stephen and Sjaak were accused of conspiring with Johan. Despite their denials, all three had their few personal items, including a French dictionary, letters from home and medication taken away. “I was furious as Johan was the only one of us three who later got his stuff back."" A year later Sjaak was separated from Stephen and Johan with no explanation. “A guy came into a hut we were sitting in and told Sjaak to pack his bags,” Stephen says. The guards wouldn’t reveal where he was taken but they understood he was still in the country. Stephen kept going by refusing to believe the frequent claims by his captors that he would soon be released. “You get excited. Then you realise something has gone wrong and you hit rock bottom,” he says. “At the start I’d think, ‘Well I have to be out for my mum’s birthday.’ This changed to thinking, ‘In five years’ time I’ll be sitting at home.’ I couldn’t take things day by day or month by month.” Stephen and Catherine on holiday Stephen worried that his family would forget about him and his wife would move on. ""I wanted the best for Catherine. We were at the age where we wanted children, and there’s a window,"" he says. “I didn’t want to limit her life and decided if she met another guy I’d have to accept it. I almost expected it to happen.” Now living in Johannesburg, Catherine was doing her best to keep going. “I was starting a speech therapy practice from scratch and this helped me focus on something. It kept me very busy and I got to meet lovely families through my work,” she says. She limited the time she allowed herself to think about her past with Stephen and avoided looking at holiday photos. Catherine in Johannesburg She also took up running to cope with the stress and relied on support from her mother and sister and Stephen’s parents. “I was able to cling on to a thin thread of hope even though the situation appeared dismal,” she says. Meanwhile Stephen’s father was trying to drive forward the negotiations about his son’s release. “The government were involved but it was cloak and dagger stuff,” Malcolm says. Stephen's bike was shipped back to South Africa after his kidnap He decided that they needed an independent negotiator but made some “bad turns” trying to find one. “We paid out money to men who claimed to be influential and have good access when they didn’t,” he says. “One even claimed he knew someone in the Red Crescent who had spoken to our son but they needed more money. I said I would pay if they could give me the name of my son’s dog. That tripped them up.” Then Malcolm came across a charity called Gift of the Givers, which had successfully negotiated with al-Qaeda in Yemen for the release of the South African, Yolande Korkie. He approached the charity’s founder, Dr Imtiaz Sooliman, on behalf of his son. Sooliman agreed to help. His first attempt to negotiate via the charity’s office in Mauritania was unsuccessful, but he was heartened when al-Qaeda released another proof-of-life video of Stephen in June 2015. Dr Imtiaz Sooliman, the founder of Gift of the Givers “The video was telling me the captors wanted to talk,” Sooliman says. He made a radio appeal in South Africa for a Malian who could act as a negotiator on the ground. A man called Mohamed Ehie Dicko responded and a month later he was sent to Mali. “I told him to make his presence and purpose known all over Mali,” Sooliman says. Within a week Dicko was contacted by someone who said he’d “come to the right door”. Stephen (right) and Johan pictured in a hostage video released in 2015 “It’s a long process that takes time. Messages are passed from person to person along a chain, not via phone or email,” Sooliman says. In November 2015 a new video was released in which Stephen thanked the charity for working for his release. “To my wife and my family, I am well and I hope you are all well back home. I understand I may be seeing you soon. I believe there is a South African organisation brokering the release,” he said in the video. Stephen was actually far from well. He had lost 15kg (2st 4lb) and says his muscles had atrophied making him look like an 80-year-old man. “I was getting joint problems and my legs had weakened. One day my knee just fell out of place and I had to push it back in,” he says. After receiving the new video, Sooliman launched a charm offensive aimed at people living near the al-Qaeda camps in northern Mali. The charity started buying cattle for the communities as well as providing food and digging wells. Eventually the community leaders agreed to speak to al-Qaeda about releasing the hostages. Then negotiations stalled again. “The elders were convinced but the youngsters in al-Qaeda said it couldn’t be allowed because it would set a precedent,” Sooliman says. Malcolm continued to fight for Stephen’s release. At the same time he was caring for his wife, who had a serious lung disease. She was now on oxygen around the clock. “It was tough but I looked after her the best I could,” Malcolm says. He delivered a letter to the South African President, Jacob Zuma, outlining their case and his wife’s ill health and pleading for his assistance. “I think he read it and realised they had to do something to get him out,” Malcolm says. In December 2016 Stephen received a letter in the desert from the South African government. “The mujahideen were very excited about this letter arriving and wanted to know what it said,” Stephen says. The letter informed Stephen his mother was very ill and the government was asking al-Qaeda to release him on compassionate grounds. The captors seemed disappointed by the news. Then in June 2017 Stephen was told, after a day of fasting, that Johan was no longer in the camp. He had been freed. Johan speaks to the press after his release in June 2017 “I was happy as it showed negotiation could take place and people could be released,” Stephen says. A year earlier he and Johan had heard a rumour that Sjaak had been freed by French soldiers. This meant Stephen was the last in captivity. Sjaak with a Malian minister after he was freed by French forces Then in July he was told he too would be freed. “I didn’t believe it. I asked them what the chances were and they said 60%. I thought, ‘Well I’ve heard 90% and that’s failed,’” Stephen says. But a few days later he was taken on a two-and-a-half-day car journey across the Sahara. Eventually the car came to a halt on a tarmac road just short of Gao. “My driver turned to me and said, ‘You are free, you can go,’” Stephen later told a press conference. Stephen assumed the driver was joking. “He said, ‘Well if you don’t believe me you can walk, you can go.’ And I thought, ‘Maybe he’s not just pulling my leg.’” Another car arrived and Stephen moved from one to the other. It was at this point he realised he was free. “It was quite a moment. It was difficult to comprehend as there had been so many ups and downs over the past five-and-a-half years.” Stephen returned to Johannesburg on 29 July 2017 following a medical check-up and a debriefing. He wasn’t allowed to speak to his family on his journey home and started to worry about what he would find there. “I asked the guys with me, ‘Am I going home to a train wreck?’ and the response was ‘Wow, wasn’t the dessert lovely,” he says. When he was 10 minutes from home he was told his mother had died just two months earlier, an experience he describes as “surreal”. It didn’t make sense to me. I remember thinking, ‘What should I be feeling now? Should I be in tears?’” Although he had been free for a few days, his father and wife were only told about his release an hour before he arrived home. “I saw my dad first from the car. My eyes filled up with tears and I just cried. It was just amazing, I couldn’t believe it,” Stephen says. Stephen and Malcolm on the day he arrived home ""It was just wonderful. I put my arms around him and he felt rock solid,” Malcolm says. Stephen then went into the house where Catherine had been packing a bag of clothes to take to him at the airport. “She came running in not realising I was already there, speaking a million miles per hour about how she had my bag,"" Stephen says. And then she covered her face with her hands and curled over and cried.” “She was looking so beautiful and it took me by surprise. It was so good to see her.” “He looked very different, but he had the same big smile,” Catherine says. “His hair was long and curly which was not what I had imagined, and he was wearing desert gear, which threw me a bit.” Stephen with his father (centre) and Dr Sooliman (right) Catherine rang Sooliman to let him know Stephen was home.“I was ecstatic as I saw the suffering the family had gone through over the past years,” he says. Stephen isn’t sure why he was freed but is aware the New York Times reported there was a $4.2m (£3m) payout from the South African government. South African officials strongly deny the claim. Whatever happened, Stephen says he is incredibly grateful to everyone who worked for his release. He says his challenge now is to work out how to return to his former life. “I see my dad, my wife and my sis and it’s like we saw each other yesterday, but there’s a big black hole of six years,” he says. I feel uncertain and it’s hard to understand what my place is now.” He has faced practical difficulties, from unlocking old bank accounts to getting medical treatment for his back and sun-damaged eyes. But it’s the psychological fallout that has taken him by surprise. His initial euphoria at being released has been replaced by a “whirlpool of thoughts and emotions,” which he hopes will settle down in time. Stephen speaks to the media after his release Stephen believes he is now in “coping mode” and describes experiencing “a grey mush” rather than typical highs and lows. He is struggling with “information overload” after his years in the desert, and finds it tricky to connect to other people. “It’s difficult to shoot the breeze. For my friends small talk is, ‘Isn’t that great coffee?’ For me it would be, ‘That was one hell of a sandstorm last night,’” he says. His English is also a little rusty. “It’s hard to find the right words,” he says. Despite his worries, his wife says he is in essence the same person. “He still makes me laugh, which I love,” she says. Catherine and Stephen on a recent visit to the South African coast Stephen says he appreciates everyday things more, such as going inside during a thunderstorm, or taking refuge in the shade of trees when it’s hot. He is keen to make up for missed time and has already met a niece and nephew born while he was in Mali. When they sleep they are so peaceful and untarnished. It’s a beauty I haven’t seen in so long.” He plans to go on cycling trips with his father. “I want to get him up and riding as it will be good for his health,” Stephen says. “He’s had to juggle his business, my mother’s illness and my kidnapping yet he’s the most positive guy. He is an unbelievable role model.” When he was in the desert Stephen was determined not to become a “shell” of a person, a goal he has carried back to South Africa. “I don’t want to get thick-skinned,"" he says. “I’m more understanding and compassionate now if people have problems. ""I hope I don't stomp my way through life and not see what’s around me.” Built with Shorthand"
Roger Lockyer: The historian who made LGBT history,"This video can not be played Roger Lockyer: The historian who made LGBT history When Roger Lockyer met his future husband Percy Steven on a blind date in 1966, their relationship made them criminals in the eyes of British law. By the time the distinguished academic and author, a reader at Royal Holloway and Bedford Universities of London, died shortly before his 90th birthday, the pair lived as a legally married couple - having tied the knot in 2014. Their remarkable journey drew worldwide press attention, when, in 2005,they became one of the first couples,externalto enter into a UK civil partnership. Invites to Downing Street followed. Together for 51 years, they proudly marched in this year's Pride in London parade waving rainbow flags. However, this was never the plan. Historians usually document history - they rarely walk into the pages themselves. The couple had lived a quiet, cultured existence in an elegant flat in Marylebone, central London, until the modern era of LGBT rights came knocking and propelled them into the limelight. Pictures of the pair in sharp suits saying their civil partnership vows, and later popping a magnum of champagne on the steps of the Westminster register office, appeared on TVs and in newspapers across Europe, the US and Canada. Roger Lockyer (R) with Percy Steven at Pride in London 2017 Eager journalists clamoured for their attention, aware of the rarity of their find; a couple whose relationship was unique, not just for its wit, passion and longevity, but also because it had survived half a century of seismic change in legal and social attitudes towards sexuality. Roger later remarked: ""We had these cameras following us down the street and neighbours leant out of windows to wave us off. Friends spotted us on television in France and Germany. ""After Elton John, we felt like the most famous gay men in the world."" They went on to feature in multiple interviews, including theBBC's recent docudrama Against the Law, marking the 50th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, which partially decriminalised homosexuality in England and Wales. Born in London in 1927, Roger completed National Service in the Royal Navy before reading history at Pembroke College, University of Cambridge. He graduated with first-class honours, beginning an eminent career as an academic and author of nearly a dozen books on 15th and 16th Century history. His seminal volume Tudor and Stuart Britain, first published in 1964, remains a core text for many undergraduates in the UK. But Roger's private and professional lives remained separate by necessity. Roger (L) celebrates his civil partnership with Percy on the steps of Westminster register office in 2005 His stories of escapades as a young gay man in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s were as mischievous and comic as they were a window into an often hostile world, where as second-class citizens homosexual men had to tread carefully on the edges of society. National Service was ""fantastic"" because it was filled with so many gay men. Cambridge was equally ""very, very gay"", causing one heterosexual undergraduate to complain to him, through tears, that there was ""something wrong with him"" because he was attracted to women. ""I think you'll be alright Douglas,"" Prof Lockyer replied drily. But those social bubbles did not conceal the potential danger of living in a country where men convicted of a being in a same-sex relationship risked jail, loss of their livelihoods, or even death. Prof Lockyer, who once quipped that the passing of the 1967 act of parliament ""took the fun out of breaking the law"", equally emphasised its brutal impact. ""It was exciting in a way and almost an adventure. But looking back at it now one realises that potentially it could be awful. ""We know people who were sent to prison and their careers ruined. ""The friend who introduced us was killed and his murder was never solved. It was a deeply unpleasant society."" Roger Lockyer in his younger years Despite the dangers, a vibrant, closely guarded, gay community bubbled under the surface. ""There was this semi-secret, sub-rosa network of gay clubs we would go to,"" Prof Lockyer explained. One bar-hopping friend and ex-lover was Jeremy Wolfenden, the gay son of Lord Wolfenden, whose radical report controversially recommended decriminalising homosexuality in 1957. ""Places like the Rockingham in Soho... was for well-to-do, sophisticated people - it had its own writing paper. ""You had to give your name at the door and I said: 'Jeremy, aren't you a little worried that you give your name 'Wolfenden'? ""He said: 'Oh don't worry my dear I always give your name.' ""So I'm recorded as having a much busier social life when it was in fact Jeremy capering about town while his father made these important recommendations to the government about 'queers'."" Percy with Roger (R) on their wedding day in 2014 The historian met his future husband Percy Steven, a South African-born actor and lecturer, now 78, on that blind-date in London. The meeting was an initial ""disaster"" but Roger, wilting daffodils in hand, had already fallen in love. He said: ""The moment I set eyes on Percy I knew that even though he was being horrid, he was the person I was going to spend the rest of my life with, so I persisted."" ""And I gave in!"" Percy replied cheerfully. For many gay men of their generation, the changes to the law that made them recognised spouses - thereby ensuring the right not to be kicked out of hospital rooms if they were ill, or lose their home due to unfair tax laws when one of them died - came too late. Roger and Percy's shot to fame late in life came as a pleasant surprise and they embraced opportunities to be as visible as they had previously been secretive. They also enjoyed plenty of glasses of champagne. On the night he died, with Percy by his side, Roger's appearance in BBC docudrama Against the Law received a standing ovation at the Barcelona International LGBT Festival. Roger and Percy enjoyed celebrating at Pride in London 2017 Speaking to the BBC in 2015, he said: ""I think that particularly being a historianâ¦ people do know a bit about their own history and what others went through and it makes for a richer and fuller life if they do. ""I remember distinctly walking down the street after the ceremony thinking: 'I am as legal a person as anybody else. I am a full citizen at last.' It was a wonderful feeling."" Professor Roger Lockyer, historian, author and activist, was born on November 27, 1927. He died on October 28, 2017 aged 89. He leaves his husband Percy Steven and a niece.

Review: Alias Grace on Netflix âââââ,"Stranger Things. Riverdale. 13 Reasons Why. Netflix certainly hasn't been short of gripping dramas this year. But is their latest one, released this weekend, up to the same standard? Will Gompertz finds out. Margaret Atwood's books have been catnip for TV producers in 2017. First there was the sublime Handmaid's Tale on Hulu, then Wandering Wenda on CBC, and now Sarah Polley's small screen adaptation of Alias Grace for Netflix, directed by Mary Harron. We're in dense, complex territory with this one. Alias Grace is one of those multi-layered, deeply textured stories that keep English professors in business. There's symbolism aplenty, psychological game playing, shaggy dog stories, and a couple of contested Murders Most Horrid on which a lecturer can chew semester after semester. And that's before we get onto the main narrator, the eponymous Grace Marks, who is about as reliable as a 4G phone signal in rural Ireland (which also happens to be where her life started). Not that she had a smartphone - we're in mid-19th Century here. Sarah Gadon stars as Grace Marks in Alias Grace The set-up is as clear as her story is opaque. We meet Grace in her early thirties. For the past 15 years she has been an inmate at a penitentiary in Canada having been found guilty of taking part in a double killing. She is a ""celebrated murderess"", which she considers a notch up from being simply a celebrated murderer. The vibe is gothic psychodrama - think Twin Peaks meets Jane Eyre. Grace tells us her tale through a series of fireside chats she has with Dr Simon Jordan. He is a young, earnest psychiatrist hired by the local worthies (led by Reverend Verringer, played by a mutton-chopped David Cronenberg) to produce a favourable assessment of Grace's mental state so she can be pardoned and set free. He is a decent man (up to a point), but boring. He is played with great restraint by Edward Holcroft who succeeds in communicating Jordan's intensity and professionalism in a performance so dialled down you fear he might nod off between sentences. Edward Holcroft, Rebecca Liddiard and Kerr Logan (pictured) also star in the show Not so the inscrutable Grace, played with assurance as both a naÃ¯ve teenager and marked woman by Sarah Gadon. She has the focus of a look-out on a street corner, playing mind games with her inquisitor whom she effortlessly wraps around her fingers like the thread she uses to endlessly stitch together quilts. To be honest, she does bang on a bit, but then who can blame her when the alternative is a beating at the hands of the brutal prison guards who ""take pleasure in the distress of a fellow mortal"". And so, over the course of six slow-burn episodes, we hear how a quiet Irish girl found herself locked up behind bars in a brutal prison in Canada. Predatory men play a part, which is very topical of course, but only because some things never change. As one female servant notes after the death of a jilted housemaid following a back-street abortion: ""It is the curse of Eve we [women] must all bear."" Anna Paquin and Paul Gross as Nancy Montgomery and Thomas Kinnear Sarah Polley's script of Atwood's masterful book is not so much a literal adaptation, as a literary one. I hope she was paid by the word, for she uses many (as one of her characters might say). Which is fine, it works, but there were moments when I wondered what exactly the show was adding by taking the text from page to screen. But that would be to discount Mary Harron's painterly eye and the tonal harmony she creates in each scene, which is an added bonus. As the show progresses you realise that Grace's predicament is not really the story at all. She is the story. This is a portrait of a young woman who has a lot in common with Shakespeare's Ophelia or Tennyson's Lady of Shalott: A tortured soul whose outer beauty becomes sublime because of - not despite of - her tragic circumstances. Alias Grace dropped on Netflix on Friday morning Rebecca Liddiard is terrific as Grace's mischievous mate Mary Whitney. She puts in the sort of screen-grabbing turn that suggests stardom is but a role or two away. Zachary Levi also delivers an eye-catching performance as Jeremiah Pontelli, a travelling salesman with a shaman's soul. Alias Grace is a solid, well-made piece of television that doesn't hide its intelligence under a bonnet, as costume dramas can do. Nor does it attempt to keep your attention with soap opera style cliff-hangers. It is better than that. But is it better than simply reading the book? I'm not so sure.

The secret of Teen Vogue's success,"Millie Bobby Brown (from Netflix's Stranger Things) was a recent cover star Clicks don't lie. And Teen Vogue gets a lot of them. A highly-successful website. Six million Facebook likes. A huge following on Snapchat. Three and a half million Twitter followers. There's no doubt Teen Vogue's digital game is strong. The quarterly print magazine, however, hasn't been having quite the same impact recently. So they're closing it. Parent company Conde Nast is planning to focus on Teen Vogue's digital content instead - which has been going from strength to strength. The brand has increased its political coverage and social activism in recent years while still delivering its entertainment, fashion and beauty content. A visit to Teen Vogue'swebsite,externalgives you some idea about why the formula has been so successful. (Warning: Doing this can make you lose hours from your day). Its headlines are light and relatable, with many written in the first person. ""Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber Just Cuddled in Coordinating Outfits."" ""Cats Can Get Acne Too and Now I Feel Less Alone."" ""Dove Cameron Freaked Out Over Pink Dressing as Her for Halloween and Honestly Same."" ""Louis Tomlinson Savagely Trolled Niall Horan and I Can't Stop Laughing."" While the above headlines, all from this week, might make zero sense to anyone outside the target audience, they do a great job of making many of us go 'Ooh that sounds interesting' - *click*. ""They've got a fantastic product and content,"" says Sarah Penny,Fashion Monitor,external's head of content. ""For the demographic they are targeting, they really push the boundaries and provide something new that isn't just celebrity, fashion and beauty for teens."" But, she adds: ""They're also not ones to sit on the fence - you only have to look at any of their Trump commentary."" ""They really came into their own during the election and the fact that they provide accessible current affairs for a young audience is really pioneering and exciting for a teen magazine, which in turn is alluring for their target audience."" This might explain the social media reaction to the news that the print magazine was closing: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

We contacted Teen Vogue, who stressed the growth and expansion of the digital brand, adding that they'll likely still do the occasional print special. ""Though the quarterly print editions will cease publishing on a regular schedule, we will explore re-imagined special issues timed to specific moments, as we do in social,"" a spokesman told BBC News. ""As audiences continue to evolve around content consumption, we will modernise and calibrate how, where and when we produce and distribute our content to be in sync with the cultural moments and platforms most important to our audiences."" The closure of the print edition is likely to result in up to 80 job losses, according toVariety,external, and it's not the only changes Conde Nast announced this week. Some of their other titles like GQ, Allure and Glamour will drop from 12 to 11 print issues per year. Glamour has also announced this month that it will be going online only Teen Vogue's move to an exclusively online product follows in the footsteps of the British version of Glamour, which did the same thingearlier this year. ""Conde Nast is doing all of a sudden and dramatically what most major magazine publishers have been doing steadily and quietly for the last 10 years - cutting their cost base to match their reduced revenues,"" says David Hepworth, whose magazine career has included editing Smash Hits and launching Just Seventeen, Q, Empire and Heat. But, he cautions: ""There are very few cases of magazines going digital-only and managing to retain the lustre on their brand. Once you let paper go you're just another website. You're just more space junk floating around out there."" (The term 'space junk' definitely isn't used enough these days is it.) Teen Vogue has seen its online operation grow under Philip Picardi, who joined as digital editorial director in 2015. Katy Perry and Ariana Grande have both appeared on the cover of Teen Vogue ""Because of the amount of attention we've received in the press and I think on social, we are looked at as a brand that is safe to pitch for, if you have a story that's not been told before,"" Picardi toldBusiness of Fashion,externalthis month about the brand's digital success. ""Now we feel empowered to be more activist and be bolder about the statements that we're making and the stances that we're taking. And so that's a completely different ballpark to be playing in."" And bolder they have been. Teen Vogue, as BoF points out, has been taking strong stances on politics, LGBTQ issues, the gender pay gap and birth control. Pretty good for a publication that was once dismissed has having little to offer beyond mascara reviews. But while its digital operation is growing, Hepworth thinks Conde Nast may end up regretting closing the physical edition. ""All this talk about migrating from print to digital ignores the monetary facts,"" he says. ""Unless you've come up with a fundamentally different way of doing business - and the fact that this announcement comes so suddenly suggests Conde Nast haven't and are just hoping - you're exchanging pounds for pennies. Teen Vogue's content has become much more political in recent years ""If you give something away, the only revenue you make is from advertising and the value of online advertising has been falling for years."" He advises Teen Vogue readers: ""Remember, if you pay for something, you're the customer. If you get something for free you're the product."" Penny thinks, though, that there was only so much money that could be made from print anyway, and points out the decline in physical sales of magazines in general. ""Print is a very difficult medium to sustain, particularly within this Generation-Z readership,"" she says. ""They're really the first demographic to have grown up with a digital presence from birth so naturally have an incredibly strong affinity with online consumption - even more so than millennials."" Teen Vogue say they are ""aggressively investing in the brand"" and pointed to the ""tremendous audience growth across its digital, social and video platforms this past year"". Conde Nast will be hoping they can keep that momentum going in the coming months. Provided readers of the print magazine are okay with swapping pages for clicks, the chances are Teen Vogue should be just fine.

Dead rabbit 'link to Croydon cat killer',"The mutilated body of lionhead rabbit Teddy was left in its hutch for its owner to find The mutilation and death of a pet rabbit could be the latest work of the ""Croydon cat killer"", it is claimed. The dismembered body of rabbit Teddy was found by his owner in his cage in her garden in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. Animal charity Snarl, which is investigating hundreds of violent UK cat and rabbit deaths, said it thought the pet fell victim to the same killer. Hertfordshire Police said officers were examining whether the death was linked to the wider inquiry. The rabbit's owner, who wanted to remain anonymous, said it was ""beyond comprehension"" that ""someone, somehow, climbed into our high-walled garden, killed and mutilated him and left him next to my daughter's little pink Wendy house for us to find"". The cat killer stalking suburbia The lionhead rabbit, whose body was found on Tuesday, was ""one of a kind, truly special"", she added. Teddy's owner has urged people to keep their pets indoors Charity Snarl (South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty) said it was ""currently investigating what seems to be a spate of attacks across the south east on cats and rabbits"". Last week, the Hertfordshire force confirmed officers werelinking the death of a cat in Potter's Barto the ""Croydon cat killer"". The mutilated body of Taz was found by his owner her Potter's Bar garden Taz's injuries were consistent with those of other mutilated cats and small animals found across the UK, leading the force to believe the deaths are linked. The Met Police began investigatinga series of ""gruesome"" killingswhich initially began in the Croydon area in 2015, after Snarl raised concerns. The suspect became known as the ""Croydon cat killer"". Tony Jenkins, head of Snarl, said about 250 cats and a number of foxes and rabbits had been killed in similar circumstances since October 2015. He believes the same person - referred to by the charity as the ""UK animal killer"" - is responsible for all the deaths. Rusty, a one-year-old cat, was deliberately mutilated and left on the doorstep of its Northampton owner's home in August ""We see no evidence there's anyone else involved as the injuries are being replicated,"" he said. ""It is possible - both geographically and because of the timings - for one person to be doing this. ""This person is a very clever psychopath, he is forensically aware, avoids CCTV and might well travel as part of his job. ""It is most likely Teddy was killed by this same person."" The Met launched Operation Takahe to investigate the links between animal deaths and last month experts at anew forensic lab in Surrey began re-examining some of the corpsesfor new evidence.

Drug arrest for British woman in Egypt,"Laura Plummer was reportedly arrested after flying into Cairo with hundreds of painkiller pills A British woman has been arrested in Egypt and accused of drug trafficking. Laura Plummer, from Hull, was arrested after flying into Cairo with nearly 300 tramadol tablets and some Naproxen in her suitcase,the Sun reported,external. Her family told the paper she brought the painkillers for her Egyptian husband, who she visits two to four times a year and who has a bad back. The Foreign Office said it was supporting a British woman and her family after her detention in Egypt. Family members told the Sun that Miss Plummer, 33, signed a 38-page statement in Arabic thinking it would lead to her release, but instead she has been kept in a cell with 25 other women for nearly a month. They also say they have been told she could face up to 25 years in prison, or even the death penalty. Miss Plummer's brother, James, 31, told the Press Association his sister thought she was doing a ""good deed"" by bringing the medication over to her husband. Mr Plummer said his mother and sisters had travelled to Egypt to visit Miss Plummer following her arrest on 9 October, adding: ""They say she's unrecognisable. When they seen her, she's like a zombie, they said."" Mr Plummer said the family feel ""helpless"" due to being in a different country. He said his sister's hair was starting to fall out due to stress. ""I don't think she's tough enough to survive it,"" he added. ""She has a phobia of using anybody else's toilet, so let alone sharing a toilet and a floor with everybody else. ""That will be awful for her, it'll be traumatising.""

Man charged after Tube train hit passenger,"A man has appeared in court charged with the attempted murder of a London Underground passenger who was allegedly pushed into the path of a train. The victim was seriously injured when a District Line train struck him at Bayswater station during the evening rush hour on Thursday. Alan Alencar is alleged to have shoved him in the back as the Tube train pulled into the central London station. Mr Alencar, 29, of Edinburgh, was remanded into custody. At Westminster Magistrates' Court, District Judge Tan Ikram ordered Mr Alencar, of Northcote Street, to appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on 1 December. The judge said there had been no bail application. The victim, aged in his 50s, managed to crawl out from underneath the carriage and was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries.

Persuading would-be migrants to stay at home,"Hassan Odjo says he is happy to be back in Senegal It is 10 o'clock at night, and outside the arrivals hall of Dakar's main airport, two Senegalese men are taking a moment to get used to their freedom. Hassan Odjo, 42 and Issa Ba, 23 have just stepped off a flight from Libya, where they had been trapped for months. ""I was praying every day to Allah to give me the chance to come home,"" says Hassan, a huge smile spread across his face. ""I saw people dying in front of my eyes. Every day I was praying to be back in my country. Today is the happiest day for me, it's like it's my birthday."" Both Hassan and Issa have returned home under a voluntary repatriation programme run by theInternational Organization for Migration (IOM),external. They had travelled through Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and ended up in Libya - where they became trapped, unable to go further. Hassan had attempted to cross the Mediterranean, but after his boat got into trouble he was picked up by local militia and held in detention. It can be hard for some to come back and say they failed to get to Europe, says Seydine Ken Hassan tells me of the suffering facing economic migrants in Libya, and describes being held in a room with 300 people, being given only bread twice a day, and bad water. ""When they catch you they lock you in prison, beat you or maltreat you, ask you to call your parents to send money."" In Libya detaining migrants has become a business in itself, he says. ""They are selling black people like coffee, like a cup of coffee. Yes I'm telling you the truth!"" Listen to Marie Keyworth's report from Senegal on BBC World Service's Business Daily Faced with this reality, it isn't surprising that more migrants are opting to return home. The International Organisation for Migration has access to the Libyan detention centres, and works with national consulates to offer people the choice to get out. So far this year, the IOM in Senegal alone has helped more than 2,000 people return home. Most of them have either been flown in from Libya, or bussed back from Niger. Others have been brought back from Morocco and Tunisia. Too many migrants don't realise the dangers they'll face, says the IOM's Senegal boss Jo-Lind Roberts Sene Sitting quietly next to Hassan is Issa Ba. He cuts a contrasting figure; he looks visibly shaken and for him the homecoming is bittersweet. ""I feel happy because I am going to see my parents again, but at the same time I'm very disappointed. It's a shame you know, it's a dishonour going back without getting to Europe."" Listening to all this is Seydine Ken, the IOM case-worker who is at the airport to meet the two. He's used to seeing these kind of reactions from returnees. Seydine says: ""The social pressure is really difficult because when they organise their trip, the family mobilises money, and sells their goods to pay for it. ""And it's very difficult for them to come back, and see what their family invested in the [failed] migration."" Seydine is part of the government welcome party; and at the airport he provides pocket money and information to take care of immediate needs, and also questions the two about their migration experience. He's a regular at the airport and says he can be there twice a week to welcome returnees. ""They have not met their dream. They are very disappointed, physically they are very tired and psychologically they are very weak. These people need help - financial help, health and personal development."" The IOM's chief of mission in Senegal is Jo-Lind Roberts Sene. Time and again she notices the serious lack of information about the realities of migrating. ""It's very frustrating when each time we have a charter flight, I get to the airport and have the same exchanges over and over again  -  they didn't have sufficient information, they knew the trip was dangerous but never knew to what extent."" In rural Senegal, a lack of jobs is one reason many choose to try and reach Europe Jo-Lind says that around Dakar there is more awareness about the dangers, but that in the countryside and other areas - home to a lot of would-be migrants - there is not this awareness. Voluntary returnees like Hassan and Issa play a vital role in helping change people's views. One of the regions where young men are being re-absorbed is Tambacounda in eastern Senegal,  close to the border with Mali. Being a poor, rural region, it is the lack of well-paying jobs for young people that encourages them to leave in the first place. So attempts are being made to reintegrate returned migrants into the community - giving them something to do and a way of earning a living. One project is a maize farm in the rural community of Jalakoto. It's run two European NGOs,Coopi,externalandLa Lumiere,,externalalong with the IOM, and helps around 100 young men in the surrounding villages. The maize farm is designed to help people earn a living - and for them to meet returning migrants For men like Mamadou Biagey, who came back from Libya three years ago, it's the only thing they have. ""Since I arrived I have lived in hardship because all the money I had I used to travel to Libya. For two years I stayed here without doing anything - it's only this year that I started doing something."" The Jalakoto project is also designed to give young men thinking of leaving for Europe a reason to stay - not just by providing an income and a purpose, but also by encouraging them to rub shoulders with people who can talk of their experiences travelling to Europe. ""Sometimes in our debates there are young men who ask, 'what did you do and how did you do it to get to Libya?',"" says Mamadou Biagey, ""but I try to discourage from going."" A quick show of hands among the 15 men working in one field reveals one man who says he initially intended to leave. ""In the beginning I only wanted to go and I saved enough money,"" he explains. ""Later on they brought us the project and explained what it was about and they convinced me. That's how I decided not to go."" In Tambacounda and throughout Senegal there is a battle going on between two narratives of what migration to Europe actually entails. Warnings about the dangers of migrating are competing with individual success stories, says Issaga Cee Back in the town, Issaga Cee, a school principal for 13 years, explains how real-life accounts of the dangers of the journey compete for space with apparent success stories on social media. ""People communicate a lot through WhatsApp - its very easy to tell the story of someone who has succeeded,"" he explains. ""Most of those who return at least have an experience of all the difficulties in Libya, so they have become lecturers about that very difficult trip and its consequences."" The IOM's Jo-Lind Roberts Sene says returning migrants have a crucial role to play: ""If it's a message that comes from Europeans it won't go through. ""If it's someone who's tried it, and hasn't made it, and can really explain what it was they experienced along the way, then it will take time - but they really are the ones that can put the message across."" A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Insurers 'burying price rises',"Some insurers are burying price rises in renewal notices, risking customers losing out financially. Rules introduced in April require companies to ""clearly, accurately and prominently"" display a renewal premium and what was paid the year before. A message to encourage customers to shop around is also stipulated, under rules set by the regulator. The trade body for insurers said there had been ""teething problems"" with implementing the new system. The new rules were expected to collectively save consumers up to Â£103m a year - but the regulator has said some insurers and brokers are failing to follow the rules properly. The rules, outlined by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), were designed to improve price transparency and tackle the issue of loyal customers paying more than new customers for the same insurance product, particularly when policies automatically renew. They cover all general insurance products, such as home, motor, pet and travel cover. Now, in letters and emails about renewals, insurers and brokers are required to: Ensure the previous year's premium is prominently displayed Encourage customers to check their cover and shop around for the best deal Give an extra message to anyone who has renewed with the same insurer four or more times saying: ""You have been with us for a number of years. You may be able to get the insurance cover you want at a better price if you shop around."" Seven months into the new system, the regulator said there had been ""several examples of firms who have failed to comply fully with the rules"". ""Consumers may have lost out as a result. For example, some firms obscured the required information or did not place the information in a prominent position,"" it said. Steven Murdoch, from London, complained to John Lewis Insurance that there was not a like-for-like comparison on renewal documents for home insurance. It gives last year's premium in bold after the extra cost of paying monthly direct debit is added, but the new quotation has the price in bold before the direct debit charge is added. ""It looks like the premium is about the same, when in fact it's an 8% increase,"" he said. The extra charge is shown in less prominent type. He and his wife felt they had lost trust in the insurer, and switched to a different provider, but others may have encountered the same issue. A spokeswoman for John Lewis Finance said: ""We acknowledge that the presentation could be improved and we are currently in the process of amending to ensure we are being as transparent and comprehensive as possible. We apologise for any confusion caused."" Two firms - Admiral and M&S Insurance have written to customers explaining their mistakes. Admiral - one of the largest insurers in the UK and a FTSE 100 company - gave last year's quoted premium, before discounts were applied, rather than the amount that the customer actually paid. M&S had not used the correct wording in its four-year renewal offer for some customers. There are more cases and the regulator has said it will work with insurers, but could use its powers to fine and order compensation to be paid, if firms fail to comply. Car insurance price fall short-lived, says comparison website How to get the cheapest car insurance Householders warned about 'blocked drain fraud' However, the FCA could have avoided some of the failures. During consultation prior to the new rules being implemented, it was suggested to the FCA that it should be more prescriptive in how and where the old premium and shop around message were displayed. The FCA's own trial showed that frequently customers overlooked details in renewal notices. With one insurer in the trial 28% of customers read the renewal letter in detail and 44% skim read, or read the first page. At a second insurer, 23% read the letter in detail and 39% skim read, or read the first page. Although the regulator pointed to this research, it did not stipulate precisely where the information should be put, nor the exact wording. In some cases, the previous year's premium and shopping around information have been placed on pages three or four of renewal notices, with the new quotation on the front. Despite the shortcomings, there has been support for the new policy. Ian Hughes, chief executive of research agency Consumer Intelligence said that, although implementation had been ""patchy"" there were signs of a rise in longstanding customers shopping around for a better deal in motor insurance. Switching rates had changed little, suggesting that customers were being offered a more competitive deal from their original insurer or were haggling on price. ""If you like your insurer, and want to keep on doing business with them, go back to them and tell them what the cheaper price was [from competitors] and see if they can match it,"" he said. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said that there had been some teething problems with the new system, despite insurers being given an extra three months to prepare compared with the original planned start date of January 2017, and that individual firms were working with the FCA to get things right.

Labour MP Clive Lewis denies groping claim,"Clive Lewis said he was ""taken aback"" by the allegation Labour MP Clive Lewis has ""completely"" denied an allegation that he groped a woman at the party's annual conference. The Labour Party is investigating after a formal complaint was made against the Norwich South MP on Friday. The former shadow defence secretary is alleged by the woman to have hugged her and squeezed her bottom at a conference event in Brighton in September. Meanwhile, suspended Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins said he ""categorically"" denies claims of sexual harassment. It comes as both Labour and the Conservatives set out measures to deal with sexual harassment following numerous allegations about the conduct of politicians in recent weeks. This weekSir Michael Fallon resigned as defence secretary, saying his behaviour may have ""fallen short"" of the standards expected by the UK military. On Friday the Conservatives suspended MP Charlie Elphicke after ""serious allegations"" were referred to the police, but the party has provided no further detail about the nature of the claims. The Labour Party launched its investigation into Mr Lewis after a party member told the Independent newspaper that he had groped her. Mr Lewis told the BBC he was ""vigorously"" disputing the allegation, which he said he had been ""pretty taken aback"" by. ""I don't as a rule at packed Labour party conferences grope people's bottoms when I greet them,"" he said. ""It's just not how I roll, it's not what I do. ""Is the person mistaken? Have I given them a hug and this has been misinterpreted? I don't know. ""All I know is that I would not deliberately do that, do what's alleged. I completely deny that."" A Labour activist told the BBC Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins hugged her inappropriately Luton North MP Mr Hopkins has also denied sexual harassment after party activist Ava Etemadzadeh, 27, told the BBC that he had hugged her inappropriately after a student event in 2014. Mr Hopkins said he had given her a ""brief, slight hug just before getting into my car"". He was suspended by the party on Thursday while an investigation takes place. This video can not be played Westminster has been rocked by a series of sexual harassment claims Corbyn 'warned over harassment claim MP' Labour suspends MP over harassment claim Sargeant removed from Welsh Government Labour activist 'warned' about pursuing rape claim And Labour's former foreign office minister, Ivan Lewis, has denied claims he made non-consensual sexual advances towards women. Buzzfeed News reported that a woman alleged he had touched her leg and invited her to his house at a Labour Party event in 2010 when she was 19. Mr Lewis said in a statement to the website that he had ""never made non-consensual sexual comments or sexual advances to women"". He added: ""However, I understand that a few women have claimed that my behaviour made them feel uncomfortable. ""I have on occasion asked women I work with out for drinks or dinner, or developed strong feelings for them, and I am genuinely sorry if this was unwelcome or inappropriate in the circumstances, and caused anyone to feel awkward."" Ivan Lewis said he had ""never made non-consensual sexual comments or sexual advances to women"" Prime Minister Theresa May is due to meet opposition party leaders, including Jeremy Corbyn, on Monday to discuss proposals to bring forward a new grievance system for Westminster staff and MPs. The Conservatives have published anew code of conduct,externalfor their MPs and other elected representatives in the wake of sexual harassment allegations. During an interview with BBC News about his resignation, Sir Michael said that the culture had changed over the years. ""What might have been acceptable 15, 10 years ago, is clearly not acceptable now,"" he said. This video can not be played Labour's Jasmin Beckett dismisses claims of generational differences on harassment Jasmin Beckett, a member of Labour's national executive committee and its equalities committee, said:  ""We've got to be clear that sexual harassment was never acceptable. It was never fine."" ""I think that's now why we are in a much better position to deal with this because actually society, and as we've seen Hollywood, knows that this type of behaviour is not acceptable. I hope that this whole scandal will make Westminster think that - I don't think in the past that Westminster has seen this as unacceptable."" Meanwhile, it was announced that Labour would appoint an independent specialist organisation to offer advice and support to individuals affected by sexual harassment in the party. However, Ms Beckett told the BBC: ""One of the things I'm calling for... is for us to re-look at that sexual harassment policy and to create an independent body for all future complaints as well."" Labour also said the independent legal expert, Karon Monaghan QC, would investigate party activist Bex Bailey's allegations. Ms Bailey has said she was raped at a party event and a senior Labour official discouraged her from reporting the attack. She said she was told reporting the alleged 2011 incident could ""damage"" her and that she was given no advice on what she should do next.

MP harassment claims and 'cost of Brexit',"Many papers show shoppers queuing for the new iPhone 10 As the allegations of harassment in Westminster continue to widen, many papers focus on political intrigue behind the scenes. TheDaily Telegraph,externalsays Sir Michael Fallon had been scheming to get Commons leader Andrea Leadsom sacked before she made what it calls ""a pre-emptive strike"" to force him out by alleging he made lewd remarks in a meeting.

Trump embarks on marathon tour of Asia,"This video can not be played President Donald Trump addresses US troops at the Yokota air base in Japan US President Donald Trump said no nation should underestimate American resolve, as he arrived in Japan at the start of a marathon Asian tour. Addressing US troops at Yokota air base near Tokyo, he pledged to ensure the military had the resources needed to keep peace and defend freedom. He later told the Japanese prime minister he thought the two countries had never been closer. It will be the longest tour of Asia by a US president in 25 years. It comes amid heightened tensions with North Korea over its nuclear programme and missile tests. ""No-one, no dictator, no regime... should underestimate American resolve,"" President Trump told cheering US and Japanese troops shortly after his arrival in Japan. Mr Trump swapped his suit jacket for a bomber jacket Before touching down, he told reporters on board Air Force One that he expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip.

Sex trafficking bill gets tech backing,"The bill seeks to prosecute websites that encourage ads selling sex The internetâs most powerful companies say they will support new measures that seek to prevent online sex trafficking. The Internet Association, which counts Facebook, Google and Amazon among its members, had at first said the proposed US law could hurt innovation. But in a statement released on Friday the group said it was satisfied with âimportant changesâ made to the bill. US senators are expected to hold an initial vote on the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (Sesta) next week. ""This important bill will hold online sex traffickers accountable and help give trafficking survivors the justice they deserve,â said Senator Robert Portman of Ohio, one of the billâs authors. âIâm pleased weâve reached an agreement to further clarify the intent of the bill and advance this important legislation.â Technology companies had been opposed to the bill because of changes it would have made to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, enacted in 1996. The section represents a pillar of internet law - one which protects internet companies from the actions of its users. For example, if a person uses YouTube to break the law by showing something illegal, the user, and not YouTube, is held legally responsible. The Internet Association argued that this framework meant fledgling companies were not burdened by huge, perhaps insurmountable legal risk. The compromise that finally got the technology companies on board, after going back-and-forth since August, relates to whether a site is âknowinglyâ aiding traffickers on their platform. The bill now clarifies that a site needs to be ""assisting, facilitating or supporting"" human trafficking in order to face prosecution. ""Internet Association is committed to combating sexual exploitation and sex trafficking online and supports Sesta,â said Internet Association President Michael Beckerman on Friday. ""Important changes made to Sesta will grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem.â Amanda Hightower, executive director at Seattle-based Real Escape from the Sex Trade (Rest), told the BBC she welcomed the news. ""With the bulk of trafficking happening over the internet, it's essential we have legislation and safeguards in place to protect victims and reduce the risk of people being sold online,"" she said. ""Knowing that internet giants are now joining forces with legislators to reduce the potential of trafficking gives me hope that we are heading in the right direction to stop this crime and that those who facilitate trafficking online will be held responsible."" The rewritten components will protect companies that take pro-active measures to remove advertisements that enable trafficking and the sale of sex, but will pave the way for prosecutors to more effectively go after sites that allegedly allow such activity to flourish. In the crosshairs of US law enforcement is Backpage.com, a site described by California prosecutors as a âmassive online brothelâ that actively encourages the sale of sex through its listings website. Backpage.com did not return the BBCâs request for comment on Friday. Despite the changes, some corners of the technology community are still concerned about the billâs effects. Engine, a non-profit group that pushes the interests of start-ups in Washington, said the new wording was still too vague. âWhile the bill sponsors have made improvements to some of the drafting problems in the original language, the changes do not address many of the startup community's concerns,â said Rachel Wolbers, Engineâs policy director. ""The bill still creates uncertainty for platforms regarding their obligations under the law and potentially penalises startups for content that they are unaware of and cannot control."" _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Bahrain deports Russian 'sex traffickers' First NI charge since sex law change Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?
