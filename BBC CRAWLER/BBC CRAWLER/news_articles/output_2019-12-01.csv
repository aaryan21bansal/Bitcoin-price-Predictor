Labour pledges to cut rail fares by a third,"Labour has announced plans to slash rail fares by 33% and simplify ticket prices for part-time workers if it wins the election on 12 December. The party also wants to make train travel free for young people under the age of 16 andbuild a central online booking portalwith no booking fees. The proposal is part of broader plans by the party to nationalise the UK's train system. Conservative Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the plan was ""desperate"". The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have also pledged to improve transport. Labour said privatisation had ""created one of the most expensive ticketing systems in the world"", which discriminated against part-time workers, discouraged rail travel and excluded the young and low-paid. Andy McDonald, Labour's shadow transport secretary, told the BBC's Today programme: ""[Our pledge] is much overdue given that passengers have had to suffer rises amounting to about 40% since 2010. ""And if we really want to make the shifts that we need to get people from cars into public transport this is a major contribution to it, because obviously that's critical to addressing the climate change crisis."" Labour's manifesto contained a pledge to make rail travel cheaper but no details about what that would entail. The party said the proposal to slash fares by a third would cost Â£1.5bn per year and be covered by Vehicle Excise Duty - money the Conservatives have earmarked for roads. More generally, Labour says nationalisation - which it plans to achieve within five years of coming to power - will allow fares to be capped and improve the reliability of services. The Conservatives' Mr Shapps said: ""This is another desperate attempt from Labour to distract from their inability and unwillingness to be straight with people on where they stand on Brexit, and the fact they would raise taxes on low and middle-income workers across the country. ""You simply cannot trust [Jeremy] Corbyn to deliver what he claims. His ideological plans would wreck our economy, cost people their livelihoods and with the help of Nicola Sturgeon, would waste the whole of next year on two more chaotic referendums."" In keeping with their proposals to nationalise the railways, Labour's plans to significantly cut fares would see a reverse in the direction of travel for policies on train fares since privatisation. Since 1995, successive governments have tried to move the day-to-day cost of running the railways onto fare-payers and away from the taxpayer. At that time, it used to be split 50/50 - now it's more like 75% on the shoulders of the passenger. The argument goes that by raising fares in line with the Retail Prices Index inflation figure each year, government spending on the railways can be reserved for investment in infrastructure. Announced just two days after the average train fare rise of 2.7% was published, and coinciding with major industrial action on several lines in the run-up to Christmas, Labour's proposal for a significant cut to fares could prove popular with commuters. The future of ticketing and rail fares is just one of the issues being looked at by a major review into the UK's railways due to report after the election. It is led by Keith Williams, the former boss of British Airways, who is particularly interested in how innovation in aviation fares and ticketing could be applied to the railways. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have pledged to freeze peak-time and season ticket train fares for the next five years and cancelthe 2.7% rise in rail tickets from 2 January 2020. They also plan to complete the HS2 high-speed rail link. And the Conservatives are pledging to improve transport links as part of a Â£3.6m Towns Fund. They have also promised to give more funding to local combined authorities to improve bus and train services and put Â£500m into reversing cuts to the railway network made in the 1960s. The Brexit Party's flagship transport policy is scrapping the HS2 rail project - a goal it shares with the Green Party. Regulated fares include season tickets for most commuter journeys, as well as saver returns, standard returns and off-peak fares between major cities. They make up about 45% of all fares. The average change in these figures is capped at July's Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure. They are due to rise 2.8% in January. Across England, Wales and Scotland regulated fares raised about Â£3.3bn for the rail operators, according to the Office of Rail and Road. Labour says they will pay for this by ring-fencing income from Vehicle Excise Duty, which the Conservatives plan to allocate to a special road-building fund from 2020-21 onwards. So, an interesting question will be which road projects will be defunded to pay for this pledge.

Leaders clash over Brexit in TV debate,"This video can not be played ITV debate: Parties tackle question of no-deal Brexit Leading figures from the UK's political parties have clashed on Brexit, the NHS and terror legislation in the latest televised general election debate. Labour's Richard Burgon declined to say during the ITV programme which way he would vote in the EU referendum his party is promising, if it wins power. Tory Rishi Sunak was pushed to rule out a no-deal Brexit if the Conservatives won, but did not give a direct answer. The UK goes to the polls on 12 December. Labour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon defended Jeremy Corbyn's decision to remain neutral in the event of a second referendum, saying the Labour leader was ""determined to bring the country together and heal divisions, not try to exploit them for votes"". Pressed by presenter Julie Etchingham on whether he would vote to stay in the EU or leave in another referendum, he said: ""I want to speak to my local Labour Party members after a Labour government comes back with that deal and then we'll decide how we approach that."" This video can not be played Labour's Richard Burgon on Brexit: 'It would be for the people to decide' Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said being neutral showed Mr Corbyn was a ""bystander not a leader"", but Mr Burgon said her party's policy of cancelling Brexit was ""not very liberal, not very democratic"". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who also wants another referendum, added it was ""dreadful"" that the Conservatives want ""Brexit at any cost"" and Labour ""can't even decide what side they're on"". She pushed Conservative minister Mr Sunak to rule out a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year if the Conservatives failed to negotiate a trade deal with the EU. The chief secretary to the Treasury insisted ""we already have a deal"", prompting Ms Sturgeon to say that that was a withdrawal deal, not a trade deal. Julie Etchingham hosted the debate Mr Sunak said a trade deal was ""in the future"", adding that ""we can only get to that future"" by respecting the result of the EU referendum and leaving. The UK would continue to abide by EU rules under the terms of Boris Johnson's EU deal until 31 December 2020, by which time he says a permanent trading relationship will be agreed with Brussels. But his opponents say that raises the prospect of a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year, if an agreement is not reached by then. Green party co-leader Sian Berry said the best way to finish off the Brexit process was ""more democracy"" by having a ""people's vote"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price and Ms Swinson said Brexit should be cancelled altogether. Mr Price said the economic effect of leaving the EU would divide the rich from the poor and ""will not be the answer to our problems"". CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said a second referendum would cause ""even more division and acrimony"". His party has pledged to leave the EU and move to World Trade Organisation trading rules if a free trade agreement cannot be struck by the end of next year. In a particularly spiky exchange, Ms Swinson attempted to use Mr Farage's defence of US President Donald Trump against him. The Brexit Party leader acknowledged that some of Mr Trump's comments about grabbing women were ""wrong"" . ""It was crass and it was crude and it was wrong - men say dreadful things sometimes,"" he said. ""If all of us were called out for what we did on a night out after a drink..."", he said, before being interrupted by the Lib Dem leader. ""Is that what you do on a night out after a drink?"" she asked. Mr Farage replied: ""He is president of the USA and that relationship matters. You are so anti-American you are prepared to put your hatred of Trump above our national interest. That is a great mistake."" This video can not be played Farage on Trump: 'Men say dreadful things sometimes' Scotland's first minister Ms Sturgeon accused Mr Johnson of modelling himself on Mr Trump. But Mr Sunak said the UK's relationship with the US was ""incredibly important for keeping us safe"" and was ""not something to turn your nose up at"". There were also heated exchanges over the the release from prison of Usman Khan, who went on commit the London Bridge terror attack. Mr Sunak said the Conservatives wanted ""tougher sentences"" and he defended Mr Johnson against claims he had politicised the attack, saying it was ""incumbent"" on the prime minister in an election ""to explain to people how they will keep them safe"". Mr Burgon said he was ""very uncomfortable with the way the discussion from the Conservatives moves straight from a tragedy to reheating pre-packaged political lines smearing the Labour Party"". ""I think our democracy, regardless of our parties, should be better than that"". Mr Farage said: ""I think these people should never ever be let out prison unless we are absolutely convinced they do not have the jihadi virus. But political correctness stops us from doing that."" Mr Sunak accused Labour of making ""baseless allegations"" that the Conservatives would sell the NHS, as part of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. He told Mr Burgon: ""The real risk to the NHS are your reckless plans for the economy, Richard, which will mean there isn't money to invest, and silly plans like the four-day week."" But the Labour shadow minister replied: ""It is not Labour's policy to have a four-day week in the National Health Service."" Challenging the comment, Mr Sunak said: ""John McDonnell stood there and said very clearly that it would apply to everyone. Are you now saying that he was wrong?"" Mr Burgon replied: ""No, I'm reiterating what he said before which is the idea of people working a four-day week at some point in the future - in maybe 10 years - is something which could be considered."" Shadow chancellor Mr McDonnell said last month that Labour's plans for a 32-hour working week will apply to all employees, including those in the NHS, and will be implemented over a decade.

Maltese prime minister to resign in new year,"Joseph Muscat has been in office six years Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has announced on national TV that he will step down in the new year, amid a crisis over a murdered journalist. He said he would ask the ruling Labour Party to begin the process to choose his successor on 12 January. Demonstrators have demanded his immediate resignation over the inquiry into Daphne Caruana Galizia's death. She was killed by a car bomb in 2017 as she investigated corruption among Malta's business and political elite. A businessman with alleged links to government officials was charged with complicity in the murder on Saturday. Why Maltaâs prime minister had to go The key figures in Malta's crisis Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Muscat said of the way the murder inquiry had been handled: ""Some decisions were good while others could have been better made."" ""All the responsibility I had to shoulder surely does not compare to the pain that the victim's family is enduring,"" he added. He said he would resign as leader of the Labour Party on 12 January and as prime minister ""in the days after"". Mr Muscat has been in power for six years, winning two elections by a landslide and presiding over a period of prosperity and social reform in the EU's smallest member state. ""Malta needs to start a new chapter and only I can give that signal,"" Mr Muscat said. He took the decision after a four-hour meeting with Labour's parliamentary group, at which MPs gave ""unanimous support to all decisions which the Prime Minister will be taking"". A large crowd of protesters earlier rallied in the capital Valletta to demand Mr Muscat's immediate resignation. Copies of a photo showing Mr Muscat's former chief of staff, Keith Schembri, alongside Melvin Theuma, an alleged middleman in Caruana Galizia's murder, were pinned to the gates of the building. Demonstrators filled Valletta's streets Fury over Mr Muscat's handling of the crisis grew this weekend when businessman Yorgen Fenech was charged with complicity in the murder, an allegation he denies. Mr Fenech was identified last year as being the owner of a mysterious Dubai-registered company, 17 Black, listed in the Panama Papers - a massive leak of documents from an offshore law firm in 2016. There were allegations that 17 Black planned to make secret payments to companies set up by Mr Schembri and Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi. This video can not be played Galizia's son, Paul, in 2018 called for a public inquiry over his mother's death Both men resigned this week but deny any wrongdoing, and Mr Mizzi has denied any business links to Mr Fenech. Three other men are in custody charged with Caruana Galizia's actual murder, which involved a car bomb. What happened after the Panama Papers? Malta country profile The murdered journalist's family said the prime minister had been left deeply compromised and should resign because he had failed, for the past two years, to take action to clean up politics in Malta. They argued that as long as he remained in place, a full investigation into Caruana Galizia's death was not possible. In another development, Mr Muscat's Economy Minister, Chris Cardona, was reinstated on Sunday after suspending himself on Tuesday after he was questioned by police. He denies any wrongdoing. Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings. Caruana Galizia (pictured in 1989) was survived by her husband and children Vincent Muscat later told police the bomb had been placed in Caruana Galizia's car while it was parked outside the walled compound where she lived. The killings earned the trio 150,000 euros (Â£132,000),Reuters news agency reports,external.

Aircraft radio fault led to RAF jets' sonic booms,"Typhoons can travel at twice the speed of sound Two Royal Air Force Typhoons caused sonic booms as they went to intercept an aircraft which had lost its radio contact over south-east England. The fighters from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire were cleared to go supersonic because of the emergency. The booms were heard in the early hours across London, Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. The aircraft first developed problems as it flew across Germany on its way to the US, said one of its pilots. The pilot praised the speed of the RAF response, but said he was shocked when he first saw the fighters. Steven Giordano told the BBC: ""It took us about 10 minutes to realize that the radio wasn't working and then about 10 minutes to resolve that problem. ""Amazing how fast the RAF reacted. I applaud them for that."" He said the crew was busy checking frequencies when the radio came back online and had not noticed the RAF fighters. ""I looked left and about had a heart attack when I saw one - so close - strobes on and with blueish 'glow strips' along the side of his fuselage. ""We flashed our landing lights to acknowledge and established radio contact on 'guard'... with the fighters. ""We were already talking to London control at that point. ""They remained with us for about five minutes."" He said the empty aircraft eventually landed safely in the US. The sonic booms woke people at about 04:20 GMT - with houses shaking and reports of police sirens sounding immediately after. The Metropolitan Police subsequentlyconfirmed the bang was the result of the RAF aircraft,externalbeing cleared to go faster than the speed of sound. RAF jets are only given permission to go supersonic in emergencies, usually when they are required to intercept another aircraft. Allow Twitter content?

Asonic boom happenswhen that air ""escapes"", creating a ripple effect which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap. It can be heard over such a large area because it moves with the plane, rather like the wake on the bow of a ship spreading out behind the vessel.

Facebook bans Tory ad over BBC footage,"Facebook has deleted a Conservative election ad that used BBC News footage because it infringed the corporation's intellectual property (IP) rights. The BBC said the material had been used out of context in a way that ""could damage perceptions of our impartiality"". On Thursday, the Tories rejected a request from the BBC's lawyers to remove the 15-second video. The BBC also complained to Facebook, which has now deleted the ad. BBC complains to Tories over Facebook advert In a statement, Facebook said: ""We have removed this content following a valid intellectual property claim from the rights holder, the BBC. ""Whenever we receive valid IP claims against content on the platform, in advertising or elsewhere, we act in accordance with our policies and take action as required."" A BBC spokesperson said: ""We welcome the decision."" The Conservative Party said: ""All political parties make use of BBC content. We will be asking the BBC if in the interests of fairness they intend to complain about other political parties who use their content."" By Digital Elections Reporter Joe Tidy The unprecedented and unpredictable campaign tactics being used during this election are putting Facebook's policies under increasing amounts of scrutiny and strain. The decision to remove the Conservative advert is significant; not because of the action the platform took, but the grounds on which it acted. The row between the BBC and the Conservative Party was about the ethics of the party's advert. The BBC believes that the ad misled viewers into thinking that its news reporters were supporting the Conservatives. The Conservatives disagreed. Facebook were aware of the row on the night the ad began running but didn't get involved until a copyright claim was lodged days later. The decision to take it down then was effectively a black and white one - and easy enough for the social media giant to act on without getting into the icky business of judging what counts as disinformation. It's another example of the platform taking action on simple technical grounds and helps us to build a clearer picture of the fuzzy policies that the platform and its sister site Instagram adheres to. Facebook will take action on political adverts but only when it has an excuse to stay out of the politics. The move also brings into sharp focus the need for regulation of what elements of news coverage are or aren't allowed during an election campaign. Clips of BBC presenters - political editor Laura Kuenssberg and News at Ten presenter Huw Edwards - speaking in recent broadcasts about Brexit delays were used in the ad. The clips were edited into a montage of protest footage and video of debate in the House of Commons, all set to dramatic music. The advert, which was used to target three separate groups of Facebook users, was seen by at least 350,000 people. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It began running on Thursday afternoon and, according to theFacebook Ad Library,external, was mainly aimed at 35-54 year olds and cost the party around Â£7,000. The advert, along with two others, was removed so it is no longer visible online and a message reads: ""This ad was taken down because it goes against Facebook's intellectual property policies."" In Facebook's policy guidelines it states that ""ads must not contain content that infringes upon or violates the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other personal or proprietary rights"".

Lib Dems won't support Labour nationalisations,"The Lib Dems would not support Labour's plans to renationalise key industries in the event of a hung Parliament, the party's leader Jo Swinson has said. She told the BBC Radio 5's Pienaar's Politics the policy was a ""distraction"" and not ""the way forward"". The Lib Dems and Labour have both ruled out a coalition deal if there is no clear general election winner. Asked if she would try to block Labour from forming a minority government, she said it was a ""fantasy situation"". ""Nobody is expecting, on the current scenario, that Jeremy Corbyn is getting anywhere near Downing Street and the Liberal Democrats are going to put him there. ""So the Labour manifesto, it's a wish list,  they cannot deliver it."" Lib Dems consider hung Parliament options Ms Swinson, who was a business minister in the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition government, began the general election campaign by saying she was aiming to be the prime minister of a Liberal Democrat government but has since conceded that would be a ""big step"" given the opinion polls. If her party ends up holding the balance of power after 12 December's election, she has said her MPs would not actively support a Labour or Tory programme of government as she believes neither Jeremy Corbyn nor Boris Johnson are fit to be prime minister. The party's foreign affairs spokesman Chuka Umunna refused to speculate about what his party would do in this situation, in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr. This video can not be played Chuka Umunna: ""We don't know who the Queen is going to approach to be prime minister."" Jo Swinson has not ruled out allowing a Conservative or Labour leader to take office - by abstaining in a vote on their first Queen's Speech - if they agreed to hold another EU referendum. Labour is committed to holding another EU referendum, on a renegotiated deal with the EU. But the party's first Queen's Speech would be likely to include plans to take the Royal Mail, rail companies, energy supply networks, water and sewerage companies back into public ownership. Asked whether she would support Labour's plans, Ms Swinson told Pienaar's Politics: ""No, I think renationalisation is a distraction. ""I don't think it's a way to deliver better public services and I think it's taking us away from, actually, how do you make things better for people?"" Pushed for further clarity on whether the Lib Dems would block the renationalisation of water, Ms Swinson said: ""We don't think that renationalisation is the way forward."" As well as criticising Jeremy Corbyn's economic plans, Ms Swinson condemned Boris Johnson's actions in the aftermath of Friday's London Bridge terror attack. She accused the prime minister of trying to make Friday's terror attack an election issue. ""This was an opportunity for Boris Johnson to be a statesman, and yet again he has failed in that and has just shown why he is not fit for the job of Prime Minister,"" she said. ""You've got a community which is coming together in a brilliant way and straight out of the door the prime minister's trying to make it an election issue - I just think it's pretty distasteful. ""I think we ought to be able to behave with respect, even when these things happen in the middle of a general election campaign.""

The pilot praised the speed of the RAF response, but said he was shocked when he first saw the fighters. Steven Giordano told the BBC: ""It took us about 10 minutes to realize that the radio wasn't working and then about 10 minutes to resolve that problem. ""Amazing how fast the RAF reacted. I applaud them for that."" He said the crew was busy checking frequencies when the radio came back online and had not noticed the RAF fighters. ""I looked left and about had a heart attack when I saw one - so close - strobes on and with blueish 'glow strips' along the side of his fuselage. ""We flashed our landing lights to acknowledge and established radio contact on 'guard'... with the fighters. ""We were already talking to London control at that point. ""They remained with us for about five minutes."" He said the empty aircraft eventually landed safely in the US. The sonic booms woke people at about 04:20 GMT - with houses shaking and reports of police sirens sounding immediately after. The Metropolitan Police subsequentlyconfirmed the bang was the result of the RAF aircraft,externalbeing cleared to go faster than the speed of sound. RAF jets are only given permission to go supersonic in emergencies, usually when they are required to intercept another aircraft. Allow Twitter content?

Asonic boom happenswhen that air ""escapes"", creating a ripple effect which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap.

US man killed by own home booby trapThe 65-year-old in the US state of Maine had rigged a door to fire a handgun should anyone enter.,"A 65-year-old American man who rigged his home with a booby trap to keep out intruders has been killed by the device. Ronald Cyr called police in the town of Van Buren in the state of Maine to say he had been shot. Police found a door had been designed to fire a handgun should anyone attempt to enter. Mr Cyr was taken to hospital but died of his injuries. It is illegal for home-owners to install such traps. Police in Van Buren, which borders the Canadian province of New Brunswick, said they responded to a 911 call in the early evening of Thanksgiving, last Thursday, from a man who said he had been shot. ""Following an extensive investigation that lasted into the early morning... it was determined that Mr Cyr had been shot as the result of the unintentional discharge of one of his homemade devices,"" the police department said in a Facebook post. ""Regretfully, Mr Cyr succumbed to the injuries he sustained from the gunshot."" It is not known how he managed to set off the device. Rigging homes with devices that can harm is illegal The police also found other possible devices and called in help from the Maine State Police Bomb Squad. There have been other cases of booby-trapped homes in the US. In February, a team of real estate investors walking through a home they had bought in Philadelphia discovered that a staircase had been rigged with string which, if tripped, would have triggered a swinging knife. In September last year, a man in Illinois was killed when he opened a neighbour's shed that had been rigged to fire a shotgun. William Wasmund, 48, was found guilty this September of first-degree murder and aggravated battery. And in October last yeara man in Oregon was charged after fortifying his home ""like a scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark"". FBI agents found a circular hot tub linked up to a tripwire, a fortified front door, animal traps and a wheelchair rigged with a shotgun that went off, hitting an agent in the leg. The definition of booby trap is a concealed or camouflaged device that can cause bodily injury when triggered. It is illegal to set up devices in your home to protect it from intruders, if those devices can cause harm. The legal argument is that life is more valued than property and that the devices have no means of preventing accidental harm or distinguishing between targets. Even if the trap targets a criminal, the trap-setter, though having the right to protect their home, has no right to determine the punishment. Injury can lead to lawsuits. In the 1971 case of Katko v. Briney, in Iowa, two homeowners were held liable for injuries caused by their spring-loaded shotgun to a trespasser intent on stealing from a vacant property. The court ruled the deadly force was not reasonable and awarded the plaintiff $30,000 (Â£23,000) in damages.

Labour pledges to cut rail fares by a thirdThe party vows to slash rail fares and make travel free for young people under the age of 16.Business,"Labour has announced plans to slash rail fares by 33% and simplify ticket prices for part-time workers if it wins the election on 12 December. The party also wants to make train travel free for young people under the age of 16 andbuild a central online booking portalwith no booking fees. The proposal is part of broader plans by the party to nationalise the UK's train system. Conservative Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the plan was ""desperate"". The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have also pledged to improve transport. Labour said privatisation had ""created one of the most expensive ticketing systems in the world"", which discriminated against part-time workers, discouraged rail travel and excluded the young and low-paid. Andy McDonald, Labour's shadow transport secretary, told the BBC's Today programme: ""[Our pledge] is much overdue given that passengers have had to suffer rises amounting to about 40% since 2010. ""And if we really want to make the shifts that we need to get people from cars into public transport this is a major contribution to it, because obviously that's critical to addressing the climate change crisis."" Labour's manifesto contained a pledge to make rail travel cheaper but no details about what that would entail. The party said the proposal to slash fares by a third would cost Â£1.5bn per year and be covered by Vehicle Excise Duty - money the Conservatives have earmarked for roads. More generally, Labour says nationalisation - which it plans to achieve within five years of coming to power - will allow fares to be capped and improve the reliability of services. The Conservatives' Mr Shapps said: ""This is another desperate attempt from Labour to distract from their inability and unwillingness to be straight with people on where they stand on Brexit, and the fact they would raise taxes on low and middle-income workers across the country. ""You simply cannot trust [Jeremy] Corbyn to deliver what he claims. His ideological plans would wreck our economy, cost people their livelihoods and with the help of Nicola Sturgeon, would waste the whole of next year on two more chaotic referendums."" In keeping with their proposals to nationalise the railways, Labour's plans to significantly cut fares would see a reverse in the direction of travel for policies on train fares since privatisation. Since 1995, successive governments have tried to move the day-to-day cost of running the railways onto fare-payers and away from the taxpayer. At that time, it used to be split 50/50 - now it's more like 75% on the shoulders of the passenger. The argument goes that by raising fares in line with the Retail Prices Index inflation figure each year, government spending on the railways can be reserved for investment in infrastructure. Announced just two days after the average train fare rise of 2.7% was published, and coinciding with major industrial action on several lines in the run-up to Christmas, Labour's proposal for a significant cut to fares could prove popular with commuters. The future of ticketing and rail fares is just one of the issues being looked at by a major review into the UK's railways due to report after the election. It is led by Keith Williams, the former boss of British Airways, who is particularly interested in how innovation in aviation fares and ticketing could be applied to the railways. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have pledged to freeze peak-time and season ticket train fares for the next five years and cancelthe 2.7% rise in rail tickets from 2 January 2020. They also plan to complete the HS2 high-speed rail link. And the Conservatives are pledging to improve transport links as part of a Â£3.6m Towns Fund. They have also promised to give more funding to local combined authorities to improve bus and train services and put Â£500m into reversing cuts to the railway network made in the 1960s. The Brexit Party's flagship transport policy is scrapping the HS2 rail project - a goal it shares with the Green Party. Regulated fares include season tickets for most commuter journeys, as well as saver returns, standard returns and off-peak fares between major cities. They make up about 45% of all fares. The average change in these figures is capped at July's Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure. They are due to rise 2.8% in January. Across England, Wales and Scotland regulated fares raised about Â£3.3bn for the rail operators, according to the Office of Rail and Road. Labour says they will pay for this by ring-fencing income from Vehicle Excise Duty, which the Conservatives plan to allocate to a special road-building fund from 2020-21 onwards. So, an interesting question will be which road projects will be defunded to pay for this pledge.

Songwriter behind calypso hit Day-O dies aged 95,"Irving Burgie wrote the lyrics to the national anthem of Barbados US composer Irving Burgie, who helped to popularise Caribbean music with hit songs like Day-O, has died aged 95. His death was confirmed by Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley, who called for a moment of silence for the man who wrote its national anthem. Mr Burgie is best known for helping singer Harry Belafonte bring calypso music to the mainstream. The 1950s song Day-O went on to be used in films, adverts and even as a wake-up call for astronauts in space. The calypso hit, also known as The Banana Boat Song, featured in the popular film Beetlejuice and has been sampled by rapper Lil Wayne and singer Jason Derulo. Why Paddington has calypso songs Belafonte handed honorary Oscar How to write a song: Tips from 1D and Little Mix writer US media reports say Mr Burgie died on Friday as a result of complications from heart failure. His website says his songs have sold more than 100 million records worldwide. Mr Burgie wrote eight of the 11 songs on Harry Belafonte's 1956 album Calypso, which was the first album in the US to sell more than a million copies. Mr Burgie wrote a number of songs for Harry Belafonte During his career, the composer worked with artists including Jimmy Buffett, Chuck Berry and Sam Cooke. His other well-known songs include Island in the Sun, Jamaica Farewell and Mary's Boy Child, which he co-wrote. Brooklyn-born Mr Burgie did not begin pursuing a career in music until he returned from serving in an all-black US Army battalion in World War Two. He then used the benefits he received as a war veteran to fund his studies at New York's prestigious Juilliard performing arts school and went on to launch a career as a singer and guitarist before moving into writing songs for others.

Thousands facing 'several days' without gas,"Angelene Perry's children donned blankets and woolly hats as the family struggled to stay warm Thousands of homes could be without heating for ""several days"" after a gas main failure in central Scotland. Gas infrastructure company SGN said about 8,000 properties in the Falkirk area had been left without supplies, SGN engineers were working to fix equipment that regulates gas pressure but warned each property would have to be visited. Electric heaters and cookers were being offered to elderly or sick customers, and those with young children. Temperatures in the Falkirk area were barely above freezing for much of Sunday and were forecast to fall to minus 2C overnight. Falkirk Council said schools may have to close on Monday and it would be working with SGN to care for vulnerable people affected. SGN said it had a large team of engineers working to fix the problem SGN said homes in Bainsford, Carron, Carronshore, Larbert, Langlees, New Carron Village, Skinflats and Stenhousemuir  were affected by a faulty  ""gas governor"" which regulates pressure in the network. Inits latest update,externalit said it would need to visit every property to turn off the gas supply at the meter. ""With so many homes affected, it's likely you could be without your gas supply for several days,"" it added. ""We're sorry for the inconvenience this will cause. We're doing all we can to restore gas supplies to the area as soon as possible. "" A customer information centre at the Camelon Community Centre in Falkirk will be stocked with portable cooking and heating appliances for elderly, disabled and chronically sick customers, as well as those with young children or other special needs. Customers can request the appliances by calling 0800 9121717. One customer, Angelene Perry, who has four young children including a baby, said the family woke on Sunday  morning to find the boiler off and displaying an error message. Gas customers woke to find error messages on their boilers She said: ""It's really cold in the house and we're all huddled in the living room where we've got a small heater. I've dressed the baby in plenty of clothes and a hat. ""I spoke to the gas company and was told a valve had been broken by the cold but they didn't know how long it would take to fix it. ""I think we're going to have to leave here and go to my sister's as we don't have any hot water or anything."" Falkirk Council said it had alerted housing and social work services to be on standby to support SGN and was contacting head teachers to let parents know if schools would be affected. A spokesman said: ""We have a list of vulnerable people in the area so we know were people who may have the most difficulty are."" He said schools could potentially close if the buildings are very cold, though all care homes in affected areas are currently fine. ""We are ready to support SGN in any way we can,"" he added.

Sentencing row - who did what?,"Usman Khan's murderous rampage has thrown the spotlight on the way in which he was sentenced and how his sentence was reviewed and changed by the Court of Appeal. It has also led to claims and counter claims by Labour and the Conservatives over who was to blame for a sentencing regime which allowed Khan's automatic release with its tragic consequences. Sentencing is massively complex, even for lawyers and judges.  So, let's try and pick a way through the thicket of sentencing laws involved in this case and understand what happened. Usman Khan pleaded guilty and was convicted in January 2012 of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism. Although the offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, he was given a sentence of detention for public protection (DPP) with a minimum term in custody of eight years. Parties row over early release of bridge attacker Second London Bridge victim named as Saskia Jones De-radicalisation dilemma at heart of attacker's case It is a version of the sentence of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP). IPPs were a highly controversial new kind of sentence introduced by Labour in England and Wales, under the Criminal Justice Act of 2003. They were designed for serious offenders who posed a significant risk of harm to the public, but who did not merit a life sentence. DPPs were only given to those aged between 18-21. The offender had to serve a minimum term, following which they had to satisfy the Parole Board that they no longer posed a risk to the public. Usman Khan pleaded guilty and was convicted in January 2012 of terror charges They were controversial because many IPPs were given to lower level criminals (street robbers and one to a man who set fire to a wheelie bin). They were often given short minimum terms and it was extremely difficult for offenders with borderline personality disorders to prove they did not pose a risk. The numbers on IPPs rapidly grew into the thousands under Labour - many regarded them as ""life sentences by default"". Under the DPP given to Khan the Parole Board would have played a key role in his release. If it had considered he posed a risk at the end of his minimum term of eight years he would not have been released and would not have been able to carry out his murderous attack. This video can not be played London Bridge attacker ""wanted to deradicalise"" at time of conviction - lawyer IPPs and DPPs were scrapped by the Conservatives in 2012, by which time the number of prisoners serving them had risen to over 6,000. It followed a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that the sentences were unlawful because the lack of rehabilitation courses meant offenders could not reduce or eliminate the risk they posed to the public. Khan appealed his sentence to the Court of Appeal. In 2013, it was quashed and substituted with what is known as an extended sentence Khan was a member of a group in Stoke who had liaised with a group in London planning to bomb the London Stock Exchange. The original sentencing judge Mr Justice Wilkie considered that although the criminality of both groups was equally serious, the Stoke group were more sophisticated and so more dangerous. The Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that if the plans of the groups were equally serious the risk posed by the Stoke group could not be greater than the London group who were far more advanced in their plans. So, Khan and the Stoke group were given extended sentences - the same as those given to the London group. Basically it is a sentence given to an offender who is deemed to be ""dangerous"" and for whom a ""determinate"" sentence is not thought to be sufficient to manage the risk he poses to the public. The offender is given a prison term - 16 years in Khan's case - plus an extended period on licence of five years. This can be eight years for an offender sentenced for serious sexual offences. Here is where there is real confusion.  In 2008 Labour introduced changes that affected extended sentences. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says about 74 convicted terrorists have been released early from prison Offenders serving them were no longer reviewed by the Parole Board - instead they were released automatically halfway through their sentence. The change was in part to deal with the problem of a prison population that had swelled due to the numbers of dangerous prisoners who had been given IPPs  and could not be released because they could not prove they no longer posed a risk to the public. However, extended sentences were changed again by the Conservative-led coalition government in December 2012. From that date offenders like Khan serving a custodial period of more than 10 years would serve two thirds of their sentence and then be considered for release by the Parole Board. This was not applied retrospectively though so did not apply to Khan. So, in effect, he was the beneficiary of a period between 2008 and December 2012 where prisoners on extended sentences were freed automatically at the half-way point in their sentence. Before and after that period they were subject to Parole Board assessment before release. In his judgment Lord Justice Leveson said: ""Given that it is difficult to identify the extent to which those who have been radicalised (perhaps as a result of immaturity or otherwise) will have modified their views having served a substantial term of imprisonment and there is an argument for concluding that anyone convicted of such an offence should be incentivised to demonstrate that he can safely be released; such a decision is then better left to the parole board for consideration proximate in time to the date when release becomes possible."" That has caused some to question whether the court had in mind an extended sentence for Khan subject to Parole Board risk assessment when no such assessment was in fact possible. Other commentators such as the Secret Barrister do not see confusion or error in the Court of Appeal's decision. He writes that Lord Justice Leveson was ""simply weighing up the competing arguments before concluding that an (extended sentence) even though it meant automatic release, was appropriate"". If the court had dismissed Khan's appeal and kept his DPP sentence in place, his release would have been subject to assessment by the Parole Board. If it had considered him a risk, he would have remained in prison and unable to carry out his plan to murder. Judges never explain or unpick their judgements so we will not hear from the Court of Appeal on this. The current law however means that no-one sentenced to a terrorism offence is now subject to automatic early release. Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison?

What is Learning Together?,"The London Bridge terror attack unfolded during a conference organised by a University of Cambridge programme called Learning Together. The prison scheme was holding a fifth anniversary event at Fishmongers' Hall when a participantwearing a fake suicide vest began a knife attack. Two people were killed, including one of Learning Together's coordinators,Jack Merritt, 25, and a volunteer, Saskia Jones, 23. Learning Together says it brings together offenders and those in higher education ""to study alongside each other"" in equal partnership. The University of Cambridgesaid the programme,external""has broken down prejudices and created new possibilities for all of those who took part"". Listen: Law in Action -  Inside the Learning Together project Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? London Bridge attack victim had 'lust for life' Second victim named as Saskia Jones The institution said the scheme illuminated the ""wealth of untapped academic talent inside the criminal justice system"". An initial course linking criminology students and prisoners was formed in 2014 at HMP Grendon in Buckinghamshire, according to the University of Cambridge website. The programme has since expanded to include a further course at Grendon and another at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire. Other partnerships include projects at HMP Brixton in south London and HMP Warren Hill in Suffolk, among others. Jack Merritt was a course coordinator for Learning Together Professor Stephen Toope, vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, said on Sunday that Learning Together does challenging work with an often maligned community. He told the BBC: ""It is always difficult to be working with populations that are, in some sense, not always very well regarded in society - people who have been convicted of offences. ""But the whole purpose of the programme is to try to ensure that people who have been convicted will be given educational opportunities that will allow them to better integrate into society when they are released."" Saskia Jones was a Cambridge graduate and volunteered with Learning Together The programme has been praised by government, with then-Justice Secretary Michael Gove saying, in 2016, that the scheme ""provides the chance for prisoners to work towards their full potential and gain qualifications as a result"". Law student Jake Thorold, a former participant in a Learning Together course at HMP Grendon, wrote on Twitter about his experience. He said the programme ""insists on seeing the best in people"" through a ""genuinely mutual exchange"" of ideas between students and prisoners. Allow Twitter content?

""The Learning Together scheme combined students from inside and outside of the prison to come together and experience a carefully structured academic-based course,"" she wrote. ""We would meet once a week for approximately two months, to participate in a lecture and follow up seminar-style interaction session."" The criminology scholar said she was struck by the course's impact on participants.

She wrote: ""...a woman disclosed that the most valuable lesson she had taken most from the course was the shift in how she viewed herself. ""[The woman] explained that prior to Learning Together, she suffered from the habit of immediately assuming what she perceived as an insignificant status in any given scenario... ""[The] course had taught her to feel relevant and valued, that she could walk into a room and look people in the eye and express her opinions."" One former Learning Together participant, Eugene,is quoted,externalon the University of Cambridge website as saying the programme made him realise higher education opportunities existed for people like him.

Protests grip Malta as PM defies calls to quit,"Joseph Muscat has been in office six years Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has announced on national TV that he will step down in the new year, amid a crisis over a murdered journalist. He said he would ask the ruling Labour Party to begin the process to choose his successor on 12 January. Demonstrators have demanded his immediate resignation over the inquiry into Daphne Caruana Galizia's death. She was killed by a car bomb in 2017 as she investigated corruption among Malta's business and political elite. A businessman with alleged links to government officials was charged with complicity in the murder on Saturday. Why Maltaâs prime minister had to go The key figures in Malta's crisis Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Muscat said of the way the murder inquiry had been handled: ""Some decisions were good while others could have been better made."" ""All the responsibility I had to shoulder surely does not compare to the pain that the victim's family is enduring,"" he added. He said he would resign as leader of the Labour Party on 12 January and as prime minister ""in the days after"". Mr Muscat has been in power for six years, winning two elections by a landslide and presiding over a period of prosperity and social reform in the EU's smallest member state. ""Malta needs to start a new chapter and only I can give that signal,"" Mr Muscat said. He took the decision after a four-hour meeting with Labour's parliamentary group, at which MPs gave ""unanimous support to all decisions which the Prime Minister will be taking"". A large crowd of protesters earlier rallied in the capital Valletta to demand Mr Muscat's immediate resignation. Copies of a photo showing Mr Muscat's former chief of staff, Keith Schembri, alongside Melvin Theuma, an alleged middleman in Caruana Galizia's murder, were pinned to the gates of the building. Demonstrators filled Valletta's streets Fury over Mr Muscat's handling of the crisis grew this weekend when businessman Yorgen Fenech was charged with complicity in the murder, an allegation he denies. Mr Fenech was identified last year as being the owner of a mysterious Dubai-registered company, 17 Black, listed in the Panama Papers - a massive leak of documents from an offshore law firm in 2016. There were allegations that 17 Black planned to make secret payments to companies set up by Mr Schembri and Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi. This video can not be played Galizia's son, Paul, in 2018 called for a public inquiry over his mother's death Both men resigned this week but deny any wrongdoing, and Mr Mizzi has denied any business links to Mr Fenech. Three other men are in custody charged with Caruana Galizia's actual murder, which involved a car bomb. What happened after the Panama Papers? Malta country profile The murdered journalist's family said the prime minister had been left deeply compromised and should resign because he had failed, for the past two years, to take action to clean up politics in Malta. They argued that as long as he remained in place, a full investigation into Caruana Galizia's death was not possible. In another development, Mr Muscat's Economy Minister, Chris Cardona, was reinstated on Sunday after suspending himself on Tuesday after he was questioned by police. He denies any wrongdoing. Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings. Caruana Galizia (pictured in 1989) was survived by her husband and children Vincent Muscat later told police the bomb had been placed in Caruana Galizia's car while it was parked outside the walled compound where she lived.

The extraordinary mission of Robert Stivey," By Gwyneth Rees, BBC Wales, with pictures by Christian Petersen In a chapel in the heart of the south Wales valleys, a coffee morning is in full flow. It is a small affair - just a handful of retired men exalting the glory days when the mines were still open. Today, like most weeks, numbers are relatively low. But for the minister who has organised it, the Reverend Robert Stivey, it is still something of a triumph. Just a year ago, this chapel - the Calfaria Calvinistic Methodist Chapel in Porth - was shut, its future uncertain. Like so many other chapels in the valleys, it was lying empty, awaiting demolition or conversion into flats. However, Stivey stepped in, purchasing it for under £40,000 of his own money, then re-opening the vestry to allow life in once more. “The chapel secretary was 90 when she retired,” he says. “No-one wanted to take on her role. But I take great pleasure in seeing the chapel coming alive again, bringing people back.”   This is one of 12 chapels he has bought across the south Wales valleys over the past decade, spending roughly £200,000 of his own savings. His aim is to re-open them all, or at least keep them in safe hands until the congregations return. “I am intent on attracting new fellowships,” he says. “Spreading the Gospel and using these chapels not as museum pieces, but centres of worship.” He pauses then smiles. “What I need to express is that this project is not about me or even the chapels. This is about the Lord and this is my calling.” It is an ambitious calling, but one which Stivey seems to have spent much of his life preparing for. Growing up in Plymouth, he frequently attended Sunday school until his personal faith was cemented at the age of 16. Driven by his interest in historic buildings, he began work as a chartered surveyor. He married and became the father of five children, one of whom died and another who was involved in a traffic accident and left quadriplegic, with just the use of his right limb. “We thought he would die,” Stivey says. “But there was a lot of praying by his bedside and he survived. Now he comes down from London in his wheelchair and helps me run the chapels.” It was only in his 60s that Stivey began dedicating his life full-time to his faith, working as an ordained minister in the Islington area of north London. Something else came into his life at that time - a run-down cottage in the village of Merthyr Vale, just five miles away from the former iron capital of the world, Merthyr Tydfil. “My wife and I bought this cottage and began coming frequently,” he says. “But while I was travelling around, I noticed all these chapels shut down or up for sale. They were just being demolished, or used inappropriately. “An idea began to germinate and I thought thatsomeoneshould be doing something about that. And then I got a message, or feeling, from the Lord, that that person wasme.” In its heyday, the valleys boasted roughly 2,000 chapels, tending the souls of those who moved there to work in the coal mines. Not only were these chapels religious hubs, they had a significant influence on cultural, educational and political life, with eloquent preachers creating theatrical atmospheres that could radicalise congregations. Prominent nonconformists like John Hughes wrote some of Wales’ most famous hymns such as Cwm Rhondda (often known as Bread of Heaven), and chapels are credited as being incubators of Welsh culture and language, steadfast in fuelling the likes of the National Eisteddfod.  The number of chapels was so high because there were so many different non-conformist denominations. Some offered language in Welsh, others in the English language. They often boasted charismatic preachers and offered a strong sense of community, but by the 1920s and 30s, a decline was under way. Dr Gethin Matthews, senior history lecturer at Swansea University, says, “The last hurrah for the religion really was 1905 when a Christian revival swept Wales. After that came a general decline in organised religion. “The valleys were hard hit. Not only was there depopulation as mines shut but many of those who came back from World War One became disillusioned with the chapel message that it was a ‘just’ war. “Society then evolved and moved on with more modern forms of entertainment, and chapels began to be seen as dogmatic and old-fashioned.”  All this may be history, yet the consequences are clearly visible today. Take a drive across the stunning - yet bleak - landscape, dipping into the deprived, ribbon towns known for their close-knit communities, and abandoned chapels are everywhere. Many are Grade II-listed but still falling into ruin. Others have no such protection, and can be demolished at a developer’s whim. Typically, they come up for auction or appear on estate agents’ websites. And this was where Stivey found his Porth chapel, snapping it up in 2010 as his first project. In many ways, it has proved to be his most successful venture. He has established a weekly service, free coffee mornings, a ladies’ group and a children’s club. The number of people attending these events, however, is rarely out of single figures and they all take place in the vestry, or hall, with the chapel itself lying empty and abandoned upstairs. To walk around the silent pews and gallery - built for 500 or more - is to step back in time. There’s the smell of dust and pitch pine. There are children’s names scratched into the backs of pews. Cushions and crocheted blankets remain on some seats, saving places for people unlikely to return. In the quiet of the chapel, Stivey’s eyes drift beyond the pulpit to the organ - glorious but unplayed, its metal pipes painted in soft pastels. Above him, high on the ceiling, is a decorative rose. “The aim is to leave the vestry and move back here,” he says, wistfully. “But we will need 50 or 60 people for that, and I don’t think we shall ever see the hundreds needed to fill the gallery upstairs."" It is this quest for fresh congregations that is the key challenge for Stivey.  And never is this clearer than 15 minutes’ drive away at the Tabernacle Chapel in Treharris, where the only thing that breathes life into the stone walls is death. On a rainy Thursday morning in September, a local funeral attracts 30 or so black-clad mourners. Father Gareth Coombes, an Anglican priest who takes services for all denominations in the region, greets those who step through the doors before the hymns ring out. “The church has lost connection with communities,” he says. “We can’t expect people to go to church in the same way. Kids have sport on Sundays.” Still, since Stivey re-opened the doors in 2018, funeral services have become popular. “It’s memories,” says John Davies, the funeral director. “People and their families have links to the chapel going down generations. So when someone dies, they want the funeral there even though it’s not usually open.” However, he is not optimistic about the chapel’s long-term viability: “It just isn’t catching on as a place of worship.” His assistant, Sophie McCarthy, 24, says, “People might want the chapels open but no-one wants to pay for their upkeep. Even at services, you pass the donation box around and people just look at it and carry on walking.” Besides the size of the congregation, money is certainly the biggest issue for Stivey. Another of his chapels is a modern building in the village of Aberfan, site of the 1966 landslide which killed 116 children and 28 adults. Built in 1970 and closed in 2007, it lies vandalised and partially flooded, with smashed windows and ivy snaking in through damaged brick. Anything of value - electric and copper cables plus lead from the roof - was stolen long ago. All that remains for now to remind people of the building’s purpose is a hefty Bible lying open on a table. It seems an anachronistic sight, just like the nearby coal lorry delivering bags of coal door-to-door. But for Stivey, it is crucial to his plans. “The building certainly is an eyesore,” he says after attempting a faint-hearted clean-up, “and a sorry tale with all the vandalism. Still, I leave this old Welsh Bible open at the front. To many this may be a derelict building, but to me this is still the house of God.” Many of his other acquisitions – all individually purchased for between £1,000 and £39,000 - hold similarly sorry tales. In Merthyr Tydfil, the Seion Welsh Baptist Chapel of 1788 once held 1,000 people. The roof is leaking, and dark boards are pinned to the windows to deter pigeons.  Mountain Ash’s Bethania Chapel - where some claim the great Welsh hymn (and rugby anthem) Calon Lân received its first public airing in 1892 - is now used to store furniture for a local charity. In Aberdare, the Calfaria Baptist Chapel with its prominent WWI memorial is closed, a pile of litter stacked up by doors leading to an overgrown graveyard. This chapel, one of his newer acquisitions, cost him £25,000. But is it a hopeless case? Not so for the minister. “We clearly need to renovate and reopen,” he says. “And it will be a slow process, perhaps not even done in my lifetime. “But I am happy when I come here. It is spiritual heritage. I sit here and think of the past, with all the singing and worship. As long as it’s not broken into and vandalised, I am happy.” Some of the chapels are in better condition.  The Siloam Welsh Baptist Chapel, in the village of Penderyn, closed after worshippers fell to single figures, but it is in near-perfect condition - small and intact, with no damp or damage. “This one,” says the minister, gazing up at the pulpit, “is ready to go. We could open it tomorrow. All we need is the people.” But in the three years he’s owned the chapel, Stivey hasn’t been able to entice back a congregation. It has stood empty, with no worship, oratory or singing to bring the acoustics to life. This leads to an inevitable question - will he ever be able to accomplish his mission to reignite the congregations and spread God’s word as he wishes? Twenty minutes away, back down in Porth, the locals are ambivalent - there’s support for the minister but also a hard view of practical realities.  Serving at the local chippy, Norma Seldon’s view is typical: “We all went to chapel on a Sunday and it’s sad they are closing. No-one wants to see them turned into flats, but I’m not sure who will go?” For the minister and those who support him, however, there is a clear and compelling point, and it is this that drives him on. It is a mission that has involved sacrifice. Not only has Stivey spent all his inheritance on the chapels, he is also reliant on public transport to check on them - a “laborious and time-consuming task” that takes up most of his days. His wife now has dementia, and is cared for in London, and he is all too aware that he is away from home. “I never thought I would end up here in the valleys,” he muses, from his digs in Treherbert. “But the Lord moves us around.” These issues are nothing when pitted against his calling, however. “Some people don’t think you need a chapel in every town anymore,” he says, “but we need to provide for the local community a place where the Bible can live.” Does he ever feel daunted by the task? “I feel completely at peace and incredibly privileged to save [the chapels]” he says. “And what is more, I’m amazed by the amount of interest in them. Of course some people are cynical, saying I am eccentric and outlandish and that it will never happen. But what I say to them is, 'have faith, have faith'. “I am never daunted by the scale of the project, not ever. The Lord will provide.” Writer:  Gwyneth Rees Photographer: Christian Petersen Photo Editor: Phil Coomes Editor: Kathryn Westcott The people who live on remote rocks in the North Atlantic  Aberfan: The mistake that cost a village its children  David Hurn's incredible photography"

Facebook bans Tory ad over BBC footageThe social media giant says the Tory video infringed the BBC's intellectual property rights.Election 2019,"Facebook has deleted a Conservative election ad that used BBC News footage because it infringed the corporation's intellectual property (IP) rights. The BBC said the material had been used out of context in a way that ""could damage perceptions of our impartiality"". On Thursday, the Tories rejected a request from the BBC's lawyers to remove the 15-second video. The BBC also complained to Facebook, which has now deleted the ad. BBC complains to Tories over Facebook advert In a statement, Facebook said: ""We have removed this content following a valid intellectual property claim from the rights holder, the BBC. ""Whenever we receive valid IP claims against content on the platform, in advertising or elsewhere, we act in accordance with our policies and take action as required."" A BBC spokesperson said: ""We welcome the decision."" The Conservative Party said: ""All political parties make use of BBC content. We will be asking the BBC if in the interests of fairness they intend to complain about other political parties who use their content."" By Digital Elections Reporter Joe Tidy The unprecedented and unpredictable campaign tactics being used during this election are putting Facebook's policies under increasing amounts of scrutiny and strain. The decision to remove the Conservative advert is significant; not because of the action the platform took, but the grounds on which it acted. The row between the BBC and the Conservative Party was about the ethics of the party's advert. The BBC believes that the ad misled viewers into thinking that its news reporters were supporting the Conservatives. The Conservatives disagreed. Facebook were aware of the row on the night the ad began running but didn't get involved until a copyright claim was lodged days later. The decision to take it down then was effectively a black and white one - and easy enough for the social media giant to act on without getting into the icky business of judging what counts as disinformation. It's another example of the platform taking action on simple technical grounds and helps us to build a clearer picture of the fuzzy policies that the platform and its sister site Instagram adheres to. Facebook will take action on political adverts but only when it has an excuse to stay out of the politics. The move also brings into sharp focus the need for regulation of what elements of news coverage are or aren't allowed during an election campaign. Clips of BBC presenters - political editor Laura Kuenssberg and News at Ten presenter Huw Edwards - speaking in recent broadcasts about Brexit delays were used in the ad. The clips were edited into a montage of protest footage and video of debate in the House of Commons, all set to dramatic music. The advert, which was used to target three separate groups of Facebook users, was seen by at least 350,000 people. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It began running on Thursday afternoon and, according to theFacebook Ad Library,external, was mainly aimed at 35-54 year olds and cost the party around Â£7,000.

Freed Taliban captive reveals hostage ordeal,"This video can not be played ""At times I felt my death was imminent"" An Australian academic freed by the Taliban in a prisoner swap has spoken of his ""long and tortuous ordeal"" as a hostage in Afghanistan. Timothy Weeks said he believed US special forces had tried six times to rescue him and an American captive, Kevin King, who was also released. Mr Weeks said he did not hate the Taliban, saying some of his guards were ""lovely people"" he hugged as he left. ""I never, ever gave up hope... I knew I would leave eventually,"" he said. Mr Weeks and Mr King, also an academic, were freed this month in exchange for three senior militants held by the Afghan authorities, in a deal aimed at kick-starting peace talks. The pair had been held for three years after being abducted outside the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul, where they worked as professors. Inside the prison wing holding 2,000 Taliban Who are the Taliban? Why is there a war in Afghanistan? Mr Weeks, a 50-year-old from Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, was speaking at a press conference after returning to Australia on Thursday night. He said he believed numerous attempts were made to rescue him and that he was held in several locations, often small windowless cells in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""I believe, and I hope this is correct, that they (special forces) came in six times to try to get us, and that a number of times they missed us only by hours,"" Mr Weeks said. Timothy Weeks with his sisters Alyssa Carter (L) and Joanne Carter (R) He recalled one such mission in April, when his guards told him they were under attack by militants of the rival Islamic State (IS) group. ""I believe now that it was the Navy SEALs coming in to get us,"" Mr Weeks said. ""I believe they were right outside our door. The moment that we got into the tunnels, we were one or two metres underground and there was a huge bang at the front door. ""And our guards went up and there was a lot of machine-gun fire. They pushed me over the top into the tunnels and I fell backwards and rolled and knocked myself unconscious."" Mr Weeks (L) and fellow hostage Kevin King during their capture He said he had accepted that his guards were soldiers acting under orders and that they ""don't get a choice"". ""I don't hate them at all,"" he said. ""And some of them I have great respect for, and great love for, almost. Some of them were so compassionate and such lovely, lovely people. And it really led me to think about... how did they end up like this?"" Mr Weeks also recalled his release, saying his ordeal ""ended as abruptly as it had begun"" as two US Black Hawk helicopters descended from the skies. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? ""Out of a big dust cloud came six special forces and they walked towards us and one of them stepped towards me and he just put his arm around me and he held me and he said, 'Are you OK?' And then he walked me back to the Black Hawk."" Mr Weeks said that his time as a hostage had had a ""profound and unimaginable effect"". But he never gave up hope because ""if you give up hope, there is very little left for you"". He said: ""At times, I felt as if my death was imminent, and that I would never return to see those that I loved again. But, by the will of God, I am here, I am alive and I am safe - and I am free.""

US man killed by own home booby trap,"A 65-year-old American man who rigged his home with a booby trap to keep out intruders has been killed by the device. Ronald Cyr called police in the town of Van Buren in the state of Maine to say he had been shot. Police found a door had been designed to fire a handgun should anyone attempt to enter. Mr Cyr was taken to hospital but died of his injuries. It is illegal for home-owners to install such traps. Police in Van Buren, which borders the Canadian province of New Brunswick, said they responded to a 911 call in the early evening of Thanksgiving, last Thursday, from a man who said he had been shot. ""Following an extensive investigation that lasted into the early morning... it was determined that Mr Cyr had been shot as the result of the unintentional discharge of one of his homemade devices,"" the police department said in a Facebook post. ""Regretfully, Mr Cyr succumbed to the injuries he sustained from the gunshot."" It is not known how he managed to set off the device. Rigging homes with devices that can harm is illegal The police also found other possible devices and called in help from the Maine State Police Bomb Squad. There have been other cases of booby-trapped homes in the US. In February, a team of real estate investors walking through a home they had bought in Philadelphia discovered that a staircase had been rigged with string which, if tripped, would have triggered a swinging knife. In September last year, a man in Illinois was killed when he opened a neighbour's shed that had been rigged to fire a shotgun. William Wasmund, 48, was found guilty this September of first-degree murder and aggravated battery. And in October last yeara man in Oregon was charged after fortifying his home ""like a scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark"". FBI agents found a circular hot tub linked up to a tripwire, a fortified front door, animal traps and a wheelchair rigged with a shotgun that went off, hitting an agent in the leg. The definition of booby trap is a concealed or camouflaged device that can cause bodily injury when triggered. It is illegal to set up devices in your home to protect it from intruders, if those devices can cause harm. The legal argument is that life is more valued than property and that the devices have no means of preventing accidental harm or distinguishing between targets. Even if the trap targets a criminal, the trap-setter, though having the right to protect their home, has no right to determine the punishment. Injury can lead to lawsuits. In the 1971 case of Katko v. Briney, in Iowa, two homeowners were held liable for injuries caused by their spring-loaded shotgun to a trespasser intent on stealing from a vacant property. The court ruled the deadly force was not reasonable and awarded the plaintiff $30,000 (Â£23,000) in damages.

Protests grip Malta as party backs prime minister,"Joseph Muscat has been in office six years Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has announced on national TV that he will step down in the new year, amid a crisis over a murdered journalist. He said he would ask the ruling Labour Party to begin the process to choose his successor on 12 January. Demonstrators have demanded his immediate resignation over the inquiry into Daphne Caruana Galizia's death. She was killed by a car bomb in 2017 as she investigated corruption among Malta's business and political elite. A businessman with alleged links to government officials was charged with complicity in the murder on Saturday. Why Maltaâs prime minister had to go The key figures in Malta's crisis Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Muscat said of the way the murder inquiry had been handled: ""Some decisions were good while others could have been better made."" ""All the responsibility I had to shoulder surely does not compare to the pain that the victim's family is enduring,"" he added. He said he would resign as leader of the Labour Party on 12 January and as prime minister ""in the days after"". Mr Muscat has been in power for six years, winning two elections by a landslide and presiding over a period of prosperity and social reform in the EU's smallest member state. ""Malta needs to start a new chapter and only I can give that signal,"" Mr Muscat said. He took the decision after a four-hour meeting with Labour's parliamentary group, at which MPs gave ""unanimous support to all decisions which the Prime Minister will be taking"". A large crowd of protesters earlier rallied in the capital Valletta to demand Mr Muscat's immediate resignation. Copies of a photo showing Mr Muscat's former chief of staff, Keith Schembri, alongside Melvin Theuma, an alleged middleman in Caruana Galizia's murder, were pinned to the gates of the building. Demonstrators filled Valletta's streets Fury over Mr Muscat's handling of the crisis grew this weekend when businessman Yorgen Fenech was charged with complicity in the murder, an allegation he denies. Mr Fenech was identified last year as being the owner of a mysterious Dubai-registered company, 17 Black, listed in the Panama Papers - a massive leak of documents from an offshore law firm in 2016. There were allegations that 17 Black planned to make secret payments to companies set up by Mr Schembri and Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi. This video can not be played Galizia's son, Paul, in 2018 called for a public inquiry over his mother's death Both men resigned this week but deny any wrongdoing, and Mr Mizzi has denied any business links to Mr Fenech. Three other men are in custody charged with Caruana Galizia's actual murder, which involved a car bomb. What happened after the Panama Papers? Malta country profile The murdered journalist's family said the prime minister had been left deeply compromised and should resign because he had failed, for the past two years, to take action to clean up politics in Malta. They argued that as long as he remained in place, a full investigation into Caruana Galizia's death was not possible. In another development, Mr Muscat's Economy Minister, Chris Cardona, was reinstated on Sunday after suspending himself on Tuesday after he was questioned by police. He denies any wrongdoing. Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings. Caruana Galizia (pictured in 1989) was survived by her husband and children Vincent Muscat later told police the bomb had been placed in Caruana Galizia's car while it was parked outside the walled compound where she lived. The killings earned the trio 150,000 euros (Â£132,000),Reuters news agency reports,external.

"Songwriter behind calypso hit Day-O dies aged 95Irving Burgie helped to popularise Caribbean music, selling more than 100 million records worldwide.","Irving Burgie wrote the lyrics to the national anthem of Barbados US composer Irving Burgie, who helped to popularise Caribbean music with hit songs like Day-O, has died aged 95. His death was confirmed by Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley, who called for a moment of silence for the man who wrote its national anthem. Mr Burgie is best known for helping singer Harry Belafonte bring calypso music to the mainstream. The 1950s song Day-O went on to be used in films, adverts and even as a wake-up call for astronauts in space. The calypso hit, also known as The Banana Boat Song, featured in the popular film Beetlejuice and has been sampled by rapper Lil Wayne and singer Jason Derulo. Why Paddington has calypso songs Belafonte handed honorary Oscar How to write a song: Tips from 1D and Little Mix writer US media reports say Mr Burgie died on Friday as a result of complications from heart failure. His website says his songs have sold more than 100 million records worldwide. Mr Burgie wrote eight of the 11 songs on Harry Belafonte's 1956 album Calypso, which was the first album in the US to sell more than a million copies. Mr Burgie wrote a number of songs for Harry Belafonte During his career, the composer worked with artists including Jimmy Buffett, Chuck Berry and Sam Cooke. His other well-known songs include Island in the Sun, Jamaica Farewell and Mary's Boy Child, which he co-wrote. Brooklyn-born Mr Burgie did not begin pursuing a career in music until he returned from serving in an all-black US Army battalion in World War Two. He then used the benefits he received as a war veteran to fund his studies at New York's prestigious Juilliard performing arts school and went on to launch a career as a singer and guitarist before moving into writing songs for others.

China due to introduce face scans for mobile users,"China has for years been trying to enforce rules to ensure that everyone using the internet does so under their ""real-name"" identities People in China are now required to have their faces scanned when registering new mobile phone services, as the authorities seek to verify the identities of the country's hundreds of millions of internet users. The regulation, announced in September, was due to come into effect on Sunday. The government says it wants to ""protect the legitimate rights and interest of citizens in cyberspace"".

But others were less cynical, saying that the move was simply in line with ""technological progress"". China already extensively censors and polices the web, removing and blocking content it does not want its citizens to see and talk about. China is often described as a surveillance state - in 2017 it had 170 million CCTV cameras in place across the country with the goal of installing an estimated 400 million new ones by 2020. The country is also setting up a ""social credit"" system to keep score of the conduct and public interactions of all its citizens in one database. The aim is that by 2020, everyone in China will be enrolled in a vast national database that compiles fiscal and government information to give a ""ranking"" for each citizen. Facial recognition plays a key role in the surveillance system and it has been lauded as a way of catching fugitives. Last year, media noted that police were able to pick a fugitive out of a crowd of 60,000 at a concert using the technology.

China's hidden camps China sets up huge 'social credit' system Smart cameras catch man in 60,000 crowd But facial recognition is increasingly becoming a part of daily life and commercial transactions in China. It's used more and more, for example, to pay in shops and supermarkets. However there has been some blow-back.

Mr Ding said it was clear that there is increasing backlash against China's widespread adoption of facial recognition technology. Such criticism used to focus on fears of data theft, hacking and abuses by commercial companies, he said. However, increasingly, citizens seem willing to criticise how the Chinese government might exploit such data to track the population.

In the western region of Xinjiang, where up to a million Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities have been detained for what the authorities call ""re-education"",surveillance cameras use facial recognition to specifically track Uighurs, based on their appearance,external, the New York Times reported earlier this year. China's hidden camps China sets up huge 'social credit' system Smart cameras catch man in 60,000 crowd But facial recognition is increasingly becoming a part of daily life and commercial transactions in China. It's used more and more, for example, to pay in shops and supermarkets. However there has been some blow-back. Earlier this year,a university professor sued a wildlife park for making facial recognition mandatory for visitors- sparking a wider debate about the state's mass collection of data on its citizens. This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" In September, the Chinese government said it planned to ""curb and regulate"" the use of facial recognition technology in schools afterreports a university was trialling using it to monitor the attendance and behaviour of students. Mr Ding said it was clear that there is increasing backlash against China's widespread adoption of facial recognition technology. Such criticism used to focus on fears of data theft, hacking and abuses by commercial companies, he said. However, increasingly, citizens seem willing to criticise how the Chinese government might exploit such data to track the population.

Johnson says 74 terror prisoners released early,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says about 74 convicted terrorists have been released early from prison Boris Johnson has told the BBC that 74 people jailed for terror offences and released early will have their licence conditions reviewed. The Ministry of Justice launched the urgent review after convicted terrorist Usman Khan, who had served half of his sentence,killed two people in a knife attack at London Bridge on Friday. The prime minister claimed scrapping early release would have stopped him. But Labour is blaming budget cuts for ""missed chances to intervene"". Friday's attack was brought to an end when police shot Khan dead. London Bridge sentencing row - who did what? Second London Bridge victim named as Saskia Jones London Bridge attack victim had 'lust for life' Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? The 28-year-old had been jailed in 2012 over a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange. He was given a special jail term known as Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), which meant he would serve at least eight years and could not be released unless he had convinced the Parole Board he was no longer a threat. But in 2013,the Court of Appeal replaced the sentencewith a 16-year-fixed term of which Khan should serve half in prison. He was released on licence in December 2018 - subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"", police said. Mr Johnsontold the BBC's Andrew Marr showit was ""repulsive"" that someone as ""dangerous"" as Khan could be released from prison after ""only serving eight years"". He blamed Khan's release on legislation introduced under ""a leftie government"", insisting the automatic release scheme was introduced by Labour - but was challenged about what the Conservatives had done to change the law over the past 10 years in government. ""Now that I am prime minister I'm going to take steps to make sure that people are not released early when they commit... serious sexual, violent or terrorist offences,"" he said. ""I absolutely deplore the that fact that this man was out on the streets... and we are going to take action against it."" Mr Johnson said there were ""probably about 74 people"" convicted of serious offences who had been released early - a figure confirmed by the Ministry of Justice. The prime minister said action had been taken immediately following London Bridge attack ""to ensure there is no threat to the public"". In a separate development, a 34-year-old man was arrested on Sunday at his home address in Stoke-on-Trent on suspicion of the preparation of terrorist acts, the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit said. There is no information to suggest that the arrested man was involved in the incident at London Bridge on Friday, the unit added. But the arrest was made as part of ""a wider on-going review of existing licence conditions of convicted terrorism offenders"". This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons One of the people Khan killed has been named by police as25-year-old Jack Merritt. The second victim has been named as Saskia Jones, a 23-year-old Cambridge University student. One of the three other people injured was a member of staff from the university. NHS London has said two victims remain in a stable condition in hospital, while a third has been discharged. They were all attending an event to mark five years of the Learning Together programme - which gives students and inmates the opportunity to study together to help reduce re-offending. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab earlier said the Conservative Party had a new policy to enforce a minimum sentence of 14 years for a person convicted of serious terrorist offences. But Prof Ian Acheson - who advised the government on how to handle extremist prisoners in 2016 - told BBC Radio 4'sThe World This Weekendit was not ""a question of an arms race on sentencing toughness"", but about what is done when offenders are in custody. He said 68 of the 69 recommendations he had made around the treatment and risk management of prisoners were agreed by the then Justice Secretary Michael Gove. But he claimed they had not been implemented due to ""the merry-go-round of political replacements of secretaries of state"", and the ""fairly recalcitrant and unwilling bureaucracy"" it created. Prof Acheson also criticised ""crazy failed and ideological austerity cuts"" to the police, prison and probation services. 2003- The Criminal Justice Act meant most offenders would be automatically released halfway through sentences, but the most ""dangerous"" would have their cases looked at by a Parole Board. Sentences with no fixed end point, called Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), were also introduced. 2008-  Criminal Justice and Immigration Act removed review process by Parole Boards, meaning more offenders were released automatically halfway through sentences. Judges could still hand down life sentences or IPPs for dangerous offenders. 2012- Usman Khan was handed a sentence with no fixed end date because of the risk he posed to the public. In the same year, the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act scrapped IPPs and reintroduced the role of the Parole Board for extended sentences of 10 years or more - this time after two-thirds of the sentence has passed. But that did not mean those already serving IPPs would have them lifted. 2013- During an appeal, Lord Justice Leveson ruled that Khan's indeterminate sentence should be substituted for an extended sentence with automatic release at the halfway point. At an event in York, Jeremy Corbyn called for an inquiry into ""everything surrounding"" Khan, including his sentence and what happened to him in prison. But he warned against ""knee-jerk legislation"", saying the country could ""pay a price later"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says cuts in public services could put more lives at risk In his speech, the Labour leader said: ""No government can prevent every attack. No-one would believe any political leader who said they could. ""But the government can act to make such acts of terror less, rather than more likely."" Mr Corbyn said there needed to be more funding for public services, including probation and mental health. ""That can lead to missed chances to intervene in the lives of people who go on to commit inexcusable acts,"" he said. ""You can't keep people safe on the cheap."" Mr Corbyn told Sky's Sophy Ridge programme terrorists should ""not necessarily"" serve their full sentences automatically, but that it ""depends on circumstances"". This video can not be played Usman Khan speaking to the BBC in 2008: ""I ain't no terrorist"" Both parties have been accused of politicising the attack. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey told Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he was ""alarmed"" at Mr Johnson's reaction to the London Bridge attack. ""In the middle of an election, we shouldn't be making political capital out of a tragedy, and he's doing that, and he's doing that in a way which is misleading people about what the law actually says,"" he said. But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tweeted that those convicted of terror offences ""should never be released"". The father of Jack Merritt, who was a course co-ordinator for Learning Together, said in a now-deleted tweet that his son ""would not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily"". Mr Raab said David Merritt should be listened to, declaring ""nobody wants to see the politicisation of this"". But he added: ""The question is, who is going to make sure that the overriding priority is avoiding any unnecessary risk to the public?"" ""I think if you look at what we're saying on sentencing... it is the Conservatives who are saying we will stop at nothing to keep people safe.""

Second London Bridge victim named as Saskia Jones,"Jack Merritt was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Saskia Jones was a volunteer on the programme The woman killed in Friday's London Bridge attack has been named by police as Saskia Jones. The 23-year-old Cambridge University graduate, from Stratford-upon-Avon, was fatally stabbed alongside another ex-student, Jack Merritt. The boss of the venue where the attack began which killed the pair said ""the building turned into a nightmare"". Toby Williamson, of Fishmongers' Hall, said staff who fought attacker Usman Khan believed he was wearing a bomb. Two men took chairs, fire extinguishers and narwhal tusks, which were hanging on the wall, to fend off Khan, driving him out of the building. Khan, 28, a convicted terrorist who was released from prison in December 2018, was later shot dead by police on London Bridge. The families of Mr Merritt and Ms Jones have both paid tribute to their loved ones. Jack Merritt's family said he was 'looking forward to building a future with his girlfriend, Leanne' In a statement, Mr Merritt's family described him as a ""talented boy"" who ""died doing what he loved"". ""Jack lived his principles; he believed in redemption and rehabilitation, not revenge, and he always took the side of the underdog. ""Jack was an intelligent, thoughtful and empathetic person. ""We know Jack would not want this terrible, isolated incident to be used as a pretext by the government for introducing even more draconian sentences on prisoners, or for detaining people in prison for longer than necessary,"" the statement read. The family of Saskia Jones said her death ""will leave a huge void in our lives"" Ms Jones' family said their daughter, from Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, had a ""great passion"" for supporting victims of criminal injustice. ""Saskia was a funny, kind, positive influence at the centre of many people's lives,"" the family statement read. ""She had a wonderful sense of mischievous fun and was generous to the point of always wanting to see the best in all people. ""She was intent on living life to the full and had a wonderful thirst for knowledge, enabling her to be the best she could be. ""This is an extremely painful time for the family. Saskia will leave a huge void in our lives and we would request that our privacy is fully respected."" This video can not be played London Bridge attack: 'Pinball bomb with added knives' Cambridge University's vice-chancellor said he was ""devastated to learn that among the victims were staff and alumni"". Professor Stephen J Toope said the victims were taking part in an event ""to mark five years of the university's Learning Together programme"" - which focuses on prisoner rehabilitation. London Bridge attack victim had 'lust for life' 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? What we know about the London Bridge attacker He added: ""What should have been a joyous opportunity to celebrate the achievements of this unique and socially transformative programme, hosted by our Institute of Criminology, was instead disrupted by an unspeakable criminal act. ""Among the three people injured, whose identities have not been publicly released, is a member of university staff. ""Our university condemns this abhorrent and senseless act of terror."" Vice-chancellor Professor Stephen J Toope said he only met Jack Merritt once but was ""impressed by his charm"". Speaking to the BBC, Prof Toope said the fact Mr Merritt was killed by someone he was trying to help ""is the greatest tragedy of all"". ""I have profound sadness for the family,"" he added. ""This is an attack on our community and it was intended, in such, to produce a form of terror and sadness - and it has clearly done that."" This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Speaking about the chain of events inside Fishmongers' Hall on Friday, where Khan launched his fatal attack, chief executive Mr Williamson praised the bravery of his staff who intervened to stop the attacker, hailing their actions as ""extraordinary things done by ordinary people"". ""There was a scream, there was blood. People thought it was an exercise at first,"" Mr Williamson told the BBC. He recounted how two men, named as Lukasz and Andy, ""used fire extinguishers, chairs and narwhal tusks ripped off the wall"" to take the fight back to Khan ""They took a decision, one that enough was enough. They were determined it wasn't going to go on."" ""They are two of the most humble people... but in the heat of the moment, people do extraordinary things. ""I am very proud to know them."" Floral tributes have been laid on the south side of London Bridge Earlier in the day, hundreds attended a service at Southwark Cathedral for the victims of Friday's attack on London Bridge. The Dean of Southwark Cathedral, the Very Revd Andrew Nunn, said many people were struggling with what happened. On Friday, the cathedral was put into lockdown as people ran away from London Bridge. As crowds ran towards the cathedral, Mr Nunn recalled having ""that sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu"", adding that it brought back memories ofthe nearby attack in Borough Market two years ago, which left eight dead and 48 injured. The Dean of Southwark Cathedral said Friday's attack brought back memories of the London Bridge terror attack in 2017 Prayers were held for the victims of the London Bridge attack Speaking at Sunday's service, Mr Nunn said ""memories have been stirred and wounds have been re-opened"". He added: ""What seemed to have been put to the back of people's minds has now been brought to the fore. ""We have to stand with them. We have to help bear their pain but also speak to that pain with words of hope."" Mr Nunn, too, praised the bravery of the people who confronted Khan as he carried out his attack. ""Every event of this nature produces stories of such selfless acts of bravery."" London Bridge was cordoned for most of the weekend while forensic officers searched the scene Dr Vin Diwaker, medical director for the NHS in London, gave an update on the conditions of the three people who were injured in the attack. He said: ""One of the people injured in the London Bridge incident has now been able to return home. ""Two people remain in a stable condition and continue to receive expert care in hospital."" This video can not be played Thomas Gray spoke to BBC 5 Live about how he helped to stop the London Bridge attacker Over the weekendcounter-terrorism officers searched a house in Stafford linked to Khanand another property in Stoke-on-Trent. On Sunday night, Staffordshire Police said a 34-year-old man was arrested in connection with a ""review of existing licence conditions of convicted terrorism offenders"". The man was arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts, but Staffordshire Police added there was no information to suggest the man was involved in the London Bridge attack. Vehicles abandoned as the attack unfolded on Friday have since been removed, the Met Police has said. Friday's attack comes after theUK's terrorism threat level was downgraded on 4 November from ""severe"" to ""substantial"", meaning that attacks were thought to be ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"". The terror threat level is reviewed every six months by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which makes recommendations independent of government.

Why was Khan out of prison?,"London Bridge attacker Usman Khan came to the attention of counter-terrorism investigators because he was involved in a highly active cell around Stoke-on-Trent, part of a wider network of radicals then headed bythe preacher Anjem Choudary. MI5 and the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit had intelligence that a group of nine men from London, Cardiff and Stoke, including Khan, wanted to bomb the London Stock Exchange. The plot was supremely incompetent and amateur. Khan also wanted to set up a terrorism training ""madrassah"", or school, in Kashmir to train a new generation of British militants to either fight out there or bring their skills home. Khan and the others were convicted and jailed in 2012- and the ultimate dilemma for the authorities was whether the men were simply fantasists who, hopefully, would grow up. London Bridge attacker had terror conviction What we know about the London Bridge attacker London Bridge: What we know so far The West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit and MI5 team who worked on the investigation had no doubt the men were dangerous - even if they did not have capability. And while Mr Justice Wilkie, the judge presiding over the case, received a letter from Khan saying he had recanted, he had his own doubts - not  least because of the nature of the conversations that had been caught during surveillance. The judge gave Khan a special prison term known as Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP). That meant he would serve at least eight years and could not be released unless he had convinced the Parole Board he was no longer a threat. Some of the other members of the cell received a sentence which dealt with their dangerousness differently. They would serve the second half of it in the community on a licence to monitor their behaviour. And following that, additional years of monitoring. When Khan appealed against his sentence, senior judges agreed he should have been treated the same way as his co-defendants. Usman Khan, circled, with his fellow defendants in a surveillance image released by police in 2012 His IPP was replaced by the same extended sentence (reflecting dangerousness) given to some of the others, meaning he would definitely still spend eight years in jail before release and monitoring. If he broke the licence he could be immediately sent back to prison. Khan had also been asking to join a deradicalisation programme - including sending a letter in October 2012 asking for the Home Office to provide someone to work with him. His solicitor, Vajahat Sharif, has told the BBC that Khan repeatedly asked him for help in finding someone. Mr Sharif said he wanted a very specific jihadist ideology expert to work with his client because he feared Khan's hate was so deeply-rooted. This video can not be played London Bridge attacker ""wanted to deradicalise"" at time of conviction - lawyer So while he may have received some help, his lawyer, for one, thinks it was not enough. When Khan was released on licence, he was subject to a variety of forms of management in the community, as is largely standard for terrorism offenders: Khan was wearing a GPS tag to monitor his specific movements He was sent to a bail hostel in Staffordshire where his comings and goings could be supervised It's likely - but unconfirmed - that he was banned from speaking to his former associates And he was obliged to take part in the government's ""Desistance and Disengagement Programme"" (DDP) DDP is now a key part of the counter-terrorism strategy and involves tailored counselling and psychological intervention in the lives of terrorism convicts leaving jail. More than 100 individuals went through the course between the beginning of its trial in October 2016 and September 2018. There is now funding in place to accommodate up to 230 individuals a year. The scheme aims to address many of the triggers that lead someone to turn against society - from a personal identity crisis and chronic self-esteem problems, through to personal grievances and immersion in extremist ideology. One of Khan's associates, jailed alongside him in 2012, was Mohibur Rahman. He attended a deradicalisation course while in jail - but he also met other extremists inside. He was subsequently released and then jailed for life for his part inan embryonic plan to carry out a vehicle and knife attack in Birmingham. Mohibur Rahman (left) alongside fellow defendant Tahir Aziz The end of that plot was a major win for the police and MI5 - but it also involved two other former terrorism prisoners who had not changed their ways. Each regional counter-terrorism unit is also supposed to take an interest in the activity of released individuals on their patch. Khan would have required police permission to travel to London before his attack so as to not trigger an alert. On Saturday, Scotland Yard said Khan was, to the best of their knowledge, complying with all his release conditions. MI5 may have been monitoring Khan too, as it has a role in looking at prisoners leaving jail - although they are typically considered a low risk because it takes time for them to re-engage. And so the biggest problem is knowing for sure that someone has reformed - even if they have been on a deradicalisation programme.

Pienaar: Can Johnson be 'change' candidate?,"Boris Johnson told the BBC's Andrew Marr his government has a ""different approach"" to previous Tory administrations After 10 years of Conservative rule blighted by austerity and Brexit-weariness, it takes an almost breathtaking audacity - hostile critics might say the brassiest neck in the business - to campaign for a fourth consecutive Tory term in office as the face of change. It takes, in other words, Boris Johnson. The prime minister and his team may or may not summon the will (or, as they would say, find space in the diary)to face the BBC's Andrew Neil. But his appearance with Andrew Marr was enough to show why Mr Johnson is trying hard to distance himself from his party's years in office - voters are yearning for change. This isn't, however, easy to pull off. Mr Johnson has been a prominent MP and minister for much of that time - aside from, admittedly, nearly half of it away from Westminster while London mayor. The pitch to be Britain's new broom hasn't just centred on the London Bridge attack. The PM did, after all, allow a decent interval (of maybe two or three hours) to pass after the attack before he began recitingTory election promises of more police and tougher sentencing. He has now added a pledge to review the terms on which dozens of terrorists were released from prison.His answers to Andrew Marron why it has taken years to do this essentially came down to arguing the Tories were now under new management. On Friday, Mr Johnson set out a vision of post-Brexit industrial intervention, and state aid for ailing companies. One journalist at his campaign news conference said he sounded like Jeremy Corbyn. Another thought it seemed North Korean, although that was probably a bit over the top. ButMr Johnson also told the Spectator magazine,externalthis week that he had never supported austerity, and that he believed the Treasury's spending decisions had helped run down the UK's neglected regions. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: 'Tory austerity impoverished millions' It all looks as bold an attempt as we've seen to dump years of political baggage, along with Britain's EU membership. As for Jeremy Corbyn, if political agility is the PM's stock-in-trade, the Labour leader's defining feature this week was his rigid refusal to concede any fault where his deepest convictions are concerned. In his interview with Andrew Neil this week that meant brushing aside questions about the cost of Labour's spending plans - or trying to - and refusing four times to apologise for anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn did tell Sky News he supported the shooting of terrorists when there was ""no choice"" and lives were in immediate danger. But his view that the UK's foreign policy, in such regions as the Middle East, has fomented the terror threat is well known, often stated, and repeated again this weekend. More widely, the slippage of the Liberal Democrats in the polls has obscured the fact that party leader Jo Swinson could yet end up with a good deal of power in a hung Parliament, whether or not her party wins many seats. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson called the renationalisation question a ""distraction"" Speaking to me on Pienaar's Politics, she made clear she would block Labour's radical plans for the renationalisation of rail, mail, energy, water and broadband if Mr Johnson fails to win a majority, and Jeremy Corbyn ends up in Number 10 - relying on Lib Dem MPs to get anything passed in Parliament. I asked her onPienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: would she back renationalisation? ""No, I think renationalisation is a distraction,"" she said. ""I don't think it's a way to deliver better public services and I think it's taking us away from actually how do you make things better for people. ""I mean, if you look at things on the climate emergency, you look at energy as one good example. You know, what's happened in the last few years is off-shore wind has become the cheapest way of producing electricity and that's been done through the competition within the market, the system that Liberal Democrats put in place in terms of making sure that we could have a renewable revolution."" Did all that mean she'd veto the renationalisation of, say, water? ""Look,"" she said. ""We don't think that renationalisation is the way forward."" The PM's travel plans were disrupted by the London Bridge attack. But he is yet to make a campaign trip to London and south-east England, outside his own constituency, of course. Has he given up on remain-supporting London? Mr Corbyn is maybe more concerned with the optics than parliamentary arithmetic. He has been visiting safe Labour seats, but he has also been to five marginals this week, four of them Tory-held. Ms Swinson has been to targets including Cheltenham and Kensington. Nigel Farage travelled to six locations with an average leave vote in the EU referendum of 64%. And SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has continued to swing by SNP marginal constituencies. It's all hotting up, and could heat up more in the TV studios in another set of debates and question-and-answer sessions. Including Andrew Neil? Who knows?

Floral tributes have been laid on the south side of London Bridge Earlier in the day, hundreds attended a service at Southwark Cathedral for the victims of Friday's attack on London Bridge. The Dean of Southwark Cathedral, the Very Revd Andrew Nunn, said many people were struggling with what happened. On Friday, the cathedral was put into lockdown as people ran away from London Bridge. As crowds ran towards the cathedral, Mr Nunn recalled having ""that sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu"", adding that it brought back memories ofthe nearby attack in Borough Market two years ago, which left eight dead and 48 injured. The Dean of Southwark Cathedral said Friday's attack brought back memories of the London Bridge terror attack in 2017 Prayers were held for the victims of the London Bridge attack Speaking at Sunday's service, Mr Nunn said ""memories have been stirred and wounds have been re-opened"". He added: ""What seemed to have been put to the back of people's minds has now been brought to the fore. ""We have to stand with them. We have to help bear their pain but also speak to that pain with words of hope."" Mr Nunn, too, praised the bravery of the people who confronted Khan as he carried out his attack. ""Every event of this nature produces stories of such selfless acts of bravery."" London Bridge was cordoned for most of the weekend while forensic officers searched the scene Dr Vin Diwaker, medical director for the NHS in London, gave an update on the conditions of the three people who were injured in the attack. He said: ""One of the people injured in the London Bridge incident has now been able to return home. ""Two people remain in a stable condition and continue to receive expert care in hospital."" This video can not be played Thomas Gray spoke to BBC 5 Live about how he helped to stop the London Bridge attacker Over the weekendcounter-terrorism officers searched a house in Stafford linked to Khanand another property in Stoke-on-Trent. On Sunday night, Staffordshire Police said a 34-year-old man was arrested in connection with a ""review of existing licence conditions of convicted terrorism offenders"". The man was arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts, but Staffordshire Police added there was no information to suggest the man was involved in the London Bridge attack. Vehicles abandoned as the attack unfolded on Friday have since been removed, the Met Police has said. Friday's attack comes after theUK's terrorism threat level was downgraded on 4 November from ""severe"" to ""substantial"", meaning that attacks were thought to be ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"".

Johnson says 74 terror prisoners released earlyThe Ministry of Justice launches an urgent review of their licence conditions after Friday's attack.UK,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says about 74 convicted terrorists have been released early from prison Boris Johnson has told the BBC that 74 people jailed for terror offences and released early will have their licence conditions reviewed. The Ministry of Justice launched the urgent review after convicted terrorist Usman Khan, who had served half of his sentence,killed two people in a knife attack at London Bridge on Friday. The prime minister claimed scrapping early release would have stopped him. But Labour is blaming budget cuts for ""missed chances to intervene"". Friday's attack was brought to an end when police shot Khan dead. London Bridge sentencing row - who did what? Second London Bridge victim named as Saskia Jones London Bridge attack victim had 'lust for life' Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? The 28-year-old had been jailed in 2012 over a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange. He was given a special jail term known as Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), which meant he would serve at least eight years and could not be released unless he had convinced the Parole Board he was no longer a threat. But in 2013,the Court of Appeal replaced the sentencewith a 16-year-fixed term of which Khan should serve half in prison. He was released on licence in December 2018 - subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"", police said. Mr Johnsontold the BBC's Andrew Marr showit was ""repulsive"" that someone as ""dangerous"" as Khan could be released from prison after ""only serving eight years"". He blamed Khan's release on legislation introduced under ""a leftie government"", insisting the automatic release scheme was introduced by Labour - but was challenged about what the Conservatives had done to change the law over the past 10 years in government. ""Now that I am prime minister I'm going to take steps to make sure that people are not released early when they commit... serious sexual, violent or terrorist offences,"" he said. ""I absolutely deplore the that fact that this man was out on the streets... and we are going to take action against it."" Mr Johnson said there were ""probably about 74 people"" convicted of serious offences who had been released early - a figure confirmed by the Ministry of Justice. The prime minister said action had been taken immediately following London Bridge attack ""to ensure there is no threat to the public"". In a separate development, a 34-year-old man was arrested on Sunday at his home address in Stoke-on-Trent on suspicion of the preparation of terrorist acts, the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit said. There is no information to suggest that the arrested man was involved in the incident at London Bridge on Friday, the unit added. But the arrest was made as part of ""a wider on-going review of existing licence conditions of convicted terrorism offenders"". This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons One of the people Khan killed has been named by police as25-year-old Jack Merritt. The second victim has been named as Saskia Jones, a 23-year-old Cambridge University student. One of the three other people injured was a member of staff from the university. NHS London has said two victims remain in a stable condition in hospital, while a third has been discharged. They were all attending an event to mark five years of the Learning Together programme - which gives students and inmates the opportunity to study together to help reduce re-offending. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab earlier said the Conservative Party had a new policy to enforce a minimum sentence of 14 years for a person convicted of serious terrorist offences. But Prof Ian Acheson - who advised the government on how to handle extremist prisoners in 2016 - told BBC Radio 4'sThe World This Weekendit was not ""a question of an arms race on sentencing toughness"", but about what is done when offenders are in custody. He said 68 of the 69 recommendations he had made around the treatment and risk management of prisoners were agreed by the then Justice Secretary Michael Gove. But he claimed they had not been implemented due to ""the merry-go-round of political replacements of secretaries of state"", and the ""fairly recalcitrant and unwilling bureaucracy"" it created. Prof Acheson also criticised ""crazy failed and ideological austerity cuts"" to the police, prison and probation services. 2003- The Criminal Justice Act meant most offenders would be automatically released halfway through sentences, but the most ""dangerous"" would have their cases looked at by a Parole Board. Sentences with no fixed end point, called Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), were also introduced. 2008-  Criminal Justice and Immigration Act removed review process by Parole Boards, meaning more offenders were released automatically halfway through sentences. Judges could still hand down life sentences or IPPs for dangerous offenders. 2012- Usman Khan was handed a sentence with no fixed end date because of the risk he posed to the public. In the same year, the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act scrapped IPPs and reintroduced the role of the Parole Board for extended sentences of 10 years or more - this time after two-thirds of the sentence has passed. But that did not mean those already serving IPPs would have them lifted. 2013- During an appeal, Lord Justice Leveson ruled that Khan's indeterminate sentence should be substituted for an extended sentence with automatic release at the halfway point. At an event in York, Jeremy Corbyn called for an inquiry into ""everything surrounding"" Khan, including his sentence and what happened to him in prison. But he warned against ""knee-jerk legislation"", saying the country could ""pay a price later"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says cuts in public services could put more lives at risk In his speech, the Labour leader said: ""No government can prevent every attack. No-one would believe any political leader who said they could. ""But the government can act to make such acts of terror less, rather than more likely."" Mr Corbyn said there needed to be more funding for public services, including probation and mental health. ""That can lead to missed chances to intervene in the lives of people who go on to commit inexcusable acts,"" he said. ""You can't keep people safe on the cheap."" Mr Corbyn told Sky's Sophy Ridge programme terrorists should ""not necessarily"" serve their full sentences automatically, but that it ""depends on circumstances"". This video can not be played Usman Khan speaking to the BBC in 2008: ""I ain't no terrorist"" Both parties have been accused of politicising the attack. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey told Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he was ""alarmed"" at Mr Johnson's reaction to the London Bridge attack. ""In the middle of an election, we shouldn't be making political capital out of a tragedy, and he's doing that, and he's doing that in a way which is misleading people about what the law actually says,"" he said. But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tweeted that those convicted of terror offences ""should never be released"". The father of Jack Merritt, who was a course co-ordinator for Learning Together, said in a now-deleted tweet that his son ""would not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily"". Mr Raab said David Merritt should be listened to, declaring ""nobody wants to see the politicisation of this"". But he added: ""The question is, who is going to make sure that the overriding priority is avoiding any unnecessary risk to the public?"" ""I think if you look at what we're saying on sentencing... it is the Conservatives who are saying we will stop at nothing to keep people safe.""

Jets' sonic boom heard in parts of South East,"Typhoons can travel at twice the speed of sound A sonic boom has woken people and shaken houses across parts of London and the northern Home Counties. People tweeted that a loud ""explosion"" had woken them at about 04:20 GMT - with houses shaking and reports of police sirens straight after. The noise was generated by two Royal Air Force Typhoons, which launched from Coningsby in Lincolnshire and intercepted an unresponsive aircraft. The sonic boom was heard across London, Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. London's Metropolitan Police subsequentlyconfirmed the bang was the result of the RAF aircraft,externalbeing cleared to go faster than the speed of sound. RAF jets are only given permission to go supersonic in emergencies, usually when they are required to intercept another aircraft. Allow Twitter content?

When an aircraft approaches the speed of sound (768mph or 1,236km/h), the air in front of the nose of the plane builds up a pressure front because it has ""nowhere to escape"", said Dr Jim Wild of Lancaster University. A sonic boom happens when that air ""escapes"", creating a ripple effect which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap.

Attack victim had 'lust for life',"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were stabbed to death in Friday's terror attack at London Bridge Tributes have been paid to two friends stabbed to death in Friday's terror attack at London Bridge. Jack Merritt, 25, andSaskia Jones, 23, had been at a conference celebrating the five-year anniversary of theLearning Together prison programmewhen knifeman, 28-year-oldUsman Khan, attacked them and three others. He was shot dead by police minutes after he fatally wounded the University of Cambridge graduates. ""Saskia was a funny, kind, positive influence at the centre of many people's lives,"" the family of Ms Jones said in a statement. ""She had a wonderful sense of mischievous fun and was generous to the point of always wanting to see the best in all people,"" they added. ""She was intent on living life to the full and had a wonderful thirst for knowledge, enabling her to be the best she could be. ""Saskia had a great passion for providing invaluable support to victims of criminal injustice, which led her to the point of recently applying for the police graduate recruitment programme, wishing to specialise in victim support."" London Bridge: What we know so far 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker Attack victim Saskia Jones 'was perfect soul' What is Learning Together? Ms Jones had completed a Masters degree in criminology in 2018. Prof Loraine Gelsthorpe, director of the University of Cambridge's institute of criminology, said Ms Jones had a ""determination to make an enduring and positive impact on society in everything she did"". ""Saskia's warm disposition and extraordinary intellectual creativity was combined with a strong belief that people who have committed criminal offences should have opportunities for rehabilitation,"" she added. Colleen Moore, a former tutor of Ms Jones at Anglia Ruskin University, paid tribute, telling the BBC: ""She was fearless, she was a warrior, she was going to change the world - maybe she will."" She added: ""She stood out above everyone else, partly because she wanted to. She was not afraid to say anything, there was no fooling herâ¦ she said things that she knew would be a bit risky but they were always right."" ""She was a lovely, lovely woman, she made me laugh. She called me out on things - a lot of people were scared of me, she wasn't."" Olivia Smith, a lecturer in criminology who marked Ms Jones' dissertation when she was at Anglia Ruskin, described her as ""one of a kind"" who ""would have been a force for good"". Dr Smith said: ""I'm so sorry that the world won't get to see what she could have achieved. ""Saskia's dissertation was so good that I cried with pride when I marked it."" A friend, Sebastian Lefeuvre, described the young woman's death as senseless. ""She was just the most perfect soul and she's gone,"" he said. Jack Merritt's family said he was a ""friend and colleague"" of Ms Jones. ""Our beautiful, talented boy, died doing what he loved, surrounded by people he loved and who loved him,"" a statement said. ""He lit up our lives and the lives of his many friends and colleagues, and we will miss him terribly. ""Jack lived his principles; he believed in redemption and rehabilitation, not revenge, and he always took the side of the underdog. ""Jack was an intelligent, thoughtful and empathetic person who was looking forward to building a future with his girlfriend, Leanne, and making a career helping people in the criminal justice system. ""We know Jack would not want this terrible, isolated incident to be used as a pretext by the government for introducing even more draconian sentences on prisoners, or for detaining people in prison for longer than necessary. ""Our thoughts go out to the relatives and friends of his friend and colleague who died with him in this incident, to the colleagues who were injured, and to his brilliant, supportive colleagues at the University of Cambridge Department of Criminology."" Mr Merritt had completed the same masters degree Ms Jones had, but a year earlier. He had previously gained a degree in law at the University of Manchester. One woman who called Mr Merritt her ""best mate"" described him in atribute posted on Twitter,externalas ""quite simply the best thing, completely golden"". ""I wanted so much for you. Your life had so much enjoyment in it, and you gave us all so much happiness,"" she wrote. The friend, who calls herself Holl on Twitter, said she went to the pub and ""kept expecting you to turn up, swanky coat, Dr Martens on"". ""I need you to be known for who you were, your beliefs and voice. I'm so angry Jack,"" she said. ""Your voice won't be lost, you will never be lost and I will never let you be forgotten."" She added Mr Merritt ""could have done anything"" but ""you chose to help others, you championed the underdog"". This video can not be played Listen to Jack Merritt speak on a BBC podcast about his work helping inmates at a prison to study law. Prof Gelsthorpe said: ""Jack's passion for social and criminal justice was infectious. He was deeply creative and courageously engaged with the world, advocating for a politics of love. He worked tirelessly in dark places to pull towards the light."" Legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg interviewed Mr Merritt for the BBC in February, when he was working with Learning Together at HMP Warren Hill in Suffolk. Mr Rozenbergdescribed him as,external""a fine young man, dedicated to improving people's lives"". Rapper Dave said Mr Merritt was ""the best guy"" and the news of his death was ""one of the most painful things"".

Hundreds attend service for London Bridge victimsThe Dean of Southwark Cathedral said Friday brought back memories of the terror attack in June 2017.UK,"Jack Merritt was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Saskia Jones was a volunteer on the programme The woman killed in Friday's London Bridge attack has been named by police as Saskia Jones. The 23-year-old Cambridge University graduate, from Stratford-upon-Avon, was fatally stabbed alongside another ex-student, Jack Merritt. The boss of the venue where the attack began which killed the pair said ""the building turned into a nightmare"". Toby Williamson, of Fishmongers' Hall, said staff who fought attacker Usman Khan believed he was wearing a bomb. Two men took chairs, fire extinguishers and narwhal tusks, which were hanging on the wall, to fend off Khan, driving him out of the building. Khan, 28, a convicted terrorist who was released from prison in December 2018, was later shot dead by police on London Bridge. The families of Mr Merritt and Ms Jones have both paid tribute to their loved ones. Jack Merritt's family said he was 'looking forward to building a future with his girlfriend, Leanne' In a statement, Mr Merritt's family described him as a ""talented boy"" who ""died doing what he loved"". ""Jack lived his principles; he believed in redemption and rehabilitation, not revenge, and he always took the side of the underdog. ""Jack was an intelligent, thoughtful and empathetic person. ""We know Jack would not want this terrible, isolated incident to be used as a pretext by the government for introducing even more draconian sentences on prisoners, or for detaining people in prison for longer than necessary,"" the statement read. The family of Saskia Jones said her death ""will leave a huge void in our lives"" Ms Jones' family said their daughter, from Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, had a ""great passion"" for supporting victims of criminal injustice. ""Saskia was a funny, kind, positive influence at the centre of many people's lives,"" the family statement read. ""She had a wonderful sense of mischievous fun and was generous to the point of always wanting to see the best in all people. ""She was intent on living life to the full and had a wonderful thirst for knowledge, enabling her to be the best she could be. ""This is an extremely painful time for the family. Saskia will leave a huge void in our lives and we would request that our privacy is fully respected."" This video can not be played London Bridge attack: 'Pinball bomb with added knives' Cambridge University's vice-chancellor said he was ""devastated to learn that among the victims were staff and alumni"". Professor Stephen J Toope said the victims were taking part in an event ""to mark five years of the university's Learning Together programme"" - which focuses on prisoner rehabilitation. London Bridge attack victim had 'lust for life' 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? What we know about the London Bridge attacker He added: ""What should have been a joyous opportunity to celebrate the achievements of this unique and socially transformative programme, hosted by our Institute of Criminology, was instead disrupted by an unspeakable criminal act. ""Among the three people injured, whose identities have not been publicly released, is a member of university staff. ""Our university condemns this abhorrent and senseless act of terror."" Vice-chancellor Professor Stephen J Toope said he only met Jack Merritt once but was ""impressed by his charm"". Speaking to the BBC, Prof Toope said the fact Mr Merritt was killed by someone he was trying to help ""is the greatest tragedy of all"". ""I have profound sadness for the family,"" he added. ""This is an attack on our community and it was intended, in such, to produce a form of terror and sadness - and it has clearly done that."" This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Speaking about the chain of events inside Fishmongers' Hall on Friday, where Khan launched his fatal attack, chief executive Mr Williamson praised the bravery of his staff who intervened to stop the attacker, hailing their actions as ""extraordinary things done by ordinary people"". ""There was a scream, there was blood. People thought it was an exercise at first,"" Mr Williamson told the BBC. He recounted how two men, named as Lukasz and Andy, ""used fire extinguishers, chairs and narwhal tusks ripped off the wall"" to take the fight back to Khan ""They took a decision, one that enough was enough. They were determined it wasn't going to go on."" ""They are two of the most humble people... but in the heat of the moment, people do extraordinary things. ""I am very proud to know them."" Floral tributes have been laid on the south side of London Bridge Earlier in the day, hundreds attended a service at Southwark Cathedral for the victims of Friday's attack on London Bridge. The Dean of Southwark Cathedral, the Very Revd Andrew Nunn, said many people were struggling with what happened. On Friday, the cathedral was put into lockdown as people ran away from London Bridge. As crowds ran towards the cathedral, Mr Nunn recalled having ""that sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu"", adding that it brought back memories ofthe nearby attack in Borough Market two years ago, which left eight dead and 48 injured. The Dean of Southwark Cathedral said Friday's attack brought back memories of the London Bridge terror attack in 2017 Prayers were held for the victims of the London Bridge attack Speaking at Sunday's service, Mr Nunn said ""memories have been stirred and wounds have been re-opened"". He added: ""What seemed to have been put to the back of people's minds has now been brought to the fore. ""We have to stand with them. We have to help bear their pain but also speak to that pain with words of hope."" Mr Nunn, too, praised the bravery of the people who confronted Khan as he carried out his attack.

Thousands without gas in sub-zero temperatures,"Angelene Perry's children donned blankets and woolly hats as the family struggled to stay warm Thousands of homes could be without heating for ""several days"" after a gas main failure in central Scotland. Gas infrastructure company SGN said about 8,000 properties in the Falkirk area had been left without supplies, SGN engineers were working to fix equipment that regulates gas pressure but warned each property would have to be visited. Electric heaters and cookers were being offered to elderly or sick customers, and those with young children. Temperatures in the Falkirk area were barely above freezing for much of Sunday and were forecast to fall to minus 2C overnight. Falkirk Council said schools may have to close on Monday and it would be working with SGN to care for vulnerable people affected. SGN said it had a large team of engineers working to fix the problem SGN said homes in Bainsford, Carron, Carronshore, Larbert, Langlees, New Carron Village, Skinflats and Stenhousemuir  were affected by a faulty  ""gas governor"" which regulates pressure in the network. Inits latest update,externalit said it would need to visit every property to turn off the gas supply at the meter. ""With so many homes affected, it's likely you could be without your gas supply for several days,"" it added. ""We're sorry for the inconvenience this will cause. We're doing all we can to restore gas supplies to the area as soon as possible. "" A customer information centre at the Camelon Community Centre in Falkirk will be stocked with portable cooking and heating appliances for elderly, disabled and chronically sick customers, as well as those with young children or other special needs. Customers can request the appliances by calling 0800 9121717. One customer, Angelene Perry, who has four young children including a baby, said the family woke on Sunday  morning to find the boiler off and displaying an error message. Gas customers woke to find error messages on their boilers She said: ""It's really cold in the house and we're all huddled in the living room where we've got a small heater. I've dressed the baby in plenty of clothes and a hat. ""I spoke to the gas company and was told a valve had been broken by the cold but they didn't know how long it would take to fix it. ""I think we're going to have to leave here and go to my sister's as we don't have any hot water or anything."" Falkirk Council said it had alerted housing and social work services to be on standby to support SGN and was contacting head teachers to let parents know if schools would be affected. A spokesman said: ""We have a list of vulnerable people in the area so we know were people who may have the most difficulty are."" He said schools could potentially close if the buildings are very cold, though all care homes in affected areas are currently fine. ""We are ready to support SGN in any way we can,"" he added.

Labour says NHS figures show decline in GP services,"Labour has highlighted NHS figures which it claims show a decline of GP services under the Conservatives. The figures show that in October there were six million GP appointments - out of 31 million - for which patients had a wait of more than two weeks. Labour said it was ""yet more damning evidence of the crisis our NHS is in after a decade of Tory cuts"". The Tories responded by highlighting their plans to deliver 50 million more GP appointments by 2024-25 if elected. The figures, from NHS Digital, do not distinguish between those patients who were content to wait for a more routine meeting at their local surgery and those who wanted a more immediate appointment and could not get one. GP numbers in first sustained drop for 50 years More GP appointments freed up by scheme More patients 'struggling to reach GP on phone' The latest data from NHS Digital show that 2.45 million patients waited between 15 and 21 days in October to see a GP or other practice clinician, which was 8.3% of the total number of appointments, compared with 8% in October 2018. Another 1.69 million waited between 22 and 28 days for a GP appointment while 1.66 million waited more than 28 days. In both cases there was an increase in the percentage of patients affected compared to October last year. The overall number of appointments increased to 30.8 million in October 2019 from 29.7 million in the same month the year before. This video can not be played ""You can't get an appointment"" - patients and staff at one GPs' practice Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""More families are struggling to get a GP appointment after the Tories have allowed the numbers of family's doctors in our communities to fall."" He said Labour had a Â£40bn rescue plan to invest in general practice which would see more doctors recruited and provide millions more GP appointments. Labour also quoted new figures on the GP workforce in England which show that the number of fully qualified doctors in general practice had fallen by more than 1,600 since September 2015 to just under 27,000 in September this year. The Conservative government had promised in 2015 to add 5,000 GPs by 2020. However, the Tories refer to a different measure which includes qualified doctors training to be GPs - this group has increased by about 400 since September 2015. Conservatives pledge to boost GP numbers Labour vows to outspend Tories on the NHS Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""It's great news that we've seen an increase in the number of GPs, and that more people are getting a GP appointment the same or next day. He said: ""A Conservative majority government will create 6,000 more GPs and deliver 50 million more GP appointments - to make sure everyone can get the care and treatment they need faster."" Labour has pledged, if elected, to increase the number of GP training places in England from 3,500 to 5,000 a year. The Conservatives say they would raise training places to 4,000 and recruit more GPs from abroad along with measures to boost retention. The Liberal Democrats say they first identified on Thursday - from the NHS' own figures - that the number of GP practices has fallen to a record low. The party accused the Conservatives of failing to keep their promises on GP numbers. It wants to end the GP shortfall within five years, with more training and what they say will be easier foreign recruitment if the UK stays in the EU.

Root & Burns hit centuries for England,"Root's century was his slowest in Test cricket, off 259 balls Second Test, Seddon Park, Hamilton (day three of five): New Zealand 375:Latham 105, Mitchell 73; Broad 4-73 England 269-5:Root 114*, Burns 101 England trail by 106 runs Scorecard Joe Root returned to form as he and Rory Burns hit centuries for England, but the second Test against New Zealand remains in the balance after day three. Root made 114 not out off 278 balls - his first Test century in 15 innings - as England closed on 269-5, 106 behind. Captain Root put on 177 with opener Burns, who reached his second Test ton before being run out for 101. New Zealand fought back with two wickets after tea before rain ended play 45 minutes early in Hamilton. Ben Stokes made an attractive 26, while 21-year-old debutant Zak Crawley fell for one. England will still hope to bat beyond the Black Caps' first-innings 375, before attempting to bowl their hosts out cheaply. However, further rain is forecast on the final day, with England needing to win to draw the two-Test series. 'Root and England needed this century' - Agnew analysis TMS podcast: Hamilton day 3 - Root is back with a century Root made two and 11 in the first-Test defeat at Mount Maunganui and was averaging 27.40 from 10 matches in 2019, form which had seen him drop out of the top 10 of the Test batting rankings for the first time since 2014. He began the day on six and batted very patiently, not playing in his trademark busy fashion until a flurry of boundaries when he reached the nineties. He did not play many memorable shots but did not offer a chance either, the only scare coming when he was given out caught down the leg side on 47. The decision was overturned when replays showed the ball flicked his pad. That said, Root reached his slowest Test hundred in fortuitous fashion, bottom-edging a cut past his stumps then over wicketkeeper BJ Watling for four. The century, his 17th in Tests, has come on a very flat pitch but it will also quieten questions around his batting since taking the captaincy - for a while at least. This is his sixth hundred as captain and his longest innings in terms of balls faced since he succeeded Alastair Cook as skipper. As England faltered late in the day against a disciplined New Zealand attack, Root held firm and will likely need to push on on day four to set up a chance of victory. Burns' hundred is his second in Tests, after making 133 in the first Ashes Test this summer After the innings-and-65-run defeat in the first Test, Root stressed the importance of England batsmen converting starts into hundreds and it will please him that both he and Burns were able to do so. It is the first time England have had two centurions in the same innings of a Test since Alastair Cook's final match in September 2018. Burns, who was dropped twice on day two, was more fluent than Root, although not as solid. He capitalised when New Zealand bowled too short and played a number of pleasing pulls, reaching his century from 208 balls. He was run out two balls later, ambling the first run and falling a couple of inches short when he opted not to dive for his ground. Still, Burns' stand with Root was the first time England have had a partnership over 150 since Cook's retirement, and further enhances his reputation at the top of the order. After Burns' departure it looked like the in-form Stokes would continue to build England's score, but he was well taken by Ross Taylor at slip off a fine delivery from Southee which seamed away. Kent opener Crawley, batting at number six, was almost run out as he scampered his first run in Test cricket before Neil Wagner found the outside edge with one angled across him. England opener Rory Burns on BBC Test Match Special:""It's pleasing to get the hundred. I'd like to still be out there. It was a disappointing end to it, but I'm pretty happy with how I played. ""I knew I had to get some things right from last night. I tried to do that overnight in terms of my mindset and how I was going about it. I got my tempo and rhythm back to how I wanted to bat."" Former England batsman and batting coach Mark Ramprakash:""I really liked the way Root played today. The risk was very low. He kept the ball on the ground, he waited for the long half-volley and his pull shots were well executed. ""The style of Root's innings has almost become alien. A lot of players these days play cricket in fast-forward mode."" New Zealand bowler Tim Southee:""It was a docile pitch throughout. Burns and Root played nicely but the run-out opened up a little bit of an end for us. ""We got a couple of rewards late in the day and if we pick up a couple tomorrow, who knows?""

Labour plans central train ticket bookings,"Train ticket sales could be transformed under Labour plans for a central online booking portal. The party wants to replace what it sees as a confusing system of sales by private train operators - with around 55 million types of fare available. Instead, it is proposing a ""one-stop shop"" for fares with no booking fees if it wins the election on 12 December. The proposal is part of broader plans by the party to nationalise the UK's train system. Labour says nationalisation - which it plans to achieve within five years of coming to power - will allow fares to be capped and improve the reliability of services. The plan to introduce a ticketing service to simplify rail ticket sales could create a competitor to existing third party ticket sellers such as Trainline, which floated on the London Stock Exchange in June. Labour says passengers can already buy tickets directly from train companies, and that nationalisation would just simplify the process. Its regional manifestos contain a number of transport pledges to be paid for by aÂ£250bn Green Transformation Fund- a pot of money raised through borrowing - such as: Northern Powerhouse Rail - improving connections between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Hull, and Newcastle, and cutting journey times Investment in the Midlands Mainline railway Electrification of lines around Bristol Temple Meads The price of rail tickets isset to rise by an average of 2.7% from 2 January, industry body the Rail Delivery Group announced this week. A spokesperson said: ""While apps and websites perform a useful function, they are limited by only being able to offer the same confusing and sometimes contradictory range of fares as today, because these were baked in to the system in the mid-1990s. ""That's why train companies have put forward proposals to reform underlying regulations and make ticket buying simpler and easier for passengers."" Independent watchdog Transport Focus said a majority of rail users did not feel they were getting value for money. The Conservatives are promising to improve transport links as part ofa Â£3.6bn Towns Fund. They have also promised to give more funding to local combined authorities to improve bus and train services and put Â£500m into reversing cuts to the railway network made in the 1960s. The Liberal Democratshave also made pledges on transport, promising to freeze peak time and season ticket train fares, and to complete the HS2 rail project. The SNPwant more powers devolved to Scotland, including on transport. The Brexit Party's flagship transport policy is scrapping the HS2 high-speed rail link - a goal it shares with the Green Party.

"Merkel ally's loss casts doubt on German coalitionOlaf Scholz, Angela Merkel's deputy chancellor, is soundly beaten in the SPD leadership race.Europe","Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken are from the leftist contingent of the SPD The future of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition has been thrown into doubt after her deputy chancellor lost the leadership race of his party. Olaf Scholz, who is also finance minister, lost his bid to become leader of the centre-left SPD. The party is now expected to vote on whether to stay in the coalition with Ms Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU. Mr Scholz's joint challengers, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, have been highly critical of the coalition. Elsewhere on Saturday, the far-right AfD, which is the biggest opposition party in the German parliament, elected Tino Chrupalla, a lawmaker from eastern Germany, to lead the party along with Joerg Meuthen. Mr Scholz and his running mate Klara Geywitz, who back staying in the coalition until 2021, received just 45.3% of the vote, while their challengers won 53%. Mr Walter-Borjans and Ms Esken, relative unknowns from the party's leftist contingent, have said they want to renegotiate the coalition deal with Ms Merkel's conservatives to focus more on social justice and investment. Is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer Merkel 2.0? Merkel bids emotional farewell to party Mr Scholz said the SPD must now ""stand behind the new leadership"". This video can not be played How Angela Merkel rose to power to lead Germany Paul Ziemiak, general secretary of the CDU (whose Bavarian sister party is the CSU), said ""the decision today has changed nothing"" about the alliance. Poor election results and mixed views of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who replaced Ms Merkel as CDU leader in 2018, have led to discontent within the party. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer replaced Angela Merkel as CDU leader in December 2018 Some have said a snap election or a minority government could be on the cards. Mrs Merkel has said she will not run again in 2021 after 14 years at the helm of the country.

Malta businessman charged over journalist murder,"Yorgen Fenech has been repeatedly questioned Maltese businessman Yorgen Fenech has been charged with complicity in the murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2017. He pleaded not guilty to that charge and four others others including membership of a criminal gang. Relatives of the assassinated blogger were present in the court in Valletta. The investigation into Caruana Galizia's death has rocked the island's government. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat is under pressure to resign. His chief aide, Keith Schembri,quit this week amid reports he was being questioned by police, while Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi also resigned and Economy Minister Chris Cardona took the decision to suspend himself. The murder that could bring down Malta's government Malta leaders barred from blogger funeral Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Three people are awaiting trial for Caruana Galizia's murder in a car bombing but the police investigation is now focusing on who ordered the killing and why. He has been repeatedly questioned over the killing since trying to leave the island on his yacht on 20 November, and sought a pardon in return for providing information but his request was rejected. Maltese media allege he was familiar with Melvin Theuma, a taxi driver with links to criminal enterprises who has been described in local media as a potential ""middleman"" in the murder. Caruana Galizia reported on allegations relating to the Panama Papers before her death Mr Fenech is a well-known figure in Malta who has served as head of the Tumas business group and a director of energy company Electrogas but recently resigned from both positions. He was identified last year as being the owner of a mysterious Dubai-registered company, 17 Black. The company was listed in the Panama Papers - confidential documents leaked from a Panamanian law firm in 2016 which revealed how the wealthy and powerful use tax havens to get around the law. Caruana Galizia had written about 17 Black eight months before her death, alleging it had links to both Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi. By Damian Grammaticas, BBC Europe correspondent, Valletta Such has been the sensitivity of this case that Malta's main courthouse was opened specially, late in the evening for this hearing. Yorgen Fenech, one of Malta's richest men, was brought in under police guard. The family of the murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, her parents, her sister, her husband and three sons were all in court. They heard Mr Fenech deny charges of complicity in Ms Caruana Galizia's murder, of membership of a criminal gang, and conspiracy in planting the car bomb that killed her. Outside court Ms Caruana Galizia's family said it was now time for Mr Muscat to resign as the allegations of shady dealing stretch to those around him. So far, though, Mr Muscat has refused to go. Investigations into Caruana Galizia's murder intensified when Mr Theuma was pardoned on Monday. The prime minister told parliament he was being given immunity in return for information about the killing. Maltese reports suggested he had audio recordings linked to the case. This video can not be played Galizia's son, Paul, in 2018 called for a public inquiry over his mother's death On Tuesday, Konrad Mizzi resigned and Chris Cardona took the decision to suspend himself after being questioned by police.

Both deny wrongdoing. Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017.

Labour say NHS figures show decline in GP services,"Labour has highlighted NHS figures which it claims show a decline of GP services under the Conservatives. The figures show that in October there were six million GP appointments - out of 31 million - for which patients had a wait of more than two weeks. Labour said it was ""yet more damning evidence of the crisis our NHS is in after a decade of Tory cuts"". The Tories responded by highlighting their plans to deliver 50 million more GP appointments by 2024-25 if elected. The figures, from NHS Digital, do not distinguish between those patients who were content to wait for a more routine meeting at their local surgery and those who wanted a more immediate appointment and could not get one. GP numbers in first sustained drop for 50 years More GP appointments freed up by scheme More patients 'struggling to reach GP on phone' The latest data from NHS Digital show that 2.45 million patients waited between 15 and 21 days in October to see a GP or other practice clinician, which was 8.3% of the total number of appointments, compared with 8% in October 2018. Another 1.69 million waited between 22 and 28 days for a GP appointment while 1.66 million waited more than 28 days. In both cases there was an increase in the percentage of patients affected compared to October last year. The overall number of appointments increased to 30.8 million in October 2019 from 29.7 million in the same month the year before. This video can not be played ""You can't get an appointment"" - patients and staff at one GPs' practice Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""More families are struggling to get a GP appointment after the Tories have allowed the numbers of family's doctors in our communities to fall."" He said Labour had a Â£40bn rescue plan to invest in general practice which would see more doctors recruited and provide millions more GP appointments. Labour also quoted new figures on the GP workforce in England which show that the number of fully qualified doctors in general practice had fallen by more than 1,600 since September 2015 to just under 27,000 in September this year. The Conservative government had promised in 2015 to add 5,000 GPs by 2020. However, the Tories refer to a different measure which includes qualified doctors training to be GPs - this group has increased by about 400 since September 2015. Conservatives pledge to boost GP numbers Labour vows to outspend Tories on the NHS Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""It's great news that we've seen an increase in the number of GPs, and that more people are getting a GP appointment the same or next day. He said: ""A Conservative majority government will create 6,000 more GPs and deliver 50 million more GP appointments - to make sure everyone can get the care and treatment they need faster."" Labour has pledged, if elected, to increase the number of GP training places in England from 3,500 to 5,000 a year. The Conservatives say they would raise training places to 4,000 and recruit more GPs from abroad along with measures to boost retention. The Liberal Democrats say they first identified on Thursday - from the NHS' own figures - that the number of GP practices has fallen to a record low. The party accused the Conservatives of failing to keep their promises on GP numbers. It wants to end the GP shortfall within five years, with more training and what they say will be easier foreign recruitment if the UK stays in the EU.

Loud sonic boom shakes houses across north London,"Typhoons can travel at twice the speed of sound A sonic boom has woken people and shaken houses across parts of London and the northern Home Counties. People tweeted that a loud ""explosion"" had woken them at about 04:20 GMT - with houses shaking and reports of police sirens straight after. The noise was generated by two Royal Air Force Typhoons, which launched from Coningsby in Lincolnshire and intercepted an unresponsive aircraft. The sonic boom was heard across London, Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. London's Metropolitan Police subsequentlyconfirmed the bang was the result of the RAF aircraft,externalbeing cleared to go faster than the speed of sound.

PM to appear on Marr after London attack 'Get off and run': Witnesses describe the scene On a visit to the attack site, the prime minister said the practice of cutting jail sentences in half and letting violent offenders out early ""simply isn't working"". Mr Johnson vowed to ""toughen up sentences"", while Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said there were questions to be answered. But Mr Merritt's father said, in a now deleted post, on Twitter: ""My son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily."" Political parties cancelled some events on Saturday, which had been planned ahead of the general election on 12 December. Flags on UK government buildings were flown at half-mast on Saturday as a mark of respect to all those affected by the attack.

""We send our thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies to all those who have lost loved ones and who have been affected by yesterday's terrible violence."" London Bridge was the scene of another attack, on 3 June 2017, in which eight people were killed and many more injured. The Dean of Southwark Cathedral, the Very Revd Andrew Nunn, said Friday's events had brought back memories.

Government reviews terrorists' prison release,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says about 74 convicted terrorists have been released early from prison Boris Johnson has told the BBC that 74 people jailed for terror offences and released early will have their licence conditions reviewed. The Ministry of Justice launched the urgent review after convicted terrorist Usman Khan, who had served half of his sentence,killed two people in a knife attack at London Bridge on Friday. The prime minister claimed scrapping early release would have stopped him. But Labour is blaming budget cuts for ""missed chances to intervene"". Friday's attack was brought to an end when police shot Khan dead. London Bridge sentencing row - who did what? Second London Bridge victim named as Saskia Jones London Bridge attack victim had 'lust for life' Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? The 28-year-old had been jailed in 2012 over a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange. He was given a special jail term known as Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), which meant he would serve at least eight years and could not be released unless he had convinced the Parole Board he was no longer a threat. But in 2013,the Court of Appeal replaced the sentencewith a 16-year-fixed term of which Khan should serve half in prison. He was released on licence in December 2018 - subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"", police said. Mr Johnsontold the BBC's Andrew Marr showit was ""repulsive"" that someone as ""dangerous"" as Khan could be released from prison after ""only serving eight years"". He blamed Khan's release on legislation introduced under ""a leftie government"", insisting the automatic release scheme was introduced by Labour - but was challenged about what the Conservatives had done to change the law over the past 10 years in government. ""Now that I am prime minister I'm going to take steps to make sure that people are not released early when they commit... serious sexual, violent or terrorist offences,"" he said. ""I absolutely deplore the that fact that this man was out on the streets... and we are going to take action against it."" Mr Johnson said there were ""probably about 74 people"" convicted of serious offences who had been released early - a figure confirmed by the Ministry of Justice. The prime minister said action had been taken immediately following London Bridge attack ""to ensure there is no threat to the public"". In a separate development, a 34-year-old man was arrested on Sunday at his home address in Stoke-on-Trent on suspicion of the preparation of terrorist acts, the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit said. There is no information to suggest that the arrested man was involved in the incident at London Bridge on Friday, the unit added. But the arrest was made as part of ""a wider on-going review of existing licence conditions of convicted terrorism offenders"". This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons One of the people Khan killed has been named by police as25-year-old Jack Merritt. The second victim has been named as Saskia Jones, a 23-year-old Cambridge University student. One of the three other people injured was a member of staff from the university. NHS London has said two victims remain in a stable condition in hospital, while a third has been discharged. They were all attending an event to mark five years of the Learning Together programme - which gives students and inmates the opportunity to study together to help reduce re-offending. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab earlier said the Conservative Party had a new policy to enforce a minimum sentence of 14 years for a person convicted of serious terrorist offences. But Prof Ian Acheson - who advised the government on how to handle extremist prisoners in 2016 - told BBC Radio 4'sThe World This Weekendit was not ""a question of an arms race on sentencing toughness"", but about what is done when offenders are in custody. He said 68 of the 69 recommendations he had made around the treatment and risk management of prisoners were agreed by the then Justice Secretary Michael Gove. But he claimed they had not been implemented due to ""the merry-go-round of political replacements of secretaries of state"", and the ""fairly recalcitrant and unwilling bureaucracy"" it created. Prof Acheson also criticised ""crazy failed and ideological austerity cuts"" to the police, prison and probation services. 2003- The Criminal Justice Act meant most offenders would be automatically released halfway through sentences, but the most ""dangerous"" would have their cases looked at by a Parole Board. Sentences with no fixed end point, called Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), were also introduced. 2008-  Criminal Justice and Immigration Act removed review process by Parole Boards, meaning more offenders were released automatically halfway through sentences. Judges could still hand down life sentences or IPPs for dangerous offenders. 2012- Usman Khan was handed a sentence with no fixed end date because of the risk he posed to the public. In the same year, the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act scrapped IPPs and reintroduced the role of the Parole Board for extended sentences of 10 years or more - this time after two-thirds of the sentence has passed. But that did not mean those already serving IPPs would have them lifted. 2013- During an appeal, Lord Justice Leveson ruled that Khan's indeterminate sentence should be substituted for an extended sentence with automatic release at the halfway point. At an event in York, Jeremy Corbyn called for an inquiry into ""everything surrounding"" Khan, including his sentence and what happened to him in prison.

Government reviews terrorists' prison releaseThe London Bridge attack sparks a review of the licence conditions of terrorists released from jail.,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says about 74 convicted terrorists have been released early from prison Boris Johnson has told the BBC that 74 people jailed for terror offences and released early will have their licence conditions reviewed. The Ministry of Justice launched the urgent review after convicted terrorist Usman Khan, who had served half of his sentence,killed two people in a knife attack at London Bridge on Friday. The prime minister claimed scrapping early release would have stopped him. But Labour is blaming budget cuts for ""missed chances to intervene"". Friday's attack was brought to an end when police shot Khan dead. London Bridge sentencing row - who did what? Second London Bridge victim named as Saskia Jones London Bridge attack victim had 'lust for life' Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? The 28-year-old had been jailed in 2012 over a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange. He was given a special jail term known as Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), which meant he would serve at least eight years and could not be released unless he had convinced the Parole Board he was no longer a threat. But in 2013,the Court of Appeal replaced the sentencewith a 16-year-fixed term of which Khan should serve half in prison. He was released on licence in December 2018 - subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"", police said. Mr Johnsontold the BBC's Andrew Marr showit was ""repulsive"" that someone as ""dangerous"" as Khan could be released from prison after ""only serving eight years"". He blamed Khan's release on legislation introduced under ""a leftie government"", insisting the automatic release scheme was introduced by Labour - but was challenged about what the Conservatives had done to change the law over the past 10 years in government. ""Now that I am prime minister I'm going to take steps to make sure that people are not released early when they commit... serious sexual, violent or terrorist offences,"" he said. ""I absolutely deplore the that fact that this man was out on the streets... and we are going to take action against it."" Mr Johnson said there were ""probably about 74 people"" convicted of serious offences who had been released early - a figure confirmed by the Ministry of Justice. The prime minister said action had been taken immediately following London Bridge attack ""to ensure there is no threat to the public"". In a separate development, a 34-year-old man was arrested on Sunday at his home address in Stoke-on-Trent on suspicion of the preparation of terrorist acts, the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit said. There is no information to suggest that the arrested man was involved in the incident at London Bridge on Friday, the unit added. But the arrest was made as part of ""a wider on-going review of existing licence conditions of convicted terrorism offenders"". This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons One of the people Khan killed has been named by police as25-year-old Jack Merritt. The second victim has been named as Saskia Jones, a 23-year-old Cambridge University student. One of the three other people injured was a member of staff from the university. NHS London has said two victims remain in a stable condition in hospital, while a third has been discharged. They were all attending an event to mark five years of the Learning Together programme - which gives students and inmates the opportunity to study together to help reduce re-offending. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab earlier said the Conservative Party had a new policy to enforce a minimum sentence of 14 years for a person convicted of serious terrorist offences. But Prof Ian Acheson - who advised the government on how to handle extremist prisoners in 2016 - told BBC Radio 4'sThe World This Weekendit was not ""a question of an arms race on sentencing toughness"", but about what is done when offenders are in custody. He said 68 of the 69 recommendations he had made around the treatment and risk management of prisoners were agreed by the then Justice Secretary Michael Gove. But he claimed they had not been implemented due to ""the merry-go-round of political replacements of secretaries of state"", and the ""fairly recalcitrant and unwilling bureaucracy"" it created. Prof Acheson also criticised ""crazy failed and ideological austerity cuts"" to the police, prison and probation services. 2003- The Criminal Justice Act meant most offenders would be automatically released halfway through sentences, but the most ""dangerous"" would have their cases looked at by a Parole Board. Sentences with no fixed end point, called Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), were also introduced. 2008-  Criminal Justice and Immigration Act removed review process by Parole Boards, meaning more offenders were released automatically halfway through sentences. Judges could still hand down life sentences or IPPs for dangerous offenders. 2012- Usman Khan was handed a sentence with no fixed end date because of the risk he posed to the public. In the same year, the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act scrapped IPPs and reintroduced the role of the Parole Board for extended sentences of 10 years or more - this time after two-thirds of the sentence has passed. But that did not mean those already serving IPPs would have them lifted. 2013- During an appeal, Lord Justice Leveson ruled that Khan's indeterminate sentence should be substituted for an extended sentence with automatic release at the halfway point. At an event in York, Jeremy Corbyn called for an inquiry into ""everything surrounding"" Khan, including his sentence and what happened to him in prison. But he warned against ""knee-jerk legislation"", saying the country could ""pay a price later"".

"'Turn off your engine, get out and run'Parties row over early release of bridge attacker","Witnesses described armed police arriving at the scene and shooting a man ""A police officer came up to me and said 'turn off your engine, get out and run'."" Mustafa Salih was behind the wheel of a bus heading towards London Bridge when he was ordered to join the crowds fleeing a sudden violent attack at one of the city's most well-known locations. That was the moment he realised the bridge had been targeted for the second time in three years. Mr Salih joined scores running from the scene wheretwo people had been stabbed to death and the suspected attacker shot dead by police. Just before 14:00 GMT bars and restaurants on the south side of the bridge had been filling up with tourists and office workers. In an instant that all changed - and London Bridge was in lockdown yet again. Mr Salih, 62, was travelling from Borough High Street when he saw a stream of people, including some in tears, running towards him. ""A police officer came up to me and said 'turn off your engine, get out and run',"" he said. ""I looked up and I could see a crowd of people coming towards me. One woman was crying. It was all very scary as we did not know what was happening."" This video can not be played Video shows the moment before a man was apparently shot by police on London Bridge Nurse Jackie Bensfield, 32, described how she asked to be let off a bus on the bridge after she heard gunshots. Ms Bensfield, who was on her way home from work, said she got off the bus and ""ran like hell"" to escape the shots. Another witness, Connor Allen, who was in his van on the bridge at the time, said: ""Everyone just started running, you heard these pops and that was it. ""We just got out [of] the van and started running."" London Bridge: What we know so far 'Heroes' praised for confronting attacker Follow the latest updates Shop worker Juan Rios, 35, realised something was wrong when he ""heard people running and screaming"" and a noise that sounded ""like popcorn"".

Afterwards the police came and told us to evacuate."" Juan Rios described hearing a sound like ""popcorn"" coming from the direction of Borough Market The bridge remains cordoned off, while nearby Borough Market has also been blocked off by officers and no-one is being allowed through towards the crime scene. Businesses have been evacuated of shoppers but there is a constant flow of police officers heading into - and out of - the cordon. London Bridge station was closed and restaurants and bars which had been filling up earlier - and would normally be a hive of activity on a Friday night - were empty. Workers are being allowed to leave down Borough High Street, but no-one is being allowed through towards the scene of the incident. Residents have been told to find elsewhere to stay as the police cordon remains in place around the London Bridge area. Meanwhile, the November night sky is lit up by blue flashing lights, and a helicopter continues to hover overhead. Shop worker David Lockwood was among those caught up in the incident.

Parties row over early release of bridge attackerHome Secretary Priti Patel clashes with Labour's Yvette Cooper over Usman Khan's prison release.UK,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel visited the scene at London Bridge A row has erupted between the home secretary and a former government minister over the early release of the London Bridge attacker, Usman Khan. Khan, who was released from prison on licence in December 2018, was shot dead by police during Friday's attack. Labour's Yvette Cooper said the government were ""warned about the risks"" of ending Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP). But Priti Patel blamed legislation brought in by Labour in 2008. The IPP regime, which was brought in bythe then Home Secretary David Blunkettto protect the public from dangerous prisoners, was scrapped by the coalition government in 2012. In a series of tweets,external, Ms Cooper, shadow home secretary from 2011-2015, said the government was ""warned"" about the risks of ending IPPs citing a ""lack of resources for probation, monitoring and rehabilitation"". The home secretary responded to Ms Cooper on Twitter, saying the law was changed ""to end Labour's automatic release policy"". Ms Patel added that Khan was convicted before the Labour legislation was changed by the Tories in 2012. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The row comes after Ms Patel joined Prime Minister Boris Johnson at London Bridge where two people were killed by Khan on Friday. Khan, 28, was convicted of a terrorism offence in 2012. He was released from prison in December last year, after agreeing to wear an electronic tag. Visiting the site of Friday's stabbings, the PM vowed to ""toughen up sentences"". Mr Johnson said: ""I've said for a long time now, that I think the practice of automatic, early release where we cut a sentence in half and let really serious and violent offenders out early, simply isn't working. ""And I think you've had some very good evidence of how that isn't working, I'm afraid, with this case,"" he added. Two people were killed in the attack and another three were taken to hospital for stab injuries Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there were questions to be answered. ""I think there is also a question about what the Probation Office were doing - were they involved at all? ""Whether the Parole Board should have been involved in deciding whether or not he should have been allowed to be released from prison in the first place, and also what happened in prison?"" The Parole Board said it had no involvement in the 28-year-old's release, saying Khan ""appears to have been released automatically on licence (as required by law)"". Ms Patel backed up the Parole Board's comments, with a tweet claiming they ""could not be involved"" in the decision to release Khan because of Labour's change to the law in 2008.

In 2012,Khan was sentenced to indeterminate detention for ""public protection"" with a minimum jail term of eight yearsafter being convicted for his part in a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange. This sentence would have allowed him to be kept in prison beyond the minimum term. 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker What we know about the London Bridge attacker But in 2013, the Court of Appeal quashed the sentence, replacing it with a 16-year-fixed term of which Khan should serve half in prison. He was released on licence in December 2018. Khan was living in Stafford and wearing a GPS police tag when he launched his attack on Friday, in which a man and a woman were killed and three others were injured. A house in Stafford linked to Usman Khan has been searched by officers As part of his release conditions, Khan was obliged to take part in the government's desistance and disengagement programme - the purpose of which is the rehabilitation of people who have been involved in terrorism. Friday's attack started inside Fishmongers' Hall where the 28-year-old was attending a rehabilitation event for convicted prisoners run by the University of Cambridge. Former chief crown prosecutor Nazir Afzal said he repeatedly warned Mr Johnson of the risk posed by convicted terrorists being released from prison while still radicalised. Mr Afzal said: ""He asked me what keeps me awake at night and I told him it was this issue. ""When he wanted to know what to do about it, I told him it was more resources for one-to-one de-radicalisation. ""Back then, he hadn't found the 'money tree' so he frustratingly said there was no money."" The Prime Minister said: ""A great deal of working is being done to make sure the public is protected.""

Labour say NHS figures show decline in GP servicesThe NHS Digital figures show a rise in patients having to wait more than two weeks in October.Election 2019The extraordinary mission of Robert Stivey,"Labour has highlighted NHS figures which it claims show a decline of GP services under the Conservatives. The figures show that in October there were six million GP appointments - out of 31 million - for which patients had a wait of more than two weeks. Labour said it was ""yet more damning evidence of the crisis our NHS is in after a decade of Tory cuts"". The Tories responded by highlighting their plans to deliver 50 million more GP appointments by 2024-25 if elected. The figures, from NHS Digital, do not distinguish between those patients who were content to wait for a more routine meeting at their local surgery and those who wanted a more immediate appointment and could not get one. GP numbers in first sustained drop for 50 years More GP appointments freed up by scheme More patients 'struggling to reach GP on phone' The latest data from NHS Digital show that 2.45 million patients waited between 15 and 21 days in October to see a GP or other practice clinician, which was 8.3% of the total number of appointments, compared with 8% in October 2018. Another 1.69 million waited between 22 and 28 days for a GP appointment while 1.66 million waited more than 28 days. In both cases there was an increase in the percentage of patients affected compared to October last year. The overall number of appointments increased to 30.8 million in October 2019 from 29.7 million in the same month the year before. This video can not be played ""You can't get an appointment"" - patients and staff at one GPs' practice Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""More families are struggling to get a GP appointment after the Tories have allowed the numbers of family's doctors in our communities to fall."" He said Labour had a Â£40bn rescue plan to invest in general practice which would see more doctors recruited and provide millions more GP appointments. Labour also quoted new figures on the GP workforce in England which show that the number of fully qualified doctors in general practice had fallen by more than 1,600 since September 2015 to just under 27,000 in September this year. The Conservative government had promised in 2015 to add 5,000 GPs by 2020. However, the Tories refer to a different measure which includes qualified doctors training to be GPs - this group has increased by about 400 since September 2015. Conservatives pledge to boost GP numbers Labour vows to outspend Tories on the NHS Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""It's great news that we've seen an increase in the number of GPs, and that more people are getting a GP appointment the same or next day. He said: ""A Conservative majority government will create 6,000 more GPs and deliver 50 million more GP appointments - to make sure everyone can get the care and treatment they need faster."" Labour has pledged, if elected, to increase the number of GP training places in England from 3,500 to 5,000 a year. The Conservatives say they would raise training places to 4,000 and recruit more GPs from abroad along with measures to boost retention. The Liberal Democrats say they first identified on Thursday - from the NHS' own figures - that the number of GP practices has fallen to a record low. The party accused the Conservatives of failing to keep their promises on GP numbers. It wants to end the GP shortfall within five years, with more training and what they say will be easier foreign recruitment if the UK stays in the EU.

Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison?,"London Bridge attacker Usman Khan came to the attention of counter-terrorism investigators because he was involved in a highly active cell around Stoke-on-Trent, part of a wider network of radicals then headed bythe preacher Anjem Choudary. MI5 and the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit had intelligence that a group of nine men from London, Cardiff and Stoke, including Khan, wanted to bomb the London Stock Exchange. The plot was supremely incompetent and amateur. Khan also wanted to set up a terrorism training ""madrassah"", or school, in Kashmir to train a new generation of British militants to either fight out there or bring their skills home. Khan and the others were convicted and jailed in 2012- and the ultimate dilemma for the authorities was whether the men were simply fantasists who, hopefully, would grow up. London Bridge attacker had terror conviction What we know about the London Bridge attacker London Bridge: What we know so far The West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit and MI5 team who worked on the investigation had no doubt the men were dangerous - even if they did not have capability. And while Mr Justice Wilkie, the judge presiding over the case, received a letter from Khan saying he had recanted, he had his own doubts - not  least because of the nature of the conversations that had been caught during surveillance. The judge gave Khan a special prison term known as Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP). That meant he would serve at least eight years and could not be released unless he had convinced the Parole Board he was no longer a threat. Some of the other members of the cell received a sentence which dealt with their dangerousness differently. They would serve the second half of it in the community on a licence to monitor their behaviour. And following that, additional years of monitoring. When Khan appealed against his sentence, senior judges agreed he should have been treated the same way as his co-defendants. Usman Khan, circled, with his fellow defendants in a surveillance image released by police in 2012 His IPP was replaced by the same extended sentence (reflecting dangerousness) given to some of the others, meaning he would definitely still spend eight years in jail before release and monitoring. If he broke the licence he could be immediately sent back to prison. Khan had also been asking to join a deradicalisation programme - including sending a letter in October 2012 asking for the Home Office to provide someone to work with him. His solicitor, Vajahat Sharif, has told the BBC that Khan repeatedly asked him for help in finding someone. Mr Sharif said he wanted a very specific jihadist ideology expert to work with his client because he feared Khan's hate was so deeply-rooted. This video can not be played London Bridge attacker ""wanted to deradicalise"" at time of conviction - lawyer So while he may have received some help, his lawyer, for one, thinks it was not enough. When Khan was released on licence, he was subject to a variety of forms of management in the community, as is largely standard for terrorism offenders: Khan was wearing a GPS tag to monitor his specific movements He was sent to a bail hostel in Staffordshire where his comings and goings could be supervised It's likely - but unconfirmed - that he was banned from speaking to his former associates And he was obliged to take part in the government's ""Desistance and Disengagement Programme"" (DDP) DDP is now a key part of the counter-terrorism strategy and involves tailored counselling and psychological intervention in the lives of terrorism convicts leaving jail. More than 100 individuals went through the course between the beginning of its trial in October 2016 and September 2018. There is now funding in place to accommodate up to 230 individuals a year. The scheme aims to address many of the triggers that lead someone to turn against society - from a personal identity crisis and chronic self-esteem problems, through to personal grievances and immersion in extremist ideology. One of Khan's associates, jailed alongside him in 2012, was Mohibur Rahman. He attended a deradicalisation course while in jail - but he also met other extremists inside. He was subsequently released and then jailed for life for his part inan embryonic plan to carry out a vehicle and knife attack in Birmingham. Mohibur Rahman (left) alongside fellow defendant Tahir Aziz The end of that plot was a major win for the police and MI5 - but it also involved two other former terrorism prisoners who had not changed their ways. Each regional counter-terrorism unit is also supposed to take an interest in the activity of released individuals on their patch. Khan would have required police permission to travel to London before his attack so as to not trigger an alert. On Saturday, Scotland Yard said Khan was, to the best of their knowledge, complying with all his release conditions. MI5 may have been monitoring Khan too, as it has a role in looking at prisoners leaving jail - although they are typically considered a low risk because it takes time for them to re-engage. And so the biggest problem is knowing for sure that someone has reformed - even if they have been on a deradicalisation programme.

Facebook bows to Singapore's 'fake news' lawIt is the first time the social media giant has added a correction to a post under the new law.,"Facebook said it was following the law by adding the correction label Facebook has added a correction notice to a post that Singapore's government said contained false information. It is the first time Facebook has issued such a notice under the city-state's controversial ""fake news"" law. Singapore claimed the post, by fringe news site States Times Review (STR), contained ""scurrilous accusations"". The note issued by the social media giant said it ""is legally required to tell you that the Singapore government says this post has false information"". Facebook's addition was embedded at the bottom of the original post, which was not altered. It was only visible to social media users in Singapore. Singapore passes controversial fake news law Concern over Singapore's anti-fake news law Singapore: What you need to know In an emailed statement to the BBC, Facebook said it had applied a label to a post ""determined by the Singapore government to contain false information"", as required under the ""fake news"" law. The company - which has its Asia headquarters in the city-state - said it hoped assurances that the law would not impact on free expression ""will lead to a measured and transparent approach to implementation"". The States Times Review post contained accusations about the arrest of an alleged whistleblower and election-rigging. The governmentsaid no one had been arrested,external, and accused the STR of making ""scurrilous accusations against the elections department, the prime minister, and the election process in Singapore"". A post on the Singaporean government website said the STR post contained false statements Authorities ordered editor Alex Tan to correct the post but the Australian citizen refused, saying he would ""not comply with any order from a foreign government,external"". Authorities then called on Facebook to ""publish a correction notice"" in line with the ""fake news"" law passed earlier this year. The law, known as the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation bill, came into effect in October. It allows the government to order online platforms to remove and correct what it deems to be false statements that are ""against the public interest"". A person found guilty of doing this in Singapore could be fined heavily and face a prison sentence of up to five years. The law also bans the use of fake accounts or bots to spread fake news - this carries penalties of up to S$1m (Â£563,000, $733,700) and a jail term of up to 10 years. Critics say the law threatens freedom of expression. Amnesty International said it would ""give authorities unchecked powers to clamp down on online views of which it disapproves"". But Singapore's law minister said free speech ""should not be affected by this bill"", adding that it was aimed only at tackling ""falsehoods, bots, trolls and fake accounts"". The government has argued that the law safeguards against abuse of power by allowing judicial reviews of its orders. Singapore's government invoked the law for the first time on Monday to order opposition politician Brad Bowyer to correct a Facebook post questioning the independence of state investment funds. Mr Bowyer complied, adding a note to the post saying it ""contains false statements of fact"". On the same day, Mr Bowyer wrote a new post saying he was ""not against being asked to make clarifications or corrections especially if it is in the public interest"". But on Thursday, Mr Bowyerclarified his earlier statement,external, saying: ""Although I have no problems in following the law...that does not mean that I agree with the position they are taking or admit to any false statements on my part."" He also said that, under the law, he must post the correction notice ""regardless of whether I make an appeal"".
