Sunak accused of wasting Â£11bn servicing debt,"Rishi Sunak has been accused of failing to act to save billions of taxpayers' money that has been used to pay interest on government debt. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank said the losses were due to the Treasury failing to insure against interest rate rises. It meant higher than necessary payments on Â£900bn of reserves created through the quantitative easing (QE) programme. The Treasury said it was the Bank of England's role to decide QE measures. The Bank of England is independent from the Treasury. The Treasury said NIESR's proposal would undermine this independence and be ""hugely damaging"" to the credibility of how public finances were managed. ""Proposals such as this risk undermining the independence of the Bank of England and forcing commercial banks to swap reserves for gilts would be an act of financial repression,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. NIESR's Prof Jagjit Chadha,told the Financial Times,externalthat Mr Sunak's failure to act had left the country with ""an enormous bill and heavy continuing exposure to interest rate risk"". The Bank of England created Â£895bn of moneythrough quantitative easing. Most of this was used to buy government bonds from pension funds and other investors. When those investors put the proceeds in commercial bank deposits at the Bank, it had to pay interest at its official interest rate. Last year, when the official rate was still 0.1%, NIESR said the government should have insured the cost of servicing this debt against the risk of rising interest rates. It said interest payments have ""now become much more expensive"" and it estimatesthe loss over the past year at around Â£11bn,external. ""Such a lost opportunity is an unnecessary cost to the public finances at a very difficult time,"" the think tank said. It suggested converting the debt into government bonds with longer to pay it back. ""It would have been much better to have reduced the scale of short-term liabilities earlier, as we have argued for some time, and to exploit the benefits of longer-term debt issuance. This is very much a question for the Treasury to answer,"" said Prof Chadha. The Treasury said it would not have been commercially viable to convert such a high level of debt. ""The Â£11bn figure is based on the implausible assumption that it would be possible to undertake action of this scale in a single transaction,"" it added. While there never was a single moment where the Treasury made a decision that cost the nation Â£11bn, the analysis from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research does point to some costly missed opportunities. Early last year the Treasury itself was pointing towards the shortening maturity of our national debt as a by-product of the pandemic expansion of borrowing and the Bank of England's QE policy.  The UK has for the past two decades had, by international standards, many more years to repay its loans from the markets, but that was no longer the case. The Treasury was trying to explain why despite the UK borrowing record sums, interest costs were at record lows. So a question arose - why don't they do something about it and lock-in then rock bottom interest rates for many years? It was suggested by NIESR, by Policy Exchange, by Boris Johnson's former economic adviser Gerard Lyons, among others. The Treasury's answer is that to have done so would have interfered with the Bank of England's independence over its QE programme of buying bonds, and that it would have been commercially unviable to refinance Â£600bn of debt in the markets in one go. In addition, though we all know now that there has been a material rise in interest rates, back then, it would have been a bet. In short, they say, they could not have done the transaction that would have ""saved Â£11bn"", and with the benefit of hindsight they might also have put money into gas futures or the used car market and ""saved"" many tens of billions more. But the wider point does raise questions about missed opportunities. And as we enter a new era of rising interest rates, and the reversal of QE, or Quantitative Tightening, many of the fuzzy accounting questions over government debts could have a rather material impact on the economic numbers. Gerard Lyons, the former chief economic adviser to Boris Johnson when the prime minister was Mayor of London, tweeted that the issue was ""all too predictable"". Dr Lyons, now a senior fellow at the Policy Exchange think tank, said the ""UK should've locked into low rates, borrowing more longer dated debt and not over reliance on QE to fund the deficit"". But Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, tweeted that the ""Â£11bn 'cost' should really be set against the Â£120bn 'benefit' that the QE process has so far yielded for the Exchequer"". ""To be fair to NIESR in their paper of last year they do acknowledge this - but this seems to have been drowned out today."" Labour's shadow treasury minister Tulip Siddiq said: ""These are astronomical sums for the chancellor to lose, and leaves working people picking up the cheque for his severe wastefulness while he hikes their taxes in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. ""This government has played fast and loose with taxpayers' money. Britain deserves a government that respects public money and delivers for people across the country.""

PGA Tour suspends golfers for playing Saudi-backed event,"Multiple major winners Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson are in the same group at Centurion Club on Thursday The PGA Tour has suspended all of its members who are playing in this week's Saudi-funded LIV Golf Invitational. The tournament, being held at Centurion Club near London, is the most lucrative in the history of the game with a $25m (Â£20m) prize fund. Six-time major winner Phil Mickelson is among the biggest names to be affected. LIV Golf issued an immediate reply calling the PGA Tour ""vindictive"" and said this ""deepens the divide between the Tour and its members"". The statement added: ""It's troubling that the Tour, an organisation dedicated to creating opportunities for golfers to play the game, is the entity blocking golfers from playing. ""This certainly is not the last word on this topic. The era of free agency is beginning as we are proud to have a full field of players joining us in London, and beyond."" The PGA Tour released its statement 30 minutes after play had begun at Centurion, where 48 players are competing in the first of eight planned LIV Golf invitational events. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas, who are both playing at the PGA Tour's Canadian Open this week, welcomed the ruling. ""Anybody that's shocked clearly hasn't been listening,"" two-time major winner Thomas said. ""They took that risk going into it, whether they thought it was a risk or not. ""I have great belief and great confidence in the PGA Tour and where we're going and continuing to grow to, and those guys just aren't going to be a part of it."" Thomas added: ""They're obviously throwing so much money at people that it's very hard to turn down. ""It doesn't matter who you are or what it is, everything has a number. They're reaching that number for some people and I hope that they don't get others. ""But I think a very strong core group of us is very stable and firm in our position, and I hope that it stays that way."" Northern Ireland's McIlroy said: ""I think it's the right thing because these guys have broken rules and done things outside of the tournament regulations, and because of that there are going to be consequences, I guess."" England's Ian Poulter, playing at the LIV event this week, said he would appeal the decision from the PGA Tour: ""It's a shame if they view this as something. ""When you feel you haven't done anything wrong and want to promote the game of golf, it would be incredibly disappointing if it turns out that way. ""I will appeal for sure. It makes no sense. Having two Tour cards and the ability to play golf all over the world, what's wrong with that?"" Graeme McDowell said he'd resigned from the PGA Tour ""30 minutes before I teed it up"" at the LIV event on Thursday. ""It was a difficult decision but it puts me into a less litigious situation,"" he said. ""I didn't want to resign, the PGA Tour has been great. This is about wanting to add on additional tournaments to my golf career."" Speaking after playing on Thursday, Mickelson said: ""As I said in my press conference yesterday, any PGA Tour matters I'm not going to discuss publicly."" Former world number one Greg Norman is the chief executive of LIV Golf, which has Â£1.6bn of funding from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The first seven events all have the same $25m prize fund, with the winner collecting $4m, while a team element will see the top three teams share $5m. The eighth event is a $50m team championship and will be played in October at Trump Doral in Miami. The PGA Tour had refused requests for waivers from its members wanting to play in the new series and had threatened to ban those that rebelled. This decision affects 17 players, including lifetime member Mickelson and his fellow American Dustin Johnson, who announced on Tuesday that he had resigned from the Tour. Mickelson did not deny that he had been given $200m to play in the series, while Johnson is reported to be getting $150m. Crucially, the PGA Tour has closed a loophole that would potentially have allowed players who have resigned from the tour to play events via sponsors exemptions. Sergio Garcia, Martin Kaymer, Graeme McDowell and Lee Westwood, have, like Johnson, already resigned and will all be affected by that ruling. PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said, in the statement that was issued to all members of the tour: ""In accordance with the PGA Tour's tournament regulations, the players competing this week without releases are suspended or otherwise no longer eligible to participate in PGA Tour tournament play, including the Presidents Cup. ""The same fate holds true for any other players who participate in future Saudi Golf League events in violation of our regulations. ""These players have made their choice for their own financial-based reasons. ""But they can't demand the same PGA Tour membership benefits, considerations, opportunities and platform as you. That expectation disrespects you, our fans and our partners."" The players will be removed from the FedEx Cup points list following the end of the Canadian Open on Sunday. The European-based DP World Tour, when contacted by BBC Sport, declined to comment.

What are the 6 January hearings?,"Trump supporters outside the Capitol during the 6 January riot After 11 months, nearly 100 subpoenas and more than 1,000 interviews, the congressional committee investigating the 6 January, 2021, attack on the US Capitol will step out from behind closed doors and hold a series of public hearings to present its findings. The first one is on Thursday. The Democratic-led committee wants to create a definitive account of the riot and the attempts to undermine the 2020 presidential election results. It could lead to prosecutions and new laws to strengthen election security. Democrats may also hope the hearings remind Americans of the chaotic Capitol attacks, carried out to buoy a Republican president - and keep that in mind when voters go to the polls for November's midterm elections. New details will aim to show that 6 January ""was the result of a coordinated, multi-step effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and stop the transfer of power"" with former President Donald Trump ""at the centre of that effort"", select committee aides said this week. It's been a while since the contentious House of Representatives vote last July creating this committee, after attempts to set up an independent inquiry failed, so here's a quick catch-up for those who may not have been following every twist and turn - leaked and reported - that the committee's efforts have taken. The panel, chaired by congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, is made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans. Those latter two, Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, are staunchly anti-Donald Trump conservatives. They were appointed by Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi after she rejected three congressmen suggested by her opposite, Republican minority leader Kevin McCarthy. Yes, there have. Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial in February 2021 offered a minute-by-minute accounting of the events on 6 January in an attempt to determine whether the former president helped incite the riot. More than 861 charges have been brought against individuals involved in the Capitol attack, with many resulting in plea agreements or guilty verdicts. Congress has also held several public hearings that covered the events of 6 January. This committee held one last July where they questioned law enforcement officials on their response to the attack. The stated purpose of this committee, and these hearings, is to provide a comprehensive account of not only the 6 January riot but the ""coordinated, multi-step effort"" to ""overturn"" the results of the 2020 presidential election, allegedly led by Mr Trump and some in his circle. This video can not be played Widow of fallen officer: ""6 January was the worst day of his life"" The proceedings are expected to be tightly scripted, in an attempt to avert the style of traditional committee hearings that can often descend into chaos or monotony. The panel has even hired a former television news executive to help with their efforts. The committee will present footage from 6 January, interspersed with clips of previously recorded testimony, live appearances and excerpts of documents and communications, in an attempt to form a cohesive narrative. Thursday night's production will include testimony and footage recorded by a British documentary filmmaker who accompanied members of the Proud Boys - a right-wing militant group whose leaders have been charged with seditious conspiracy - before and during the 6 January attack. It will also feature first-hand testimony by one of the police officers at the US Capitol that day. Members of the committee will also use the evening to outline areas to be covered in future hearings. ""Thursday night is about connecting the dots,"" said a select committee aide this week. ""A lot has been reported, bits and pieces have been shared, but our aim is to tie it together."" ""We'll bring the American people back to the reality of that violence and remind them just how horrific it was,"" the aide said. Rioters entering the US Capitol on 6 January The committee interviewed a wide range of current and former Trump associates, advisers and administration officials - including Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, son Donald Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Members of Vice-President Mike Pence's political team, law enforcement officials, individuals who were part of the protests that led to the Capitol attack and Republican officeholders across the US were also questioned. Pieces of testimony, and of the documents and text messages from Mr Trump's circle, have already leaked to the public. But there may be new information that can help fill in details. Select committee aides have said they plan to unveil ""a whole lot of new material"" including previously unseen documents, video and audio they have obtained. In particular, investigators have been trying to find out what the president was doing during a three-hour period on that day - from the start of the Capitol attack to the time when he recorded a video address telling rioters to leave the Capitol. White House logs offer sparse details, but the president made several phone calls - including to House Minority Leader McCarthy and Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville. The committee has spoken with numerous people who were around the president during that time - and perhaps their hearings will reveal what they learned. It has also subpoenaed Mr McCarthy about his conversation with the former president, but the congressman has refused to comply. That will be hard to judge until the first batch of television ratings come out. The hearings will get plenty of media coverage, however. Three US television networks - ABC, NBC and CBS - have already committed to airing at least a portion of the Thursday proceedings. Notably, Fox News has opted to stick with its regular programming - including Tucker Carlson's highly rated but controversial conservative news opinion show. It takes a lot for political events to cut through and capture the public's attention, however, and these hearings are a drama with a known script and ending. The challenge for the committee will be making now familiar events seem fresh. To that end, Democrats are attempting to juice interest, organising more than 90 hearing ""watch parties"" across the US. In Washington, they will project the proceedings on a large screen outside the Capitol itself and provide attendees with free ice cream. Republican officeholders, particularly those most loyal to Mr Trump, are planning ""counterprogramming"" and a quick response to the committee's presentations. Members of Congress like Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana - two of the Republicans Ms Pelosi blocked from serving on the committee - will appear on media outlets like Fox News, One America News and Newsmax, and are likely to argue that the hearings are partisan grandstanding. Many conservatives will argue that Democrats are focusing on the past when they should be addressing pressing concerns like the economy, immigration, trade and crime. Some Republicans, such as Ohio Representative Jim Jordan, have sought to portray the committee as illegitimate Only the first three hearings - on Thursday night and during the day next Monday and Wednesday - have been scheduled, but committee members say there will be more this month. The committee plans to produce a report, and possibly hold another hearing, in September to outline its findings, as well as offer suggestions for reforms to the US electoral process. There is no set deadline for an end to the committee's work, but Democrats may lose a majority in the House in November's midterm elections and hand over control of the chamber in January. Republicans would be expected to quickly shut down the probe. Although the committee does not have power to bring charges, it can make recommendations and provide evidence to the US justice department, which is conducting its own criminal investigation into the 6 January attack. It is possible, though far from certain, that the committee could recommend Mr Trump himself be charged with some form of criminal conduct. In addition to the cases already launched against individuals who breached the Capitol, the justice department has brought charges against two Trump advisers, former White House strategist Steve Bannon and trade representative Peter Navarro, for refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas. Trump Chief-of-Staff Mark Meadows and advisor Dan Scavino were held in contempt of Congress, but the justice department said it will not prosecute them. The committee will eventually make legislative recommendations about how to prevent another 6 January from happening, but they haven't yet shared details of what those might be. The biggest question may not be the scope of the legal consequences, but the political ones. In the days after the 6 January attack, Democrats predicted - and conservatives feared - that the American public would hold the Republican Party responsible. Since then, however, traditional partisan divides in the US have re-emerged. Democrats may hope that these hearings remind voters heading to the polls in November of what happened the last time Republicans held the reins of power. At the moment, however, Americans seem more concerned with the price of petrol.

The rioters pictured in five defining images,"On 6 January, 2021, people around the United States were shocked by images coming from the US Capitol. The pictures - many of which were captured by news agency photojournalists on hand to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's electoral win - depicted rioters trespassing in government offices, or roaming the Senate chamber, or assaulting police officers. This week, a House of Representatives select committee set up to investigate the events will begin public hearings aimed at piecing together what happened and who can be held accountable. While the committee can refer cases for prosecution, it is up to the Justice Department to determine if charges are actually filed. But for many of the rioters, the snaps taken that day have already come back to haunt them. To date, more than 810  have been arrested in nearly every US state and Washington DC. More than 60 so far have been sentenced to incarceration, with US officials vowing that more prosecutions are likely in the future. Investigators are seeking public help in identifying over 350 rioters, including 250 suspected of attacking police officers. Here are five of the most iconic pictures of rioters and what's happened to them since 6 January. Among the most widely shared images was that of Jacob Anthony Chansley, a 34-year old who referred to himself as the ""QAnon Shaman"". An ardent Trump supporter, Chansley was pictured wearing horns and a bearskin headdress during the riot, quickly becoming one of the most recognisable figures from the siege. Chansley was arrested just days after the riot. In November, he was sentenced to 41 months in prison for his involvement, in addition to 36 months of supervised release. In court, Chansley said he now believes it was ""wrong"" to enter the Capitol and that he hopes to ""evolve"". His sentence is one of the longest so far doled out to 6 January rioters. He is currently being held in a low-security federal prison in Arizona. Another rioter, 36-year-old Florida resident Adam Johnson, was famously pictured walking - wearing a Trump beanie - between guide ropes meant for tours at the Capitol. He was carrying a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House and posed in front of a painting depicting the surrender of British General John Burgoyne in the American Revolutionary War. Johnson, who was dubbed ""Podium Guy"" by social media users in the wake of the riot, was charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct and theft of government property just days later. In November, Johnson pleaded guilty to entering and remaining in a restricted building. The other charges were dropped by prosecutors in exchange for a guilty plea. Additionally, Johnson - who has expressed interest in writing a book - agreed to hand over any publishing profits to the government for a five-year period. Early this year, he was sentenced to 75 days in prison and was also fined $5,000 (Â£3,996). Ahead of his prison sentence, Johnson reportedly planned to host an ""Adam is going to prison"" party at a Florida restaurant. The event was eventually cancelled by the venue. ""Come help me celebrate my last Friday of freedom before I go to prison for the lamest charge in history,"" a Facebook page for the event read. Another Trump supporter, Richard Barnett, was pictured sitting with one boot on a desk in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The image of Mr Barnett - dressed in a baseball cap and chequered shirt - went viral, as did pictures of the notes he and others left on Mrs Pelosi's desk. Mr Barnett now faces multiple charges in connection with the riot, including obstruction of an official proceeding, entering a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon and disorderly conduct. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and in April rejected the government's offer of a plea deal. He is currently not in jail. Mr Barnett's trial is scheduled to begin on 6 September. A fourth rioter, Kevin Seefried, was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag while walking through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Mr Seefried and his son, Hunter, were arrested a week after the riot and hit with multiple charges, including violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol Grounds. The father-son duo is scheduled to begin a bench trial - in which their culpability will be determined by a judge, rather than a jury - on 13 June. Aaron Mostofsky, a Trump supporter, in the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 The son of a prominent and politically connected New York City judge, Aaron Mostofsky was famously pictured wearing a fur pelt as a ""caveman"" and holding a police riot shield and wooden stick inside the US Capitol during the 6 January riot. He told the New York Post he felt that supporters of President Trump ""were cheated"" in the election. ""I don't think 75 million people voted for Trump - I think it was close to 85 million,"" he told the newspaper. ""I think certain states that have been red for a long time turned blue and were stolen, like New York."" Mostofsky was arrested in New York six days after the riot and charged with multiple offences, including theft of government property, assaulting or impeding officers and disorderly conduct. In February, he pleaded guilty to one felony charge of civil disorder, as well as several misdemeanor charges. Three months later, he was sentenced to eight months in prison followed by 12 months of supervised release, including 200 hours of community service and $2,000 (Â£1,600) restitution.

Family's 'distress' at video of captured Briton,"Aiden Aslin's family said he joined the Ukrainian Marines after moving to Mykolaiv in 2018 The family of a British man reportedly captured defending Ukraine have said footage of him shown on Russian television is ""deeply distressing"". Aiden Aslin, 28, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, had been defending the battered city of Mariupol. In a statement his family denounced ""Kremlin propaganda"" adding he was not a ""volunteer, a mercenary, or a spy"". They said he moved to Mykolaiv in 2018 where he met his girlfriend and joined the Ukrainian Marines. The family spoke through a statement released by their MP Robert Jenrick onTwitter,external. They said: ""Aiden was making plans for his future outside the military, but like all Ukrainians, his life was turned upside down by Putin's barbarous invasion. ""He has played his part in defending Ukraine's right to self-determination."" Mr Aslin has appeared in video footage afterhis unit was reportedly captured. His family said it was ""deeply distressing"" to see him looking bruised and swollen. They said: ""Using images and videos of prisoners of war is in contravention of the Geneva Convention and must stop. ""Aiden is a much-loved young man with a strong network of friends around him and a loving wife-to-be."" His grandmotherpreviously said she thoughthis captors were using him ""for propaganda purposes"". The family said they were in contact with the Foreign Office. Mr Johnson said he echoed his Conservative colleague's comments Mr Jenrick raised his concerns about the footage in Parliament during Prime Minister's Questions. He asked Boris Johnson if he agreed that broadcasting it was a ""flagrant breach of the Geneva Convention"". The Newark MP said the way Mr Aslin was being treated was illegal and the person conducting the interview was in danger of prosecution for war crimes. He also criticised online platforms that were used to show the footage and said the videos should be taken down. Mr Johnson said he echoed his Conservative colleague's comments about those that broadcast ""propaganda messages"".

Is Russia exporting grain from Ukraine?,"Harvest in Zaporizhzhia: Ukraine is a major exporter of grain to Africa and the Middle East Russia is sending grain from Ukraine overseas, Russian-appointed officials in occupied southern Ukraine say. The claim - which the BBC has not been able to verify - comes as Ukrainian officials accuse Russia of stealing about 600,000 tonnes of its grain and exporting some of it. Russia denies it is stealing grain. Accessing Ukraine's stockpiled grain has become urgent internationally: millions of tonnes are exported annually to Africa and the Middle East. But it cannot be shipped now because Russia's navy is blockading Ukraine's Black Sea ports. And Russia says Ukraine must de-mine waters off the Black Sea coast for corridors to export the grain to become operational. The US alleges that Russia is trying to sell stolen Ukrainian wheat to drought-stricken countries in Africa,the New York Times reported,external. In mid-May, the US sent an alert to 14 countries, mostly in Africa, that Russian cargo ships were leaving ports near Ukraine laden with the grain, the paper reported, citing a State Department cable. Yevgeny Balitsky, in charge of Russian-held areas in Zaporizhzhia region, said grain had left the region on freight trains bound for Crimea - which Russia annexed in 2014 -  and, from there, the Middle East. He told Russian state TV ""the main contracts are being concluded with Turkey"" - without giving details. A spokesman for the Russian occupation authority in Crimea, Oleg Kryuchkov, said 11 waggons of grain had arrived in Crimea from Melitopol, a city in Zaporizhzhia. He spoke to Russian state news agency RIA, which also said grain was being transported from the occupied Kherson region. The BBC has approached Russian authorities for comment. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov discussed the grain problem with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu in Ankara on Wednesday, but there was no breakthrough. Mr Lavrov denied that Russia was obstructing Ukraine's wheat exports, saying the onus was on Ukraine to de-mine the waters off Odesa and other ports. A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman said Ukraine could not de-mine the coast because Russia would ""use grain corridors to attack southern Ukraine"". Russia also blames Western sanctions for the food crisis. The West however says Russia has ""weaponised"" food supplies. Turkey is trying to broker a deal to create safe maritime corridors. Last week Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, Vasyl Bodnar, said Russia was shipping stolen grain from Crimea, and Turkey was among the destinations. ""We have made our appeal for Turkey to help us and, upon the suggestion of the Turkish side, are launching criminal cases regarding those stealing and selling the grains,"" Reuters quoted him as saying. Ukraine Grain Association chief Mykola Gorbachov has warned that, if exports cannot resume from Ukraine's ports, the next harvest, starting in late July, will be severely impacted. He said Ukraine's grain exports would be limited to 20m tonnes maximum next year - via road, river and rail - whereas last year it managed to export 44.7m tonnes. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has fuelled big price rises worldwide for grain, cooking oil, fuel and fertiliser. Part of that is a result of Western sanctions on Russia. Russia and Ukraine jointly account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies - Ukraine's contribution is nearly 10%. In 2019 Ukraine accounted for 16% of the world's corn supplies and 42% of sunflower oil, according to UN data. The current blockade of Ukraine and stockpiling of grain by some countries are contributing to shortages in countries already hit by food insecurity. Petroc Wilton of the World Food Programme in Somalia says the drought in the Horn of Africa is already devastating. ""Four consecutive failed rainy seasons. Fifteen million hungry people, rising to 20 by year's end,"" he said.

PM wants benefit claimants to be able to buy homes,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on housing benefit changes: ""It's time to turn benefits to bricks."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has unveiled plans to allow benefits to be put towards mortgages in England, as he sought to relaunch his premiership. He made the ""benefits-to-bricks"" pledge in his first big speech since surviving a bid to oust him by Tory MPs. Speaking in Blackpool, he also vowed to extend a scheme to allow social tenants to buy their homes. But critics say the proposals are unworkable and would make the housing crisis worse. In Monday's confidence vote on Mr Johnson's leadership, four in 10 Tory MPs backed getting rid of him, amid anger over widespread Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street during lockdown. Under-fire Johnson vows to get on with the job Is the government meeting its new-homes target? Chris Mason: Boris Johnson faces political and economic gales There is also disquiet among Conservatives over the government's decision to raise National Insurance, while the cost of living is soaring and the public finances have been battered by the expense of dealing with Covid. In a wide-ranging speech aimed at demonstrating he has not run out of ideas and is focused on issues that most matter to voters, Mr Johnson promised more help ""over the next few weeks"" to deal with 40-year-high inflation driven by energy price rises. ""Global headwinds are strong... but our engines are stronger,"" said Mr Johnson, adding that ""we are on your side"" in cutting the cost of fuel, childcare, transport and other living expenses. ""And, while it's not going to be quick or easy, you can be confident that things will get better, that we will emerge from this a strong country with a healthy economy,"" the prime minister told the audience at Blackpool and The Fylde College. He said ""economic growth"" was the answer and he hoped tax cuts - which have been demanded by some Tory MPs - would come ""sooner rather than later"". Mr Johnson restated the government's commitment to extending a home-buying scheme, known as right to buy, to housing association tenants. He said he wanted to extend it ""within existing spending plans"" and ensure a ""one-for-one replacement"" of each home sold. This video can not be played Watch: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says PM's new housing policy is the ""wrong approach"" The prime minister also said universal credit recipients would get to choose whether to spend their benefits on rent or put them towards a mortgage. The government will explore discounting Lifetime ISA and Help to Buy ISA savings from Universal Credit eligibility rules, Mr Johnson said. Currently, claimants are only eligible for universal credit if they have savings below Â£16,000, and Lifetime ISAs are included in this limit. Changing these policies would ""help millions realise the dream of home ownership"", Mr Johnson said. Housing benefits, which help low-income or unemployed people pay their rent, cost the government around Â£30bn a year, much of which goes to private landlords. A person is not usually eligible for the payments if they have a mortgage. This speech was in the diary before the confidence vote on Monday but it nevertheless became a chance to try and reset Boris Johnson's premiership. This was a prime minister who wanted to talk political plans - not personal problems. Mr Johnson wants to focus on ways to help households with costs - but there are big questions about how and when the policies announced today will be delivered. This won't be an overnight equivalent of Thatcher's council house scheme. The PM also failed to commit to the pledge to build 300,000 houses a year in England by 2025 - something which was in the 2019 Conservative general election manifesto. It's looked increasingly unlikely since the government dropped plans to reform the planning system in England to make it easier for developers to win approval. A reminder perhaps that housing pledges can often be easier in theory than in practice. About two million council homes in England have been sold under right to buy since 1980 Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy questioned whether people on benefits could afford mortgage deposits, saying: ""This speech was yet more evidence that the prime minister and his tired government are out of ideas. ""You can't solve a housing crisis with back-of-the-envelope policies that have no realistic chance of success."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""Boris Johnson has lost the confidence of his party, Parliament and the country. The desperate attempt to relaunch his leadership today will do nothing to win it back."" It's not entirely clear how the government's right-to-buy policy is going to work: There is already a shortage of social housing without selling properties - 1.1 million people are on waiting lists The government has not revealed who will be able to take advantage of the scheme, how much it will cost and whether it will be capped It's the third such pilot scheme - previous ones found that some housing association properties were not eligible to be sold and there was concern about the financial risks being taken on by participants While the government has said that there will be funding for housing associations to replace each home sold, previous pilots have had problems with replacements coming quickly enough or being like-for-like The policy depends on negotiations with housing associations, which will not necessarily want to take part. Council tenants in England have been able to buy their homes at a discount since 1980, when Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher introduced the policy. But the same is not true for people renting from housing associations, unless their property was once owned by a local authority and they lived in it during this period. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, called Mr Johnson's housing proposals ""baffling, unworkable, and a dangerous gimmick"". Extending the right to buy would ""put our rapidly shrinking supply of social homes at even greater risk,"" she added. Right-to-buy: A tainted gift?

Putin: West unlikely to reject our energy for years,"Vladimir Putin said Russian energy profits are increasing Russian President Vladimir Putin says the West will not be able to cut itself off from Russian oil and gas for several years. He added that nobody knows what might happen in that time, so Russian companies would not be ""concreting over their oil-wells"". It comes as a US official admitted that Russian profits on energy may be higher now than they were before the war. The EU currently imports around 40% of its gas from Russia. The bloc has pledged toreduce its dependency on Russian oil by 90%by the end of 2022, but so far has not made any commitments on gas. The US has placed an embargo on all Russian energy products. The restrictions on Russian energy are designed to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine. But rising global oil and gas prices mean that Russian profits could have risen in recent months, despite a reduction in the overall supply. ""The volume of oil is decreasing on the world market, prices are rising,"" President Putin told a group of young entrepreneurs. ""Company profits are rising,"" he added. That idea was echoed on Thursday by US energy security envoy Amos Hochstein. Asked at a Senate hearing if Russia could be earning more now from fossil fuels than it was before the war, Mr Hochman replied ""I can't deny that"". Thursday marked the 350th anniversary of Peter the Great's birth The Russian president was speaking on Thursday after attending an exhibition in Moscow dedicated to the 350th anniversary of the birth of Russian monarch Peter the Great. The 18th Century ruler fought a long territorial war against Sweden, which Putin appeared to compare to his invasion of Ukraine. ""You get the impression that by fighting Sweden he was grabbing something. He wasn't taking anything, he was taking it back,"" he told his young audience. ""It is our responsibility also to take back and strengthen,"" he said, in an apparent reference to Ukraine.

Prince William spotted selling Big Issue in London,"This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge posed for photos with tourists, members of the public and a taxi driver The Duke of Cambridge has been spotted in central London quietly helping to sell Big Issue magazines. Retired Met Police Ch Supt Matthew Gardner shared photos of Prince William on Rochester Row, in Westminster, on his social media account. He said his brother-in-law, Richard Hannant, had seen what he thought was a celebrity and took a distanced photo. Prince William then crossed the road and spoke to Mr Hannant while wearing the iconic Big Issue uniform. The magazine is sold by homeless people, long-term unemployed people, and those who need money to avoid getting into debt, the Big Issue says. Vendors are given five free magazines, which are then sold to the public for Â£3, with additional copies bought for Â£1.50. Richard Hannant was surprised Prince William was spotted just days after celebrating the Queen's Platinum Jubilee Mr Hannant, a property manager, has since said he was on his way back to the office when he spotted the royal among a small group of people in the street. The 47-year-old, who lives in Bath but works in London, said: ""He was amazing, he was so friendly."" He added: ""I think what struck me is we've just got past a massive Jubilee event and days later he's out there supporting a charity like Big Issue. ""I think it's that that I thought was most amazing because one is a worldwide event, this is just a low-key [event], literally standing on the side of the road with a homeless person. ""I was quite amazed that he could go from one massive event to such a low-key thing."" Laura Zuikauskas had spent the weekend in London for the Jubilee In his social media post, Mr Gardner wrote alongside the photo of his brother-in-law and the prince: ""What an honour to have a private moment with our future king who was humble and working quietly in the background, helping the most needy. ""These 'silent gestures' often go unrecognised. ""The finale to this unique occasion was when Prince William asked my brother-in-law If he wanted to buy the Big Issue, to which he replied 'I have no change'. ""At this point William produced a mobile card machineâ¦ you cannot teach that! ""Priceless, or should I say, 'princely'."" Lithuanian tourists Vitalijus and Laura Zuikauskas also met the prince on their visit to London to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. ""We bought the magazine and had a warm chat,"" said Mr Zuikauskas. ""We wished him good luck and shook hands, and were excited that the Royal Family take big care of ordinary people."" He added the future king had a ""warm personality"" and they were ""excited and really happy"" to meet him. Another social media post by black cab driver Neil Kramer also showed Prince William in the uniform posing for a photo with another Big Issue vendor. Allow Instagram content?

He said: ""I was charging up my taxi on Rochester Row in Westminster when I was approached by a vendor who introduced himself as William and asked would I like to buy a copy of the Big Issue. ""When I realised who it was, I was a bit shocked but of course said yes. ""He then introduced the other gentlemen with him and we had a lovely chat for 15 minutes about the charity and its work."" Mr Kramer said the prince asked him if he was a regular reader, to which he replied there was always an opportunity to buy the magazine when on a rank or charging up. Richard Hannant told Prince William they shared the same birthday, 21 June, to which the prince replied ""happy birthday"" He added Prince William was engaging and polite, and that he never forgot his name. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have previously spoken of their involvement with charities close to their heart, often inspired by his mother, the late Princess Diana.

Seal seen 'chilling out' on inflatable dinghy,"Ms Hedges said she got lucky with the shot as only had a couple of seconds to capture the seal in the dinghy This super-relaxed seal does not have a care in the world as it appeared to have taken a dinghy for a leisurely cruise - complete with a pair of oars. Karis Hedges was returning from Skomer Island, Pembrokeshire, when she saw the seal ""chilling out"". The 26-year-old started snapping away and captured some ""lucky shots"" of the mammal in the inflatable boat. Ms Hedges, from Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire, said she was really surprised to see the seal. The large animal, blatantly unbothered by its audience appeared completely relaxed. Photos taken by Ms Hedges, who is a full-time photographer, show the brazen seal peering up towards its onlookers on 19 May. What can Cornwall learn from Wallyâs Welsh trip?

""I thought it was really cute that he was totally unfazed by anyone and just chilling out without a care in the world. ""His expression is like 'and? Do you have a problem?' Like it was the most normal thing,"" she said. Ms Hedges said she believed the seal had climbed into a boat's rescue dingy, adding the crew would probably have to kick out the surprise guest at the end of the day.

Chip shops battered as price of fish rises,"Erin Morgan said the price of cod for her restaurant had gone up 50%, but she did not want to pass the cost on to customers It is one of Britain's favourite dishes, but there are fears the future of fish and chips could be at risk due to rising costs. In some Welsh seaside resorts the price of cod and chips has risen to Â£12. Erin Morgan runs a restaurant in Ceredigion and said she feared the increase in price would see customers stay away. The UK government said it supported the hospitality sector through the pandemic with a multi-million pound package. Ms Morgan, who has been running Caffi Sgadan in Aberporth, Ceredigion, for the last two years, said she was having to shoulder much of the rising cost, as she did not want to put prices up by 50%. Shame driving needy away from food banks - study Food costs rise as farmers struggle with increase Fish & chips: Batter in or out of the EU? ""It's worrying, the price of everything is going up,"" she said, adding cooking oil and other kitchen expenses had also risen along with the fish. ""If we carry on seeing these price rises, we'll have to reassess how we run the business,"" she said. This video can not be played White fish, potatoes, peas and the energy to cook them with have all sky-rocketed in price. The cost of a large portion of cod and chips at her shop has risen from Â£7.40 at the start of the year to Â£7.90 this week. But in some areas of Wales, it can be as much as Â£12. Gareth Morgan and his family are just trying to hang on at the Pendre Cafe, the business they run in Cardigan. ""Where as you'd have a regular visit two or three times a week possibly, you see them now twice a month possibly."" Gareth Morgan said his regular customers were visiting less frequently One option was to sell cheaper unskinned fish. Mr Morgan said: ""We're trying not to pass the cost on to customers, but eventually, prices will have to go up again."" Jo Davies, visiting Aberporth from the Midlands, decided to go for a pie at Caffi Sgadan, because the cod was too pricey. She said: ""I would have had fish, definitely, but it's too expensive. It's more of a treat than a normal dinner time meal now. It's not an option."" Chip shop customer Jo Davies, right, bought a pie because the cod was too pricey National Federation of Fish Friers president, Andrew Crook, said the industry was facing a crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. From rising energy and fuel costs to cooking oil and fish, prices have spiralled. Mr Crook, who runs his own chip shop in Euxton, Lancashire, has visited Alesund, Norway, to find ways to mitigate the problems. ""I've seen the price of cooking oils more than double,"" he said. ""That's due to the conflict in Ukraine. With fish, we're already seeing post-pandemic inflation. The cost of fuel also affects it. ""And we're expecting tariffs to be applied to Russian whitefish of 35%, which will certainly impact our industry."" Russia is one of the planet's largest seafood producers. Some countries rely on its white fish. Expert Andrew Crook said the industry was facing a crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine Mr Crook wants to increase stocks in other markets, starting with Norway. ""Most vessel owners in Norway produce headed and gutted fish that then goes on for further processing. It's cheaper than producing fillets,"" he said. ""But with prices going up, it might now stack up for them to switch over to fillets that could provide some solutions to our issues. If there's more fish available to is, shortly it will help mitigate the price increases in the future."" With VAT returning to 20% in April, Mr Crooks is calling on the UK government to step in. ""We need a rethink on how we're taxed,"" he said. ""It's a very bleak outlook, it's going to be very tough on a lot of businesses. ""It all means we don't have the money to invest, and provide good jobs. It's going to put a lot of businesses out of business."" The UK government said a Â£1,000 increase to the Employment Allowance had been announced in the Spring Statement, which would cut takes for businesses. ""Eligible high street businesses can also get 50% off business rates bills, and benefit from a freeze to the business rates multiplier that puts the brakes on bill increases and is worth Â£4.6 billion over the next five years,"" they said. ""We've always been clear that the lower rate of VAT was a temporary measure and it's right our support reflects the fact the economy has reopened.""

"Labour queries PPE contracts and Tory peer linksAngela Rayner says there is ""suspicion"" about contracts for a firm she says is linked to a Tory peer.UK","Baroness Mone, who founded the Ultimo bra company, has denied links with PPE Medpro Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner has asked ministers why they are refusing to release details of PPE contracts for a firm being investigated by the National Crime Agency. She said supplier PPE Medpro was reportedly raided by police, along with the home of Tory peer Baroness Mone - who she said was linked to the firm. There were serious questions about due diligence, she told MPs. Baroness Mone has previously denied any link to PPE Medpro. Government efficiency minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said there was a global shortage of personal protective equipment in the pandemic and British manufacturers provided it in ""unprecedented quantities"". But he declined to address the specifics of PPE Medpro's contracts or any alleged connections between Baroness Mone and the firm. Government writes off Â£8.7bn of pandemic PPE Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority One million NHS masks fail high-grade safety tests UK failed to stockpile crucial protective kit In January,the House of Lords launched an investigation,externalinto her ""alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro"" and whether it potentially breached the code of conduct. Baroness Mone's lawyers have previously told the Guardianshe had no association with the company,externalor any involvement in the awarding of contracts. PPE Medpro was awarded two contracts to supply protective equipment in May 2020 as part of the so-called ""VIP lane"", which allowed MPs, ministers and senior officials to pass on offers of help from suppliers, who could be awarded contracts without competing bids. In June 2020, it won another contract worth Â£122m to supply millions of protective gowns to the NHS. Butthe BBC revealed none were ever used, and the company is in dispute with the government about the contract. It is not known if the raid by the NCA and any potential investigation are connected to PPE contracts. Ms Rayner told the House of Commons that ""a Conservative peer is under investigation by the National Crime Agency over fraud"", after PPE Medpro was ""handed hundreds of millions of pounds in government contracts during the pandemic"". Angela Rayner said there were ""serious questions"" about the contracts She said it had been reported that the company had been raided by the NCA, along with Baroness Mone's home. And she asked what evidence the government held and why they were ""refusing to give a single sheet of it out into the public domain"". ""What have they got to hide?"" she asked. The Labour deputy leader accused ministers of being unwilling to answer because ""they know there is suspicion about the way they handled those contracts"". Saying that storage of unusable or unneeded PPE was costing Â£500,000 a day, she asked whether the government'sProcurement Bill,externalwould ""prevent cronyism from corrupting our government and wasting public money"". Responding for the government, Mr Rees-Mogg said her claims were ""completely false, they have no bearing on reality"" and said they ignored the conditions at the start of the pandemic two years ago. He said British manufacturers managed to increase domestic production of PPE from 1% of the UK's supply to more than 70%, at a time when ""everyone was calling for it, because it was urgent"". On the morning of 27 April, the National Crime Agency executed search warrants at addresses linked to PPE Medpro in London and on the Isle of Man. The BBC spoke to witnesses on the Isle of Man who described seeing more than 10 un-marked vehicles displaying UK number plates and officers who were wearing law enforcement-style vests entering and searching the company building in Douglas. After the raid, the NCA said: ""The NCA does not routinely confirm or deny the existence of investigations or the names of those who may or may not be under investigation"". Baroness Mone has not commented on the raid. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached by the BBC for comment.

High Court hearing for Prince Harry libel claim,"Prince Harry said he had suffered ""substantial hurt, embarrassment and distress"" Details of the Duke of Sussex's latest legal claim against the publishers of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday have been aired at a High Court hearing. Prince Harry is suing Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) for libel over a February article about a dispute over his family's security arrangements. His barrister said the story falsely suggested he had ""lied"" and ""cynically"" tried to manipulate public opinion. But ANL said it contained ""no hint of impropriety"" and was not defamatory. The story, published in the Mail on Sunday and online, referred to the prince's separate legal case against the Home Office over security arrangements when he and his family are in the UK. In a written statement to Thursday's preliminary hearing, Prince Harry said it had caused him ""substantial hurt, embarrassment and distress, which is continuing"". The prince's barrister Justin Rushbrooke said the article suggested he had ""lied in his initial public statements"" by claiming to have always been willing to pay for police protection in the UK. The story suggested ""he had only made such an offer recently, after his dispute had started and after his visit to the UK in June 2021"", Mr Rushbrooke said. He added that the Mail on Sunday story claimed he had ""improperly and cynically tried to manipulate and confuse public opinion by authorising his 'spin doctors' to put out false and misleading statements about his willingness to pay for police protection immediately after the Mail on Sunday had revealed he was suing the government"". He said the story also claimed the prince ""tried to keep his legal fight with the government secret from the public, including the fact that he expected British taxpayers to pay for his police protection, in a way which was improper and showed a lack of transparency on his part"". ANL is disputing the claim, and the company's barrister Andrew Caldecott said the print and online versions of the article were ""essentially identical"" and were not ""defamatory"" to Prince Harry in the eyes of ""the reasonable reader"". ""There is no hint of impropriety on any sensible reading of the article,"" he said. ""The claimant is not portrayed as seeking to keep the whole action secret. ""The article does not accuse the claimant of lying in his initial statement about offering to pay for his security. ""The article does allege that the claimant's PR team spun the story (or added a gloss unduly favourable to the claimant) which led to inaccurate reporting and confusion about the nature of the claim. It does not allege dishonesty against them."" Judge Justice Nicklin oversaw Thursday's hearing and must now decide a number of things before the case proceeds, including the meaning of parts of the article, whether they are a statement of fact or opinion, and if they are defamatory. He will deliver his ruling at a later date. The Duke and Duchess of Sussexannounced last yearthat they would step back as ""senior"" royals and work to become financially independent, dividing their time between the US and UK. Last year,he accepted an apology and ""substantial damages""from ANL after suing the company for libel over claims that he had ""turned his back"" on the Royal Marines.

Putin: Russian energy embargo unlikely for years,"Vladimir Putin said Russian energy profits are increasing Russian President Vladimir Putin says the West will not be able to cut itself off from Russian oil and gas for several years. He added that nobody knows what might happen in that time, so Russian companies would not be ""concreting over their oil-wells"". It comes as a US official admitted that Russian profits on energy may be higher now than they were before the war. The EU currently imports around 40% of its gas from Russia. The bloc has pledged toreduce its dependency on Russian oil by 90%by the end of 2022, but so far has not made any commitments on gas. The US has placed an embargo on all Russian energy products. The restrictions on Russian energy are designed to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine. But rising global oil and gas prices mean that Russian profits could have risen in recent months, despite a reduction in the overall supply. ""The volume of oil is decreasing on the world market, prices are rising,"" President Putin told a group of young entrepreneurs. ""Company profits are rising,"" he added. That idea was echoed on Thursday by US energy security envoy Amos Hochstein. Asked at a Senate hearing if Russia could be earning more now from fossil fuels than it was before the war, Mr Hochman replied ""I can't deny that"". Thursday marked the 350th anniversary of Peter the Great's birth The Russian president was speaking on Thursday after attending an exhibition in Moscow dedicated to the 350th anniversary of the birth of Russian monarch Peter the Great. The 18th Century ruler fought a long territorial war against Sweden, which Putin appeared to compare to his invasion of Ukraine. ""You get the impression that by fighting Sweden he was grabbing something. He wasn't taking anything, he was taking it back,"" he told his young audience. ""It is our responsibility also to take back and strengthen,"" he said, in an apparent reference to Ukraine.

Wizz Air boss sparks backlash over fatigue request,"Wizz Air chief executive Jozsef Varadi said staff should go ""the extra mile"" Wizz Air is facing a backlash from pilot unions after the airline's boss appeared to call on crew to work through fatigue. Chief executive Jozsef Varadi said staff should go ""the extra mile"" when tired so that the airline could avoid cancelling flights. Pilot unions said flying when fatigued is dangerous and his comments showed a ""deficient safety culture"". But Wizz Air said Mr Varadi was addressing all workers not just pilots. Like some airlines, Wizz Air has been forced to cancel flights over the recent Jubilee bank holiday which coincided with schools' half-term break because of ""widespread shortages in staff"". Cancer patient 'devastated' by Wizz Air flight cancellation Suffolk family's disbelief as Wizz Air flights cancelled twice On Wednesday Mr Varadi told workers: ""Now that everyone is getting back into work, I understand that fatigue is a potential outcome of the issues but once we are starting stabilising the rosters, we also need to take down the fatigue rate. ""I mean, we cannot run this business when every fifth person of a base reports sickness because the person is fatigued. We are all fatigued but sometimes it is required to take the extra mile."" Mr Varadi added, ""The damage is huge when we are cancelling the flights, it's huge. It is reputational damage of the brand and it is the other financial damage, transactional damage because we have to pay compensation for that."" The European Cockpit Association, which has been pushing for union recognition at Wizz Air, shared a short clip of Mr Varadi's address. It said the comments encouraged pilots to fly when fatigued, and called on regulators to step in. ""It's like handing the car keys to a drunk driver,"" the union said, adding it showed a ""deficient safety culture"" at the airline. Allow Twitter content?

Martin Chalk, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa), said that ""fatigue has been shown, in many studies, to have effects on a person's thinking and decision making similar to alcohol"". ""No-one supports pilots or other safety sensitive staff working with alcohol in their system,"" he said, adding that he was ""very surprised by the apparent views of Mr Varadi on fatigue"". He called on Mr Varadi to clarify his comments, and that if he really believed pilots should fly when fatigued, ""he should consider whether he is in the right job"". When airline pilots are very tired ""it can be life or death"", he added. ""People's lives are important, and we don't squander them for no reason - definitely not for profit."" There are restrictions on the number of hours air crew are supposed to work. Rules state that air crew should not fly, and should not be required to fly, if they are in a state of fatigue which could endanger passengers or the aircraft. Wizz Air denied that Mr Varadi was specifically targeting pilots but was speaking to all staff. It said in a statement:  ""Our crew unavailability has been very low, at 4%. In this context, going the extra mile to minimise disruption was discussed. ""What this does not mean is compromising safety. Wizz Air and the airline industry are highly regulated, and safety has, and always will be, our first priority."" It added: ""This clip has been edited from an all staff briefing - not pilots only, but also cabin crew and all office employees - on key business updates and current challenges facing aviation.""

Energy drink ban for children in Wales proposed,"Several ideas are being considered to try and tackle the problem of childhood obesity Selling energy drinks to under-16s could be banned in Wales in a bid to tackle childhood obesity. More than one in four children are overweight when they start primary school, according to official figures. Under Welsh government proposals, takeaways could also be stopped from opening near schools and free soft drink refills could be banned. The consultations are aimed at informing new legislation to try to improve the health of young people. The UK governmentlaunched a consultationon plans to ban the sale of energy drinks in England to anybody under 18 in 2018, but a law has not been passed. Currently, identification is not legally required but somesupermarkets already stop under-16s from buying soft drinkswith high-caffeine content - mostly those with more than 150mg of per litre, which carry a warning stating they are not recommended for children. Many UK teenagers have weekly energy drink habit Not enough evidence for energy drink ban ""We're looking at things like price promotions where unhealthy food is cited in supermarkets, having calorie labelling in takeaways and restaurants, so it's a whole range of measures that we're consulting on,"" said deputy minister for mental health, Lynne Neagle. Ms Neagle met pupils at Whitchurch High School in Cardiff where nutritional values form part of lessons about food. ""They were brilliant and really well-informed and thought that education was really important and that there were other things as well that we could do such as making the labelling warning of the dangers for young people more prominent,"" she said. Lewis thinks an energy drink ban would be ""a bit extreme"" Year 9 pupil Lewis agreed with some of the proposals but called banning the sale of energy drinks ""a bit extreme"". ""I think it's more general stuff that would work like not putting them near the checkouts and maybe shops should put fruit at the tills,"" he said. ""It's just that when you see chocolate there, it's more likely you'll go for the chocolate, but people still like fruit as well."" Callum says young people will find ways to get around a ban Classmate Callum, said schools should do more to teach pupils about foods that are high in sugar and fat. ""Banning energy drinks will just mean under-16s will just ask someone over 16 to get them for them,"" he said. Kundi thinks education, not a ban, is needed ""I think you need to educate people on energy drinks because some people just drink energy drinks every day of the week like it's water,"" said Kundi. ""So we need to educate them in school and cooking lessons but we shouldn't ban them because they do taste nice and yes, they are unhealthy, but it's about educating young kids on how unhealthy they are."" Deeptha says a ban will not solve the problem Deeptha said: ""I don't think a ban's a good idea because taking them away won't solve the problem. ""Instead advising them and educating them more would be a better option. ""I hope the deputy minister does take our views on board because we the people vote for them and that's really important if we want our country to improve."" In Wales, approximately 1.5 million adults are overweight and 600,000 people are obese - aBody Mass Index (BMI),externalof 30 to 39.9. However, this is not the case for everyone and BMI is not used to diagnose obesity as very muscular people will have a high BMI but not much body fat. Obesity is linked to premature deaths from cancer, heart disease, liver disease and type 2 diabetes. The latestNational Diet and Nutrition Survey,externalshows people are consuming too much sugar, saturated fat, salt and calories, but not enough fibre, fruit and vegetables. The survey showed that people aged 11 -18 consumed up to three times the recommended maximum amount of sugar. Some energy drinks have 21 teaspoons of sugar and the same caffeine as three cups of coffee. Research shows that children who drink at least one energy drink per week are more likely to report symptoms such as headaches, sleep and stomach problems, as well as low mood and irritability. Research by the charity Nesta Cymru found that Welsh consumers significantly underestimated the number of calories in popular snacks. In the poll, 95% of Welsh respondents underestimated the calories in half a sharing bag of crisps containing 447 calories, the average guess was less than half the correct answer. While most people were broadly accurate at guessing the calorie content of meals and drinks, they significantly underestimated the calories of crisps, chocolates and sausage rolls. Half of the respondents overestimated the calories in a Big Mac with medium fries, with an average guess of 1,050 calories compared to the true value of 870. Dr Jonathan Bone says a ban would be an opportunity to improve people's health ""The way we are exposed to unhealthy snacks through adverts, prominent positioning in shops and price offers can have a real impact on what we choose to eat and our overall health,"" said Dr Jonathan Bone from Nesta Cymru. ""With snacks making up a significant portion of our diets, this is a real opportunity to improve the health of people in Wales."" ""We know where policy leads, the industry will follow - the soft drinks levy was successful at nudging manufacturers to reformulate their products with less sugar."" Gavin Partington, director of the  British Soft Drinks Association, said the group's members did not ""market or promote energy drinks to under-16s, nor do they sample products with this age group"". He added: ""In addition, energy drinks carry an advisory note stating 'not recommended for children.' This is all in line with our long-standing code of practice."" The Department of Health and Social Care said obesity was the second biggest cause of cancer and cost the NHS about Â£6.5bn a year. It said it was taking action to encourage people to choose healthier food by introducing calorie labelling on menus, helping families with schemes like Healthy Start and bringing in rules on the placement of less healthy products in stores. A spokesman said further action would be detailed in the health disparities white paper later this year. The Welsh government consultation runs until 1 September.

Train drivers to join other rail workers on strike,"Train drivers are set to join thousands of other rail workers on strike threatening more major disruption to services in June and July. Aslef, Britain's trade union for train drivers, announced strikes at three companies in rows over pay. It comes after the RMT Union, which represents guards and other railway staff, said 40,000 workers from Network Rail and 13 train firms would walkout. The separate strikes are expected to cause severe disruption across the UK. Train driver members of ASLEF will hold their own strike over pay on 26 June at Hull Trains, at Greater Anglia on 23 June, and on Croydon Tramlink on 28, 29 June and 13 and 14 July. Meanwhile, RMT workers will take their industrial action on 21, 23 and 25 June after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. Hospitality firms: Rail strikes will be devastating Unions branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikes When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said its members had not had a pay rise since 2019 and the union wanted drivers an wage increase ""in line with the cost of living, so that we are not, in real terms, worse off"". ""We are not naive. The train companies are doing very well out of Britain's railways - with handsome profits, dividends for shareholders, and big salaries for managers - and we are not going to work longer, for less,"" he said. The various planned strikes coincide with several large events, ranging from Glastonbury Festival, which runs from 22 to 26 June, to a cricket Test match between England and New Zealand taking place from 23 to 27 June. The industrial action has been described as the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"". Downing Street has called the strikes ""selfish"" and warned such action would inflict pain on passengers during ""really tough times"". Meanwhile leaders across the theatre, live music and hospitality industries have said the move will have a devastating impact on businesses recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. RMT has said Network Rail plans to cut up to 2,500 jobs as part of a Â£2bn reduction in spending, with the proposed job cuts including workers who maintain tracks, signals and overhead lines among other things. It also claimed train operators had been subject to pay freezes and changes to their terms and conditions. However, Network Rail has said no proposals have been put forward. Aslef has alreadyagreed a 5% pay deal for drivers at Scot Rail after negotiations. Elsewhere, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) has said it will ballot hundreds of workers for industrial action at train operator Avanti West Coast in a dispute over pay, conditions and job security. TSSA is demanding from Avanti a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies for 2022, no unagreed changes to terms and conditions, and a pay increase which reflects the rising cost of living. Voting will start on June 15 and close two weeks later, with the union saying strikes could start in mid-July if there is support from members.

Wizz Air sparks backlash over working with fatigue,"Wizz Air chief executive Jozsef Varadi said staff should go ""the extra mile"" Wizz Air is facing a backlash from pilot unions after the airline's boss appeared to call on crew to work through fatigue. Chief executive Jozsef Varadi said staff should go ""the extra mile"" when tired so that the airline could avoid cancelling flights. Pilot unions said flying when fatigued is dangerous and his comments showed a ""deficient safety culture"". But Wizz Air said Mr Varadi was addressing all workers not just pilots. Like some airlines, Wizz Air has been forced to cancel flights over the recent Jubilee bank holiday which coincided with schools' half-term break because of ""widespread shortages in staff"". Cancer patient 'devastated' by Wizz Air flight cancellation Suffolk family's disbelief as Wizz Air flights cancelled twice On Wednesday Mr Varadi told workers: ""Now that everyone is getting back into work, I understand that fatigue is a potential outcome of the issues but once we are starting stabilising the rosters, we also need to take down the fatigue rate. ""I mean, we cannot run this business when every fifth person of a base reports sickness because the person is fatigued. We are all fatigued but sometimes it is required to take the extra mile."" Mr Varadi added, ""The damage is huge when we are cancelling the flights, it's huge. It is reputational damage of the brand and it is the other financial damage, transactional damage because we have to pay compensation for that."" The European Cockpit Association, which has been pushing for union recognition at Wizz Air, shared a short clip of Mr Varadi's address. It said the comments encouraged pilots to fly when fatigued, and called on regulators to step in. ""It's like handing the car keys to a drunk driver,"" the union said, adding it showed a ""deficient safety culture"" at the airline. Allow Twitter content?

Martin Chalk, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa), said that ""fatigue has been shown, in many studies, to have effects on a person's thinking and decision making similar to alcohol"". ""No-one supports pilots or other safety sensitive staff working with alcohol in their system,"" he said, adding that he was ""very surprised by the apparent views of Mr Varadi on fatigue"". He called on Mr Varadi to clarify his comments, and that if he really believed pilots should fly when fatigued, ""he should consider whether he is in the right job"". When airline pilots are very tired ""it can be life or death"", he added. ""People's lives are important, and we don't squander them for no reason - definitely not for profit."" There are restrictions on the number of hours air crew are supposed to work. Rules state that air crew should not fly, and should not be required to fly, if they are in a state of fatigue which could endanger passengers or the aircraft. Wizz Air denied that Mr Varadi was specifically targeting pilots but was speaking to all staff. It said in a statement:  ""Our crew unavailability has been very low, at 4%. In this context, going the extra mile to minimise disruption was discussed. ""What this does not mean is compromising safety. Wizz Air and the airline industry are highly regulated, and safety has, and always will be, our first priority."" It added: ""This clip has been edited from an all staff briefing - not pilots only, but also cabin crew and all office employees - on key business updates and current challenges facing aviation.""

Labour queries PPE contracts and Tory peer links,"Baroness Mone, who founded the Ultimo bra company, has denied links with PPE Medpro Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner has asked ministers why they are refusing to release details of PPE contracts for a firm being investigated by the National Crime Agency. She said supplier PPE Medpro was reportedly raided by police, along with the home of Tory peer Baroness Mone - who she said was linked to the firm. There were serious questions about due diligence, she told MPs. Baroness Mone has previously denied any link to PPE Medpro. Government efficiency minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said there was a global shortage of personal protective equipment in the pandemic and British manufacturers provided it in ""unprecedented quantities"". But he declined to address the specifics of PPE Medpro's contracts or any alleged connections between Baroness Mone and the firm. Government writes off Â£8.7bn of pandemic PPE Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority One million NHS masks fail high-grade safety tests UK failed to stockpile crucial protective kit In January,the House of Lords launched an investigation,externalinto her ""alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro"" and whether it potentially breached the code of conduct. Baroness Mone's lawyers have previously told the Guardianshe had no association with the company,externalor any involvement in the awarding of contracts. PPE Medpro was awarded two contracts to supply protective equipment in May 2020 as part of the so-called ""VIP lane"", which allowed MPs, ministers and senior officials to pass on offers of help from suppliers, who could be awarded contracts without competing bids. In June 2020, it won another contract worth Â£122m to supply millions of protective gowns to the NHS. Butthe BBC revealed none were ever used, and the company is in dispute with the government about the contract. It is not known if the raid by the NCA and any potential investigation are connected to PPE contracts. Ms Rayner told the House of Commons that ""a Conservative peer is under investigation by the National Crime Agency over fraud"", after PPE Medpro was ""handed hundreds of millions of pounds in government contracts during the pandemic"". Angela Rayner said there were ""serious questions"" about the contracts She said it had been reported that the company had been raided by the NCA, along with Baroness Mone's home. And she asked what evidence the government held and why they were ""refusing to give a single sheet of it out into the public domain"". ""What have they got to hide?"" she asked. The Labour deputy leader accused ministers of being unwilling to answer because ""they know there is suspicion about the way they handled those contracts"". Saying that storage of unusable or unneeded PPE was costing Â£500,000 a day, she asked whether the government'sProcurement Bill,externalwould ""prevent cronyism from corrupting our government and wasting public money"". Responding for the government, Mr Rees-Mogg said her claims were ""completely false, they have no bearing on reality"" and said they ignored the conditions at the start of the pandemic two years ago. He said British manufacturers managed to increase domestic production of PPE from 1% of the UK's supply to more than 70%, at a time when ""everyone was calling for it, because it was urgent"". On the morning of 27 April, the National Crime Agency executed search warrants at addresses linked to PPE Medpro in London and on the Isle of Man. The BBC spoke to witnesses on the Isle of Man who described seeing more than 10 un-marked vehicles displaying UK number plates and officers who were wearing law enforcement-style vests entering and searching the company building in Douglas. After the raid, the NCA said: ""The NCA does not routinely confirm or deny the existence of investigations or the names of those who may or may not be under investigation"". Baroness Mone has not commented on the raid. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached by the BBC for comment.

Eurozone plans first interest rate rise in 11 years,"ECB president Christine Lagarde said a further rate rise was likely in September The European Central Bank (ECB) has said it intends to raise interest rates for the first time in more than 11 years next month as it tries to control soaring inflation in the eurozone. The ECB said it would raise its key interest rates by 0.25% in July, with further increases planned for later in the year. The bank also intends to end its bond-buying stimulus programme on 1 July. The latest eurozone inflation estimate was 8.1%,external, well above the ECB's target. ""High inflation is a major challenge for all of us. The [ECB] governing council will make sure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term,""the ECB said in a statement.,external ""It is not just a step, it is a journey,""  ECB President Christine Lagarde said of the moves. The ECB's main policy interest rate is currently at -0.50% and it could be back at zero or above by the end of September, the bank said. The last time it raised interest rates in the eurozone was in 2011. Inflation in May ""again rose significantly"" as energy and food prices surged, it added. But it said inflationary pressures had ""broadened and intensified, with prices for many goods and services increasing strongly"". As a result, the bank has upped its estimate for annual inflation this year to 6.8%, before slowing to 3.5% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024. The ECB also cut its growth forecast for the eurozone from 3.7% to 2.8% for 2022, and from 2.8% to 2.1% for 2023. Several other central banks have already started raising interest rates as they try to slow inflation that has been accelerating amid surging energy costs. In the US, the Federal Reserve has now raised rates twice this year, while a series of moves by the Bank of England has now lifted UK rates to 1% - the highest level for 13 years. Interest rates: What are they and how high could they go? How the interest rate rise might affect you Speaking at a news conference after the ECB's decision, the bank's president, Christine Lagarde, said inflation would remain ""undesirably elevated for some time"". Energy prices are up nearly 40% from a year earlier, she said, while food prices rose 7.5% in May, partly due to the impact of the war in Ukraine on food supplies. ""Do we expect that the July interest rate hike will have an immediate impact on inflation? The answer is no,"" she said. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: ""With this inflation outlook and the unavoidable path for higher rates, the ECB is facing stagflation threats full-frontal. ""The strangling hold of desperately high living costs means that euro area growth will slow through the second half of this year, with recession increasingly likely - particularly now with sharp policy tightening in the near-term horizon.""

"Berlin car attack was âcruel rampageâ â ScholzBerlin's mayor says the suspect, who is in police custody, is ""severely mentally impaired"".","The car crashed into a store German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has condemned Wednesday's attack on a busy Berlin street that left one person dead and 31 injured as a ""cruel rampage"". Mr Scholz added that the attack, which was carried out by a 29-year-old man, had left him ""deeply saddened"". Berlin's Mayor Franziska Giffey told local media the attack was ""a dark day in the history of Berlin"". She added that the man, who remains in police custody, is ""severely mentally impaired"". In a short statement issued on Thursday, police said they believe the attack was ""an intentional act"" by the ""allegedly mentally ill 29-year-old"".  It added that he had been travelling in his sister's car. Local media has reported that the suspect, who has been identified as a German-Armenian man who lives in the city, is co-operating with investigators. However, Ms Giffey cautioned that he has made a series of ""confused statements"". The Berlin state prosecutor said on Thursday that there does not seem to be a terrorism link, and that the man appeared to displaying signs of paranoid schizophrenia. The man's sister told the German tabloid Bild that he suffers from ""serious problems"" and Berlin's top security official, Interior Minister Iris Spranger, said the ""evidence suggests this is a case of a mentally ill person running amok"". The prosecutor has recommended the man be held in a psychiatric institution until his trial. Ms Spranger said posters were found in the car used during the attack ""in which he expressed views about Turkey"", but she refuted an earlier report from Bild that a letter of confession had been found in the car. She said the reasons behind the crash will be investigated in detail by officials. Almost all those injured were students who were on a school trip to celebrate finishing their exams. They had travelled from the small town of Bad Arolsen, in the central Hesse region of Germany. Seven of them were severely injured, but are not out of danger, the state prosecutor said. The woman who died has been identified as their schoolteacher. Another teacher remains in a critical condition and is said to be fighting for his life. A district administrator in Hesse, Jurgen van der Horst, told Bild that ""everyone in Bad Arolsen is affected"" by the tragedy. ""It's a big school in a small town,"" Mr van der Horst said. ""Everyone knows everyone here and has contact with the families impacted."" Witnesses described seeing a silver Renault Clio veering into a crowd of people on the pavement near Berlin's busy KurfÃ¼rstendamm shopping avenue, before driving back on to the road and smashing through a shop window at around 10:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Wednesday. A witness who would only be named as F Kacan said the driver had abandoned the car and started to run away but ""we were able to stop him"", AFP news agency reports. The man was not known to the security services but had been stopped by police for property offences, Bild reported. The incident happened opposite Breitscheidplatz, where 12 people were killed in a terrorist attack in 2016 when a truck was deliberately driven into a crowd of people at a Christmas market. On Wednesday the mayor said it was too early to know if the area had been chosen deliberately, but she said: ""It's a situation where you think, for God's sake, not again!"" After the Christmas market attack in 2016, concrete barriers were erected near the site to prevent future attacks, but Ms Giffey admitted that it is impossible to provide such protections for ""all of the city"".

US House passes gun bill doomed to fail in senate,"This video can not be played 'I don't want it to happen again' - Uvalde survivor The US House of Representatives has voted through a series of measures regulating the sale of guns, but which are destined to fail in the Senate. The new measures would bar sales of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 and ban large-capacity magazines. But Republican opposition in the Senate means the bill has little chance of entering law, despite a renewed focus on gun control in the wake of a series of mass shootings in the US. Hours before the vote, survivors of the Uvalde school shooting gave emotional testimony to lawmakers which reduced some to tears. The primary school shooting in the Texan city claimed the lives of 21 people, including 19 young children. One 11-year-old girl told the hearing - in pre-recorded testimony - that she had smeared her classmate's blood on herself to play dead, and graphically described the moment the gunman shot her teacher in the head. Uvalde survivor covered herself in friend's blood The teachers who died trying to save their pupils The Uvalde attack and other recent mass killings have sparked a new round of bipartisan talks on gun control in the US Senate, but Democrats need at least 10 Republicans on board to pass any new laws. Conservatives want to protect the constitutional right to bear arms and object to limiting sales of the assault-style rifles used in the Uvalde shooting. And while a group of Republican and Democratic senators are trying to find common ground, correspondents say that whatever they come up with is very unlikely to involve any sweeping reforms. On Thursday, more than 220 CEOs of major companies - including Levi Strauss & Co, Lululemon and Lyft - called on the Senate ""take immediate action"" to reduce gun violence following the recent spate of shooting deaths. ""Taken together, the gun violence epidemic represents a public health crisis that continues to devastate communities - especially Black and Brown communities - and harm our national economy,"" the business leaders wrote. Adding further pressure to lawmakers, major Republican donors joined other conservative Texans in signing an open letter pushing for gun control. The letter is expected to run as a full-page ad in the Dallas Morning News on Sunday and will support expanding background checks and raising the age to purchase a gun to 21. In the House of Representatives, Wednesday's wide-ranging package of legislation, called the ""Protecting Our Kids Act"" by lawmakers, passed by 223-204 votes with just five Republicans joining Democrats in supporting the bill. In addition to tighter controls around the sale of guns, it would also introduce a scheme allowing local government to compensate individuals who surrender high capacity magazine and strengthen existing regulations on bump stocks and untraceable ghost guns. However the measures cannot pass into law without approval in the Senate. ""America has lost more children from gun violence than any other cause. Does that embarrass you?"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during a debate on the bill. ""To think that in our country, more children have died from gun violence than any other cause? These stories are tragically all too common in America today."" But House Republicans claimed the bill was an attack on citizens' constitutional rights to own a firearm. ""The speaker started by saying this bill is about protecting our kids,"" Ohio Republican Jim Jordan said. ""But this bill doesn't do it. What this bill does is take away second amendment rights, God-given rights, protected by our Constitution from law-abiding American citizens."" Bipartisan negotiations are ongoing in the Senate on more moderate measures that could gain the support of enough Republicans to pass the 60-vote threshold required in the chamber. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Thursday that the talks were making progress. But one senior Republican, Texas Senator John Cornyn, warned on Wednesday that there are ""sticking points everywhere"". Only a handful of the 50 Republican senators appear open to new gun legislation, with Democrats seeking narrower measures as a compromise. Senators are expected to reach a final agreement by the end of the week. Proposals with the greatest public support include a ""red flag"" law that would prevent individuals with mental illness or a criminal history from purchasing firearms, and expanded background checks on gun purchasers that would include private gun sales.

"âAbuse, assault, profitâ - children's homes staff speak out","Mia is a former Calcot Services for Children support worker Children in care have reported being groomed and sexually assaulted in homes run by a firm making huge profits. Multiple employees of Calcot Services for Children say vulnerable young people were failed. BBC News has found it made profits of 36% last year, double that of other big care providers - figures already considered excessive by a watchdog. Calcot said profits were high because of built up investment, and it prioritises safeguarding children. The company runs eight homes, four schools and supported living accommodation in southern England. It made profits of 42% in 2020 and 36% in 2021, using an industry-standard measure. That is more than double the average annual profit made by the biggest 15 providers of children's services in Great Britain over the past five years - ashighlighted in a recent reportby the government's competition watchdog. The study found that profits of 17% were much higher than would be expected if the market was operating well. The sector is in ""crisis"" - says the providers' group, the Independent Children's Homes Association - with increasing demand for places, severe staff shortages and ballooning costs. But children's homes are the last resort for many young people, with the foster care system often judged as inappropriate for those who have suffered the worst abuse and neglect. And the time when homes were largely managed by local councils has long gone - more than 80% are now run by private companies. The BBC has seen leaked company records and confidential local authority briefings. It has also spoken to a dozen current and former Calcot employees. They told us the company had accepted high-risk children, who came with increased levels of funding, but did not meet all their needs and keep them safe. Our investigation found: Children had reported being groomed for sex, given alcohol, and also assaulted by staff Allegations of child-on-child sexual abuse and suicide attempts after youngsters had absconded were not reported to Ofsted despite an obligation to do so Calcot did not provide some dedicated care and teaching staff despite receiving specific funding from local authorities Claims of inadequate staffing at homes where there were serious incidents - including an assault and rape allegation Some support workers had been asked to sign non-disclosure agreements when they left the company The Children's Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, told us she was ""appalled"" by our findings and said they revealed ""actual harm"". This video can not be played Watch: Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza says the children's homes findings are ""horrendous"" One former Calcot support worker we spoke to, Mia*, said it seemed to her that Calcot put profit before childcare and suffered from ""chronic"" under-staffing. She felt it was all about ""getting that high-level amount of funding for children with challenging behaviour"". A letter sent to Ofsted by another member of staff echoes that claim. The whistleblower wrote: ""I don't believe they [the company] are acting in the best interest of any young people."" Mia told us one girl's needs were so acute that the local authority agreed to provide extra funding so three members of staff could continually care for her in the daytime, known as a ""three-to-one"". Yet Mia says she was frequently the only staff member working with the girl. On another occasion, she said a colleague - who had also been working alone - was knocked unconscious by the teenager. Mia says the girl was later found with sharp knives in her bedroom. But one particular incident last year caused Mia to leave the company. She says a 17-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy were found undressed without supervision. According to Mia, the boy told other staff the girl had made him touch her genitals. Mia says senior management assured her the incident had been reported to authorities - but Ofsted has told the BBC it wasn't. She says she then found that no record had been placed on Calcot's own incident log. ""I knew I couldn't stay in a company where the standards were so low,"" she says. ""It was just failure after failure."" BBC News has learned of serious incidents involving other children of very high need and risk who were accepted into Calcot homes. One teenager - a victim of sexual exploitation - was even taken from a Calcot home by a support worker and given alcohol. Tina*, who was 16, had been subject to a Deprivation of Liberty order - a court-imposed restriction on her freedom. Such measures are normally used when children are sent to secure units. The teenager was meant to have been kept inside the Calcot home for her own welfare. Shortly afterwards, she went missing for a time. Another incident - the BBC has learned - concerns a school run by Calcot. The building and grounds of a Calcot-run school Jodie* - who has significant learning difficulties and was judged to be at significant risk of absconding - had been given a place at the school. She was also living in a Calcot children's home. She soon fled the home with a boy - a victim of sexual abuse - and later alleged that he had raped her. After returning, Jodie continued to attend the school despite the boy living in residential quarters in the same building. She continued to abscond and twice attempted to take her own life. Once, she reached a motorway bridge nearly half a mile away. Another time, former teacher Mohamed Abdulmohamed found her climbing over the side of a river bridge. ""I ran, grabbed her and we fell to the ground,"" he says. ""There was a good five minutes where we sat there and she was just crying."" Mohamed Abdulmohamed was the behaviour lead at one school BBC News has learned that neither of Jodie's absconding incidents was reported to Ofsted despite Calcot being obliged to do so. Three former school staff members say concerns were raised about security at the school gates, but no improvements were made at this time. Calcot told us all incidents the company is made aware of are reported to the relevant bodies. It denied concerns had been raised about school security and said new electric gates were installed - although the BBC has established this occurred many months after Jodie's suicide attempts. Former staff at a Calcot-run school - Eton Dorney - have also questioned what thousands of pounds of specific local authority funding for pupils were spent on. They say some children, who had each been allocated up to Â£23,000 for one-to-one teaching, did not receive all the extra support. ""This is money from the public purse that's meant to improve the lives of some of the most vulnerable children in society,"" says Maggie McCarthy, a former teacher at the school. Maggie McCarthy used to teach at Eton Dorney School Two former members of Calcot's senior leadership team also told us that staff performing exceptionally challenging roles were both poorly qualified and paid. Our analysis of Calcot's accounts found it spent just 40% of its turnover on staffing costs. We found that the average spend by more than 30 other big providers was 58%. Calcot told us it has the required number of staff in its homes. We have also learned that one teaching assistant at Eton Dorney was accused of assaulting autistic children on three occasions, and found to have turned up at an inset day smelling of alcohol. Another member of Calcot's staff was recently jailed for abusing his position and sexual activity with a child. The man - a former member of office staff at the company - had been redeployed as a support worker. The 28-year-old was sent to a supported living home for older teenagers and was often required to stay overnight. He groomed 17-year-old Michela* by sending her messages on social media calling her ""beautiful"" and saying he was longing for a ""cuddle"". Shortly after, he kissed her on the neck. After a few months, he had unprotected sex with Michela in the living room of the home while other young people were in their bedrooms. Afterwards, he went outside to smoke cannabis. Michela headed upstairs to her room and cried. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. Within a month, she reported what had happened to another staff member and he was arrested. Michela found it hard to recover, especially as she was not immediately moved out of the home. In messages sent to a friend at the time, she described being left feeling ""manipulated"" and ""broken"". She started self-harming and attempted to take her life. Her abuser was jailed. When asked by the BBC on the steps of the court, the former office worker said he didn't know why he had been allowed such responsibility at the Calcot home. An allegation of rape in a Calcot home has also been made by a female support worker. She says she was attacked by a contractor while working a day shift in a property she claims was understaffed. Despite these incidents and staff concerns, which all took place in the past three years, Calcot has maintained a proud record with Ofsted - all of its children's homes and schools are rated outstanding or good by the regulator. Many of the safeguarding issues had been reported to Ofsted, including Tina being removed from her home and given alcohol - and the rape allegation made by Jodie. We asked Ofsted why these incidents had such little impact on Calcot's ratings. It said a number of inspections and visits to Calcot homes were currently being made. The BBC has also learnt that two homes in Doncaster, run by a different company, maintained their good Ofsted ratings until their closure was announced - despite more than 100 reports of concern having been made since 2018 to the local council and regulator. Police are now investigating allegations of abuse at the homes operated by the Hesley Group, which says it is co-operating fully with the authorities. Do you have more information about this story?

Dame Rachel de Souza said the sector as a whole included some ""exceptional"" private children's homes, but unfortunately ""some of the worst providers"" were also harboured by the industry. She said it seemed wrong that some providers were ""still allowed to make large profits"". ""The entire system needs radical reform."" Huge profits made from children's care - report Early help for families urged in social care reset In all, the BBC looked at the accounts of the 32 biggest private providers of children's homes and residential special schools in England. Calcot - the 20th-largest provider - told us its recent annual profits appeared high because it had been unable to spend money on investment during the pandemic. Although the BBC has learned that in 2019, before Covid, the company made a 32% profit - using the same industry-standard EBITDA measure of profitability. In a statement, Calcot Services for Children said: ""The sector is rightly subject to stringent regulation and the company prioritises safeguarding all children in its care. It has a history of more than 30 years caring for and educating vulnerable and challenging children. ""It is known for achieving positive outcomes and is highly regarded by Ofsted and the local authorities with which it works."" Calcot added that it was grateful to the BBC ""for highlighting what it considers to be safeguarding issues"". A recent review of England's council-run children's services suggested that the government should levy a windfall tax on the 15 largest private providers. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We expect all children's homes to provide the right support, care and protection for children who live there - no private company should exploit those in need."" It added that it was taking steps to tackle poor-quality provision and root out bad practice. *Name has been changed Huge profits made from children's care - report Early help for families urged in social care reset Almost 100,000 children could be in care by 2025 Pastor Mick: âIf I lock this door, he diesâ Â© 2025 BBC.

Eurozone set for first rate rise in 11 years,"ECB president Christine Lagarde said a further rate rise was likely in September The European Central Bank (ECB) has said it intends to raise interest rates for the first time in more than 11 years next month as it tries to control soaring inflation in the eurozone. The ECB said it would raise its key interest rates by 0.25% in July, with further increases planned for later in the year. The bank also intends to end its bond-buying stimulus programme on 1 July. The latest eurozone inflation estimate was 8.1%,external, well above the ECB's target. ""High inflation is a major challenge for all of us. The [ECB] governing council will make sure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term,""the ECB said in a statement.,external ""It is not just a step, it is a journey,""  ECB President Christine Lagarde said of the moves. The ECB's main policy interest rate is currently at -0.50% and it could be back at zero or above by the end of September, the bank said. The last time it raised interest rates in the eurozone was in 2011. Inflation in May ""again rose significantly"" as energy and food prices surged, it added. But it said inflationary pressures had ""broadened and intensified, with prices for many goods and services increasing strongly"". As a result, the bank has upped its estimate for annual inflation this year to 6.8%, before slowing to 3.5% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024. The ECB also cut its growth forecast for the eurozone from 3.7% to 2.8% for 2022, and from 2.8% to 2.1% for 2023. Several other central banks have already started raising interest rates as they try to slow inflation that has been accelerating amid surging energy costs. In the US, the Federal Reserve has now raised rates twice this year, while a series of moves by the Bank of England has now lifted UK rates to 1% - the highest level for 13 years. Interest rates: What are they and how high could they go? How the interest rate rise might affect you Speaking at a news conference after the ECB's decision, the bank's president, Christine Lagarde, said inflation would remain ""undesirably elevated for some time"". Energy prices are up nearly 40% from a year earlier, she said, while food prices rose 7.5% in May, partly due to the impact of the war in Ukraine on food supplies. ""Do we expect that the July interest rate hike will have an immediate impact on inflation? The answer is no,"" she said. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: ""With this inflation outlook and the unavoidable path for higher rates, the ECB is facing stagflation threats full-frontal. ""The strangling hold of desperately high living costs means that euro area growth will slow through the second half of this year, with recession increasingly likely - particularly now with sharp policy tightening in the near-term horizon.""

Calls for more help as petrol hits Â£100 a tank,"Driving groups have called for more support to help drivers after the cost of filling an average family car with petrol hit Â£100 for the first time. The RAC motoring group called it ""a truly dark day"" as the cost of filling a 55-litre tank reached Â£100.27 for petrol and Â£103.43 for diesel. The RAC and its rival the AA urged the chancellor to cut VAT on fuel or to reduce fuel duty further. The Treasury said it had provided Â£37bn to ease the cost of living already. Rising petrol prices are putting pressure on household budgets, with energy bills and food prices also now at multi-year highs. Pump prices began to soar after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February led to oil supply fears. However, there are concerns that petrol retailers are not passing on a recent 5p cut in fuel duty to consumers. According to the RAC, the average pump price of a litre of unleaded petrol is now 182.31p while for diesel it is 188.05p. However, the motoring group has warned this could rise to over Â£2 a litre soon. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""While fuel prices have been setting new records on a daily basis, households up and down the country may never have expected to see the cost of filling an average-sized family car reach three figures. ""A further duty cut or a temporary reduction in VAT would go a long way towards helping drivers, especially those on lower incomes who have no choice other than to drive."" The AA called on the government to cut fuel duty by 10p per litre immediately and introduce a ""fuel price stabiliser"", which would reduce fuel duty when petrol prices go up and increase it when they drop. Five tips for saving petrol money examined Petrol prices see biggest daily jump in 17 years Service station defends Â£2 per litre fuel costs Why is petrol so expensive? The wholesale price of petrol - the price at which supermarkets and independent forecourts buy it at - has actually dropped by 5p since 1 June, when it was Â£1.55 a litre, to Â£1.50 on Wednesday. But motoring groups say it takes time for changes in the wholesale price to feed through to the pumps due to the way retailers buy fuel in advance. It comes as some UK forecourts are already selling petrol above Â£2 a litre, according to price comparison website PetrolPrices. On Wednesday, the highest price was found to be 202.9p a litre at BP sites on the A1 near Sunderland, the M4 near Chippenham in Wiltshire and the M6 near Burton-in-Kendal, Cumbria. Motorists at the BP garage at Washington services on the A1(M) on Wednesday were paying more than Â£2 a litre Ewan, 31, told the BBC he needed a car to get to work in centre of Aberdeen, otherwise it was a one-and-a-half hour bus journey. But he said he was now paying up to Â£90 to fill a tank and the petrol expenses he could claim through work were no longer enough. The civil servant, who lives alone, said it was just one more thing pushing up the cost of living and he was now ""barely"" getting by. ""I used to be able to save about Â£200 a month but now I am dipping into savings,"" he said. ""It makes me quite stressed out."" The RAC argues the Treasury could afford to offer more help, as the higher fuel prices rise, the more it collects in VAT receipts - currently around 30p per litre. It added that despite March's fuel duty cut, the government still collects 53p in duty on every litre sold. The government has so far ruled out cutting VAT, arguing that any increases in receipts it gets from higher fuel prices will be largely offset by reduced household spending and VAT on other items. It has no plans to cut fuel duty either. Instead, Downing Street has indicated that fuel retailers failing to pass on the 5p duty cut could be named and shamed. Answering questions from journalists in Blackpool, Boris Johnson said: ""What I want to see is those cuts in taxation not just swallowed up in one gulp, without touching the gullet of the fuel companies, I want to see those cuts having an impact on the pumps. ""And we are watching very closely to see what happens."" Lisa Stevenson, who owns Tolladine service station near Worcester, told the BBC her prices per litre - at 197.9p for unleaded and 194.9p for diesel - were purely the result of volatile wholesale fuel prices driven by the Ukraine war. She added that customers were now buying less fuel because of the soaring costs: ""A delivery of fuel would previously have lasted me a week to 10 days, now its 2-3 weeks."" Alasdair Locke, chairman of Motor Fuel Group, the UK's largest independent forecourt operator, told the BBC's Today programme that his business had passed on the 5p duty cut to consumers ""immediately"". ""It would be easy if there was evidence we're just profiteering but there is no evidence of that, in fact rather the opposite. Our margins are under pressure, along with everyone else's."" Commenting on the rising pump prices, a government spokesperson said: ""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices which is why we have acted to protect the eight million most vulnerable British families through at least Â£1,200 of direct payments this year with additional support for pensioners and those claiming disability benefits."" They added that the typical employee would save more than Â£330 a year through a tax cut in July, while the 5p cut to fuel duty would save a typical family Â£100.

Smoking age of sale should rise by year each year,"The age at which people can buy tobacco and cigarettes in England should be raised year by year so that eventually no-one can buy them, a review says. The call has been made in an independent report by ex-charity boss Javed Khan asked for by ministers. Under the plan the age of sale would rise from 18 by one year every year so the children of today will never be allowed to buy tobacco. The government has not agreed to the plan, but said it would consider it. However, sources said it was unlikely at this stage that ministers would agree to the move. Smoking rates have been falling since the 1970s. But there are still six million smokers in England - seven million across the UK. The government has said new ideas are needed to convince the final remaining groups to quit. It has set an ambition for England to be smoke free  - defined as less than 5% of the population smoking - by 2030. Achieving that will be a huge challenge, which is why Health Secretary Sajid Javid asked former Barnardo's chief executive Mr Khan to review the current rules and approaches. The proposal on raising the age of sale is similar to what is being introduced in New Zealand, where buying tobacco products will remain banned for anyone born after 2008. In England, the age limit was raised from 16 to 18 in 2007. Currently, one in nine 18 to 24-year-olds smokes, according to the Office for National Statistics. Mr Khan has also recommended: Setting aside an extra Â£125m for smoke free policies, with an extra Â£70 million per year ring-fenced for stop smoking services Promotion of vapes as an effective ""swap to stop"" tool to help people quit smoking Introducing a licensing system for shops to sell tobacco and banning supermarkets altogether Increasing duties on products and banning duty-free tobacco Ministers said they would consider the proposals as part of a wider package of measures they are looking to introduce this year to improve the health of the nation and tackle inequalities. The report has been produced for ministers in England. But Wales and Northern Ireland have already promised to work closely with counterparts in England over raising the legal age for smoking. The number of deaths caused by smoking is falling - but it remains the leading cause of preventable illness and premature death and is estimated to cause a quarter of all cancer deaths. In 2019, it accounted for 75,000 deaths in England - 15% of the total. Prof Jim McManus, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said if the government was to implement the recommendations they would ""make a huge difference to the nation's health"". And Deborah Arnott, of the charity Action on Smoking and Health, said given the higher rates of smoking and ill-health in more deprived areas only by making ""smoking obsolete"" could the government deliver on its levelling up mission. But Simon Clark, of smokers' lobby group Forest, criticised the recommendations. He said: ""Creeping prohibition won't stop young adults smoking. ""It will simply drive the sale of tobacco underground and consumers will buy cigarettes on the black market where no-one pays tax and products are completely unregulated.""

Police chief sorry for tear gassing Liverpool fans,"Steve Rotheram said the day had quickly turned from a dream into a nightmare Liverpool's mayor has said some French police officers were seeking confrontation at last month's Champions League final in Paris. Steve Rotheram said police were quick to threaten fans with their batons. The head of policing at the final earlier apologised for using tear gas on Liverpool fans travelling to the Stade de France but said he had no alternative. The fiasco has prompted uproar in France as well as the UK and Spain. Liverpool fans, including families with children, were tear-gassed and pepper-sprayed outside the stadium by police ahead of the final between Liverpool and Real Madrid on 28 May. Then as they left the area, some fans were attacked by 300 to 400 local youths. The French Senate is now investigating the incident. Speaking to the Senate on Thursday, Mr Rotheram - who was at the final - said ""the day gradually transformed from a dream into a nightmare"". ""I saw police who were, in a way, looking to find a problem,"" he said. He added that he had been robbed of his possessions at the event. French authorities blamed late arrivals and fake tickets for overcrowding and chaotic scenes before the match. Liverpool fans react as they queue to access Stade de France before Champions League Final on 28 May Speaking earlier at the Senate, head of policing at the final Didier Lallement defended the tactics he used, insisting his ""red line"" was to save lives. Using tear gas outside the stadium was the only means they had to get the crowd to move back without charging at them, which would have been ""devastating"", he explained. However, if his force had not dispersed the crowd, people could have died in a crush. ""I am fully aware that people acting in good faith, even families, were tear-gassed,"" he added. ""For this I am very sorry. But there was no other way."" He did however admit that the security operation was ""obviously a failure,"" saying ""people were pushed around or attacked even though we owed them security."" He said his force was not prepared for the scale of the problem that thousands of fake tickets caused. In another development during the Senate's investigation, it emerged that all the CCTV from outside the stadium on the day of the final has been deleted. Erwan Le PrÃ©vost, director of international relations at the French Football Federation (FFF) told the Senate that CCTV footage of the stadium is automatically deleted after seven days. As the footage had not been requested before the seven days were up, it was deleted. He added that the images were ""extremely violent"". The Senate commission's co-president Laurent Lafon told AFP that as an investigation was opened a day after the game, there would have been ""plenty of time"" to request the footage. ""We need to understand what happened,"" he said. This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris Interior minister GÃ©rald Darmanin has come under fire for his own response, blaming the trouble outside the stadium on ""massive, industrial-scale"" ticket fraud which caused Liverpool fans to turn up en masse. Mr Lallement said the scale of fake tickets had not been considered ahead of the match. Asked why he had put the number of fake tickets at 30-40,000, the police chief admitted he may have been wrong but that was the number he had estimated at the time. Harrowing accounts of post-match violence spark debate How the Champions League final trouble unfolded Liverpool fans have complained of fearing for their safety in the crush, despite arriving hours earlier. But they have also told of local gangs from the Saint-Denis area descending on crowds after the match, stealing phones and watches and threatening them with knives. Mr Lallement pledged to do everything he could to find those responsible for the post-match violence and to bring them to justice. He encouraged British and Spanish citizens to file complaints to help find those responsible. Uefa eventually apologised to fans of both clubs last week for the ""frightening and distressing events"" they had witnessed.

Student's heart failure linked to energy drinks,"A 21-year old university student developed heart failure after ""excessive"" consumption of energy drinks, a new report suggests. For two years, the man drank four 500ml energy drinks a day, according to the BMJ Case Report. He spent 58 days in hospital, including the intensive care unit which he described as ""traumatising"". Before the hospital admission, he suffered with shortness of breath and weight loss for four months. Doctors treating him considered a number of diagnoses, but concluded: ""Energy drink-induced cardiotoxicity was felt to be the most likely cause."" An organ transplant was considered after tests revealed both his heart and kidneys had failed - with the kidney failure linked to a long-standing but previously undiagnosed condition. The unnamed patient contributed to the report, and was unable to continue his university studies three months before hospital admission because of his health. ""When I was drinking up to four energy drinks per day, I suffered from tremors and heart palpitations, which interfered with my ability to concentrate on daily tasks and my studies at university."" The authors said recovery or relapse was difficult to predict After nine months his heart function has appeared to have returned with ""mildly impaired function"", but the report said it was difficult to predict recovery or potential for relapse. The student suffered from severe migraine headaches which would ""often occur during the periods"" when he didn't have energy drinks. ""This also restricted my ability to perform day-to-day tasks and even leisurely activities such as going to the park or taking a walk,"" he said. He felt there should be more awareness about energy drinks and the effect of their contents. ""I believe they are very addictive and far too accessible to young children. I think warning labels, similar to smoking, should be made to illustrate the potential dangers of the ingredients in energy drink,"" he added. Energy drinks ban for children proposed Fizzy drinks: What we know and what we don't This comes after a separate study done by researchers at Cardiff University analysed the responses of a health survey of more than 176,000 secondary school children in Wales aged 11 to 16 between 2013 and 2017. It found that 6% of pupils said they drank energy drinks on a ""daily"" basis - a trend which didn't change over time. The study's lead author Dr Kelly Morgan said there was a difference in consumption between those from low and high socioeconomic groups. ""Marketing campaigns for energy drinks are often aimed at those from more disadvantaged backgrounds."" Their popularity was unlikely to be hit unless policy measures were ""put in place"", Dr Morgan added. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

Supermarkets ban energy drinks for under-16s,"Retailers will ban the sale of energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre Sales of energy drinks to children under 16 have been banned in most major UK supermarkets, amid concerns about high levels of sugar and caffeine. Boots is also joining supermarkets such as Asda, Waitrose, Tesco and the Co-op in introducing the rule. Retailers will limit sale of energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to under-16s. Co-op said it recognised the ""growing concern about the consumption of energy drinks"" among children. The handbag that costs as much as a house Conman returns with scam targeting actors A routine abduction - of a 13-year-old girl Other supermarkets introducing the voluntary ban include Aldi, Lidl, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Boots is the first retailer to partake that is not a supermarket. The Co-op, Aldi and Lidl implemented the change on 1 March, while Morrisons, Waitrose, Asda and Boots put the rule in place on 5 March. A Boots spokesperson said: ""Helping our customers to live healthier lives has always been our core purpose. ""We have listened to the growing public concern about young people consuming these high sugar and highly-caffeinated drinks."" Although Tesco has announced its decision to follow, it will not implement the change until 26 March. The move follows calls by campaigners for a complete ban on energy drinks, and after MP Maria Caulfield asked Prime Minister Theresa May toconsider a UK-wide banearlier this year. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, who led the#NotForChildren campaign,external, welcomed the news and took to Twitter to celebrate the supermarkets that had ""done the right thing"".

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities. It raises money for Unicef and this year the charity says some of the money raised will go towards helping those impacted by the war. ""This event is going to help a lot of people in Ukraine,"" he says, ""especially kids, we're going to create a lot of great programmes to improve a lot of things for kids.""

McDonald's pulled out of Russia over the Ukraine war. Its new Russian buyer has not yet revealed the name of the chain, although the logo has been revealed Aiden Aslin, left, Shaun Pinner, right, and Brahim Saaudun, centre, have been sentenced to death Amnesty International says that three foreign soldiers sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court is a situation that ""has no precedent"". Two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun were captured by Russian troops while fighting for Ukraine. All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely."" Chris PartridgeBBC News This video can not be played Low-flying Ukrainian jet skims above trees Ukraine
is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied. Brits Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were all sentenced to death Thanks for joining us this afternoon - here's the latest on what's been happening in Ukraine: Russia defends death sentences for captured Britons  UK's defence secretary visits Ukraine  Cholera in Mariupol  How long will the war last?  Stay with us for the latest developments as they unfold. Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking to students across the UK in a live broadcast to several universities. The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our
history, our state, our identity, and to deny our existence. And as such to
tell the world that we never existed that we are an artificially created people
like a variety of some kind of plants or animals."" State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The
venue where Volodymyr Zelensky will be speaking to students at Coventry
University usually hosts cinema nights - but this evening it will be the
Ukrainian president's face on the big screen. Only 75 tickets were made available
for the event, and they were snapped up within hours. The first few
students have started arriving and there are a few Ukrainian flags draped on
the front row. Pavel Pimkin The president of the universityâs Ukraine Society is Pavel Pimkin, 20, whose male relatives are still in his home country. He says heâs feeling âhonoured and nervousâ about asking his nationâs president a question later. The address will also be shown at other British universities that have Ukrainian societies.

Johnson wants benefit claimants to buy homes,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on housing benefit changes: ""It's time to turn benefits to bricks."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has unveiled plans to allow benefits to be put towards mortgages in England, as he sought to relaunch his premiership. He made the ""benefits-to-bricks"" pledge in his first big speech since surviving a bid to oust him by Tory MPs. Speaking in Blackpool, he also vowed to extend a scheme to allow social tenants to buy their homes. But critics say the proposals are unworkable and would make the housing crisis worse. In Monday's confidence vote on Mr Johnson's leadership, four in 10 Tory MPs backed getting rid of him, amid anger over widespread Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street during lockdown. Under-fire Johnson vows to get on with the job Is the government meeting its new-homes target? Chris Mason: Boris Johnson faces political and economic gales There is also disquiet among Conservatives over the government's decision to raise National Insurance, while the cost of living is soaring and the public finances have been battered by the expense of dealing with Covid. In a wide-ranging speech aimed at demonstrating he has not run out of ideas and is focused on issues that most matter to voters, Mr Johnson promised more help ""over the next few weeks"" to deal with 40-year-high inflation driven by energy price rises. ""Global headwinds are strong... but our engines are stronger,"" said Mr Johnson, adding that ""we are on your side"" in cutting the cost of fuel, childcare, transport and other living expenses. ""And, while it's not going to be quick or easy, you can be confident that things will get better, that we will emerge from this a strong country with a healthy economy,"" the prime minister told the audience at Blackpool and The Fylde College. He said ""economic growth"" was the answer and he hoped tax cuts - which have been demanded by some Tory MPs - would come ""sooner rather than later"". Mr Johnson restated the government's commitment to extending a home-buying scheme, known as right to buy, to housing association tenants. He said he wanted to extend it ""within existing spending plans"" and ensure a ""one-for-one replacement"" of each home sold. This video can not be played Watch: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says PM's new housing policy is the ""wrong approach"" The prime minister also said universal credit recipients would get to choose whether to spend their benefits on rent or put them towards a mortgage. The government will explore discounting Lifetime ISA and Help to Buy ISA savings from Universal Credit eligibility rules, Mr Johnson said. Currently, claimants are only eligible for universal credit if they have savings below Â£16,000, and Lifetime ISAs are included in this limit. Changing these policies would ""help millions realise the dream of home ownership"", Mr Johnson said. Housing benefits, which help low-income or unemployed people pay their rent, cost the government around Â£30bn a year, much of which goes to private landlords. A person is not usually eligible for the payments if they have a mortgage. This speech was in the diary before the confidence vote on Monday but it nevertheless became a chance to try and reset Boris Johnson's premiership. This was a prime minister who wanted to talk political plans - not personal problems. Mr Johnson wants to focus on ways to help households with costs - but there are big questions about how and when the policies announced today will be delivered. This won't be an overnight equivalent of Thatcher's council house scheme. The PM also failed to commit to the pledge to build 300,000 houses a year in England by 2025 - something which was in the 2019 Conservative general election manifesto. It's looked increasingly unlikely since the government dropped plans to reform the planning system in England to make it easier for developers to win approval. A reminder perhaps that housing pledges can often be easier in theory than in practice. About two million council homes in England have been sold under right to buy since 1980 Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy questioned whether people on benefits could afford mortgage deposits, saying: ""This speech was yet more evidence that the prime minister and his tired government are out of ideas. ""You can't solve a housing crisis with back-of-the-envelope policies that have no realistic chance of success."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""Boris Johnson has lost the confidence of his party, Parliament and the country. The desperate attempt to relaunch his leadership today will do nothing to win it back."" It's not entirely clear how the government's right-to-buy policy is going to work: There is already a shortage of social housing without selling properties - 1.1 million people are on waiting lists The government has not revealed who will be able to take advantage of the scheme, how much it will cost and whether it will be capped It's the third such pilot scheme - previous ones found that some housing association properties were not eligible to be sold and there was concern about the financial risks being taken on by participants While the government has said that there will be funding for housing associations to replace each home sold, previous pilots have had problems with replacements coming quickly enough or being like-for-like The policy depends on negotiations with housing associations, which will not necessarily want to take part. Council tenants in England have been able to buy their homes at a discount since 1980, when Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher introduced the policy. But the same is not true for people renting from housing associations, unless their property was once owned by a local authority and they lived in it during this period. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, called Mr Johnson's housing proposals ""baffling, unworkable, and a dangerous gimmick"". Extending the right to buy would ""put our rapidly shrinking supply of social homes at even greater risk,"" she added. Right-to-buy: A tainted gift?

PGA Tour suspends members for playing LIV event,"Multiple major winners Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson are in the same group at Centurion Club on Thursday The PGA Tour has suspended all of its members who are playing in this week's Saudi-funded LIV Golf Invitational. The tournament, being held at Centurion Club near London, is the most lucrative in the history of the game with a $25m (Â£20m) prize fund. Six-time major winner Phil Mickelson is among the biggest names to be affected. LIV Golf issued an immediate reply calling the PGA Tour ""vindictive"" and said this ""deepens the divide between the Tour and its members"". The statement added: ""It's troubling that the Tour, an organisation dedicated to creating opportunities for golfers to play the game, is the entity blocking golfers from playing. ""This certainly is not the last word on this topic. The era of free agency is beginning as we are proud to have a full field of players joining us in London, and beyond."" The PGA Tour released its statement 30 minutes after play had begun at Centurion, where 48 players are competing in the first of eight planned LIV Golf invitational events. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas, who are both playing at the PGA Tour's Canadian Open this week, welcomed the ruling. ""Anybody that's shocked clearly hasn't been listening,"" two-time major winner Thomas said. ""They took that risk going into it, whether they thought it was a risk or not. ""I have great belief and great confidence in the PGA Tour and where we're going and continuing to grow to, and those guys just aren't going to be a part of it."" Thomas added: ""They're obviously throwing so much money at people that it's very hard to turn down. ""It doesn't matter who you are or what it is, everything has a number. They're reaching that number for some people and I hope that they don't get others. ""But I think a very strong core group of us is very stable and firm in our position, and I hope that it stays that way."" Northern Ireland's McIlroy said: ""I think it's the right thing because these guys have broken rules and done things outside of the tournament regulations, and because of that there are going to be consequences, I guess."" England's Ian Poulter, playing at the LIV event this week, said he would appeal the decision from the PGA Tour: ""It's a shame if they view this as something. ""When you feel you haven't done anything wrong and want to promote the game of golf, it would be incredibly disappointing if it turns out that way. ""I will appeal for sure. It makes no sense. Having two Tour cards and the ability to play golf all over the world, what's wrong with that?"" Graeme McDowell said he'd resigned from the PGA Tour ""30 minutes before I teed it up"" at the LIV event on Thursday. ""It was a difficult decision but it puts me into a less litigious situation,"" he said. ""I didn't want to resign, the PGA Tour has been great. This is about wanting to add on additional tournaments to my golf career."" Speaking after playing on Thursday, Mickelson said: ""As I said in my press conference yesterday, any PGA Tour matters I'm not going to discuss publicly."" Former world number one Greg Norman is the chief executive of LIV Golf, which has Â£1.6bn of funding from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The first seven events all have the same $25m prize fund, with the winner collecting $4m, while a team element will see the top three teams share $5m. The eighth event is a $50m team championship and will be played in October at Trump Doral in Miami. The PGA Tour had refused requests for waivers from its members wanting to play in the new series and had threatened to ban those that rebelled. This decision affects 17 players, including lifetime member Mickelson and his fellow American Dustin Johnson, who announced on Tuesday that he had resigned from the Tour. Mickelson did not deny that he had been given $200m to play in the series, while Johnson is reported to be getting $150m. Crucially, the PGA Tour has closed a loophole that would potentially have allowed players who have resigned from the tour to play events via sponsors exemptions. Sergio Garcia, Martin Kaymer, Graeme McDowell and Lee Westwood, have, like Johnson, already resigned and will all be affected by that ruling. PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said, in the statement that was issued to all members of the tour: ""In accordance with the PGA Tour's tournament regulations, the players competing this week without releases are suspended or otherwise no longer eligible to participate in PGA Tour tournament play, including the Presidents Cup.

"US House passes gun bill doomed to fail in senateThe measures include banning sales of semi-automatic weapons to under-21s, but they look set to be rejected.","This video can not be played 'I don't want it to happen again' - Uvalde survivor The US House of Representatives has voted through a series of measures regulating the sale of guns, but which are destined to fail in the Senate. The new measures would bar sales of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 and ban large-capacity magazines. But Republican opposition in the Senate means the bill has little chance of entering law, despite a renewed focus on gun control in the wake of a series of mass shootings in the US. Hours before the vote, survivors of the Uvalde school shooting gave emotional testimony to lawmakers which reduced some to tears. The primary school shooting in the Texan city claimed the lives of 21 people, including 19 young children. One 11-year-old girl told the hearing - in pre-recorded testimony - that she had smeared her classmate's blood on herself to play dead, and graphically described the moment the gunman shot her teacher in the head. Uvalde survivor covered herself in friend's blood The teachers who died trying to save their pupils The Uvalde attack and other recent mass killings have sparked a new round of bipartisan talks on gun control in the US Senate, but Democrats need at least 10 Republicans on board to pass any new laws. Conservatives want to protect the constitutional right to bear arms and object to limiting sales of the assault-style rifles used in the Uvalde shooting. And while a group of Republican and Democratic senators are trying to find common ground, correspondents say that whatever they come up with is very unlikely to involve any sweeping reforms. On Thursday, more than 220 CEOs of major companies - including Levi Strauss & Co, Lululemon and Lyft - called on the Senate ""take immediate action"" to reduce gun violence following the recent spate of shooting deaths. ""Taken together, the gun violence epidemic represents a public health crisis that continues to devastate communities - especially Black and Brown communities - and harm our national economy,"" the business leaders wrote. Adding further pressure to lawmakers, major Republican donors joined other conservative Texans in signing an open letter pushing for gun control. The letter is expected to run as a full-page ad in the Dallas Morning News on Sunday and will support expanding background checks and raising the age to purchase a gun to 21. In the House of Representatives, Wednesday's wide-ranging package of legislation, called the ""Protecting Our Kids Act"" by lawmakers, passed by 223-204 votes with just five Republicans joining Democrats in supporting the bill. In addition to tighter controls around the sale of guns, it would also introduce a scheme allowing local government to compensate individuals who surrender high capacity magazine and strengthen existing regulations on bump stocks and untraceable ghost guns. However the measures cannot pass into law without approval in the Senate. ""America has lost more children from gun violence than any other cause. Does that embarrass you?"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during a debate on the bill. ""To think that in our country, more children have died from gun violence than any other cause? These stories are tragically all too common in America today."" But House Republicans claimed the bill was an attack on citizens' constitutional rights to own a firearm. ""The speaker started by saying this bill is about protecting our kids,"" Ohio Republican Jim Jordan said. ""But this bill doesn't do it. What this bill does is take away second amendment rights, God-given rights, protected by our Constitution from law-abiding American citizens."" Bipartisan negotiations are ongoing in the Senate on more moderate measures that could gain the support of enough Republicans to pass the 60-vote threshold required in the chamber. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Thursday that the talks were making progress. But one senior Republican, Texas Senator John Cornyn, warned on Wednesday that there are ""sticking points everywhere"". Only a handful of the 50 Republican senators appear open to new gun legislation, with Democrats seeking narrower measures as a compromise. Senators are expected to reach a final agreement by the end of the week. Proposals with the greatest public support include a ""red flag"" law that would prevent individuals with mental illness or a criminal history from purchasing firearms, and expanded background checks on gun purchasers that would include private gun sales.

PM tries to reset leadership with housing pledges,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on housing benefit changes: ""It's time to turn benefits to bricks."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has unveiled plans to allow benefits to be put towards mortgages in England, as he sought to relaunch his premiership. He made the ""benefits-to-bricks"" pledge in his first big speech since surviving a bid to oust him by Tory MPs. Speaking in Blackpool, he also vowed to extend a scheme to allow social tenants to buy their homes. But critics say the proposals are unworkable and would make the housing crisis worse. In Monday's confidence vote on Mr Johnson's leadership, four in 10 Tory MPs backed getting rid of him, amid anger over widespread Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street during lockdown. Under-fire Johnson vows to get on with the job Is the government meeting its new-homes target? Chris Mason: Boris Johnson faces political and economic gales There is also disquiet among Conservatives over the government's decision to raise National Insurance, while the cost of living is soaring and the public finances have been battered by the expense of dealing with Covid. In a wide-ranging speech aimed at demonstrating he has not run out of ideas and is focused on issues that most matter to voters, Mr Johnson promised more help ""over the next few weeks"" to deal with 40-year-high inflation driven by energy price rises. ""Global headwinds are strong... but our engines are stronger,"" said Mr Johnson, adding that ""we are on your side"" in cutting the cost of fuel, childcare, transport and other living expenses. ""And, while it's not going to be quick or easy, you can be confident that things will get better, that we will emerge from this a strong country with a healthy economy,"" the prime minister told the audience at Blackpool and The Fylde College. He said ""economic growth"" was the answer and he hoped tax cuts - which have been demanded by some Tory MPs - would come ""sooner rather than later"". Mr Johnson restated the government's commitment to extending a home-buying scheme, known as right to buy, to housing association tenants. He said he wanted to extend it ""within existing spending plans"" and ensure a ""one-for-one replacement"" of each home sold. This video can not be played Watch: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says PM's new housing policy is the ""wrong approach"" The prime minister also said universal credit recipients would get to choose whether to spend their benefits on rent or put them towards a mortgage. The government will explore discounting Lifetime ISA and Help to Buy ISA savings from Universal Credit eligibility rules, Mr Johnson said. Currently, claimants are only eligible for universal credit if they have savings below Â£16,000, and Lifetime ISAs are included in this limit. Changing these policies would ""help millions realise the dream of home ownership"", Mr Johnson said. Housing benefits, which help low-income or unemployed people pay their rent, cost the government around Â£30bn a year, much of which goes to private landlords. A person is not usually eligible for the payments if they have a mortgage. This speech was in the diary before the confidence vote on Monday but it nevertheless became a chance to try and reset Boris Johnson's premiership. This was a prime minister who wanted to talk political plans - not personal problems. Mr Johnson wants to focus on ways to help households with costs - but there are big questions about how and when the policies announced today will be delivered. This won't be an overnight equivalent of Thatcher's council house scheme. The PM also failed to commit to the pledge to build 300,000 houses a year in England by 2025 - something which was in the 2019 Conservative general election manifesto. It's looked increasingly unlikely since the government dropped plans to reform the planning system in England to make it easier for developers to win approval. A reminder perhaps that housing pledges can often be easier in theory than in practice. About two million council homes in England have been sold under right to buy since 1980 Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy questioned whether people on benefits could afford mortgage deposits, saying: ""This speech was yet more evidence that the prime minister and his tired government are out of ideas. ""You can't solve a housing crisis with back-of-the-envelope policies that have no realistic chance of success."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""Boris Johnson has lost the confidence of his party, Parliament and the country. The desperate attempt to relaunch his leadership today will do nothing to win it back."" It's not entirely clear how the government's right-to-buy policy is going to work: There is already a shortage of social housing without selling properties - 1.1 million people are on waiting lists The government has not revealed who will be able to take advantage of the scheme, how much it will cost and whether it will be capped It's the third such pilot scheme - previous ones found that some housing association properties were not eligible to be sold and there was concern about the financial risks being taken on by participants While the government has said that there will be funding for housing associations to replace each home sold, previous pilots have had problems with replacements coming quickly enough or being like-for-like The policy depends on negotiations with housing associations, which will not necessarily want to take part. Council tenants in England have been able to buy their homes at a discount since 1980, when Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher introduced the policy. But the same is not true for people renting from housing associations, unless their property was once owned by a local authority and they lived in it during this period. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, called Mr Johnson's housing proposals ""baffling, unworkable, and a dangerous gimmick"". Extending the right to buy would ""put our rapidly shrinking supply of social homes at even greater risk,"" she added. Right-to-buy: A tainted gift?

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities. It raises money for Unicef and this year the charity says some of the money raised will go towards helping those impacted by the war. ""This event is going to help a lot of people in Ukraine,"" he says, ""especially kids, we're going to create a lot of great programmes to improve a lot of things for kids.""

Two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun were captured by Russian troops while fighting for Ukraine. All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely."" Chris PartridgeBBC News This video can not be played Low-flying Ukrainian jet skims above trees Ukraine
is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied. Brits Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were all sentenced to death Thanks for joining us this afternoon - here's the latest on what's been happening in Ukraine: Russia defends death sentences for captured Britons  UK's defence secretary visits Ukraine  Cholera in Mariupol  How long will the war last?  Stay with us for the latest developments as they unfold. Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking to students across the UK in a live broadcast to several universities. The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our
history, our state, our identity, and to deny our existence. And as such to
tell the world that we never existed that we are an artificially created people
like a variety of some kind of plants or animals."" State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The
venue where Volodymyr Zelensky will be speaking to students at Coventry
University usually hosts cinema nights - but this evening it will be the
Ukrainian president's face on the big screen. Only 75 tickets were made available
for the event, and they were snapped up within hours. The first few
students have started arriving and there are a few Ukrainian flags draped on
the front row. Pavel Pimkin The president of the universityâs Ukraine Society is Pavel Pimkin, 20, whose male relatives are still in his home country. He says heâs feeling âhonoured and nervousâ about asking his nationâs president a question later. The address will also be shown at other British universities that have Ukrainian societies.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities. It raises money for Unicef and this year the charity says some of the money raised will go towards helping those impacted by the war. ""This event is going to help a lot of people in Ukraine,"" he says, ""especially kids, we're going to create a lot of great programmes to improve a lot of things for kids.""

Two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun were captured by Russian troops while fighting for Ukraine. All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely."" Chris PartridgeBBC News This video can not be played Low-flying Ukrainian jet skims above trees Ukraine
is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied. Brits Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were all sentenced to death Thanks for joining us this afternoon - here's the latest on what's been happening in Ukraine: Russia defends death sentences for captured Britons  UK's defence secretary visits Ukraine  Cholera in Mariupol  How long will the war last?  Stay with us for the latest developments as they unfold. Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking to students across the UK in a live broadcast to several universities. The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our
history, our state, our identity, and to deny our existence. And as such to
tell the world that we never existed that we are an artificially created people
like a variety of some kind of plants or animals."" State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The
venue where Volodymyr Zelensky will be speaking to students at Coventry
University usually hosts cinema nights - but this evening it will be the
Ukrainian president's face on the big screen. Only 75 tickets were made available
for the event, and they were snapped up within hours. The first few
students have started arriving and there are a few Ukrainian flags draped on
the front row. Pavel Pimkin The president of the universityâs Ukraine Society is Pavel Pimkin, 20, whose male relatives are still in his home country. He says heâs feeling âhonoured and nervousâ about asking his nationâs president a question later. The address will also be shown at other British universities that have Ukrainian societies.

Prince William spotted selling Big Issue in LondonThe Duke of Cambridge was seen wearing the Big Issue uniform and selling copies of the magazine.London,"This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge posed for photos with tourists, members of the public and a taxi driver The Duke of Cambridge has been spotted in central London quietly helping to sell Big Issue magazines. Retired Met Police Ch Supt Matthew Gardner shared photos of Prince William on Rochester Row, in Westminster, on his social media account. He said his brother-in-law, Richard Hannant, had seen what he thought was a celebrity and took a distanced photo. Prince William then crossed the road and spoke to Mr Hannant while wearing the iconic Big Issue uniform. The magazine is sold by homeless people, long-term unemployed people, and those who need money to avoid getting into debt, the Big Issue says. Vendors are given five free magazines, which are then sold to the public for Â£3, with additional copies bought for Â£1.50. Richard Hannant was surprised Prince William was spotted just days after celebrating the Queen's Platinum Jubilee Mr Hannant, a property manager, has since said he was on his way back to the office when he spotted the royal among a small group of people in the street. The 47-year-old, who lives in Bath but works in London, said: ""He was amazing, he was so friendly."" He added: ""I think what struck me is we've just got past a massive Jubilee event and days later he's out there supporting a charity like Big Issue. ""I think it's that that I thought was most amazing because one is a worldwide event, this is just a low-key [event], literally standing on the side of the road with a homeless person. ""I was quite amazed that he could go from one massive event to such a low-key thing."" Laura Zuikauskas had spent the weekend in London for the Jubilee In his social media post, Mr Gardner wrote alongside the photo of his brother-in-law and the prince: ""What an honour to have a private moment with our future king who was humble and working quietly in the background, helping the most needy. ""These 'silent gestures' often go unrecognised. ""The finale to this unique occasion was when Prince William asked my brother-in-law If he wanted to buy the Big Issue, to which he replied 'I have no change'. ""At this point William produced a mobile card machineâ¦ you cannot teach that! ""Priceless, or should I say, 'princely'."" Lithuanian tourists Vitalijus and Laura Zuikauskas also met the prince on their visit to London to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. ""We bought the magazine and had a warm chat,"" said Mr Zuikauskas. ""We wished him good luck and shook hands, and were excited that the Royal Family take big care of ordinary people."" He added the future king had a ""warm personality"" and they were ""excited and really happy"" to meet him. Another social media post by black cab driver Neil Kramer also showed Prince William in the uniform posing for a photo with another Big Issue vendor. Allow Instagram content?

""When I realised who it was, I was a bit shocked but of course said yes. ""He then introduced the other gentlemen with him and we had a lovely chat for 15 minutes about the charity and its work."" Mr Kramer said the prince asked him if he was a regular reader, to which he replied there was always an opportunity to buy the magazine when on a rank or charging up. Richard Hannant told Prince William they shared the same birthday, 21 June, to which the prince replied ""happy birthday"" He added Prince William was engaging and polite, and that he never forgot his name.

"Get ready for more storm power cuts, energy firms told","Storm Arwen left millions of people without power last November Power firms must improve their storm response after Storm Arwen left more than one million UK homes without power last year, a report by the energy regulator says. The storm brought severe wind, rain and snow across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on 26 November. Three people diedas gusts of up to 100mph lashed the UK. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley told power firms to ""up your game"" and ""get ready for winter"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said companies were ""not well prepared"" for the storm. In future, they should maintain and invest more in the network, provide clearer communication to customers about when they will be reconnected, and be more imaginative about how they get people back on supply, he said. ""This is a really tough time for customers right now, this is a market where everyone is having a difficult time. ""Every energy company that is working in this country needs to be working on behalf of their customers and that means big changes for the networks."" Storm Arwen response report misses maintenance Thousands of homes without power after Storm Arwen Power firms' response to Storm Arwen 'unacceptable' Third person dies as storm brings 98mph gusts The storm - which saw nearly 4,000 people in north-east England and Scotland cut off from their energy supply for more than a week - caused widespread damage, with high winds snapping or uprooting trees that fell onto overhead lines. The north east of Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders were among the worst-hit areas. Ofgem said three network companies - Northern Powergrid, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks and Electricity North West - have agreed to pay Â£10.3m in ""redress payments"" to support communities affected by Storm Arwen and for upgrading networks to minimise the impact of severe weather events. This is in addition to almost Â£30m in compensation that has been paid by the firms. A lot of damage was caused by the wind, including part of a wall collapsing on a car in Sunderland Mr Brearley said the frequency of extreme weather events was only set to increase, so it was really important that industry, and those involved more widely, learned from Storm Arwen to better respond in future. Ofgem'sreport,externalfound: Emergency plans initiated before the storm hit were not adequate to deal with the significant damage that followed Some people were cut off for an ""unacceptable"" length of time, had poor and sometimes inaccurate communications from network firms, and it took too long for them to receive compensation payments Around 28% of customers were told they would be back on supply within 24 hours, but that did not happen, and some customers did not think that the support available was made clear to them One firm, Northern Powergrid, did not directly contact vulnerable customers enrolled on its Priority Services Register before Storm Arwen, which should have happened under its winter preparedness campaign Northern Powergrid also accepted the performance of its call centre ""fell below"" the expected standards during a severe storm, potentially breaching its licence Most power disruption was caused by severe winds and trees toppling onto power lines, with a link found between damaged network poles and their age, although this need further examination Its key recommendations included: Network companies should submit their winter preparedness plans to Ofgem so it can check customers will be supported during power disruptions Firms should ""stress test"" their websites and call centres to ensure they have sufficient capacity for severe weather events They should develop ""more robust mechanisms"" to ensure compensation payments are delivered swiftly and accurately to customers Energy firms should voluntarily lift the Â£700 cap on compensation for future storms as they did for Storm Arwen Overhead lines and the management of vegetation should be reviewed to boost network resilience for future storms Storm Arwen felled trees such as this one in the Lake District, in Cumbria Jamie Sunderland, who lives in Brigsteer, a village in South Cumbria, had no power for a week after Storm Arwen. With a toddler who could not be at home with no heating or lighting, he was forced to camp out with family and friends. They were initially told they would be reconnected in about 12 to 24 hours, but after three days, they took such assurances ""with a pinch of salt"". Reacting to Ofgem's report, he said its finding that customers received ""unacceptable"" service was correct. ""The problem was lack of information. If we'd been told more accurately that the power was going to be off for three or four days then we'd have been able to plan more accurately. ""For instance, we didn't think to empty the fridge or the freezer, thinking it was only for a short time. ""And all that food went to waste. If we'd realised it would have been longer we'd have taken more frozen stuff with us."" Simon Bainbridge, a farmer in Northumberland, was left without power for eight days and says having to use seven generators to keep the farm running left him out of pocket, even with the compensation he received. He argues there needs to be more investment and active checks of the network to protect power supplies for future events. This video can not be played Watch: Dr Lily Fulton-Humble on living without power with a seven-week-old baby and a sick toddler The Energy Networks Association, which represents the UK and Ireland's power firms, said six electricity firms planned to boost investment in network resilience measures from about Â£12bn to Â£14.5bn over the next five years. The extra cash would fund tree cutting, flood prevention and other measures to protect the UK's power network against future severe weather events, it added. The firms have submitted these details in their business plans for the next five years, subject to Ofgem's approval. Phil Jones, chief executive of Northern Powergrid,said,externalit had improved its handling of customer communications and estimated power restoration times, and had invested further in its website, telephone systems and power cut maps to cope with periods of high demand. Mr Jones said that by the end of the 2015- 2023 period, Northern Powergrid would have invested almost Â£1bn in maintaining its network. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said it was clear thousands of customers had been badly let down by electricity network companies and that a new action plan would improve preparedness for future storms. Power lines - including in Ballater, Aberdeenshire - were brought down by trees during Storm Arwen Additional reporting by Catherine Lee.

Berlin car attack was âcruel rampageâ â Scholz,"The car crashed into a store German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has condemned Wednesday's attack on a busy Berlin street that left one person dead and 31 injured as a ""cruel rampage"". Mr Scholz added that the attack, which was carried out by a 29-year-old man, had left him ""deeply saddened"". Berlin's Mayor Franziska Giffey told local media the attack was ""a dark day in the history of Berlin"". She added that the man, who remains in police custody, is ""severely mentally impaired"". In a short statement issued on Thursday, police said they believe the attack was ""an intentional act"" by the ""allegedly mentally ill 29-year-old"".  It added that he had been travelling in his sister's car. Local media has reported that the suspect, who has been identified as a German-Armenian man who lives in the city, is co-operating with investigators. However, Ms Giffey cautioned that he has made a series of ""confused statements"". The Berlin state prosecutor said on Thursday that there does not seem to be a terrorism link, and that the man appeared to displaying signs of paranoid schizophrenia. The man's sister told the German tabloid Bild that he suffers from ""serious problems"" and Berlin's top security official, Interior Minister Iris Spranger, said the ""evidence suggests this is a case of a mentally ill person running amok"". The prosecutor has recommended the man be held in a psychiatric institution until his trial. Ms Spranger said posters were found in the car used during the attack ""in which he expressed views about Turkey"", but she refuted an earlier report from Bild that a letter of confession had been found in the car. She said the reasons behind the crash will be investigated in detail by officials. Almost all those injured were students who were on a school trip to celebrate finishing their exams. They had travelled from the small town of Bad Arolsen, in the central Hesse region of Germany. Seven of them were severely injured, but are not out of danger, the state prosecutor said. The woman who died has been identified as their schoolteacher. Another teacher remains in a critical condition and is said to be fighting for his life. A district administrator in Hesse, Jurgen van der Horst, told Bild that ""everyone in Bad Arolsen is affected"" by the tragedy. ""It's a big school in a small town,"" Mr van der Horst said. ""Everyone knows everyone here and has contact with the families impacted."" Witnesses described seeing a silver Renault Clio veering into a crowd of people on the pavement near Berlin's busy KurfÃ¼rstendamm shopping avenue, before driving back on to the road and smashing through a shop window at around 10:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Wednesday. A witness who would only be named as F Kacan said the driver had abandoned the car and started to run away but ""we were able to stop him"", AFP news agency reports. The man was not known to the security services but had been stopped by police for property offences, Bild reported. The incident happened opposite Breitscheidplatz, where 12 people were killed in a terrorist attack in 2016 when a truck was deliberately driven into a crowd of people at a Christmas market. On Wednesday the mayor said it was too early to know if the area had been chosen deliberately, but she said: ""It's a situation where you think, for God's sake, not again!"" After the Christmas market attack in 2016, concrete barriers were erected near the site to prevent future attacks, but Ms Giffey admitted that it is impossible to provide such protections for ""all of the city"".

Police chief sorry for tear gassing Liverpool fansThe head of security at the Champions League final admits failings but says his aim was to save lives.,"Steve Rotheram said the day had quickly turned from a dream into a nightmare Liverpool's mayor has said some French police officers were seeking confrontation at last month's Champions League final in Paris. Steve Rotheram said police were quick to threaten fans with their batons. The head of policing at the final earlier apologised for using tear gas on Liverpool fans travelling to the Stade de France but said he had no alternative. The fiasco has prompted uproar in France as well as the UK and Spain. Liverpool fans, including families with children, were tear-gassed and pepper-sprayed outside the stadium by police ahead of the final between Liverpool and Real Madrid on 28 May. Then as they left the area, some fans were attacked by 300 to 400 local youths. The French Senate is now investigating the incident. Speaking to the Senate on Thursday, Mr Rotheram - who was at the final - said ""the day gradually transformed from a dream into a nightmare"". ""I saw police who were, in a way, looking to find a problem,"" he said. He added that he had been robbed of his possessions at the event. French authorities blamed late arrivals and fake tickets for overcrowding and chaotic scenes before the match. Liverpool fans react as they queue to access Stade de France before Champions League Final on 28 May Speaking earlier at the Senate, head of policing at the final Didier Lallement defended the tactics he used, insisting his ""red line"" was to save lives. Using tear gas outside the stadium was the only means they had to get the crowd to move back without charging at them, which would have been ""devastating"", he explained. However, if his force had not dispersed the crowd, people could have died in a crush. ""I am fully aware that people acting in good faith, even families, were tear-gassed,"" he added. ""For this I am very sorry. But there was no other way."" He did however admit that the security operation was ""obviously a failure,"" saying ""people were pushed around or attacked even though we owed them security."" He said his force was not prepared for the scale of the problem that thousands of fake tickets caused. In another development during the Senate's investigation, it emerged that all the CCTV from outside the stadium on the day of the final has been deleted. Erwan Le PrÃ©vost, director of international relations at the French Football Federation (FFF) told the Senate that CCTV footage of the stadium is automatically deleted after seven days. As the footage had not been requested before the seven days were up, it was deleted. He added that the images were ""extremely violent"". The Senate commission's co-president Laurent Lafon told AFP that as an investigation was opened a day after the game, there would have been ""plenty of time"" to request the footage. ""We need to understand what happened,"" he said.

Brazil steps up search for missing UK journalistJournalist Dom Phillips and indigenous expert Bruno Pereira disappeared on Sunday in the Amazon.,"Veteran journalist Dom Phillips has been living in Brazil for over a decade Brazil says it is stepping up its search for British journalist Dom Phillips, 57, and Brazilian indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, 41, after it was criticised for its slow response to their disappearance. The two men went missing in the rainforest near Brazil's border with Peru on Sunday. No trace has been found of them or the boat they were travelling in. The lead investigator said his team was ""pursuing all lines of inquiry"". There has been huge concern for the welfare of the men after it emerged that Mr Pereira had received death threats in the week before they went missing. Dom Phillips' brother (right), sister (centre) and her partner (left) attended a vigil outside the Brazilian embassy on Thursday Brazilian football legend PelÃ© is among those who have urged the authorities to intensify to scale up their search. He retweeted a video in which Mr Phillip's wife, Alessandra Sampaio, said she hoped that ""the love of my life"" would be found alive. This video can not be played Watch: Missing journalist's wife makes tearful plea to step up Brazilian Amazon search Investigators said there were now 250 members of the security forces taking part in the search, up from just about a dozen in the first days. The search team started off very small They said the team included divers and experts in jungle terrain. Two helicopters, more than a dozen boats and drones are also being used. Six people have been questioned in connection with the men's disappearance, but police said only one had been arrested while the others were questioned as witnesses. They said that the arrested man had been detained during a random stop-and-search operation in the area during which he had been found illegally carrying ammunition. A local security official said that ""we have not established any connection between him and the [disappearance] for now"". Lead investigator Alexandre Fontes described the area as a ""very complicated region"" which he said could only be reached by helicopter, small plane or boat. Indigenous rights groups which Mr Pereira worked with were the first to raise the alarm about the disappearance of the expert on isolated indigenous groups and the journalist. They said that Mr Pereira had received threatening letters over his work fighting against illegal fishing in the area. Both Mr Pereira and Mr Phillips, who has written about threats to the Amazon for publications such as The Guardian and the Washington Post, are hugely experienced and planned their journeys thoroughly. They had a new boat and plenty of fuel, the rights group said. The area where they disappeared is home to around 6,300 indigenous people from more than 20 groups. As well as clashes with fishermen catching protected stock, it has also seen incursions by illegal gold miners, loggers and drug traffickers who smuggle cocaine from neighbouring Peru. Both Mr Pereira, who has worked for the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai, and Mr Phillips, who was carrying out research for a book on the Amazon, documented these threats as part of their work. Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has come under fire for referring to the work of the two men as an ""adventure"" and  appeared to blame them for their disappearance. ""Two people in a boat in a region like that, completely wild - it's an unadvisable adventure. Anything can happen,"" he said on Tuesday.

Police chief sorry for tear gassing Liverpool fansThe head of security at the Champions League final admits failings but says his aim was to save lives.Europe,"Steve Rotheram said the day had quickly turned from a dream into a nightmare Liverpool's mayor has said some French police officers were seeking confrontation at last month's Champions League final in Paris. Steve Rotheram said police were quick to threaten fans with their batons. The head of policing at the final earlier apologised for using tear gas on Liverpool fans travelling to the Stade de France but said he had no alternative. The fiasco has prompted uproar in France as well as the UK and Spain. Liverpool fans, including families with children, were tear-gassed and pepper-sprayed outside the stadium by police ahead of the final between Liverpool and Real Madrid on 28 May. Then as they left the area, some fans were attacked by 300 to 400 local youths. The French Senate is now investigating the incident. Speaking to the Senate on Thursday, Mr Rotheram - who was at the final - said ""the day gradually transformed from a dream into a nightmare"". ""I saw police who were, in a way, looking to find a problem,"" he said. He added that he had been robbed of his possessions at the event. French authorities blamed late arrivals and fake tickets for overcrowding and chaotic scenes before the match. Liverpool fans react as they queue to access Stade de France before Champions League Final on 28 May Speaking earlier at the Senate, head of policing at the final Didier Lallement defended the tactics he used, insisting his ""red line"" was to save lives. Using tear gas outside the stadium was the only means they had to get the crowd to move back without charging at them, which would have been ""devastating"", he explained. However, if his force had not dispersed the crowd, people could have died in a crush. ""I am fully aware that people acting in good faith, even families, were tear-gassed,"" he added. ""For this I am very sorry. But there was no other way."" He did however admit that the security operation was ""obviously a failure,"" saying ""people were pushed around or attacked even though we owed them security."" He said his force was not prepared for the scale of the problem that thousands of fake tickets caused.

"Get ready for more storm power cuts, energy firms toldFirms were unprepared for last year's Storm Arwen which left over one million without power, says Ofgem.UKComments","Storm Arwen left millions of people without power last November Power firms must improve their storm response after Storm Arwen left more than one million UK homes without power last year, a report by the energy regulator says. The storm brought severe wind, rain and snow across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on 26 November. Three people diedas gusts of up to 100mph lashed the UK. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley told power firms to ""up your game"" and ""get ready for winter"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said companies were ""not well prepared"" for the storm. In future, they should maintain and invest more in the network, provide clearer communication to customers about when they will be reconnected, and be more imaginative about how they get people back on supply, he said. ""This is a really tough time for customers right now, this is a market where everyone is having a difficult time. ""Every energy company that is working in this country needs to be working on behalf of their customers and that means big changes for the networks."" Storm Arwen response report misses maintenance Thousands of homes without power after Storm Arwen Power firms' response to Storm Arwen 'unacceptable' Third person dies as storm brings 98mph gusts The storm - which saw nearly 4,000 people in north-east England and Scotland cut off from their energy supply for more than a week - caused widespread damage, with high winds snapping or uprooting trees that fell onto overhead lines. The north east of Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders were among the worst-hit areas. Ofgem said three network companies - Northern Powergrid, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks and Electricity North West - have agreed to pay Â£10.3m in ""redress payments"" to support communities affected by Storm Arwen and for upgrading networks to minimise the impact of severe weather events. This is in addition to almost Â£30m in compensation that has been paid by the firms. A lot of damage was caused by the wind, including part of a wall collapsing on a car in Sunderland Mr Brearley said the frequency of extreme weather events was only set to increase, so it was really important that industry, and those involved more widely, learned from Storm Arwen to better respond in future. Ofgem'sreport,externalfound: Emergency plans initiated before the storm hit were not adequate to deal with the significant damage that followed Some people were cut off for an ""unacceptable"" length of time, had poor and sometimes inaccurate communications from network firms, and it took too long for them to receive compensation payments Around 28% of customers were told they would be back on supply within 24 hours, but that did not happen, and some customers did not think that the support available was made clear to them One firm, Northern Powergrid, did not directly contact vulnerable customers enrolled on its Priority Services Register before Storm Arwen, which should have happened under its winter preparedness campaign Northern Powergrid also accepted the performance of its call centre ""fell below"" the expected standards during a severe storm, potentially breaching its licence Most power disruption was caused by severe winds and trees toppling onto power lines, with a link found between damaged network poles and their age, although this need further examination Its key recommendations included: Network companies should submit their winter preparedness plans to Ofgem so it can check customers will be supported during power disruptions Firms should ""stress test"" their websites and call centres to ensure they have sufficient capacity for severe weather events They should develop ""more robust mechanisms"" to ensure compensation payments are delivered swiftly and accurately to customers Energy firms should voluntarily lift the Â£700 cap on compensation for future storms as they did for Storm Arwen Overhead lines and the management of vegetation should be reviewed to boost network resilience for future storms Storm Arwen felled trees such as this one in the Lake District, in Cumbria Jamie Sunderland, who lives in Brigsteer, a village in South Cumbria, had no power for a week after Storm Arwen. With a toddler who could not be at home with no heating or lighting, he was forced to camp out with family and friends. They were initially told they would be reconnected in about 12 to 24 hours, but after three days, they took such assurances ""with a pinch of salt"". Reacting to Ofgem's report, he said its finding that customers received ""unacceptable"" service was correct. ""The problem was lack of information. If we'd been told more accurately that the power was going to be off for three or four days then we'd have been able to plan more accurately. ""For instance, we didn't think to empty the fridge or the freezer, thinking it was only for a short time. ""And all that food went to waste. If we'd realised it would have been longer we'd have taken more frozen stuff with us."" Simon Bainbridge, a farmer in Northumberland, was left without power for eight days and says having to use seven generators to keep the farm running left him out of pocket, even with the compensation he received. He argues there needs to be more investment and active checks of the network to protect power supplies for future events. This video can not be played Watch: Dr Lily Fulton-Humble on living without power with a seven-week-old baby and a sick toddler The Energy Networks Association, which represents the UK and Ireland's power firms, said six electricity firms planned to boost investment in network resilience measures from about Â£12bn to Â£14.5bn over the next five years. The extra cash would fund tree cutting, flood prevention and other measures to protect the UK's power network against future severe weather events, it added. The firms have submitted these details in their business plans for the next five years, subject to Ofgem's approval. Phil Jones, chief executive of Northern Powergrid,said,externalit had improved its handling of customer communications and estimated power restoration times, and had invested further in its website, telephone systems and power cut maps to cope with periods of high demand. Mr Jones said that by the end of the 2015- 2023 period, Northern Powergrid would have invested almost Â£1bn in maintaining its network. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said it was clear thousands of customers had been badly let down by electricity network companies and that a new action plan would improve preparedness for future storms. Power lines - including in Ballater, Aberdeenshire - were brought down by trees during Storm Arwen Additional reporting by Catherine Lee.

LiveLiveNo let up in battle for key eastern Ukraine cityStreet fighting rages in Severodonetsk as Russians use heavy artillery to try to break through.Europe,"Russia's foreign minister says three men sentenced to death - two Britons and one Moroccan - committed crimes in a breakaway Ukrainian region All three were convicted by a Russian proxy court in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic UK PM Boris Johnson urges ministers to do ""everything in their power"" to secure the release of the two Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner were fighting with the Ukrainian army and their sentencing is an ""egregious breach"" of the Geneva Conventions, the UK says Meanwhile, there's a risk of a major cholera outbreak in the occupied port city of Mariupol, the UK's Ministry of Defence says The exiled deputy mayor says the 100,000 people still in the city are at growing risk of disease Edited by Rob Corp We're pausing our live coverage now. Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities.

is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied.

State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The

Children of today should never be able to smoke,"The age at which people can buy tobacco and cigarettes in England should be raised year by year so that eventually no-one can buy them, a review says. The call has been made in an independent report by ex-charity boss Javed Khan asked for by ministers. Under the plan the age of sale would rise from 18 by one year every year so the children of today will never be allowed to buy tobacco. The government has not agreed to the plan, but said it would consider it. However, sources said it was unlikely at this stage that ministers would agree to the move. Smoking rates have been falling since the 1970s. But there are still six million smokers in England - seven million across the UK. The government has said new ideas are needed to convince the final remaining groups to quit. It has set an ambition for England to be smoke free  - defined as less than 5% of the population smoking - by 2030. Achieving that will be a huge challenge, which is why Health Secretary Sajid Javid asked former Barnardo's chief executive Mr Khan to review the current rules and approaches. The proposal on raising the age of sale is similar to what is being introduced in New Zealand, where buying tobacco products will remain banned for anyone born after 2008. In England, the age limit was raised from 16 to 18 in 2007. Currently, one in nine 18 to 24-year-olds smokes, according to the Office for National Statistics. Mr Khan has also recommended: Setting aside an extra Â£125m for smoke free policies, with an extra Â£70 million per year ring-fenced for stop smoking services Promotion of vapes as an effective ""swap to stop"" tool to help people quit smoking Introducing a licensing system for shops to sell tobacco and banning supermarkets altogether Increasing duties on products and banning duty-free tobacco Ministers said they would consider the proposals as part of a wider package of measures they are looking to introduce this year to improve the health of the nation and tackle inequalities. The report has been produced for ministers in England. But Wales and Northern Ireland have already promised to work closely with counterparts in England over raising the legal age for smoking. The number of deaths caused by smoking is falling - but it remains the leading cause of preventable illness and premature death and is estimated to cause a quarter of all cancer deaths. In 2019, it accounted for 75,000 deaths in England - 15% of the total. Prof Jim McManus, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said if the government was to implement the recommendations they would ""make a huge difference to the nation's health"". And Deborah Arnott, of the charity Action on Smoking and Health, said given the higher rates of smoking and ill-health in more deprived areas only by making ""smoking obsolete"" could the government deliver on its levelling up mission. But Simon Clark, of smokers' lobby group Forest, criticised the recommendations. He said: ""Creeping prohibition won't stop young adults smoking. ""It will simply drive the sale of tobacco underground and consumers will buy cigarettes on the black market where no-one pays tax and products are completely unregulated.""

"Up your game on storms, energy firms told","Storm Arwen left millions of people without power last November Power firms must improve their storm response after Storm Arwen left more than one million UK homes without power last year, a report by the energy regulator says. The storm brought severe wind, rain and snow across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on 26 November. Three people diedas gusts of up to 100mph lashed the UK. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley told power firms to ""up your game"" and ""get ready for winter"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said companies were ""not well prepared"" for the storm. In future, they should maintain and invest more in the network, provide clearer communication to customers about when they will be reconnected, and be more imaginative about how they get people back on supply, he said. ""This is a really tough time for customers right now, this is a market where everyone is having a difficult time. ""Every energy company that is working in this country needs to be working on behalf of their customers and that means big changes for the networks."" Storm Arwen response report misses maintenance Thousands of homes without power after Storm Arwen Power firms' response to Storm Arwen 'unacceptable' Third person dies as storm brings 98mph gusts The storm - which saw nearly 4,000 people in north-east England and Scotland cut off from their energy supply for more than a week - caused widespread damage, with high winds snapping or uprooting trees that fell onto overhead lines. The north east of Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders were among the worst-hit areas. Ofgem said three network companies - Northern Powergrid, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks and Electricity North West - have agreed to pay Â£10.3m in ""redress payments"" to support communities affected by Storm Arwen and for upgrading networks to minimise the impact of severe weather events. This is in addition to almost Â£30m in compensation that has been paid by the firms. A lot of damage was caused by the wind, including part of a wall collapsing on a car in Sunderland Mr Brearley said the frequency of extreme weather events was only set to increase, so it was really important that industry, and those involved more widely, learned from Storm Arwen to better respond in future. Ofgem'sreport,externalfound: Emergency plans initiated before the storm hit were not adequate to deal with the significant damage that followed Some people were cut off for an ""unacceptable"" length of time, had poor and sometimes inaccurate communications from network firms, and it took too long for them to receive compensation payments Around 28% of customers were told they would be back on supply within 24 hours, but that did not happen, and some customers did not think that the support available was made clear to them One firm, Northern Powergrid, did not directly contact vulnerable customers enrolled on its Priority Services Register before Storm Arwen, which should have happened under its winter preparedness campaign Northern Powergrid also accepted the performance of its call centre ""fell below"" the expected standards during a severe storm, potentially breaching its licence Most power disruption was caused by severe winds and trees toppling onto power lines, with a link found between damaged network poles and their age, although this need further examination Its key recommendations included: Network companies should submit their winter preparedness plans to Ofgem so it can check customers will be supported during power disruptions Firms should ""stress test"" their websites and call centres to ensure they have sufficient capacity for severe weather events They should develop ""more robust mechanisms"" to ensure compensation payments are delivered swiftly and accurately to customers Energy firms should voluntarily lift the Â£700 cap on compensation for future storms as they did for Storm Arwen Overhead lines and the management of vegetation should be reviewed to boost network resilience for future storms Storm Arwen felled trees such as this one in the Lake District, in Cumbria Jamie Sunderland, who lives in Brigsteer, a village in South Cumbria, had no power for a week after Storm Arwen. With a toddler who could not be at home with no heating or lighting, he was forced to camp out with family and friends. They were initially told they would be reconnected in about 12 to 24 hours, but after three days, they took such assurances ""with a pinch of salt"". Reacting to Ofgem's report, he said its finding that customers received ""unacceptable"" service was correct. ""The problem was lack of information. If we'd been told more accurately that the power was going to be off for three or four days then we'd have been able to plan more accurately. ""For instance, we didn't think to empty the fridge or the freezer, thinking it was only for a short time. ""And all that food went to waste. If we'd realised it would have been longer we'd have taken more frozen stuff with us."" Simon Bainbridge, a farmer in Northumberland, was left without power for eight days and says having to use seven generators to keep the farm running left him out of pocket, even with the compensation he received. He argues there needs to be more investment and active checks of the network to protect power supplies for future events. This video can not be played Watch: Dr Lily Fulton-Humble on living without power with a seven-week-old baby and a sick toddler The Energy Networks Association, which represents the UK and Ireland's power firms, said six electricity firms planned to boost investment in network resilience measures from about Â£12bn to Â£14.5bn over the next five years. The extra cash would fund tree cutting, flood prevention and other measures to protect the UK's power network against future severe weather events, it added. The firms have submitted these details in their business plans for the next five years, subject to Ofgem's approval. Phil Jones, chief executive of Northern Powergrid,said,externalit had improved its handling of customer communications and estimated power restoration times, and had invested further in its website, telephone systems and power cut maps to cope with periods of high demand. Mr Jones said that by the end of the 2015- 2023 period, Northern Powergrid would have invested almost Â£1bn in maintaining its network. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said it was clear thousands of customers had been badly let down by electricity network companies and that a new action plan would improve preparedness for future storms.

"US House passes gun bill doomed to fail in senateThe measures include banning sales of semi-automatic weapons to under-21s, but they look set to be rejected.US & Canada","This video can not be played 'I don't want it to happen again' - Uvalde survivor The US House of Representatives has voted through a series of measures regulating the sale of guns, but which are destined to fail in the Senate. The new measures would bar sales of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 and ban large-capacity magazines. But Republican opposition in the Senate means the bill has little chance of entering law, despite a renewed focus on gun control in the wake of a series of mass shootings in the US. Hours before the vote, survivors of the Uvalde school shooting gave emotional testimony to lawmakers which reduced some to tears. The primary school shooting in the Texan city claimed the lives of 21 people, including 19 young children. One 11-year-old girl told the hearing - in pre-recorded testimony - that she had smeared her classmate's blood on herself to play dead, and graphically described the moment the gunman shot her teacher in the head. Uvalde survivor covered herself in friend's blood The teachers who died trying to save their pupils The Uvalde attack and other recent mass killings have sparked a new round of bipartisan talks on gun control in the US Senate, but Democrats need at least 10 Republicans on board to pass any new laws. Conservatives want to protect the constitutional right to bear arms and object to limiting sales of the assault-style rifles used in the Uvalde shooting. And while a group of Republican and Democratic senators are trying to find common ground, correspondents say that whatever they come up with is very unlikely to involve any sweeping reforms. On Thursday, more than 220 CEOs of major companies - including Levi Strauss & Co, Lululemon and Lyft - called on the Senate ""take immediate action"" to reduce gun violence following the recent spate of shooting deaths. ""Taken together, the gun violence epidemic represents a public health crisis that continues to devastate communities - especially Black and Brown communities - and harm our national economy,"" the business leaders wrote. Adding further pressure to lawmakers, major Republican donors joined other conservative Texans in signing an open letter pushing for gun control. The letter is expected to run as a full-page ad in the Dallas Morning News on Sunday and will support expanding background checks and raising the age to purchase a gun to 21. In the House of Representatives, Wednesday's wide-ranging package of legislation, called the ""Protecting Our Kids Act"" by lawmakers, passed by 223-204 votes with just five Republicans joining Democrats in supporting the bill. In addition to tighter controls around the sale of guns, it would also introduce a scheme allowing local government to compensate individuals who surrender high capacity magazine and strengthen existing regulations on bump stocks and untraceable ghost guns. However the measures cannot pass into law without approval in the Senate. ""America has lost more children from gun violence than any other cause. Does that embarrass you?"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during a debate on the bill. ""To think that in our country, more children have died from gun violence than any other cause? These stories are tragically all too common in America today."" But House Republicans claimed the bill was an attack on citizens' constitutional rights to own a firearm. ""The speaker started by saying this bill is about protecting our kids,"" Ohio Republican Jim Jordan said. ""But this bill doesn't do it. What this bill does is take away second amendment rights, God-given rights, protected by our Constitution from law-abiding American citizens."" Bipartisan negotiations are ongoing in the Senate on more moderate measures that could gain the support of enough Republicans to pass the 60-vote threshold required in the chamber. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Thursday that the talks were making progress. But one senior Republican, Texas Senator John Cornyn, warned on Wednesday that there are ""sticking points everywhere"". Only a handful of the 50 Republican senators appear open to new gun legislation, with Democrats seeking narrower measures as a compromise. Senators are expected to reach a final agreement by the end of the week. Proposals with the greatest public support include a ""red flag"" law that would prevent individuals with mental illness or a criminal history from purchasing firearms, and expanded background checks on gun purchasers that would include private gun sales.

Cost of filling average car with petrol hits Â£100,"Driving groups have called for more support to help drivers after the cost of filling an average family car with petrol hit Â£100 for the first time. The RAC motoring group called it ""a truly dark day"" as the cost of filling a 55-litre tank reached Â£100.27 for petrol and Â£103.43 for diesel. The RAC and its rival the AA urged the chancellor to cut VAT on fuel or to reduce fuel duty further. The Treasury said it had provided Â£37bn to ease the cost of living already. Rising petrol prices are putting pressure on household budgets, with energy bills and food prices also now at multi-year highs. Pump prices began to soar after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February led to oil supply fears. However, there are concerns that petrol retailers are not passing on a recent 5p cut in fuel duty to consumers. According to the RAC, the average pump price of a litre of unleaded petrol is now 182.31p while for diesel it is 188.05p. However, the motoring group has warned this could rise to over Â£2 a litre soon. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""While fuel prices have been setting new records on a daily basis, households up and down the country may never have expected to see the cost of filling an average-sized family car reach three figures. ""A further duty cut or a temporary reduction in VAT would go a long way towards helping drivers, especially those on lower incomes who have no choice other than to drive."" The AA called on the government to cut fuel duty by 10p per litre immediately and introduce a ""fuel price stabiliser"", which would reduce fuel duty when petrol prices go up and increase it when they drop. Five tips for saving petrol money examined Petrol prices see biggest daily jump in 17 years Service station defends Â£2 per litre fuel costs Why is petrol so expensive? The wholesale price of petrol - the price at which supermarkets and independent forecourts buy it at - has actually dropped by 5p since 1 June, when it was Â£1.55 a litre, to Â£1.50 on Wednesday. But motoring groups say it takes time for changes in the wholesale price to feed through to the pumps due to the way retailers buy fuel in advance. It comes as some UK forecourts are already selling petrol above Â£2 a litre, according to price comparison website PetrolPrices. On Wednesday, the highest price was found to be 202.9p a litre at BP sites on the A1 near Sunderland, the M4 near Chippenham in Wiltshire and the M6 near Burton-in-Kendal, Cumbria. Motorists at the BP garage at Washington services on the A1(M) on Wednesday were paying more than Â£2 a litre Ewan, 31, told the BBC he needed a car to get to work in centre of Aberdeen, otherwise it was a one-and-a-half hour bus journey. But he said he was now paying up to Â£90 to fill a tank and the petrol expenses he could claim through work were no longer enough. The civil servant, who lives alone, said it was just one more thing pushing up the cost of living and he was now ""barely"" getting by. ""I used to be able to save about Â£200 a month but now I am dipping into savings,"" he said. ""It makes me quite stressed out."" The RAC argues the Treasury could afford to offer more help, as the higher fuel prices rise, the more it collects in VAT receipts - currently around 30p per litre. It added that despite March's fuel duty cut, the government still collects 53p in duty on every litre sold. The government has so far ruled out cutting VAT, arguing that any increases in receipts it gets from higher fuel prices will be largely offset by reduced household spending and VAT on other items. It has no plans to cut fuel duty either. Instead, Downing Street has indicated that fuel retailers failing to pass on the 5p duty cut could be named and shamed. Answering questions from journalists in Blackpool, Boris Johnson said: ""What I want to see is those cuts in taxation not just swallowed up in one gulp, without touching the gullet of the fuel companies, I want to see those cuts having an impact on the pumps. ""And we are watching very closely to see what happens."" Lisa Stevenson, who owns Tolladine service station near Worcester, told the BBC her prices per litre - at 197.9p for unleaded and 194.9p for diesel - were purely the result of volatile wholesale fuel prices driven by the Ukraine war. She added that customers were now buying less fuel because of the soaring costs: ""A delivery of fuel would previously have lasted me a week to 10 days, now its 2-3 weeks."" Alasdair Locke, chairman of Motor Fuel Group, the UK's largest independent forecourt operator, told the BBC's Today programme that his business had passed on the 5p duty cut to consumers ""immediately"". ""It would be easy if there was evidence we're just profiteering but there is no evidence of that, in fact rather the opposite. Our margins are under pressure, along with everyone else's."" Commenting on the rising pump prices, a government spokesperson said: ""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices which is why we have acted to protect the eight million most vulnerable British families through at least Â£1,200 of direct payments this year with additional support for pensioners and those claiming disability benefits."" They added that the typical employee would save more than Â£330 a year through a tax cut in July, while the 5p cut to fuel duty would save a typical family Â£100.

On Wednesday, the highest price was found to be 202.9p a litre at BP sites on the A1 near Sunderland, the M4 near Chippenham in Wiltshire and the M6 near Burton-in-Kendal, Cumbria. Motorists at the BP garage at Washington services on the A1(M) on Wednesday were paying more than Â£2 a litre Ewan, 31, told the BBC he needed a car to get to work in centre of Aberdeen, otherwise it was a one-and-a-half hour bus journey. But he said he was now paying up to Â£90 to fill a tank and the petrol expenses he could claim through work were no longer enough. The civil servant, who lives alone, said it was just one more thing pushing up the cost of living and he was now ""barely"" getting by. ""I used to be able to save about Â£200 a month but now I am dipping into savings,"" he said. ""It makes me quite stressed out."" The RAC argues the Treasury could afford to offer more help, as the higher fuel prices rise, the more it collects in VAT receipts - currently around 30p per litre. It added that despite March's fuel duty cut, the government still collects 53p in duty on every litre sold. The government has so far ruled out cutting VAT, arguing that any increases in receipts it gets from higher fuel prices will be largely offset by reduced household spending and VAT on other items. It has no plans to cut fuel duty either. Instead, Downing Street has indicated that fuel retailers failing to pass on the 5p duty cut could be named and shamed. Answering questions from journalists in Blackpool, Boris Johnson said: ""What I want to see is those cuts in taxation not just swallowed up in one gulp, without touching the gullet of the fuel companies, I want to see those cuts having an impact on the pumps. ""And we are watching very closely to see what happens."" Lisa Stevenson, who owns Tolladine service station near Worcester, told the BBC her prices per litre - at 197.9p for unleaded and 194.9p for diesel - were purely the result of volatile wholesale fuel prices driven by the Ukraine war. She added that customers were now buying less fuel because of the soaring costs: ""A delivery of fuel would previously have lasted me a week to 10 days, now its 2-3 weeks."" Alasdair Locke, chairman of Motor Fuel Group, the UK's largest independent forecourt operator, told the BBC's Today programme that his business had passed on the 5p duty cut to consumers ""immediately"". ""It would be easy if there was evidence we're just profiteering but there is no evidence of that, in fact rather the opposite. Our margins are under pressure, along with everyone else's."" Commenting on the rising pump prices, a government spokesperson said: ""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices which is why we have acted to protect the eight million most vulnerable British families through at least Â£1,200 of direct payments this year with additional support for pensioners and those claiming disability benefits."" They added that the typical employee would save more than Â£330 a year through a tax cut in July, while the 5p cut to fuel duty would save a typical family Â£100.

"Smoking age should rise, government report to say","The age at which people can buy tobacco and cigarettes in England should be raised year by year so that eventually no-one can buy them, a review says. The call has been made in an independent report by ex-charity boss Javed Khan asked for by ministers. Under the plan the age of sale would rise from 18 by one year every year so the children of today will never be allowed to buy tobacco. The government has not agreed to the plan, but said it would consider it. However, sources said it was unlikely at this stage that ministers would agree to the move. Smoking rates have been falling since the 1970s. But there are still six million smokers in England - seven million across the UK. The government has said new ideas are needed to convince the final remaining groups to quit. It has set an ambition for England to be smoke free  - defined as less than 5% of the population smoking - by 2030. Achieving that will be a huge challenge, which is why Health Secretary Sajid Javid asked former Barnardo's chief executive Mr Khan to review the current rules and approaches. The proposal on raising the age of sale is similar to what is being introduced in New Zealand, where buying tobacco products will remain banned for anyone born after 2008. In England, the age limit was raised from 16 to 18 in 2007. Currently, one in nine 18 to 24-year-olds smokes, according to the Office for National Statistics. Mr Khan has also recommended: Setting aside an extra Â£125m for smoke free policies, with an extra Â£70 million per year ring-fenced for stop smoking services Promotion of vapes as an effective ""swap to stop"" tool to help people quit smoking Introducing a licensing system for shops to sell tobacco and banning supermarkets altogether Increasing duties on products and banning duty-free tobacco Ministers said they would consider the proposals as part of a wider package of measures they are looking to introduce this year to improve the health of the nation and tackle inequalities. The report has been produced for ministers in England. But Wales and Northern Ireland have already promised to work closely with counterparts in England over raising the legal age for smoking. The number of deaths caused by smoking is falling - but it remains the leading cause of preventable illness and premature death and is estimated to cause a quarter of all cancer deaths. In 2019, it accounted for 75,000 deaths in England - 15% of the total. Prof Jim McManus, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said if the government was to implement the recommendations they would ""make a huge difference to the nation's health"". And Deborah Arnott, of the charity Action on Smoking and Health, said given the higher rates of smoking and ill-health in more deprived areas only by making ""smoking obsolete"" could the government deliver on its levelling up mission. But Simon Clark, of smokers' lobby group Forest, criticised the recommendations. He said: ""Creeping prohibition won't stop young adults smoking. ""It will simply drive the sale of tobacco underground and consumers will buy cigarettes on the black market where no-one pays tax and products are completely unregulated.""

Why is petrol so expensive?Chip shops battered as price of fish risesSoaring bills damaging people's health - medicsIce cream man freezes lolly sales over costsJapan's shock as prices rise for first time in years,"Motorists will have noticed that the price of petrol and diesel has been creeping up in recent weeks. These rising costs may pile further pressure on families whose budgets are already being squeezed. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year. Recent data from 13 August puts petrol at an average of 149.1p per litre on UK forecourts. In just two weeks, it has shot up by more than 4p and it marks the highest price seen since February. Diesel stands at an average of 150.6p per litre - a level not seen since late May. Although it now costs about Â£82 to fill up a 55-litre family car, prices have fallen back from the record highs seen last summer, which were sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on road fuel prices, said that this recent surge would, however, ""lump pressure back on diesel users, particularly on small businesses"". Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from. They are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound would mean that fuel gets more expensive. Oil prices have risen in recent weeks as producers have tried to restrict output. Oil rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that form part of a group called Opec+ have cut back production. They are grappling with slow demand as economies around the world struggle with high prices and the adjustment after the Covid pandemic. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices. As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. What is Opec and what is happening to oil prices? Livia Gallarati, an oil markets analyst at Energy Aspects, said that prices could grind higher still because of supplies being dented. She suggested Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, could even move above $90 (Â£71) per barrel. Supplies have also been affected by recent outages at oil refineries across the United States and Asia. Oil prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Brent crude hitting more than $120 a barrel in June 2022. Russia used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but that wasbefore punishing sanctions were imposed by the West. After peaking in summer last year, oil prices fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in March this year amid concerns over weak demand. Experts have said that motorists shouldn't expect petrol prices to go up much more unless garages and supermarkets decide to take a bigger cut - or margin - per litre sold. The price of diesel, however, might rise in the autumn and winter because large parts of Europe rely on it for their heating. Retailers said in July that they will to workwith the UK's competition watchdog to set up a scheme to allow motorists to compare live fuel prices online. It came after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that weak competition meant that the average annual supermarket margins on fuel had increased by 6p per litre between 2019 and 2022 - equivalent to Â£900m in extra costs for drivers. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that despite the recent announcement, ""there is still far too much regional variation in prices, particularly among the big four supermarkets, which unfairly penalises drivers in some areas."" He urged drivers to shop around where they can in a bid to save cash. In March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also announced that fuel duty - a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel - would be frozen for another year, having been cut by 5p the year before. It will cost the government more than Â£5bn and think tanks such as theInstitute for Government have suggested,externalit might sit awkwardly with its climate-related pledges.

Chip shops battered as price of fish risesSoaring bills damaging people's health - medicsIce cream man freezes lolly sales over costsJapan's shock as prices rise for first time in years,"Erin Morgan said the price of cod for her restaurant had gone up 50%, but she did not want to pass the cost on to customers It is one of Britain's favourite dishes, but there are fears the future of fish and chips could be at risk due to rising costs. In some Welsh seaside resorts the price of cod and chips has risen to Â£12. Erin Morgan runs a restaurant in Ceredigion and said she feared the increase in price would see customers stay away. The UK government said it supported the hospitality sector through the pandemic with a multi-million pound package. Ms Morgan, who has been running Caffi Sgadan in Aberporth, Ceredigion, for the last two years, said she was having to shoulder much of the rising cost, as she did not want to put prices up by 50%. Shame driving needy away from food banks - study Food costs rise as farmers struggle with increase Fish & chips: Batter in or out of the EU? ""It's worrying, the price of everything is going up,"" she said, adding cooking oil and other kitchen expenses had also risen along with the fish. ""If we carry on seeing these price rises, we'll have to reassess how we run the business,"" she said. This video can not be played White fish, potatoes, peas and the energy to cook them with have all sky-rocketed in price. The cost of a large portion of cod and chips at her shop has risen from Â£7.40 at the start of the year to Â£7.90 this week. But in some areas of Wales, it can be as much as Â£12. Gareth Morgan and his family are just trying to hang on at the Pendre Cafe, the business they run in Cardigan. ""Where as you'd have a regular visit two or three times a week possibly, you see them now twice a month possibly."" Gareth Morgan said his regular customers were visiting less frequently One option was to sell cheaper unskinned fish. Mr Morgan said: ""We're trying not to pass the cost on to customers, but eventually, prices will have to go up again."" Jo Davies, visiting Aberporth from the Midlands, decided to go for a pie at Caffi Sgadan, because the cod was too pricey. She said: ""I would have had fish, definitely, but it's too expensive. It's more of a treat than a normal dinner time meal now. It's not an option."" Chip shop customer Jo Davies, right, bought a pie because the cod was too pricey National Federation of Fish Friers president, Andrew Crook, said the industry was facing a crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. From rising energy and fuel costs to cooking oil and fish, prices have spiralled. Mr Crook, who runs his own chip shop in Euxton, Lancashire, has visited Alesund, Norway, to find ways to mitigate the problems. ""I've seen the price of cooking oils more than double,"" he said. ""That's due to the conflict in Ukraine. With fish, we're already seeing post-pandemic inflation. The cost of fuel also affects it. ""And we're expecting tariffs to be applied to Russian whitefish of 35%, which will certainly impact our industry."" Russia is one of the planet's largest seafood producers. Some countries rely on its white fish. Expert Andrew Crook said the industry was facing a crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine Mr Crook wants to increase stocks in other markets, starting with Norway. ""Most vessel owners in Norway produce headed and gutted fish that then goes on for further processing. It's cheaper than producing fillets,"" he said. ""But with prices going up, it might now stack up for them to switch over to fillets that could provide some solutions to our issues. If there's more fish available to is, shortly it will help mitigate the price increases in the future."" With VAT returning to 20% in April, Mr Crooks is calling on the UK government to step in. ""We need a rethink on how we're taxed,"" he said. ""It's a very bleak outlook, it's going to be very tough on a lot of businesses. ""It all means we don't have the money to invest, and provide good jobs. It's going to put a lot of businesses out of business."" The UK government said a Â£1,000 increase to the Employment Allowance had been announced in the Spring Statement, which would cut takes for businesses. ""Eligible high street businesses can also get 50% off business rates bills, and benefit from a freeze to the business rates multiplier that puts the brakes on bill increases and is worth Â£4.6 billion over the next five years,"" they said. ""We've always been clear that the lower rate of VAT was a temporary measure and it's right our support reflects the fact the economy has reopened.""

Soaring bills damaging people's health - medicsIce cream man freezes lolly sales over costsJapan's shock as prices rise for first time in years,"Laura Brant cannot afford dialysis at home Rises in the cost of living are already having a negative impact of people's health, health professionals warn. BBC News has been told of people skipping meals or cutting back on medication, because of money worries. The Royal College of Nursing says people are having to make heart-wrenching choices that compromise their health and wellbeing. Along with GPs and hospital doctors, they warn health inequalities between rich and poor risk becoming worse. Why are prices rising so quickly? When will we get the Â£400 energy grant? Cost of Living: Are Affordable Food Brands Healthy? 'It feels like I'm being priced out of existence' Laura Brant, 28, has already had to make some tough choices about a treatment keeping her alive. Having lived with kidney disease since the age of seven, she has already had two kidney transplants - and now needs another. Laura is dependent on a dialysis machine to carry out the filtering process usually performed by the kidneys. Without it, she could be dead in a week. Laura was having dialysis at home - but the machine used so much electricity and water the bills started to mount rapidly. ""I'd say that it's the straw that broke the camel's back, really, with the cost of running the dialysis machine, the water it uses, the electric,"" she says. ""And it was adding to my anxiety, like, 'How am I going to pay to do this treatment every month?'"" So Laura switched her dialysis away from the convenience and accessibility of home to a hospital. At first, this meant a three-hour round trip, three days a week, from her North Yorkshire home to the Freeman Hospital, in Newcastle. She has since moved to a centre 20 minutes away but this has also meant switching to an entirely new medical team - and it has not been easy. ""I'm sick of having to make choices,"" Laura says. ""And they have to be the right choices. ""If not, it's my health that's going to be affected at the end of the line - and I don't want to be any more poorly."" At Grey Road Surgery, in north Liverpool, one of the most deprived parts of the city, Dr Janet Bliss and her team have seen how poverty affects their patients' health. Dr Janet Bliss says her patients are struggling ""For us in this part of Liverpool, it's been a significant issue for a number of years,"" she says. ""The kind of constant worrying about how you're going to pay the bills, how you're going to feed yourself, how you're going to pay for your kids' clothes, takes a toll that we could probably all relate to. ""However, it's more than that. It's not just mental health and wellbeing - it's also your physical health. ""Living in that kind of chronic stress does really bad things to your blood pressure and to your metabolism and can lead to illnesses like diabetes. ""Also, not being able to access nutritious foods makes it really difficult to keep yourself well physically."" Dr Bliss says the recent price rises are making a bad situation worse. ""It's definitely noticeable that we are getting increased patients on the list who are calling up - no food in the house is a common thing, not able to pay the bills, people facing eviction, people actually acknowledging that they're going to lose their homes. ""We're seeing people limiting the amount of meals they will eat in a week, consciously planning to miss meals. ""We're seeing people deciding to not to collect medications, not to pay for prescription items. ""We're seeing the impact on transport costs, and also things like data for your phone in order to access vital services that will support their health. ""Also, those cost of living impacts are only just filtering through and people who are on the lowest incomes will be feeling them now. ""But as the months go by, I think that's going to bite harder on people who previously would not have considered themselves on low incomes."" Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen says nurses themselves are affected. ""Many are choosing between heating and eating,"" she says, ""and struggling to afford the petrol they need to drive to their patients' homes, potentially impacting care. ""The situation is becoming grave for many. The UK government can, and must, do more to ensure this crisis doesn't worsen the health inequalities we face in this country."" Royal College of Physicians president Dr Andrew Goddard says some of his respiratory-medicine colleagues are hearing of patients choosing to turn off oxygen supplies to save money. ""Respiratory disease disproportionately affects those least able to afford to improve their social circumstances,"" he says. ""It seems likely the cost of living crisis will widen this disparity further."" In Darlington, a mobile food club is helping people continue to eat healthily despite rising prices. Marzena Domoracka has to provide for four children Organised by The Bread And Butter Thing, it redistributes excess food from supermarkets and other suppliers. Members pay Â£7.50 a week for at least Â£35 worth of fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, cereals, grains and pulses. Mother-of-four Marzena Domoracka finds the scheme invaluable. Her five-month-old son will soon be weaning on to solid food. ""At the moment, I have to count every penny to make sure I've got enough for the nappies, for the cream, for the wipes,"" Marzena says. ""This saving will allow me to buy him some better veg and better fruit so he can actually have a good start in life. ""Without it, I don't know what I would do."" A spokesman for the department of health and social care in England says the government is taking action to support households, including cutting fuel duty, raising the threshold at which people start to pay National Insurance and freezing NHS prescription charges.

Ice cream man freezes lolly sales over costsJapan's shock as prices rise for first time in years,"Mark Biggs may have to stop selling ice lollies from his van because he cannot afford the electricity to run the freezer An ice cream man is considering axing ice lollies because of the cost of freezing them. Mark Biggs, from Merthyr Tydfil, runs Biggzy's Ice Cream and said there have been weeks he has not paid himself a wage. Rising prices for electricity, diesel and wholesale food mean he is considering quitting the job he loves. The UK government said it is ""supporting British businesses to navigate the months ahead"". The Federation of Small Businesses said 11% of small firms plan to close, sell or downsize over the coming year, according to their research. Cost of living crisis: What support is there? Households face being Â£600 worse off this year Costs drive young people back to their parents Mr Biggs used to be a mechanic and said his decision to ""change oily rags for rags covered in ice cream"" made him happy. ""I love this job, it's the best job I've had,"" he said. ""All I want to do is make people happy. I'm happy when I'm serving."" Mr Biggs said it's ""upsetting"" to think his dream job could come to an end He said wanted this to be a ""lifetime"" job, but can't see that happening with the way prices are rising. ""It's upsetting when you think about it, it could be over."" Three days-worth of diesel for the van is costing him Â£120 and the fridges are charged from his home electricity supply. He said he may have to remove ice lollies from the van, due to the cost of electricity of the additional fridge. He is also paying suppliers more for ice cream mix and snacks. ""Everything costs way too much at the minute, I can't put my prices up because people moan if I put my prices up,"" he said. He added that he takes home on average around Â£150 a week, but sometimes has no wage at all. After the disruption of the pandemic, many working in leisure, hospitality and tourism are hoping for a good summer, but businesses face many difficulties. This week, the RAC saidit costs Â£98 to fill the average carwith petrol and Â£101.86 with diesel. The British Retail Consortium saidshoppers are spending less than they werea year ago. Hopkin Smith, of Taff Valley Activity Centre near Pontypridd, said corporate clients and local family day trips aren't as frequent as they used to be. Mr Smith says his business is in a Catch-22 situation with rising costs but customers unable to pay higher prices ""What is worrying me is that the cost of fuel is going to go up again in the autumn, the stag and hens will have plateaued, and with gas and electricity prices going up, the family groups are going to be hit harder again,"" said Mr Smith. ""So while we're able to get through the summer, (by) the autumn, winter and next year I don't know where we'll be going. ""We're in a sort of Catch-22, reluctance from customers to spend while our costs are escalating all the time."" With foreign travel restricted, last year was a busy summer for Lydia Watts at Under The Oak glamping in Bedwas, near Caerphilly. However, Ms Watts is expecting this season to be ""challenging"". Lydia Watts runs Under The Oak glamping in Bedwas, near Caerphilly ""It does seem that people are more wary about booking that big holiday, spending hundreds, getting away because the cost of fuel's gone up, their household bills have gone up and there does seem to be an air of uncertainty,"" said Ms Watts. ""People are maybe booking a little later, booking shorter stays, cutting back a little bit."" Sam Foulkes runs Wrexham's Rock The Park festival and said the cost of living is causing sales to drop. ""People cannot afford to go to events and festivals. ""They are worried about being able to have hot running water, a roof over their head and a light on in the dark,"" he said. Mr Foulkes said the events industry is facing a tough time with ""little or no financial support available."" Sam Foulkes said rising prices, especially diesel, are causing him ""major issues"" Ben Cottam, from The Federation of Small Businesses Wales, said the UK and Welsh governments should offer ""targeted interventions like grant support"", similar to measures taken during the pandemic. ""We have called on UK government to extend the energy support issued via the council tax system to small businesses, as they are currently not protected by the energy price cap unlike domestic customers. ""We have also called on government to install a sick pay rebate, to allow breathing space for the smallest businesses."" Asked if pandemic-style business grants were part of the answer, Welsh government Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said he wanted to support business ""in a way that helps them to move forward with their customer base"". ""So it's both about putting money into the pockets of customers - that's why we've put money into advice services, it's why our Â£380m package of support for households really matters. ""But we've then got to think about how we use the opportunities to support businesses into the future."" He added that would need to involve the UK government and its ""much larger fiscal firepower"" to have a significant impact. A UK government spokesman said: ""We've cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance and slashing fuel duty.

Japan's shock as prices rise for first time in years,"While many parts of Asia grew richer over the last three decades Japan's prosperity stagnated As a child growing up in Japan, things very rarely seemed to get more expensive. My favourite lunch was always available for a 500 yen coin ($3.90; Â£3.10) and it remained that way until 2021. The same for shoes or clothes, little changed. I was taught to save, save and save, and repeatedly warned that the value of our family home had collapsed in the 1990s, when the property market crashed. This painful financial loss meant my parents, and many others like them, were never able to sell their house again or upgrade it. But when prices for everyday items don't increase, people don't actively spend money. Companies, in turn, respond by not increasing salaries, which lowers consumer demand and prices further. When you cannot get a pay rise, you don't rush out to go shopping very often. Taken altogether, this slows an entire country's economic growth - a vicious cycle Japan has been trapped in for decades. While many parts of Asia grew richer, Japan's wealth stagnated.Japan's gross domestic product per capita- the country's economic output per person - remained stuck at the same level since the 1990s. By 2010, China had overtaken it as the world's second-biggest economy. Productivity rates have remained relatively static For decades, with little success, the country's central bank has tried to stimulate growth to get Japanese to ""spend more, invest more, the wage goes up and the price goes up in tandem moderately"", explains Nobuko Kobayashi, a partner with EY-Parthenon. In April, the benchmark measure for consumer prices rose 2.1%, enough that inflation this year is expected to finally hit the Bank of Japan's 2% target, after three decades of essentially no rise at all. However, the jump has nothing to do with domestic economic policy. It has been driven largely by higher import costs, a global increase in raw material and energy prices - pushed higher by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Ms Kobayashi even warns it could mark ""the start of bad inflation, because wages have not gone up yet"". In fact, average salaries have hardly risen for over three decades, so things are about to get painful for shoppers. Japanese workers' take-home pay has improved very little since the 1990s While post-Covid there are many governments battling rising prices and a higher cost of living, it comes as a huge shock to Japan, where people have been used to decades of stable prices. When the price of Japan's everyday snack - umaibo - which was always priced at 10 yen ($0.075; Â£0.06) since its creation 43 years ago - went up by 20%, it sent a shockwave through the nation. In a society which believes in sharing social burdens, increasing prices has become something of a cultural taboo. So much so that Yaokin, the company which makes the popular snack, had to launch an ad campaign explaining why it had to increase the price. But it was inevitable and one by one, everything from mayonnaise and bottled drinks to beer has become more expensive. According to Teikoku databank, prices for more than 10,000 food items are set to go up by an average of 13% this year. Snack maker Yaokin launched an ad campaign to explain the price hike Central Bank dilemma And here, Japan has a really tricky problem: central banks across the rest of the world have responded to soaring prices by incrementally raising interest rates to help keep inflation in check. The Bank of Japan has held rates at rock bottom for years. If there is a significant gap in interest rates between Japan and other major economies, such as the US, the Japanese currency sharply weakens. Theyen recently slid to 20-year-lows,externalagainst the dollar. A weaker yen means that imported items - crucially oil and gas - cost even more. ""Consumers are not accustomed to accepting inflation,"" says Takeshi Niinami, who is the chief executive of Suntory Holdings, known for Japanese whiskies Yamazaki, Hibiki and Hakushu, as well as beer and non-alcoholic beverages such as bottled water and coffee. The company has recently announced a price hike across most of its product range from October, to give itself time to discuss these increases with its distributors. Mr Niinami puts this down to the global supply chain crunch, caused by the pandemic andChina's recent lockdowns. ""Overall, it has been accepted. But there is still a challenge from big retailers,"" he says. Suntory CEO Takeshi Niinami says the company raised prices of its products due to supply chain issues Part of the rationale behind the government's efforts to promote inflation in the Japanese economy has been to try to push wages higher. ""There's huge pressure from society and the government to raise wages, but we need to increase productivity,"" says Mr Niinami. ""But it's difficult to increase productivity all of a sudden. We have so many peers in one industry, so we have to consolidate."" Mr Niinami says Japan also needs to invest in new sectors such as green innovation or healthcare to stimulate the economy, and create new jobs to boost average salaries. He also hopes that the government will do more to attract foreign investors. But all that will take time and job creation is just one of many issues Japan has been grappling with for decades. The only silver lining of a weaker yen in the short term could be an influx of international tourists keen to spend their money in Japan, although the borders are only just starting to reopen after Covid.

"Cost of filling car with petrol set to hit Â£100The milestone could come as soon as Thursday as wholesale fuel prices continue to rise, says RAC.Business","Driving groups have called for more support to help drivers after the cost of filling an average family car with petrol hit Â£100 for the first time. The RAC motoring group called it ""a truly dark day"" as the cost of filling a 55-litre tank reached Â£100.27 for petrol and Â£103.43 for diesel. The RAC and its rival the AA urged the chancellor to cut VAT on fuel or to reduce fuel duty further. The Treasury said it had provided Â£37bn to ease the cost of living already. Rising petrol prices are putting pressure on household budgets, with energy bills and food prices also now at multi-year highs. Pump prices began to soar after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February led to oil supply fears. However, there are concerns that petrol retailers are not passing on a recent 5p cut in fuel duty to consumers. According to the RAC, the average pump price of a litre of unleaded petrol is now 182.31p while for diesel it is 188.05p. However, the motoring group has warned this could rise to over Â£2 a litre soon. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""While fuel prices have been setting new records on a daily basis, households up and down the country may never have expected to see the cost of filling an average-sized family car reach three figures. ""A further duty cut or a temporary reduction in VAT would go a long way towards helping drivers, especially those on lower incomes who have no choice other than to drive."" The AA called on the government to cut fuel duty by 10p per litre immediately and introduce a ""fuel price stabiliser"", which would reduce fuel duty when petrol prices go up and increase it when they drop. Five tips for saving petrol money examined Petrol prices see biggest daily jump in 17 years Service station defends Â£2 per litre fuel costs Why is petrol so expensive? The wholesale price of petrol - the price at which supermarkets and independent forecourts buy it at - has actually dropped by 5p since 1 June, when it was Â£1.55 a litre, to Â£1.50 on Wednesday. But motoring groups say it takes time for changes in the wholesale price to feed through to the pumps due to the way retailers buy fuel in advance. It comes as some UK forecourts are already selling petrol above Â£2 a litre, according to price comparison website PetrolPrices. On Wednesday, the highest price was found to be 202.9p a litre at BP sites on the A1 near Sunderland, the M4 near Chippenham in Wiltshire and the M6 near Burton-in-Kendal, Cumbria. Motorists at the BP garage at Washington services on the A1(M) on Wednesday were paying more than Â£2 a litre Ewan, 31, told the BBC he needed a car to get to work in centre of Aberdeen, otherwise it was a one-and-a-half hour bus journey. But he said he was now paying up to Â£90 to fill a tank and the petrol expenses he could claim through work were no longer enough. The civil servant, who lives alone, said it was just one more thing pushing up the cost of living and he was now ""barely"" getting by. ""I used to be able to save about Â£200 a month but now I am dipping into savings,"" he said. ""It makes me quite stressed out."" The RAC argues the Treasury could afford to offer more help, as the higher fuel prices rise, the more it collects in VAT receipts - currently around 30p per litre. It added that despite March's fuel duty cut, the government still collects 53p in duty on every litre sold. The government has so far ruled out cutting VAT, arguing that any increases in receipts it gets from higher fuel prices will be largely offset by reduced household spending and VAT on other items. It has no plans to cut fuel duty either. Instead, Downing Street has indicated that fuel retailers failing to pass on the 5p duty cut could be named and shamed. Answering questions from journalists in Blackpool, Boris Johnson said: ""What I want to see is those cuts in taxation not just swallowed up in one gulp, without touching the gullet of the fuel companies, I want to see those cuts having an impact on the pumps. ""And we are watching very closely to see what happens."" Lisa Stevenson, who owns Tolladine service station near Worcester, told the BBC her prices per litre - at 197.9p for unleaded and 194.9p for diesel - were purely the result of volatile wholesale fuel prices driven by the Ukraine war. She added that customers were now buying less fuel because of the soaring costs: ""A delivery of fuel would previously have lasted me a week to 10 days, now its 2-3 weeks."" Alasdair Locke, chairman of Motor Fuel Group, the UK's largest independent forecourt operator, told the BBC's Today programme that his business had passed on the 5p duty cut to consumers ""immediately"". ""It would be easy if there was evidence we're just profiteering but there is no evidence of that, in fact rather the opposite. Our margins are under pressure, along with everyone else's."" Commenting on the rising pump prices, a government spokesperson said: ""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices which is why we have acted to protect the eight million most vulnerable British families through at least Â£1,200 of direct payments this year with additional support for pensioners and those claiming disability benefits."" They added that the typical employee would save more than Â£330 a year through a tax cut in July, while the 5p cut to fuel duty would save a typical family Â£100.

Zelensky ties fate of east Ukraine to city battleUkraine's president says fighting for Severodonetsk may prove decisive in the battle for the east.Europe,"Smoke over Severodonetsk this week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that fighting for the city of Severodonetsk may decide the outcome of the war in the east of the country. ""In many respects, the fate of the Donbas is being decided there,"" he said as combat raged in the industrial belt with Russian and separatist forces. He said his troops were inflicting major losses on enemy forces. But Ukrainian forces have been pushed back to the outskirts, according to the region's top Ukrainian official. Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region (which makes up the Donbas along with the neighbouring Donetsk region), said special forces had pulled back after Russia ""started levelling the area with shelling and air strikes"". ""Our [forces] now again control only the outskirts of the city,"" he told local media. ""But the fighting is still going on, our [forces] are defending Severodonetsk."" ""It is impossible to say the Russians completely control the city,"" he added. Some 15,000 civilians remained in Severodonetsk and the nearby city of Lysychansk, the governor said. Civilians in Lysychansk sheltered from shelling this week Russia said on Wednesdaythat Ukraine was suffering ""significant losses in manpower, weapons and military equipment"" in the Donbas. Daily round-up: Warnings over grain blockage and fuel 'gold rush' The focus of the war switched to the east at the end of March after Russian forces pulled back from the region around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Large parts of the Donbas have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since earlier fighting in 2014-15. In another development, UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that the consequences for the world of Russia's invasion were worsening, with 1.6 billion people affected. ""The war's impact on food security, energy and finance is systemic, severe and speeding up,"" he said. In an interview for BBC News, World Trade Organization Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned thatthe food crisis could last for years without intervention. African countries could be hit especially hard by wheat and fertilizer shortages, she said. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports, unable to be exported because of the war. Global banking experts believeRussia's economy will shrink 15% by the end of the year- and a further 3% in 2023 - because of Western sanctions, a mass exodus of companies and a collapse in exports. The figures could be even worse if Europe fully weans itself off Russian energy, the Institute of International Finance warned. Russia invaded on 24 February, saying it was seeking to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine - a claim that has been widely discredited. Since the war began,at least 4,253 civilians have been killed and 5,141 injured,externalaccording to the UN, along with thousands of combatants on both sides, whilemore than 14 million people have fled their homes.

Soaring bills damaging people's health - medics,"Laura Brant cannot afford dialysis at home Rises in the cost of living are already having a negative impact of people's health, health professionals warn. BBC News has been told of people skipping meals or cutting back on medication, because of money worries. The Royal College of Nursing says people are having to make heart-wrenching choices that compromise their health and wellbeing. Along with GPs and hospital doctors, they warn health inequalities between rich and poor risk becoming worse. Why are prices rising so quickly? When will we get the Â£400 energy grant? Cost of Living: Are Affordable Food Brands Healthy? 'It feels like I'm being priced out of existence' Laura Brant, 28, has already had to make some tough choices about a treatment keeping her alive. Having lived with kidney disease since the age of seven, she has already had two kidney transplants - and now needs another. Laura is dependent on a dialysis machine to carry out the filtering process usually performed by the kidneys. Without it, she could be dead in a week. Laura was having dialysis at home - but the machine used so much electricity and water the bills started to mount rapidly. ""I'd say that it's the straw that broke the camel's back, really, with the cost of running the dialysis machine, the water it uses, the electric,"" she says. ""And it was adding to my anxiety, like, 'How am I going to pay to do this treatment every month?'"" So Laura switched her dialysis away from the convenience and accessibility of home to a hospital. At first, this meant a three-hour round trip, three days a week, from her North Yorkshire home to the Freeman Hospital, in Newcastle. She has since moved to a centre 20 minutes away but this has also meant switching to an entirely new medical team - and it has not been easy. ""I'm sick of having to make choices,"" Laura says. ""And they have to be the right choices. ""If not, it's my health that's going to be affected at the end of the line - and I don't want to be any more poorly."" At Grey Road Surgery, in north Liverpool, one of the most deprived parts of the city, Dr Janet Bliss and her team have seen how poverty affects their patients' health. Dr Janet Bliss says her patients are struggling ""For us in this part of Liverpool, it's been a significant issue for a number of years,"" she says. ""The kind of constant worrying about how you're going to pay the bills, how you're going to feed yourself, how you're going to pay for your kids' clothes, takes a toll that we could probably all relate to. ""However, it's more than that. It's not just mental health and wellbeing - it's also your physical health. ""Living in that kind of chronic stress does really bad things to your blood pressure and to your metabolism and can lead to illnesses like diabetes. ""Also, not being able to access nutritious foods makes it really difficult to keep yourself well physically."" Dr Bliss says the recent price rises are making a bad situation worse. ""It's definitely noticeable that we are getting increased patients on the list who are calling up - no food in the house is a common thing, not able to pay the bills, people facing eviction, people actually acknowledging that they're going to lose their homes. ""We're seeing people limiting the amount of meals they will eat in a week, consciously planning to miss meals. ""We're seeing people deciding to not to collect medications, not to pay for prescription items. ""We're seeing the impact on transport costs, and also things like data for your phone in order to access vital services that will support their health. ""Also, those cost of living impacts are only just filtering through and people who are on the lowest incomes will be feeling them now. ""But as the months go by, I think that's going to bite harder on people who previously would not have considered themselves on low incomes."" Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen says nurses themselves are affected. ""Many are choosing between heating and eating,"" she says, ""and struggling to afford the petrol they need to drive to their patients' homes, potentially impacting care. ""The situation is becoming grave for many. The UK government can, and must, do more to ensure this crisis doesn't worsen the health inequalities we face in this country."" Royal College of Physicians president Dr Andrew Goddard says some of his respiratory-medicine colleagues are hearing of patients choosing to turn off oxygen supplies to save money. ""Respiratory disease disproportionately affects those least able to afford to improve their social circumstances,"" he says. ""It seems likely the cost of living crisis will widen this disparity further."" In Darlington, a mobile food club is helping people continue to eat healthily despite rising prices. Marzena Domoracka has to provide for four children Organised by The Bread And Butter Thing, it redistributes excess food from supermarkets and other suppliers. Members pay Â£7.50 a week for at least Â£35 worth of fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, cereals, grains and pulses. Mother-of-four Marzena Domoracka finds the scheme invaluable. Her five-month-old son will soon be weaning on to solid food. ""At the moment, I have to count every penny to make sure I've got enough for the nappies, for the cream, for the wipes,"" Marzena says. ""This saving will allow me to buy him some better veg and better fruit so he can actually have a good start in life. ""Without it, I don't know what I would do."" A spokesman for the department of health and social care in England says the government is taking action to support households, including cutting fuel duty, raising the threshold at which people start to pay National Insurance and freezing NHS prescription charges.

"Teacher dead and pupils hurt as car hits Berlin crowdEvidence suggests the driver was a ""mentally ill person running amok"", a regional official says.Europe","The car crashed into a store A teacher was killed and 14 schoolchildren were injured after a car hit a crowd on a busy street in the German capital, Berlin. The group was on a school trip to Berlin from the state of Hesse. A second teacher was seriously hurt. Police say the driver, a 29-year-old man, was arrested at the scene. Berlin Interior Affairs Minister Iris Spranger said evidence suggested the driver was a ""mentally ill person running amok"". The incident occurred shortly before 10:30 (08:30 GMT) in the heart of western Berlin, on one of its busiest shopping streets. The woman who died has been identified as a schoolteacher who was on a trip with a class of teenagers from the central state of Hesse. Berlin police say she died on the spot. ""There are seriously injured people among the more than a dozen injured,"" police spokesperson Thilo Cablitz said. Bad Arolsen Mayor Marko Lambion said a bus was on its way to pick up the children from Berlin. ""We're doing everything we can to bring them home,"" he said at the press conference. The driver has dual German and Armenian citizenship and lives in Berlin. Earlier reports that he had left a note in his car were denied by officials. Witnesses described seeing a silver Renault Clio veering into a crowd of people on the pavement near Berlin's busy KurfÃ¼rstendamm shopping avenue, before driving back on to the road and crashing into a shop window. A witness who would only be named as F Kacan said the driver had abandoned the car and had taken off running but ""we were able to stop him"", AFP news agency reports. The actor John Barrowman tweeted that he had been nearby when the incident took place and in a video posted from the scene said the car had repeatedly mounted the footpath before crashing into the storefront.

Filming of JJ Abrams project in Belfast scrapped,"JJ Abrams has directed films in the Star Wars franchise A major television series from Star Wars director JJ Abrams, which was due to film in Belfast, has been cancelled. The sci-fi drama Demimonde was set to be broadcast on the United States network HBO. Crew who had started working on the project in Belfast have been stood down. Northern Ireland Screen said they would be looking in the coming weeks for a project to replace it, and it would get back its Â£1m investment. JJ Abrams is best known for directing Star Wars and the Mission Impossible films. BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme understands crew who were working in pre-production on the project were sent home while negotiations took place between JJ Abrams' production company Bad Robot and HBO. The film industry publication The Hollywood Reporterbroke the news that the show was not going ahead due to ""budget issues"",external. The television series was in pre-production at the Titanic Studios in Belfast, which previously housed Game of Thrones and the upcoming blockbuster film Dungeons and Dragons. This video can not be played Belfast filming for new JJ Abrams series cancelled It was expected that Demimonde would be in the studios for more than a year, which would have provided well-paid work for local film crews. Northern Ireland Screen chief executive Richard Williams told Good Morning Ulster the production would have provided work for about 600 people. He said it was not unusual for a project to drop out, and NI Screen would be looking for another in Los Angeles in the coming weeks. ""We've had this happen before, we had a project just to drop out before lockdown and had it replaced by Dungeons and Dragons,"" Mr Williams said. ""We'll just have to go out to find another project. ""I would be very disappointed if we didn't have a new project slated by the middle of autumn, certainly before Christmas - but time is lost, money is lost for sure."" He said the money the screen agency invested in the pilot - which had not yet been shot - would be recouped, adding: ""We had invested in the pilot to the tune of just over a million pounds. We will have a swift conversation with HBO to get that money retrieved."" Securing Demimonde to shoot in Belfast was a big coup for Northern Ireland Screen. Northern Ireland's film and television industry has been boosted recently by securing major projects likeThe Northman,The School for Good and Evil,Lift and Dungeons and Dragons.

Plan to ban selling energy drinks to under-16s,"Several ideas are being considered to try and tackle the problem of childhood obesity Selling energy drinks to under-16s could be banned in Wales in a bid to tackle childhood obesity. More than one in four children are overweight when they start primary school, according to official figures. Under Welsh government proposals, takeaways could also be stopped from opening near schools and free soft drink refills could be banned. The consultations are aimed at informing new legislation to try to improve the health of young people. The UK governmentlaunched a consultationon plans to ban the sale of energy drinks in England to anybody under 18 in 2018, but a law has not been passed. Currently, identification is not legally required but somesupermarkets already stop under-16s from buying soft drinkswith high-caffeine content - mostly those with more than 150mg of per litre, which carry a warning stating they are not recommended for children. Many UK teenagers have weekly energy drink habit Not enough evidence for energy drink ban ""We're looking at things like price promotions where unhealthy food is cited in supermarkets, having calorie labelling in takeaways and restaurants, so it's a whole range of measures that we're consulting on,"" said deputy minister for mental health, Lynne Neagle. Ms Neagle met pupils at Whitchurch High School in Cardiff where nutritional values form part of lessons about food. ""They were brilliant and really well-informed and thought that education was really important and that there were other things as well that we could do such as making the labelling warning of the dangers for young people more prominent,"" she said. Lewis thinks an energy drink ban would be ""a bit extreme"" Year 9 pupil Lewis agreed with some of the proposals but called banning the sale of energy drinks ""a bit extreme"". ""I think it's more general stuff that would work like not putting them near the checkouts and maybe shops should put fruit at the tills,"" he said. ""It's just that when you see chocolate there, it's more likely you'll go for the chocolate, but people still like fruit as well."" Callum says young people will find ways to get around a ban Classmate Callum, said schools should do more to teach pupils about foods that are high in sugar and fat. ""Banning energy drinks will just mean under-16s will just ask someone over 16 to get them for them,"" he said. Kundi thinks education, not a ban, is needed ""I think you need to educate people on energy drinks because some people just drink energy drinks every day of the week like it's water,"" said Kundi. ""So we need to educate them in school and cooking lessons but we shouldn't ban them because they do taste nice and yes, they are unhealthy, but it's about educating young kids on how unhealthy they are."" Deeptha says a ban will not solve the problem Deeptha said: ""I don't think a ban's a good idea because taking them away won't solve the problem. ""Instead advising them and educating them more would be a better option. ""I hope the deputy minister does take our views on board because we the people vote for them and that's really important if we want our country to improve."" In Wales, approximately 1.5 million adults are overweight and 600,000 people are obese - aBody Mass Index (BMI),externalof 30 to 39.9. However, this is not the case for everyone and BMI is not used to diagnose obesity as very muscular people will have a high BMI but not much body fat. Obesity is linked to premature deaths from cancer, heart disease, liver disease and type 2 diabetes. The latestNational Diet and Nutrition Survey,externalshows people are consuming too much sugar, saturated fat, salt and calories, but not enough fibre, fruit and vegetables. The survey showed that people aged 11 -18 consumed up to three times the recommended maximum amount of sugar. Some energy drinks have 21 teaspoons of sugar and the same caffeine as three cups of coffee. Research shows that children who drink at least one energy drink per week are more likely to report symptoms such as headaches, sleep and stomach problems, as well as low mood and irritability. Research by the charity Nesta Cymru found that Welsh consumers significantly underestimated the number of calories in popular snacks. In the poll, 95% of Welsh respondents underestimated the calories in half a sharing bag of crisps containing 447 calories, the average guess was less than half the correct answer. While most people were broadly accurate at guessing the calorie content of meals and drinks, they significantly underestimated the calories of crisps, chocolates and sausage rolls. Half of the respondents overestimated the calories in a Big Mac with medium fries, with an average guess of 1,050 calories compared to the true value of 870. Dr Jonathan Bone says a ban would be an opportunity to improve people's health ""The way we are exposed to unhealthy snacks through adverts, prominent positioning in shops and price offers can have a real impact on what we choose to eat and our overall health,"" said Dr Jonathan Bone from Nesta Cymru. ""With snacks making up a significant portion of our diets, this is a real opportunity to improve the health of people in Wales."" ""We know where policy leads, the industry will follow - the soft drinks levy was successful at nudging manufacturers to reformulate their products with less sugar."" Gavin Partington, director of the  British Soft Drinks Association, said the group's members did not ""market or promote energy drinks to under-16s, nor do they sample products with this age group"". He added: ""In addition, energy drinks carry an advisory note stating 'not recommended for children.' This is all in line with our long-standing code of practice."" The Department of Health and Social Care said obesity was the second biggest cause of cancer and cost the NHS about Â£6.5bn a year. It said it was taking action to encourage people to choose healthier food by introducing calorie labelling on menus, helping families with schemes like Healthy Start and bringing in rules on the placement of less healthy products in stores. A spokesman said further action would be detailed in the health disparities white paper later this year. The Welsh government consultation runs until 1 September.

"Up your game on storms, Ofgem tells energy firms","Storm Arwen left millions of people without power last November Power firms must improve their storm response after Storm Arwen left more than one million UK homes without power last year, a report by the energy regulator says. The storm brought severe wind, rain and snow across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on 26 November. Three people diedas gusts of up to 100mph lashed the UK. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley told power firms to ""up your game"" and ""get ready for winter"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said companies were ""not well prepared"" for the storm. In future, they should maintain and invest more in the network, provide clearer communication to customers about when they will be reconnected, and be more imaginative about how they get people back on supply, he said. ""This is a really tough time for customers right now, this is a market where everyone is having a difficult time. ""Every energy company that is working in this country needs to be working on behalf of their customers and that means big changes for the networks."" Storm Arwen response report misses maintenance Thousands of homes without power after Storm Arwen Power firms' response to Storm Arwen 'unacceptable' Third person dies as storm brings 98mph gusts The storm - which saw nearly 4,000 people in north-east England and Scotland cut off from their energy supply for more than a week - caused widespread damage, with high winds snapping or uprooting trees that fell onto overhead lines. The north east of Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders were among the worst-hit areas. Ofgem said three network companies - Northern Powergrid, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks and Electricity North West - have agreed to pay Â£10.3m in ""redress payments"" to support communities affected by Storm Arwen and for upgrading networks to minimise the impact of severe weather events. This is in addition to almost Â£30m in compensation that has been paid by the firms. A lot of damage was caused by the wind, including part of a wall collapsing on a car in Sunderland Mr Brearley said the frequency of extreme weather events was only set to increase, so it was really important that industry, and those involved more widely, learned from Storm Arwen to better respond in future. Ofgem'sreport,externalfound: Emergency plans initiated before the storm hit were not adequate to deal with the significant damage that followed Some people were cut off for an ""unacceptable"" length of time, had poor and sometimes inaccurate communications from network firms, and it took too long for them to receive compensation payments Around 28% of customers were told they would be back on supply within 24 hours, but that did not happen, and some customers did not think that the support available was made clear to them One firm, Northern Powergrid, did not directly contact vulnerable customers enrolled on its Priority Services Register before Storm Arwen, which should have happened under its winter preparedness campaign Northern Powergrid also accepted the performance of its call centre ""fell below"" the expected standards during a severe storm, potentially breaching its licence Most power disruption was caused by severe winds and trees toppling onto power lines, with a link found between damaged network poles and their age, although this need further examination Its key recommendations included: Network companies should submit their winter preparedness plans to Ofgem so it can check customers will be supported during power disruptions Firms should ""stress test"" their websites and call centres to ensure they have sufficient capacity for severe weather events They should develop ""more robust mechanisms"" to ensure compensation payments are delivered swiftly and accurately to customers Energy firms should voluntarily lift the Â£700 cap on compensation for future storms as they did for Storm Arwen Overhead lines and the management of vegetation should be reviewed to boost network resilience for future storms Storm Arwen felled trees such as this one in the Lake District, in Cumbria Jamie Sunderland, who lives in Brigsteer, a village in South Cumbria, had no power for a week after Storm Arwen. With a toddler who could not be at home with no heating or lighting, he was forced to camp out with family and friends. They were initially told they would be reconnected in about 12 to 24 hours, but after three days, they took such assurances ""with a pinch of salt"". Reacting to Ofgem's report, he said its finding that customers received ""unacceptable"" service was correct. ""The problem was lack of information. If we'd been told more accurately that the power was going to be off for three or four days then we'd have been able to plan more accurately. ""For instance, we didn't think to empty the fridge or the freezer, thinking it was only for a short time. ""And all that food went to waste. If we'd realised it would have been longer we'd have taken more frozen stuff with us."" Simon Bainbridge, a farmer in Northumberland, was left without power for eight days and says having to use seven generators to keep the farm running left him out of pocket, even with the compensation he received. He argues there needs to be more investment and active checks of the network to protect power supplies for future events. This video can not be played Watch: Dr Lily Fulton-Humble on living without power with a seven-week-old baby and a sick toddler The Energy Networks Association, which represents the UK and Ireland's power firms, said six electricity firms planned to boost investment in network resilience measures from about Â£12bn to Â£14.5bn over the next five years. The extra cash would fund tree cutting, flood prevention and other measures to protect the UK's power network against future severe weather events, it added. The firms have submitted these details in their business plans for the next five years, subject to Ofgem's approval. Phil Jones, chief executive of Northern Powergrid,said,externalit had improved its handling of customer communications and estimated power restoration times, and had invested further in its website, telephone systems and power cut maps to cope with periods of high demand. Mr Jones said that by the end of the 2015- 2023 period, Northern Powergrid would have invested almost Â£1bn in maintaining its network. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said it was clear thousands of customers had been badly let down by electricity network companies and that a new action plan would improve preparedness for future storms. Power lines - including in Ballater, Aberdeenshire - were brought down by trees during Storm Arwen Additional reporting by Catherine Lee.

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities. It raises money for Unicef and this year the charity says some of the money raised will go towards helping those impacted by the war. ""This event is going to help a lot of people in Ukraine,"" he says, ""especially kids, we're going to create a lot of great programmes to improve a lot of things for kids.""

Two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun were captured by Russian troops while fighting for Ukraine. All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely."" Chris PartridgeBBC News This video can not be played Low-flying Ukrainian jet skims above trees Ukraine
is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied. Brits Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were all sentenced to death Thanks for joining us this afternoon - here's the latest on what's been happening in Ukraine: Russia defends death sentences for captured Britons  UK's defence secretary visits Ukraine  Cholera in Mariupol  How long will the war last?  Stay with us for the latest developments as they unfold. Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking to students across the UK in a live broadcast to several universities. The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our
history, our state, our identity, and to deny our existence. And as such to
tell the world that we never existed that we are an artificially created people
like a variety of some kind of plants or animals."" State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The
venue where Volodymyr Zelensky will be speaking to students at Coventry
University usually hosts cinema nights - but this evening it will be the
Ukrainian president's face on the big screen. Only 75 tickets were made available
for the event, and they were snapped up within hours. The first few
students have started arriving and there are a few Ukrainian flags draped on
the front row. Pavel Pimkin The president of the universityâs Ukraine Society is Pavel Pimkin, 20, whose male relatives are still in his home country. He says heâs feeling âhonoured and nervousâ about asking his nationâs president a question later. The address will also be shown at other British universities that have Ukrainian societies.

"Smoking age should rise, government report to sayA review is expected to suggest a gradual increase as part of the drive to eradicate smoking by 2030.","The age at which people can buy tobacco and cigarettes in England should be raised year by year so that eventually no-one can buy them, a review says. The call has been made in an independent report by ex-charity boss Javed Khan asked for by ministers. Under the plan the age of sale would rise from 18 by one year every year so the children of today will never be allowed to buy tobacco. The government has not agreed to the plan, but said it would consider it. However, sources said it was unlikely at this stage that ministers would agree to the move. Smoking rates have been falling since the 1970s. But there are still six million smokers in England - seven million across the UK. The government has said new ideas are needed to convince the final remaining groups to quit. It has set an ambition for England to be smoke free  - defined as less than 5% of the population smoking - by 2030. Achieving that will be a huge challenge, which is why Health Secretary Sajid Javid asked former Barnardo's chief executive Mr Khan to review the current rules and approaches. The proposal on raising the age of sale is similar to what is being introduced in New Zealand, where buying tobacco products will remain banned for anyone born after 2008. In England, the age limit was raised from 16 to 18 in 2007. Currently, one in nine 18 to 24-year-olds smokes, according to the Office for National Statistics. Mr Khan has also recommended: Setting aside an extra Â£125m for smoke free policies, with an extra Â£70 million per year ring-fenced for stop smoking services Promotion of vapes as an effective ""swap to stop"" tool to help people quit smoking Introducing a licensing system for shops to sell tobacco and banning supermarkets altogether Increasing duties on products and banning duty-free tobacco Ministers said they would consider the proposals as part of a wider package of measures they are looking to introduce this year to improve the health of the nation and tackle inequalities. The report has been produced for ministers in England. But Wales and Northern Ireland have already promised to work closely with counterparts in England over raising the legal age for smoking. The number of deaths caused by smoking is falling - but it remains the leading cause of preventable illness and premature death and is estimated to cause a quarter of all cancer deaths. In 2019, it accounted for 75,000 deaths in England - 15% of the total. Prof Jim McManus, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said if the government was to implement the recommendations they would ""make a huge difference to the nation's health"". And Deborah Arnott, of the charity Action on Smoking and Health, said given the higher rates of smoking and ill-health in more deprived areas only by making ""smoking obsolete"" could the government deliver on its levelling up mission. But Simon Clark, of smokers' lobby group Forest, criticised the recommendations. He said: ""Creeping prohibition won't stop young adults smoking. ""It will simply drive the sale of tobacco underground and consumers will buy cigarettes on the black market where no-one pays tax and products are completely unregulated.""

"Up your game on storms, Ofgem tells energy firmsThe watchdog says firms must do better to prevent power cuts and get people back on supply quicker.UK","Storm Arwen left millions of people without power last November Power firms must improve their storm response after Storm Arwen left more than one million UK homes without power last year, a report by the energy regulator says. The storm brought severe wind, rain and snow across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on 26 November. Three people diedas gusts of up to 100mph lashed the UK. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley told power firms to ""up your game"" and ""get ready for winter"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said companies were ""not well prepared"" for the storm. In future, they should maintain and invest more in the network, provide clearer communication to customers about when they will be reconnected, and be more imaginative about how they get people back on supply, he said. ""This is a really tough time for customers right now, this is a market where everyone is having a difficult time. ""Every energy company that is working in this country needs to be working on behalf of their customers and that means big changes for the networks."" Storm Arwen response report misses maintenance Thousands of homes without power after Storm Arwen Power firms' response to Storm Arwen 'unacceptable' Third person dies as storm brings 98mph gusts The storm - which saw nearly 4,000 people in north-east England and Scotland cut off from their energy supply for more than a week - caused widespread damage, with high winds snapping or uprooting trees that fell onto overhead lines. The north east of Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders were among the worst-hit areas. Ofgem said three network companies - Northern Powergrid, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks and Electricity North West - have agreed to pay Â£10.3m in ""redress payments"" to support communities affected by Storm Arwen and for upgrading networks to minimise the impact of severe weather events. This is in addition to almost Â£30m in compensation that has been paid by the firms. A lot of damage was caused by the wind, including part of a wall collapsing on a car in Sunderland Mr Brearley said the frequency of extreme weather events was only set to increase, so it was really important that industry, and those involved more widely, learned from Storm Arwen to better respond in future. Ofgem'sreport,externalfound: Emergency plans initiated before the storm hit were not adequate to deal with the significant damage that followed Some people were cut off for an ""unacceptable"" length of time, had poor and sometimes inaccurate communications from network firms, and it took too long for them to receive compensation payments Around 28% of customers were told they would be back on supply within 24 hours, but that did not happen, and some customers did not think that the support available was made clear to them One firm, Northern Powergrid, did not directly contact vulnerable customers enrolled on its Priority Services Register before Storm Arwen, which should have happened under its winter preparedness campaign Northern Powergrid also accepted the performance of its call centre ""fell below"" the expected standards during a severe storm, potentially breaching its licence Most power disruption was caused by severe winds and trees toppling onto power lines, with a link found between damaged network poles and their age, although this need further examination Its key recommendations included: Network companies should submit their winter preparedness plans to Ofgem so it can check customers will be supported during power disruptions Firms should ""stress test"" their websites and call centres to ensure they have sufficient capacity for severe weather events They should develop ""more robust mechanisms"" to ensure compensation payments are delivered swiftly and accurately to customers Energy firms should voluntarily lift the Â£700 cap on compensation for future storms as they did for Storm Arwen Overhead lines and the management of vegetation should be reviewed to boost network resilience for future storms Storm Arwen felled trees such as this one in the Lake District, in Cumbria Jamie Sunderland, who lives in Brigsteer, a village in South Cumbria, had no power for a week after Storm Arwen. With a toddler who could not be at home with no heating or lighting, he was forced to camp out with family and friends. They were initially told they would be reconnected in about 12 to 24 hours, but after three days, they took such assurances ""with a pinch of salt"". Reacting to Ofgem's report, he said its finding that customers received ""unacceptable"" service was correct. ""The problem was lack of information. If we'd been told more accurately that the power was going to be off for three or four days then we'd have been able to plan more accurately. ""For instance, we didn't think to empty the fridge or the freezer, thinking it was only for a short time. ""And all that food went to waste. If we'd realised it would have been longer we'd have taken more frozen stuff with us."" Simon Bainbridge, a farmer in Northumberland, was left without power for eight days and says having to use seven generators to keep the farm running left him out of pocket, even with the compensation he received. He argues there needs to be more investment and active checks of the network to protect power supplies for future events. This video can not be played Watch: Dr Lily Fulton-Humble on living without power with a seven-week-old baby and a sick toddler The Energy Networks Association, which represents the UK and Ireland's power firms, said six electricity firms planned to boost investment in network resilience measures from about Â£12bn to Â£14.5bn over the next five years. The extra cash would fund tree cutting, flood prevention and other measures to protect the UK's power network against future severe weather events, it added. The firms have submitted these details in their business plans for the next five years, subject to Ofgem's approval. Phil Jones, chief executive of Northern Powergrid,said,externalit had improved its handling of customer communications and estimated power restoration times, and had invested further in its website, telephone systems and power cut maps to cope with periods of high demand. Mr Jones said that by the end of the 2015- 2023 period, Northern Powergrid would have invested almost Â£1bn in maintaining its network. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said it was clear thousands of customers had been badly let down by electricity network companies and that a new action plan would improve preparedness for future storms. Power lines - including in Ballater, Aberdeenshire - were brought down by trees during Storm Arwen Additional reporting by Catherine Lee.

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities. It raises money for Unicef and this year the charity says some of the money raised will go towards helping those impacted by the war. ""This event is going to help a lot of people in Ukraine,"" he says, ""especially kids, we're going to create a lot of great programmes to improve a lot of things for kids.""

Two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun were captured by Russian troops while fighting for Ukraine. All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely."" Chris PartridgeBBC News This video can not be played Low-flying Ukrainian jet skims above trees Ukraine
is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied. Brits Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were all sentenced to death Thanks for joining us this afternoon - here's the latest on what's been happening in Ukraine: Russia defends death sentences for captured Britons  UK's defence secretary visits Ukraine  Cholera in Mariupol  How long will the war last?  Stay with us for the latest developments as they unfold. Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking to students across the UK in a live broadcast to several universities. The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our
history, our state, our identity, and to deny our existence. And as such to
tell the world that we never existed that we are an artificially created people
like a variety of some kind of plants or animals."" State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The
venue where Volodymyr Zelensky will be speaking to students at Coventry
University usually hosts cinema nights - but this evening it will be the
Ukrainian president's face on the big screen. Only 75 tickets were made available
for the event, and they were snapped up within hours. The first few
students have started arriving and there are a few Ukrainian flags draped on
the front row. Pavel Pimkin The president of the universityâs Ukraine Society is Pavel Pimkin, 20, whose male relatives are still in his home country. He says heâs feeling âhonoured and nervousâ about asking his nationâs president a question later. The address will also be shown at other British universities that have Ukrainian societies.

As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country.""

All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely.""

is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied.

The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our

State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The

"Thailand legalises cannabis growing and tradeThais can now grow cannabis for commerce, but the rules still ban recreational use.Asia","It's now legal to grow cannabis plants and buy marijuana-infused dishes in Thailand People in Thailand can now grow cannabis plants at home and sell the crop after the nation removed marijuana from its banned narcotics list. The nation is the first to advance such a move in South-East Asia, a region known for its stringent drug laws. Advocates say the easing effectively decriminalises marijuana, but personal use for non-medical reasons is still heavily discouraged by the government. Officials have also warned people against smoking in public. Smoking outside is viewed as a public nuisance and offenders risk fines and arrest, authorities have said. But the government is hoping that developing a local cannabis trade will boost agriculture and tourism. It's even giving away one million cannabis seedlings to citizens to encourage pick-up. ""It is an opportunity for people and the state to earn income from marijuana and hemp,"" said Anutin Charnvirakul, deputy prime minister and health minister, on his social media accounts last month. Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? âItâs either cannabis or dieâ He shared a photo on Facebook of a chicken dish cooked with cannabis, adding that anyone could sell the dish if they followed the rules -  the main one being that products must contain less than 0.2% of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the compound that gives users that ""high"" feeling. From Thursday, households will be able to cultivate up to six cannabis pot plants at home if they register with authorities, and companies can also farm the plant with a permit. Diners will also be able to order cannabis-infused dishes and drinks at restaurants. Restaurants will able to freely offer cannabis-infused menus Clinics across the country can also more freely offer cannabis as a treatment.Thailand was the first in Asia to legalise medicinal cannabis use in 2018. However, using the drug for personal use is still illegal. Officials have warned people against smoking in public, saying it's considered a public nuisance and offenders risked arrest. Under the plan the government says it also aims to release about 4,000 prisoners convicted of cannabis-related offences. Thailand, with its year-round tropical climate, has long had a history with cannabis which many locals commonly used in traditional medicines. A wider draft law on cannabis control is currently being considered in Thai parliament. Advocates believe that coming years could see a gradual relaxing on the rules governing use. So is it legal or isn't it? As Thailand's tourist economy recovers from its long Covid slumber, many visitors will be wondering whether the new liberal regime governing cannabis means they can light up a joint wherever and whenever they please. The answer from the government is no, you cannot smoke marijuana in public, and it is still illegal to sell or supply any extracts containing more than 0.2% of the main hallucinogenic compound THC. The official goal is for Thailand to get a head start on its neighbours in winning a large slice of the lucrative market for health treatments using cannabis derivatives, in particular the milder compound CBD. But there is another motive; to reducing overcrowding in some of the world's most overcrowded jails. Which means, in theory, with cultivation of the plant in any quantities now completely legalised, that the police are now unlikely to arrest people just for possession of marijuana. Already there are hundreds of businesses in Thailand, operating even before the new law, offering a whole range of marijuana products, like restaurants putting the leaves in Thai curries. It is hard to see how the authorities can regulate how much THC they contain. The government insists they are permitting production and consumption solely for medical, not recreational purposes, but in practice that line is already blurred. In a version of this story published on 9 June 2022 we wrote that recreational use was banned. This has been corrected to discouraged. Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK?

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk.

Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said.

"Teacher dead and pupils hurt as car hits Berlin crowdEvidence suggests the driver was a ""mentally ill person running amok"", a regional official says.","The car crashed into a store A teacher was killed and 14 schoolchildren were injured after a car hit a crowd on a busy street in the German capital, Berlin. The group was on a school trip to Berlin from the state of Hesse. A second teacher was seriously hurt. Police say the driver, a 29-year-old man, was arrested at the scene. Berlin Interior Affairs Minister Iris Spranger said evidence suggested the driver was a ""mentally ill person running amok"". The incident occurred shortly before 10:30 (08:30 GMT) in the heart of western Berlin, on one of its busiest shopping streets. The woman who died has been identified as a schoolteacher who was on a trip with a class of teenagers from the central state of Hesse. Berlin police say she died on the spot. ""There are seriously injured people among the more than a dozen injured,"" police spokesperson Thilo Cablitz said. Bad Arolsen Mayor Marko Lambion said a bus was on its way to pick up the children from Berlin. ""We're doing everything we can to bring them home,"" he said at the press conference. The driver has dual German and Armenian citizenship and lives in Berlin. Earlier reports that he had left a note in his car were denied by officials. Witnesses described seeing a silver Renault Clio veering into a crowd of people on the pavement near Berlin's busy KurfÃ¼rstendamm shopping avenue, before driving back on to the road and crashing into a shop window. A witness who would only be named as F Kacan said the driver had abandoned the car and had taken off running but ""we were able to stop him"", AFP news agency reports. The actor John Barrowman tweeted that he had been nearby when the incident took place and in a video posted from the scene said the car had repeatedly mounted the footpath before crashing into the storefront.

Barrowman told the BBC the car had careened through tables of people sitting outside having breakfast, before smashing into the storefront. ""It was just horrific"", he said. ""I saw somebody being resuscitated, I saw somebody being literally thrown onto a stretcher and put into an ambulance."" Some 130 emergency workers went to the scene and a body lay in the middle of the road, covered in blankets. It happened opposite Breitscheidplatz, where 12 people were killed in a terrorist attack in 2016 when a truck was deliberately driven into a crowd of people at a Christmas market. Berlin Mayor Franziska Giffey said it was too early to know if the area had been chosen deliberately, but she said: ""It's a situation where you think, for God's sake, not again!"" After the Christmas market attack in 2016, the militant group Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the killings which had been carried out by an unsuccessful asylum seeker. He was later shot dead by police in Italy.

Is the government meeting its new-homes target?,"The government aims to build 1.5 million more homes in the next five years, helped by planning reforms, the release of green belt land and the reintroduction of mandatory housing targets for local authorities. Under the motto ""get Britain building again"", the new Labour government has started laying out its plans for how it will deliver more housing. The target, set out in the 2024 Labour manifesto, is for ""1.5 million new homes over the next parliament"". The figure, which is for England, was unveiled by now Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his party conference in October 2023. ""We'll get shovels in the ground, cranes in the sky and build the next generation of Labour new towns,"" he said. In the manifesto, Labour also pledged to update the National Policy Planning Framework, restore mandatory housing targets, and deliver the biggest increase in social and affordable housebuilding in a generation. To achieve these, they'll prioritise building on previously-developed brownfield land first but, where necessary, also release currently-protected green belt land of lower quality. What is the 'grey belt' and how many homes could Labour build on it? The previous Conservative government had two housebuilding targets - 300,000 new homes a year and one million new homes over the whole Parliament. Figures for housebuilding in 2023-24 are yet to be released butannual figures,externalfor 2021-22 and 2022-23 were just short of 235,000 each year. This is in terms of ""net additional dwellings"" - a housebuilding measure that includes newbuild housing and properties converted for domestic use, while subtracting demolished homes. In 2019-20 that reached a peak of 248,590 but has fallen since, partly due to the pandemic. Labour say that the fall was also due to the scrapping of the mandatory housebuilding targets for local authorities in December 2022, so they reintroduced those in their first month in office. The government has confirmed to BBC Verify that its target is also in terms of net additional dwellings - not housing starts - although Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook had contradicted this on 31 July. ""We said we'd start 1.5 million new homes over the course of the parliament, over that 5 years. That's the target that you should measure us on,"" he told Sky News. In terms of the last government's target of building one million homes over the course of the Parliament, at the end of May theypublished a report,externalconfirming that the target had been met. The new government's 1.5 million homes target suggests that there will be an average of 300,000 net new homes each year - something that hasn't happened in the past. In the1960s,external, while there were more than 300,000 newly-built homes each year, there were also a lot of demolitions, largely due to slum clearances, which meant that net gains were at a similar level as now. Former miners' cottages being demolished in Carlin How in North Yorkshire in June 1978 Net housing supply decreased in the followingdecades,externaland hit a record low of just over 150,000 in the 1990s. The annual figure then rose until the 2007-08 financial crisis, when housebuilding stalled, before recovering in the mid-2010s. Housing charity Shelter has warned that the new government risks not meeting its target and not addressing the actual housing challenges unless it puts affordability at the heart of its building approach. ""Any new planning legislation must be focussed on delivering 90,000 social rent homes a year. Private developers will not deliver the target 1.5m homes by themselves - councils need the means to build genuinely affordable homes too,"" it said. Labour have expressed their commitment to social and affordable housebuilding. If they are to deliver the biggest increase in that in a generation, they need to build over 66,100 affordable homes each year, at least 51,500 of these for social rent, which wasachieved by,externalthe John Major 1992-97 Conservative government. One of the ways Labour plans to do that is by introducing golden rules for the way it releases low-quality green belt land. Any new development on such land will need to have at least 50% affordable homes - significantly more than the 10% requirement for new developments on brownfield land. Latestfigures on affordable-housing supply,externalshow 63,605 affordable homes were completed in England in 2022-23, an increase of 7% from the previous year. These homes are classified as having: affordable rent- properties rented by local authorities or other providers at up to 80% of local market rent London affordable rent- a separate classification, offered by the Greater London Authority, also capped at 80% social rent- affordable housing usually owned by local authorities and housing associations with rents set by a national rent formula intermediate rent- rent capped at 80% for key workers, sometimes as part of a scheme to help save up to buy a home shared ownership- purchaser buys between 25% and 75% of a home and pays rent on the remaining share affordable home ownership- homes offered at no more than 80% of local market values Just 9,500 of the affordable housing built that year, however, was for social rent, though there were over 24,500 new properties for affordable rent. For a home to be deemed affordable, it needs to cost less than five times workers' earnings. Across England & Wales, on average, that hasn't been the case since 2002. Homesin 2023,externalcost Â£285,000 on average - more than eight times average earnings of Â£35,000. This is a slight improvement in affordability from the year prior, though, as earnings have been growing faster than house prices. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?

Thailand legalises cannabis growing and trade,"It's now legal to grow cannabis plants and buy marijuana-infused dishes in Thailand People in Thailand can now grow cannabis plants at home and sell the crop after the nation removed marijuana from its banned narcotics list. The nation is the first to advance such a move in South-East Asia, a region known for its stringent drug laws. Advocates say the easing effectively decriminalises marijuana, but personal use for non-medical reasons is still heavily discouraged by the government. Officials have also warned people against smoking in public. Smoking outside is viewed as a public nuisance and offenders risk fines and arrest, authorities have said. But the government is hoping that developing a local cannabis trade will boost agriculture and tourism. It's even giving away one million cannabis seedlings to citizens to encourage pick-up. ""It is an opportunity for people and the state to earn income from marijuana and hemp,"" said Anutin Charnvirakul, deputy prime minister and health minister, on his social media accounts last month. Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? âItâs either cannabis or dieâ He shared a photo on Facebook of a chicken dish cooked with cannabis, adding that anyone could sell the dish if they followed the rules -  the main one being that products must contain less than 0.2% of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the compound that gives users that ""high"" feeling. From Thursday, households will be able to cultivate up to six cannabis pot plants at home if they register with authorities, and companies can also farm the plant with a permit. Diners will also be able to order cannabis-infused dishes and drinks at restaurants. Restaurants will able to freely offer cannabis-infused menus Clinics across the country can also more freely offer cannabis as a treatment.Thailand was the first in Asia to legalise medicinal cannabis use in 2018. However, using the drug for personal use is still illegal. Officials have warned people against smoking in public, saying it's considered a public nuisance and offenders risked arrest. Under the plan the government says it also aims to release about 4,000 prisoners convicted of cannabis-related offences. Thailand, with its year-round tropical climate, has long had a history with cannabis which many locals commonly used in traditional medicines. A wider draft law on cannabis control is currently being considered in Thai parliament. Advocates believe that coming years could see a gradual relaxing on the rules governing use. So is it legal or isn't it? As Thailand's tourist economy recovers from its long Covid slumber, many visitors will be wondering whether the new liberal regime governing cannabis means they can light up a joint wherever and whenever they please. The answer from the government is no, you cannot smoke marijuana in public, and it is still illegal to sell or supply any extracts containing more than 0.2% of the main hallucinogenic compound THC. The official goal is for Thailand to get a head start on its neighbours in winning a large slice of the lucrative market for health treatments using cannabis derivatives, in particular the milder compound CBD. But there is another motive; to reducing overcrowding in some of the world's most overcrowded jails. Which means, in theory, with cultivation of the plant in any quantities now completely legalised, that the police are now unlikely to arrest people just for possession of marijuana. Already there are hundreds of businesses in Thailand, operating even before the new law, offering a whole range of marijuana products, like restaurants putting the leaves in Thai curries. It is hard to see how the authorities can regulate how much THC they contain. The government insists they are permitting production and consumption solely for medical, not recreational purposes, but in practice that line is already blurred. In a version of this story published on 9 June 2022 we wrote that recreational use was banned. This has been corrected to discouraged. Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK?

Protester sentenced over BBC reporter pursuitNewsnight political editor Nicholas Watt was targeted during an anti-lockdown protest last summer.London,"Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt reporting from close to where he was abused An anti-lockdown protester has been sentenced after a BBC journalist was chased and called a traitor near Downing Street. Joseph Olswang, 39, was part of a group of people who shouted abuse at Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt on 14 June 2021. Olswang was given a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard he has bipolar disorder and was in the midst of a manic episode at the time. At a previous hearing Olswang, of Richmond-upon-Thames, pleaded guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment toMr Watt. He was found guilty of the same offence against PC Agnes Matvejeva. He had shouted at the Metropolitan Police officer for 35 minutes and called her a ""Brownshirt Nazi"" and ""evil scum"". Joseph Olswang was also ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work Olswang had been part of a group demonstrating against the government's extension of coronavirus restrictions in England by four weeks. Footage shared on social media showed demonstrators shouting abuse in the face of Mr Watt, who was wearing a BBC lanyard, as he tried to walk down the street behind a line of police officers. In mitigation, Olswang's barrister Eleanor De outlined his health issues, adding that the pandemic had ""created a perfect storm for a mental health crisis"". Police and demonstrators faced each other outside Downing Street District Judge Daniel Sternberg described what happened as ""disgraceful"". He told Olswang: ""You were part of a group of individuals who styled themselves as protesters but were doing very little more than harassing journalists and police officers - who were going about their business - and making their lives very unpleasant indeed."" Olswang was banned from Whitehall and Parliament Square for 18 months and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and undertake 20 days of rehabilitation. He was also told to pay Â£1,748 in compensation and costs. Five others who are accused of the same public order offence are due to stand trial later this month.
