Scientists say UK virus strategy 'risks lives'Hundreds of scientists write to the government calling for tougher measures to tackle Covid-19.Science & Environment,"Architects of the UK's nuanced approach: Sir Patrick Vallance (left) and Prof Chris Whitty (right) More than 200 scientists have written to the government urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19. In an open letter,external, the 229 specialists in disciplines ranging from mathematics to genetics - though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases - say the UK's current approach will put the NHS under additional stress and ""risk many more lives than necessary"". The signatories also criticised comments made by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, about managing the spread of the infection to make the population immune. The Department of Health said Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted. The scientists - all from UK universities - also questioned the government's view that people would become fed up with restrictions if they were imposed too soon. Their letter was published on the dayit was announced 10 more people in the UK have diedafter testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 21. Meanwhile the government'sscientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) advised,externalthat measures to protect vulnerable people - including household isolation - ""will need to be instituted soon"". Sir Patrick and the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, have said they intend to publish the computer models on which their strategy is based. UK virus measures will have the 'biggest impact' Why is the UK not shutting schools like other countries? Three reasons why the UK might not follow Italy The UK's approach to coping with the coronavirus pandemic has been in stark contrast to other countries. The whole ofItaly has been on lockdown since Tuesday, while Poland is set to close its borders for two weeks. On Saturday the French government ordered the closure of all non-essential public locations from midnight (23:00 GMT Saturday). And Spain has declared a 15-day national lockdown on Monday to battle the virus, In the open letter the group of scientists argue that stronger ""social distancing measures"" would ""dramatically"" slow the rate of growth of the disease in the UK, and would spare ""thousands of lives"". The group, specialising in a range of disciplines, ranging from mathematics to genetics said the current measures are ""insufficient"" and ""additional and more restrictive measures should be taken immediately"", as is happening in other countries. On Friday, Sir Patrick suggestedmanaging the spread of the disease so that the population gains some immunity to the disease was a part of the government strategy. This idea, known as ""herd immunity"", means at-risk individuals are protected from infection because they are surrounded by people who are resistant to the disease. EASY STEPS:What should I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Rough estimates indicate that herd immunity to Covid-19 would be reached when approximately 60% of the population has had the disease. But in the open letter, the scientists said: ""Going for 'herd immunity' at this point does not seem a viable option."" The major downside of herd immunity, according to Birmingham University's Prof Willem van Schaik, is that this will mean that in the UK alone at least 36 million people will need to be infected and recover. ""It is almost impossible to predict what that will mean in terms of human costs, but we are conservatively looking at tens of thousands of deaths, and possibly at hundreds of thousands of deaths,"" he said. ""The only way to make this work would be to spread out these millions of cases over a relatively long period of time so that the NHS does not get overwhelmed."" This video can not be played Willem van Schaik, professor of microbiology and infection at the University of Birmingham, was one of the signatories Prof van Schaik noted that the UK is the only country in Europe that is following what he described as its ""laissez-faire attitude to the virus"". But a Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said that Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted. ""Herd immunity is not part of our action plan, but is a natural by-product of an epidemic. Our aims are to save lives, protect the most vulnerable, and relieve pressure on our NHS,"" he said. ""We have now moved out of the contain phase and into delay, and we have experts working round the clock. Every measure that we have or will introduce will be based on the best scientific evidence. ""Our awareness of the likely levels of immunity in the country over the coming months will ensure our planning and response is as accurate and effective as possible."" In a separate letter to the government,external, more than 200 behavioural scientists have questioned the government's argument that starting tougher measures too soon would lead to people not sticking to them just at the point that the epidemic is at its height. ""While we fully support an evidence-based approach to policy that draws on behavioural science, we are not convinced that enough is known about 'behavioural fatigue' or to what extent these insights apply to the current exceptional circumstances,"" the letter said. ""Such evidence is necessary if we are to base a high-risk public health strategy on it."" ""In fact, it seems likely that even those essential behaviour changes that are presently required (e.g., handwashing) will receive far greater uptake the more urgent the situation is perceived to be. Carrying on as normal for as long as possible undercuts that urgency,"" it added. The scientists said ""radical behaviour change"" could have a ""much better"" effect and could ""save very large numbers of lives"". ""Experience in China and South Korea is sufficiently encouraging to suggest that this possibility should at least be attempted,"" it added. The second letter called on the government to reconsider its stance on ""behavioural fatigue"" and to share the evidence on which it based this stance.

Join us tomorrow for further news as it happens, and analysis and reporting from our correspondents on the ground. You can read more on the developing story ofFrance's sweeping new restrictionshere. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has ordered the closure of all non-essential public locations from midnight (23:00 GMT Saturday) in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The measure applies to restaurants, cafes, cinemas and nightclubs, as well as ""non-essential"" businesses. Mr Philippe also called on French people to reduce their travel, especially between towns. Nine doctors and
nurses from China who worked on the frontline of the first coronavirus outbreak
in Wuhan visited the Italian capital Rome on Saturday. They brought supplies, and shared their experiences of tackling the virus at a hospital in the Italian capital which specialises in
infectious diseases. Speaking to
journalists outside the Spallanzani hospital, they said that they believed the
Italian doctors they had met in Rome were doing a very good job, and that the
measures the Italian government had taken across the country met the
international standard required. They said that
in China, they had learned that detecting infection early and quarantining
early was very important in bringing the virus under control. They also said
that releasing information to the media regularly was important for
transparency. Yemen's government says it is suspending all flights to and from
airports under its control for two weeks from 18 March. Prime Minister Maeen
Abdulmalik Saeed's office said there would be an exemption for flights for
humanitarian purposes. The main airports his government controls are Aden, Sayoun and Mukalla. Earlier on Saturday, Houthi rebels said they were closing the capital Sanaa's airport. It means United Nations flights can no longer fly into Sanaa. All other flights to Sanaa had already been banned by the Saudi-led military coalition that is backing the government against the Houthis. France now has 4,499 confirmed cases, up from 3,661 on Friday, officials say. Some 91 people have died in the country after getting the virus, up from 79 on Friday. There are now 189 coronavirus cases in the Czech Republic - a rise of 39 since the morning. Neighbouring Slovakia is reporting 44 positive cases. 
Both countries have introduced draconian measures to slow the spread of the virus. The authorities say the measures will be tightened even further if the situation deteriorates. Meanwhile, Slovenian TV is reporting the first coronavirus death in the country. The international beauty brand says it is stopping demonstrations of make-up and other products, and will no longer supplying tester pots for customers to try out goods. Trying out make-up products is seen as a core part of the consumer's experience. The company wants to minimise skin-to-skin contact in stores, it said in an email to customers. ""At the Body Shop our store teams always follow strict hygiene protocols. We have reinforced these in line with the latest World Health Organization guidelines,"" it said. Earlier in the week MAC Cosmestics introduced a ""no-touch"" policy at its counters. Ireland's deputy prime minister says the coronavirus is going to change the way in which everyone lives â and that hand washing can no longer be seen as ""a luxury"" if vulnerable people are to be protected. Simon Coveney was speaking after a meeting between senior ministers from the Irish government and the Northern Ireland Executive.

The country reported its second death from coronavirus on Saturday, with 907 confirmed cases. The government is in talks with Norwegian Air regarding the airlifting of medical equipment from China. Several European countries have reported steep rises in infections and deaths in recent days, andthe continent has become the new ""epicentre"" of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization. Governments are taking emergency measures to curb the outbreak, including school closures, travel bans and economic stimulus packages to protect jobs. If you're just joining us, here's a recap of some of the biggest developments today: The official number of confirmed
coronavirus cases in South Africa has rise to 38, up from 24
on Friday. Elsewhere on the continent, more than 20 countries have been affected by the outbreak. Egypt has the most reported infections - currently 93 - followed by its northern neighbours Algeria and Tunisia. As well as confirming that non-Americans will no longer be able to travel to the US from the UK and Ireland, President Donald Trump also announced some significant new measures in the US effort to tackle the pandemic. Here are the highlights from his news conference:   This video can not be played Coronavirus: US to suspend all UK and Ireland travel The ban on travel to the US from UK and Ireland will begin at 00:00 Eastern time on Tuesday (04:00 GMT), US Vice-President Mike Pence has confirmed. He said US citizens and US legal residents would still be able to return to the US from those countries after the ban came into effect. They would be ""funnelled through specific airports"" and told to self-quarantine, he said. The ban on travel to the US from many European countries is to be extended to the UK and Ireland following the rise in coronavirus cases there, President Trump appeared to confirm. He said the measure was ""going to be announced"". Earlier US media reported that the move was imminent. President Donald Trump has said he took a test for the new coronavirus on Friday night. He expects the results in the next one to two days, he told journalists at the White House.

the past few days, since President Donald Trump banned visitors from Europe's
Schengen area and announced a national emergency. Masks and hand sanitisers have been missing from shelves for weeks
- now pharmacies have started putting up signs outside the shop doors,
pre-emptively warning people they are out of stock. Even sanitising wipes and
thermometers are limited to two or four per customer - and appear to be sold
out on most days. People have also been stocking up on food in anticipation of the
need to self-isolate or work from home. At one local supermarket, the check out
queue was so long it wound the entire way around the store - all the way to the
front of the shop, and then back to near the cashiers - with customers waiting
about 20 minutes before they could pay for their groceries. I asked the cashier if it was normally this busy on a Saturday
morning. She replied with a resigned smile: ""It's virus busy.""

Minecraft âloopholeâ library of banned journalismHow the popular video game Minecraft is being used as a way for journalism to beat global censors.,"Players gather around a book to read some of the censored material It started out as a project in an online forum and turned into the best-selling video game of all time, but now Minecraft is being used for something even its creator would not have dreamt of. The iconic game based around placing Lego-like blocks with more than 145 million players each month has been turned into a hub of free speech. A virtual library has been meticulously created to host articles written by journalists which were censored online. Work by Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist killed by Saudi agents in 2018, can be read among the plethora of books in the library. Minecraft has declined to comment. The library viewed from the outside The project was created by non-profit organisation Reporters Without Borders, which seeks to defend the freedom of information worldwide, and the Minecraft library itself was built by design studio Blockworks. Christian Mihr, executive director of Reporters Without Borders Germany, told the BBC that Minecraft was good for the project as he believes it is not seen as a threat by governments which censor their media. ""We chose Minecraft because of its reach,"" he said. ""It is available in every country. The game is not censored like some other games which are under suspicion of being political. ""There are big communities in each featured country, that's why the idea came up - it is a loophole for censorship."" He said the authors were chosen to represent the countries where press was censored, so that people from those communities would be able to access their work. But he clarified that permissions were sought before republishing in the library. ""We didn't put any content in the library without the approval of respective authors themselves - if they are alive. ""In the case of Jamal Khashoggi we spoke to family members - in respect of people who have been killed, and the safety of their families."" A book explains who Jamal Khashoggi was and why his articles are important Nick Feamster, Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago, told the BBC that the library could be effective at beating the censors, but he was concerned about how governments may respond. ""It's an interesting idea,"" he said, ""But I think there are still some issues. Governments will know about this - the articles are going across the internet. It's not going to be foolproof against a determined adversary. He said that the strength of the library came from its use of entanglement - mixing up the censored material with the video game in the eyes of the censors. ""By entangling these two things you force them to share content,"" he said. ""You can't censor this one without the other."" Meanwhile Helmi Noman, a Research Affiliate of the Berkman Klein Centre for Internet & Society, said he felt the library would be likely to have a limited audience. ""The censored content is dynamic, diverse and distributed,"" he said, adding that in his research ""the users prefer approaches that don't pre-select and compartmentalise content in certain spaces online. ""Any approach that doesn't create a seamless and secure browsing experience of the entire web, social media and direct messaging apps will likely have limited success."" Players are able to quickly transport around the library to view its diverse content The server, which holds a maximum of 100 players at once, was regularly inaccessible due to how many players were trying to log on at once. Despite this cap on simultaneous users, it has been visited by 3,889 players from 75 different countries and has been downloaded over 7,000 times. After two hours of trying, the BBC managed to visit the virtual library and asked its patrons what they thought about it. SoulfulGenie said they thought ""it needs more books and a new section on North Korea"" and another user called it ""ingenious in many ways"", adding that, as the library may be downloaded and reuploaded by other users, ""it is easy to replicate and therefore hard to kill"". Meanwhile, other players focused on the appearance of the library, with ReduxPL saying it ""looks incredible indeed"". The Minecraft library and an influence - the unbuilt design for a French National Library by Etienne-Louis Boullee The design of the library by Blockworks was no small feat, taking a team of 24 people from 16 different countries around 250 hours to construct. James Delaney, Managing Director of the design company, told the BBC that the aim was to create a classical design which was ""on the border of fantasy"". ""It is kind of plausible as a real building,"" he said, ""but is pushing the limits of what is possible. ""We went for a design in the neoclassical style. It's similar to things like the British Museum and public libraries in New York."" Outside of these influences, he said Minecraft was improvisational at its core, so the builders were not restricted to set designs. ""With many people working on the same project,"" he said, ""people see each others' work and have to respond in real time. So it is a very reactive way of working, and that changes the look.

Â£320m coronavirus rescue package for business,"Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has announced a Â£320m rescue package for businesses. The cash is being made available to support business through the Covid-19 outbreak. She also revealed that a Â£50m hardship fund will be made available to people who lose their jobs as a result of a downturn caused by the virus. The action has been taken to try to limit the impact of the pandemic on Scotland's economy. The first Scots fatality was confirmed on Friday after an elderly patient with underlying health issues died in the NHS Lothian area. During the 2020-21 financial year, business will be boosted with: 75% rates relief for retail, hospitality and leisure sectors with a rateable value of less than Â£69,000 from 1 April 2020 Â£80m fund to provide grants of at least Â£3,000 to small businesses in sectors facing the worst economic impact of Covid-19 1.6% rates relief for all properties across Scotland, effectively reversing the planned below inflation uplift in the poundage from 1 April 2020 Fixed rates relief of up to Â£5,000 for all pubs with a rateable value of less than Â£100,000 from 1 April 2020 Finance secretary Kate Forbes has offered Â£320m to help business The finance secretary will also write to all local authorities urging them to respond positively to requests from ratepayers for payment deferrals for a fixed period. Ms Forbes said: ""Covid-19 will have challenging implications for businesses and the economy over the coming weeks and months. ""As well as following the latest health and travel advice, it's also crucial we consider the latest economic analysis and listen carefully to what the business community is telling us. We know that the tourism and hospitality sectors are facing immediate pressure, which is why we have directed support to them in particular."" She said that all ratepayers would benefit from a relief that effectively reversed the planned inflationary uplift that was due to come into effect in April. She also said the Scottish government was preparing a Â£50m fund for people who lose their jobs as a result of measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. This makes up the rest of the Â£360m-plus grant given by the Treasury in last week's budget. She told BBC News: ""Â£50m will go to a hardship fund which will be announced shortly. That will look at, for example, people who are self- employed or people who have lost their jobs. ""We have allocated every consequential penny we have received towards business support but I would believe and hope that further support comes to help us meet business needs."" David Lonsdale - Scottish Retail Consortium ""In dealing with this unprecedented scenario the Scottish government has listened to business and has taken steps which should improve cashflow and confidence for those impacted by the virus. These are the right decisions for the present, albeit both the UK and Scottish government may have to take further steps as this very unpredictable and unprecedented situation evolves."" Andrew McRae - Federation of Small Businesses Scotland ""While the shape of this help is slightly different to the support being offered to businesses south of the border, it is a substantial attempt by ministers in Edinburgh to help perfectly sound businesses facing severe short-term cashflow problems. Time is of the essence, so this new money must be easy to access. This is no time for bureaucratic hold-ups. Further, should this initial package of measures prove insufficient, we must not hesitate in delivering a further expansion."" Liz Cameron - Scottish Chambers of Commerce ""The Scottish government have outlined an initial number of measures that will be welcomed by businesses - particularly in the most affected sectors such as retail, hospitality and tourism - following on from the measures introduced in the UK Budget earlier this week. This is a positive initial response by the Scottish Government, but the situation needs to be reviewed on a daily basis to identify what additional support is required, particularly around how business can retain employees and the cost of businesses changing their operating models, for example to flexible working practises. Tracy Black - CBI Scotland ""These are substantive steps from the Scottish government that will be hugely welcomed by business. Sector-specific support is vital in hospitality, leisure and retail.  Freezing rates and introducing direct grants are also important elements - and more may be needed, as knock-on effects are emerging daily in sectors and businesses of all sizes. So the scale of response must keep pace with the impact. Agility is essential."" Gail Macgregor - Cosla ""We recognise that the Scottish government is taking action to mitigate the impacts of coronavirus and the measures announced today will help local businesses and communities. Cosla will continue to work closely with the Scottish government and other agencies to ensure our businesses and communities across Scotland are supported during this exceptionally challenging period.""

'School closures will last for at least 16 weeks',"Five new coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Northern Ireland, bringing the total up to 34 When schools shut in Northern Ireland over coronavirus it will be for at least 16 weeks, Arlene Foster has said. The first minister was speaking after a meeting between senior ministers from the NI Executive and Irish government. Two primary schools have said they will close voluntarily, the first primary schools in NI to do so. The two are Lurgan Model Primary School, in County Armagh, and St Scire's in Trillick, County Tyrone. Lurgan Model said it would close for the week, while St Scire's will close on Monday ahead of planned St Patrick's closures on Tuesday and Wednesday. Five new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in NI while a second person has died in the Republic of Ireland. There have been 129 confirmed cases in the Republic of Ireland whilecoronavirus deaths have doubled in 24 hours in the UK. The first and deputy first ministers met counterparts include Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar in Armagh on Saturday. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Speaking after the meeting, Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill were both still split over the issue of school closures. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill repeated her call for them to be shut immediately, in line with the Republic of Ireland. Meanwhile,in a statement on social media,external, Lurgan Model Primary School said it remain closed all this week. The school said it was already due to be shut on Monday and Tuesday due to St Patrick's Day and will bring planned closures due for May forward to this week. It is the first school in Northern Ireland to close voluntarily over the outbreak. The school said it ""will not officially reopen until Monday, 23 March"" but will ""monitor the situation of this incoming week"". St Scire's, in Trillick, said the school would stay closed on Monday ahead of planned closures on Tuesday and Wednesday for St Patrick's Day. It added that the situation will be reviewed prior to Thursday. Speaking after the meeting in Armagh, Mrs Foster said that schools will close ""when we are advised on the medical evidence"". ""Children will be at home for quite a considerable period of time, given that when we do close the schools they will be closed for at least 16 weeks. ""Then of course you are into the summer period, so they will be off school for a very long time."" Ms O'Neill said all parties in the executive agreed schools would have to close but it was a matter of timing. Michelle O'Neill repeated her call for schools to close She said: ""In my opinion schools should close now. I think we need to be consistent across this island ""I think the fact that you can have two schools a mile apart and one school's open and one school's closed that's a very confusing picture and a very confusing message for the public."" Ms O'Neillfirst called for schools to close immediately on Friday, a day after she, along with First Minister Arlene Foster, said the executive did not believe the situation had reached that stage. On Saturday, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also called for schools to close, after Archibishop Eamon Martin, the leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland,wrote to NI's education minister to ask him to consider closures. However, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said the main differences between the two governments was over timing. He said the Northern Ireland Executive and Irish government shared the same objective in slowing the advance of coronavirus but it was inevitable there would be differences in how they approached it. He added: ""But the differences that exist are mostly around timing. ""What there isn't any difference about is our common objective, which is to slow down this virus in its tracks and push it back as much as possible and limit the harm to human health and human life."" Mrs Foster said both governments had ""very coherent messages"". Mr Varadkar also explained that the short notice of Irish school closures given to counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK was ""not how we intended it to happen"". ""I absolutely guarantee you I did not intend to make that announcement or speak to Irish people on the steps of Blair House in Washington DC,"" he said. ""We had a plan in place to move to delay phase. We had to bring that forward almost overnight."" This video can not be played Washing hands no longer ""a luxury"" â Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney He added that Irish officials gave ""as many people a heads up as we could, including authorities here in Northern Ireland"" but it was also ""important that the Irish people should hear the news first from me and from the government"". ""That's why the notice that we gave people here and elsewhere was so short but there was no perfect way of doing this unfortunately and I appreciate the understanding of the first minister and deputy first minister,"" he added. Health Minister Robin Swann, TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney and Irish Health Minister Simon Harris also attended the meeting. Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald - who was not at the meeting - said the UK's response to coronavirus ""should be rejected"" and is ""totally unacceptable in the north of Ireland"".

Catholic churches preparing to suspend Mass,"Roman Catholic churches in England are ""preparing for a time"" when the celebration of Mass may have to ""come to an end"", the Catholic leader in England and Wales has said. Catholics have an obligation to go to Mass every Sunday. Butlarge gatherings could be bannedin the UK from as early as next weekend, as the coronavirus continues to spread. The Church of England is also following these procedures, as well as refraining from passing collection plates around. The Muslim Council of Britain has urged mosques, madrasas and Muslim community centres to follow the governments hygiene practices. It also urged mosques to have contingency plans in place for Ramadan - which begins in the second half of April - as it may have to suspend mass gatherings. The United Synagogue asked its members to refrain from shaking hands and kissing religious artefacts, such as communal siddurim, which is a Jewish prayer book. Cardinal Vincent Nichols said Catholic churches were ""adjusting"" to minimise the spread of infection. He said: ""We are preparing for a time when the churches should not be used to gather big numbers of people together, so we might come to an end of the celebration of Mass or other services."" Many churches have already brought in measures to avoid exposing congregations to the virus. In some churches, holy water has been removed from the entrances, the sign of peace - normally a handshake - has been replaced by bowing and churchgoers can no longer drink wine from shared chalices. Church ministers are also washing their hands before distributing communion. Speaking to BBC's Radio 4's Today programme, Cardinal Vincent Nichols said: ""These are not the essential parts of mass,"" adding that he hoped everyone will be ""cooperative and calm"". EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic However, he said: ""The presence of the church and the space that it offers will be very important in the coming months,"" adding that some churches might also move to live-stream services. ""Even if the priest is there with one helper, we can stream them and people can join in from home and gather if they wish on a Sunday to follow the mass and say their prayers together,"" he said. He added that, in his view, churches would ""always remain open"" because they were ""places where  people can go, they can sit quietly, they can pray there's, plenty of space in them and there are no health risks.""

Minecraft âloopholeâ library of banned journalism,"Players gather around a book to read some of the censored material It started out as a project in an online forum and turned into the best-selling video game of all time, but now Minecraft is being used for something even its creator would not have dreamt of. The iconic game based around placing Lego-like blocks with more than 145 million players each month has been turned into a hub of free speech. A virtual library has been meticulously created to host articles written by journalists which were censored online. Work by Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist killed by Saudi agents in 2018, can be read among the plethora of books in the library. Minecraft has declined to comment. The library viewed from the outside The project was created by non-profit organisation Reporters Without Borders, which seeks to defend the freedom of information worldwide, and the Minecraft library itself was built by design studio Blockworks. Christian Mihr, executive director of Reporters Without Borders Germany, told the BBC that Minecraft was good for the project as he believes it is not seen as a threat by governments which censor their media. ""We chose Minecraft because of its reach,"" he said. ""It is available in every country. The game is not censored like some other games which are under suspicion of being political. ""There are big communities in each featured country, that's why the idea came up - it is a loophole for censorship."" He said the authors were chosen to represent the countries where press was censored, so that people from those communities would be able to access their work. But he clarified that permissions were sought before republishing in the library. ""We didn't put any content in the library without the approval of respective authors themselves - if they are alive. ""In the case of Jamal Khashoggi we spoke to family members - in respect of people who have been killed, and the safety of their families.""

UK flights to virus-hit Spain turn around mid-air,"Jet2 planes heading to Spain were turned around in mid-air earlier as the airline cancelled all flights to the mainland, Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands because of coronavirus. Confirmed cases in Spain have risen to 6,046and thousands of people have been placed in lockdown. The country's death toll has reached 191 and it is set to enter a two-week state of emergency. Jet2 said the health and safety of its customers was its top priority. The airline flies to destinations including Alicante, Malaga and Lanzarote from nine UK airports. It said it decided to suspend all holidays and flights to all of Spain for at least a week after authorities there ordered bars, restaurants, shops and activities to close. Jet2 has started sending empty planes out to the 14 Spanish destinations it operates to and will run its normal schedule of return flights to the UK for the coming week to bring customers home. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic ""We know these local measures will have a significant impact on our customers' holidays, which is why we have taken this decision,"" an spokesperson for the airline added. ""This is a fast-moving and complex situation and we are reviewing our programme as a matter of urgency, so that we can fly customers back to the UK."" Trump's virus travel ban on Europe comes into force Earlier, flight tracking information showed at least five Jet2 planes travelling to Spain turning around to return to the UK.

Dale Dixon, 26, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, was due to fly from Alicante to East Midlands Airport at 11:45 GMT. He said there was a feeling of ""deflation"" at the airport, saying: ""It is overcrowded here. There are children just lying around bored and bags scattered all over the place. People are definitely panicking."" Holidaymaker Mark Harrison, whose flight home to Manchester was scheduled for this evening, said: ""Jet2 said not to contact them so we are just waiting to hear from them. All we've seen is that which is on social media."" Christine Jones from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was expecting to fly out on a Jet2 plane to Tenerife with her husband at 14:20 GMT. She said: ""The last message we received last night from the company said they were looking forward to seeing us. We are fully ready and packed and are surrounded by our suitcases but we aren't going anywhere now. I'm just sat here looking at suitcases."" Clive Sloman, 55, from Chelmsford, Essex, was at Tenerife Airport waiting for his flight to London Stansted. He praised Jet2's ""helpful"" staff, but said he did not know when his flight, which was scheduled to depart at 14:30 GMT, would leave. ""We've just been turned away from security because we can't go through security without a flight to go on, but there are no flights yet,"" Mr Sloman said. Easyjet said flights between the UK and Spain were currently ""unaffected"" - but that there was some disruption to those flights because of a shortage of air traffic controllers in Spain. Jet2 passengers waited on the runway to hear if their flight from Alicante to Stansted would take off On Friday, British Airways warned it would need to ground flights ""like never before"" and lay off staff in response to the coronavirus. Ryanair told staff they might be forced to take leave from Monday. Travel company Tui has cancelled all holidays in Spain which were due to start between 14 and 16 March.

"Spain set to declare coronavirus lockdownThe government in Madrid is poised to take emergency action after 191 deaths and 6,046 infections.Europe","Shops have been shutting in Barcelona and other Spanish cities The Spanish government is poised to declare a 15-day national lockdown on Monday to battle coronavirus. Under the decree being finalised, people would be allowed out only for emergencies, to buy food, or for work. With 191 deaths and 6,046 infections, Spain is the worst-hit country in Europe after Italy, which declared a nationwide lockdown on Monday. The US is extending its European travel ban to the UK and the Republic of Ireland from Monday. President Donald Trump confirmed the news in answer to a reporter's question at the White House. On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) saidEurope was now the ""epicentre"" of the pandemic. Italy has seen 1,266 deaths and 17,660 infections. Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to use aggressive measures, community mobilisation and social distancing to save lives.

All public transport would be cut back with airline, train, bus and boat operators told they need to cut their services by at least half and that any plane, train, bus or other means of transport can only be a third full, Reuters news agency reports. The interior ministry would control all police forces, including those at local and regional level. Adding to the drama, Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias broke his own quarantine - which he went into after coming into contact with an infected colleague - to attend Saturday's talks. It had not been possible for Mr Iglesias, who did not test positive for the virus, to attend remotely and his presence was agreed with the government after sanitary measures were taken, government sources told Efe news agency. Two other ministers who are ill with coronavirus, Irene Montero and Carolina Darias, did not attend. This will be the second state of emergency in the country since the transition to democracy began in 1975, the first being a 2010 air traffic controllers' strike. Some measures have already been enforced at local level. The authorities in Madrid and its surrounding area have ordered the closure of most bars, restaurants and shops.

"Virus an 'existential threat' to cafe and bar jobsUK Hospitality says well-known cafe, dining and pub chains could fold because of the coronavirus.Business","Restaurant, pub and cafe chains employ tens of thousands of people across the UK Hotel, cafe and dining chains will fail and jobs will go if the government does not do more to help the industry, a trade group has warned the chancellor. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, lobby group UK Hospitality said coronavirus was an ""existential threat"" to the sector. It wants to change laws to allow temporary staff redundancies. UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls said, without help, ""a significant number"" of jobs could disappear by May. In the letter, seen by the BBC, Ms Nicholls suggested broader support for the sector such as introducing measures ""to permit temporary staff redundancies where demand falls substantially - with Universal Credit covering wage costs"". Other government policies UK Hospitality would like to see include a business rates holiday for all businesses regardless of size, all payments to HMRC suspended for three months and Government Statutory Sick Pay payments to all hospitality businesses. Ms Nicholls told the BBC that even some of the largest hotel chains, pub chains and casual dining brands all ""run the risk of not existing going forward"", such is the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. ""This is business-critical - these are cash businesses, put simply, if you don't have people coming through the door, you will run out of cash very quickly. ""So we are talking about intervention that is needed next week to make sure that in six to eight weeks these businesses continue to trade, and if we don't get that support, by May, we will be facing business failures and a significant number of jobs at risk."" ""This is affecting hospitality companies of all sizes and shapes...it's high street businesses that are seeing footfall decline, so your pubs, bars, your cafes where you pop in for a sandwich, but also it's the larger companies across the sector - they are the firms that employing the most people,"" she added. Chancellor Rishi Sunak offered business rates relief for some small businesses in this week's Budget In Mr Sunak's first Budget this week, business rates relief was granted to companies with a rateable value of less than Â£51,000, which he said could save a business up to Â£25,000. The measure applies to firms including shops, cinemas, restaurants and hotels. However, Ms Nicholl said that the because many of the biggest employers in the hospitality industry operate from the largest premises on the UK high street, they will not benefit from the new business rate support. The financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the hospitality sector is being shouldered by businesses large and small, but one hotel manager said businesses of his size were ignored by the chancellor and are teetering on the brink. Mark Cotman is the group operations director at York House hotel in Eastbourne, and said his bookings are down 60% and he expects them to get worse. ""We've got the money to carry on for maybe two or three months, and then we're out of money. Then what do we do about paying staff, paying VAT, paying the veg man, the butcher?â¦We will run out of money, Mr Cotman said. Mark Cotman says his hotel is usually full at weekends, but is now running at only 40% occupancy ""The larger businesses like ours have received no assistance in the budget. ""We've been offered a facility of maybe applying for loan but of course that's got to be paid back. If we're not taking any money, how can we pay the loan back?"" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""On Wednesday, the chancellor announced, in total, a Â£30bn fiscal stimulus to support British people, jobs and businesses through this moment. ""Because of our extension of business rate relief, including to the hospitality and leisure sectors, around 900,000 properties, 45% of those in England, won't pay any business rates in 20/21. ""HMRC will also help businesses and self-employed individuals experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to Covid-19.""

Confirmed cases in Spain have risen to 6,046and thousands of people have been placed in lockdown. The country's death toll has reached 191 and it is set to enter a two-week state of emergency. Jet2 said the health and safety of its customers was its top priority. The airline flies to destinations including Alicante, Malaga and Lanzarote from nine UK airports. It said it decided to suspend all holidays and flights to all of Spain for at least a week after authorities there ordered bars, restaurants, shops and activities to close. Jet2 has started sending empty planes out to the 14 Spanish destinations it operates to and will run its normal schedule of return flights to the UK for the coming week to bring customers home.

IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic ""We know these local measures will have a significant impact on our customers' holidays, which is why we have taken this decision,"" an spokesperson for the airline added. ""This is a fast-moving and complex situation and we are reviewing our programme as a matter of urgency, so that we can fly customers back to the UK.""

Dale Dixon, 26, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, was due to fly from Alicante to East Midlands Airport at 11:45 GMT. He said there was a feeling of ""deflation"" at the airport, saying: ""It is overcrowded here. There are children just lying around bored and bags scattered all over the place. People are definitely panicking."" Holidaymaker Mark Harrison, whose flight home to Manchester was scheduled for this evening, said: ""Jet2 said not to contact them so we are just waiting to hear from them. All we've seen is that which is on social media."" Christine Jones from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was expecting to fly out on a Jet2 plane to Tenerife with her husband at 14:20 GMT. She said: ""The last message we received last night from the company said they were looking forward to seeing us. We are fully ready and packed and are surrounded by our suitcases but we aren't going anywhere now. I'm just sat here looking at suitcases."" Clive Sloman, 55, from Chelmsford, Essex, was at Tenerife Airport waiting for his flight to London Stansted. He praised Jet2's ""helpful"" staff, but said he did not know when his flight, which was scheduled to depart at 14:30 GMT, would leave. ""We've just been turned away from security because we can't go through security without a flight to go on, but there are no flights yet,"" Mr Sloman said. Easyjet said flights between the UK and Spain were currently ""unaffected"" - but that there was some disruption to those flights because of a shortage of air traffic controllers in Spain. Jet2 passengers waited on the runway to hear if their flight from Alicante to Stansted would take off On Friday, British Airways warned it would need to ground flights ""like never before"" and lay off staff in response to the coronavirus. Ryanair told staff they might be forced to take leave from Monday. Travel company Tui has cancelled all holidays in Spain which were due to start between 14 and 16 March.

"NI energy scheme failure 'not due to corruption'The RHI Inquiry report finds the botched energy scheme was a ""project too far"" for the NI Executive.Northern IrelandAs it happened: RHI Inquiry report publicationReaction and analysis to the publication of Sir Patrick Coghlin's report into the RHI inquiry.Northern IrelandShut NI schools over virus, urges Catholic primateThe leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland asks Stormont education minister to consider closures.Northern Ireland","The RHI scheme paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating Corrupt or malicious activity was not the cause of what went wrong with Northern Ireland's failed energy scheme. Thefindings into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI),externalscheme were published on Friday. It found the scheme was a ""project too far"" for the NI Executive and ""should never have been adopted"". The scheme, which opened in 2012, paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating. The 656-page report said that while there was ""unacceptable"" behaviour by some officials, ministers and special advisers, what went wrong was a ""compounding of errors and omissions over time and a failure of attention"". Set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, the RHI closed to new entrants in 2016 amid concerns about the potential cost. Those boilers used wood pellets, but the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income. It became known as ""cash for ash"". Key findings from the inquiry The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster. Following the report's publication, Mrs Foster, now the first minister, repeated an apology for her ""failings in the implementation"" of the RHI scheme. This video can not be played The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster She added that she is ""determined to learn from my mistakes and to work to ensure that the mistakes and systematic failures of the past are not repeated"". Finance Minister Conor Murphy said it was now the responsibility of the executive to ""put (the report's) recommendations into action to change the system"". ""We need effective government and we need good practice in terms of our handling of public finances and we need to ensure that an issue such as this... can never arise again,"" the Sinn FÃ©in MLA said. Mrs Foster had told the inquiry that she did not read the regulations before bringing them to the assembly. The inquiry found: ""The minister, in presenting the regulations to the assembly and asking for their approval, should have read them herself. ""Not least because in the inquiry's view to so do is a core part of a minister's job."" This video can not be played RHI behaviour was 'unacceptable' However, it has found that as enterprise minister, Mrs Foster was given inaccurate and misleading information. The report also criticises the arrangement between Mrs Foster and her special advisor (Spad) Andrew Crawford. The RHI report: In full,external Live updates: RHI Inquiry report publication Latest reaction to the RHI report It said the division of responsibility between them for reading and digesting important documents was ""ineffective and led to false reassurance on the part of the minister"". The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), and in particular the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), have come under heavy criticism. The report finds that at the development stage ""insufficient care was taken within DETI to weigh properly the whole-life costs"" of the scheme. This video can not be played The inquiry findings are the culmination of more than three years of work by a team led by Sir Patrick Coghlin A draft regulatory impact assessment presented to Mrs Foster in 2012 ""lacked necessary cost information"". The report noted that at this point she had already been ""incorrectly"" told by officials that the scheme provided ""the highest renewable heat output at the best value"". The lack of record keeping was also highlighted. It emerged during the inquiry that many meetings had not been minuted by civil servants. ""Basic administration and record keeping, normally the bedrock of the Civil Service, was on too many occasions lacking within DETI,"" it said. ""This contributed to uncertainty as to what discussions had actually taken place."" The RHI scheme paid 1,200 businesses to switch from oil and gas to what was meant to be environmentally-friendly heating, using wood pellet boilers. Some businesses put in multiple boilers. But the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income.  Â£30mThe amount Stormont had to pay to cover the actual overspend Â£490-700mCost of 20-year projected overspend before RHI was reformed Â£38,000Average cost of the most popular-sized RHI boiler Â£23,000Average annual subsidy payment per boiler before tariff cuts Â£2,000Average annual subsidy payment after tariff cuts 2,128Total number of RHI boilers in NI, many in poultry industry It became known as ""cash for ash"" and a lack of cost controls meant it threatened a massive overspend on the Stormont budget. The financial scandal led to thecollapse of Northern Ireland's political institutions in 2017and caused a three-year political stalemate. The political institutions were only reinstated in January 2020. A public inquiry into the scheme was set up in 2017. It took evidence from high-profile politicians, civil servants and consultants who designed the scheme as well as administrators who ran it. Further criticism of the NICS said that having embarked on the RHI scheme, DETI did not ensure that ""adequate resources and expertise were applied to its development"". ""Those junior civil servants responsible for the scheme day-to-day, no matter how hardworking and well-intentioned, were consistently under resourced. ""They were not equipped with the necessary expertise, nor adequately supported."" A ""wholesale and uncoordinated changeover of staff"" who had knowledge of the scheme within DETI should not have been allowed to happen between 2013 and 2014. Renewable Heat Incentive scheme: Timeline of events What is the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme? In 2015, when problems were recognised, the actions of senior civil servants were not good enough to ensure they were identified and addressed. The inquiry also found that the whistleblower who repeatedly contacted DETI with her concerns should have been treated better. The report said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour from Spads"" Janette O'Hagan repeatedly contacted DETI between 2013 and 2015 to highlight abuse of the scheme, but her warnings were overlooked. The report said her treatment ""fell well below the standard she was entitled to expect"". It also said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour by Spads"", highlighting one who shared confidential government documents, not just about RHI, with family members. Another instance involved a number of Spads and a minister, discussing a plan to disclose information to divert media attention away from their party. The ""unsatisfactory"" relationship between DETI and Ofgem, the scheme's administrator, was also highlighted. The service Ofgem provided to the department ""fell below that standard that DETI could reasonably have expected"". The report said Ofgem had relevant information about scheme exploitation and did not pass this information on. This failure of communication ""deprived DETI of important opportunities to be confronted with or reminded of the problems of the scheme"". Ultimately the report finds that ""responsibility for what went wrong lay not just with one individual or group but with a broad range or persons and organisations involved"". ""There were repeated missed opportunities to identify and correct, to seek or have others correct, the flaws in the scheme. ""The sad reality is, that in addition to a significant number of individual shortcomings, the very governance, management and communication systems, which in these circumstances should have provided early warning of impending problems and fail safes against such problems, proved inadequate.""

"As it happened: RHI Inquiry report publicationReaction and analysis to the publication of Sir Patrick Coghlin's report into the RHI inquiry.Northern IrelandShut NI schools over virus, urges Catholic primateThe leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland asks Stormont education minister to consider closures.Northern Ireland","A report into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme in Northern Ireland has been published The political fall-out from the scandal left Northern Ireland without a government for three years The scheme was set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources However, it closed to new entrants in 2016 amid concerns about the potential cost The debacle cost Stormont in the region of Â£30m. An inquiry was set up in 2017 to look into the working of the scheme Luke Sproule, Tori Watson and Robin Sheeran That's all from us after a detailed report from Sir Patrick Coghlin and plenty of reaction from our politicians. The assembly will meet on Monday for a three-hour debate on the report. Join us again then. North Down MLA Andrew Muir of the Alliance Party tells BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra, ""not many of the people mentioned in the report are coming out smelling of roses"". He adds that there needs to be a ""culture change"" as ""some basics"" were missed, such as minute taking. ""We need to ensure all levels of government respond to this report and ensure that the recommendations are implemented,"" he says. ""Not many people will be relieved reading this report,"" says Mr Muir, adding that the matter really damaged public confidence in government in NI. ""We need to ensure those mistakes are never repeated."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking on BBC Evening Extra, Sinn FÃ©in's chief whip John O'Dowd says his party will spend the next few days ""reading and studying the report"". When asked about references in the document to his party colleague MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir, he says any ""criticism relating to his role"" was after issues with the RHI scandal had come to light and ""did not relate to the RHI scheme itself"". He adds that the scheme was the responsibility of the DUP minister who was in control of commissioning, designing and overseeing the scheme. However Mr O'Dowd says there are lessons in the recommendations to be learnt by all parties. Mr O'Dowd adds that there are ""clearly differences between us and other parties"" but that everyone is ""trying to make"" power sharing work and to ensure ""proper procedures are in place"". ""We need to be ensuring that we are working for families and workers and delivering change this society needs,"" he adds. Alliance finance spokesperson Andrew Muir says reform of the devolved institutions is essential following the release of the RHI inquiry report. ""At first glance it appears there are clear lessons to be learned and issues of real public concern, showing why reform of the institutions is essential,"" says Mr Muir. ""This report must act as a watershed moment for those who have been criticised directly, as well as the wider culture and system of governance, which enabled their actions and inactions.""

TUV leader Jim Allister has also responded to the report. He says: ""Although the language in the report is quite neutral, it's abundantly clear that the panel was appalled by what they found passes in government here, leading them to the conclusion that this government was never fit to handle a scheme like RHI. ""There was an appalling level of ineptitude and no accountability. ""It may be because the blame was spread so widely that some who deserve more criticism have gotten off lightly. ""I look forward to playing my part in being a catalyst in bringing those issues to the assembly."" In conclusion, Sir Patrick says he hopes the work of the inquiry ""will not only have been of interest of the public but will also have served the public interest"". ""We hope that you will all agree of the importance to give priority to this report and its findings in the interests of the people of this jurisdiction,"" he says.  Sir Patrick says that if the inquiry's report is ""followed both in letter and spirit, it will much more difficult for
the type of general problem discovered in respect of the Northern Ireland scheme to reoccur"". ""Hopefully that will in turn lead to better functioning of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and provide for much healthier devolved administration in Northern Ireland,"" he adds. ""Work has progressed in the Northern Ireland civil service with regard to
number of measures covered in inquiry's recommendations."" But he says: ""The inquiry would again counsel against any tendency to conclude that some of the necessary changes have already been fully achieved."" He adds that the ""recommendations set out in report require sustained
system wide change"" and that they will take time to implemented effectively. Sir Patrick says the inquiry recommends a role for the NI Audit Office (NIAO) ""in assessing and validating the extent of progress in implementing the lessons learned from the Northern Ireland RHI scheme"". The inquiry has asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to monitor and if necessary pursue the effective implementation ot its recommendations. He says the inquiry wants to thank the NIAO for agreeing to undertake this task.  ""The relation between minsters and Spads should be reconsidered
and clarified,"" says Sir Patrick. He says there ""should be a process of induction for Spads which should be
shared by the appointing minister and relevant permanent secretary. ""The relevant employment contract and conduct code for Spads must
be reconsidered and code of conduct revised."" He adds that there should be a ""clear system for Spads to register interests and potential
conflicts of interest"" and recommends there should also be a ""revision of the code of conduct"" for ministers, which he says should be a ""priority"". He says all such codes of conduct should be ""periodically
reviewed by an independent mechanism reporting to the public, in keeping with principles
independency and transparency"". He goes on to add that ""ministers presenting the assembly with legislation for approval, should familiarise themselves with it and ensure there is publicly
available evidence"" of how the benefits outweigh the costs. ""Minsters decisions should be taken by ministers in
conjunction with other ministerial colleagues where appropriate and by
no-one else,"" he adds.

happen again. ""There were a lot of wild allegations going around in December
2016 and January 2017, none of those were shown in the report. ""I think RHI gave Sinn FÃ©in the trigger to come out of the NI Executive."" Minister, SPADs and civil servants all share responsibility for ensuring best practice in the use of taxpayers' money, Sir Patrick says. He says there should be encouragement of recruitment of commercial expertise in the civil service. Turning to the matter of inter-departmental communication, Sir Patrick says, ""departmental silos are not in the interest of Northern Ireland public expenditure"".

Sir Patrick talks in some detail about a number of the recommendations. They include issues such as applying ""rigorous process"" about whether a ""potentiality volatile policy should be delivered by Nothernd Ireland's devolved
administration"". For policies ""driven by unpredictable demand, careful consideration should always be given, prior to implementation, to the inclusion of suspension or closure and ministers should
be informed of such powers at the outset"". He adds that consideration should be given to ""challenging guidelines and practice"" around the use of external consultants by the NI Civil Service and that ""best practice and risk management"" should become ""daily practice"" in ""novel and complex projects"". The system ""by which advice of policy tendered to ministers
should be improved"" to ensure they ""effectively discharge their role"" in testing and challenging
advice prior to policy decisions. In relation to minutes, Sir Patrick says there should be a duty to ""ensure accurate minutes"" with senior officials and ministers are kept - particularity around expenditure and decision making. Arlene Foster has been speaking to BBC News NI's Political Editor Mark Devenport. She says: ""I welcome this report and think Sir Patrick and his team

public trust. ""It is a lesson that I will not forget very quickly."" Sir Patrick says he hopes the report and its recommendations can make some contribution to more transparent and effective government in Northern Ireland. ""The recommendations set out in the report are offered in a constructive spirit and represent the inquiry's view as to what needs to change to give Northern Ireland's devolved administration the best chance of avoiding any repeat of the failings of the RHI scheme,"" he adds Sir Patrick says the inquiry has made a number of recommendations - which can be found in full in chapter 56 of the report. He says any inquiry's recommendations are designed to ""remove or reduce risk of similar failures which gave rise to
inquiry"" and ""present an opportunity for progress, for improvement in policy and
practice and innovative thinking"".  ""In addition there were repeated missed opportunities to identify and
correct, or seek to have others correct the flaws in the scheme,"" says Sir Patrick. ""The reality is in addition to a significant number of additional

"Spanish coronavirus cases up by 1,500 in a dayThe news comes as the government prepares to declare a nationwide state of emergency.Europe","Shops have been shutting in Barcelona and other Spanish cities The Spanish government is poised to declare a 15-day national lockdown on Monday to battle coronavirus. Under the decree being finalised, people would be allowed out only for emergencies, to buy food, or for work. With 191 deaths and 6,046 infections, Spain is the worst-hit country in Europe after Italy, which declared a nationwide lockdown on Monday. The US is extending its European travel ban to the UK and the Republic of Ireland from Monday. President Donald Trump confirmed the news in answer to a reporter's question at the White House. On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) saidEurope was now the ""epicentre"" of the pandemic. Italy has seen 1,266 deaths and 17,660 infections. Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to use aggressive measures, community mobilisation and social distancing to save lives. Several European countries have reported steep rises in infections and deaths in recent days. LIVE UPDATES:Borders shut as coronavirus cases rise EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? France reported a sharp rise in cases, from 3,661 to 4,499, and 12 more deaths, bringing the toll to 79 The US decided to extend its European coronavirus travel banto include the UK and Republic of Ireland from midnight EST on Monday (04:00 GMT Tuesday) New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern said almost all new arrivals in the country must self-isolatefor 14 days In China, new cases among people arriving in the country outnumbered those by local transmission for the first time Colombia closed its border with Venezuela and barred any visitors who recently visited Europe or Asia Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez discussed the emergency measures at a meeting of his cabinet in Madrid. The restrictions are expected to come into force at 08:00 (07:00 GMT) Monday. All public transport would be cut back with airline, train, bus and boat operators told they need to cut their services by at least half and that any plane, train, bus or other means of transport can only be a third full, Reuters news agency reports. The interior ministry would control all police forces, including those at local and regional level. Adding to the drama, Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias broke his own quarantine - which he went into after coming into contact with an infected colleague - to attend Saturday's talks. It had not been possible for Mr Iglesias, who did not test positive for the virus, to attend remotely and his presence was agreed with the government after sanitary measures were taken, government sources told Efe news agency. Two other ministers who are ill with coronavirus, Irene Montero and Carolina Darias, did not attend. This will be the second state of emergency in the country since the transition to democracy began in 1975, the first being a 2010 air traffic controllers' strike. Some measures have already been enforced at local level. The authorities in Madrid and its surrounding area have ordered the closure of most bars, restaurants and shops. Shops selling foodstuffs, pharmacies and petrol stations are exempt. Similar measures have been brought in elsewhere, including the regions of Galicia and Catalonia. The mayor of the southern city of Seville said he had suspended the famous Easter processions. Catalan regional leader Quid Torra has said he wants to seal off the whole region, and has asked the authorities in Madrid to block access by air, rail and sea. On Thursday the region's authorities locked down four towns north of Barcelona with a high number of cases. Airlines are also stopping flights to Spain.Low-cost leisure airline Jet2 turned back planes in mid-air on Saturdayas it announced it was cancelling all flights. All but ""essential travel"" to parts of Spain should be avoided,external, says the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office. More than 132,500 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in 123 countries around the world, according to the WHO. This video can not be played Coronavirus patients in northern Italy are being treated in warehouses The total number of deaths has reached about 5,000 - a figure Dr Tedros described as ""a tragic milestone"". ""Europe has now become the epicentre of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China,"" he said. ""More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic."" This video can not be played Europe now the ""epicentre"", says WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus As well as the increases in Spain and Italy, France has now confirmed 3,661 cases and 79 deaths. Germany has seen 3,675 cases and eight deaths.There have been 798 confirmed infections in the UK and 11 deaths. A number of European states are enforcing border closures: Denmark:Closes borders to foreign visitors from Saturday Czech Republic:Bans all foreigners from entering the country, except those with residence permits. Bans most of its own nationals from leaving Slovakia:Closes borders to all foreigners except those with a residence permit. Austria:Closes three land border crossings with Italy to all foreigners, except those with a medical certificate issued within four days. No restriction on Austrian nationals Hungary:Closes land borders with Austria and Slovenia Poland:From Sunday will close borders to foreign visitors Russia:Closes land borders with Poland and Norway Ukraine:Closes border crossings to foreigners (except diplomats) for two weeks Belgium, France, Switzerland and parts of Germany are among the latest countries to close schools. There are also widespread curbs on large gatherings and measures to close theatres, restaurants and bars. The number of cases of coronavirus reported every day in Europe has surpassed China at its peak. But Europe is in a worse position. The overwhelming majority of China's cases were in one place, Hubei province, and those were largely concentrated in one city, Wuhan. The outbreak was dealt with by an authoritarian government that imposed the biggest quarantine in human history. While there are hotspots in Europe, this is an outbreak across a continent, and different countries are adopting very different strategies for dealing with coronavirus. All these figures are based on cases that have been detected, but scientists fear there could be large outbreaks going on unnoticed in countries that don't have the tools to spot them.

Catholic churches preparing to suspend MassIt comes as mosques prepare for virus to affect Ramadan and synagogues ask worshippers not to shake hands.,"Roman Catholic churches in England are ""preparing for a time"" when the celebration of Mass may have to ""come to an end"", the Catholic leader in England and Wales has said. Catholics have an obligation to go to Mass every Sunday. Butlarge gatherings could be bannedin the UK from as early as next weekend, as the coronavirus continues to spread. The Church of England is also following these procedures, as well as refraining from passing collection plates around. The Muslim Council of Britain has urged mosques, madrasas and Muslim community centres to follow the governments hygiene practices. It also urged mosques to have contingency plans in place for Ramadan - which begins in the second half of April - as it may have to suspend mass gatherings. The United Synagogue asked its members to refrain from shaking hands and kissing religious artefacts, such as communal siddurim, which is a Jewish prayer book. Cardinal Vincent Nichols said Catholic churches were ""adjusting"" to minimise the spread of infection. He said: ""We are preparing for a time when the churches should not be used to gather big numbers of people together, so we might come to an end of the celebration of Mass or other services."" Many churches have already brought in measures to avoid exposing congregations to the virus. In some churches, holy water has been removed from the entrances, the sign of peace - normally a handshake - has been replaced by bowing and churchgoers can no longer drink wine from shared chalices. Church ministers are also washing their hands before distributing communion. Speaking to BBC's Radio 4's Today programme, Cardinal Vincent Nichols said: ""These are not the essential parts of mass,"" adding that he hoped everyone will be ""cooperative and calm"". EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic However, he said: ""The presence of the church and the space that it offers will be very important in the coming months,"" adding that some churches might also move to live-stream services. ""Even if the priest is there with one helper, we can stream them and people can join in from home and gather if they wish on a Sunday to follow the mass and say their prayers together,"" he said. He added that, in his view, churches would ""always remain open"" because they were ""places where  people can go, they can sit quietly, they can pray there's, plenty of space in them and there are no health risks.""

Â£320m coronavirus rescue package for businessA series of measures from Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will support businesses through the Covid-19 crisis.Scotland,"Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has announced a Â£320m rescue package for businesses. The cash is being made available to support business through the Covid-19 outbreak. She also revealed that a Â£50m hardship fund will be made available to people who lose their jobs as a result of a downturn caused by the virus. The action has been taken to try to limit the impact of the pandemic on Scotland's economy. The first Scots fatality was confirmed on Friday after an elderly patient with underlying health issues died in the NHS Lothian area. During the 2020-21 financial year, business will be boosted with: 75% rates relief for retail, hospitality and leisure sectors with a rateable value of less than Â£69,000 from 1 April 2020 Â£80m fund to provide grants of at least Â£3,000 to small businesses in sectors facing the worst economic impact of Covid-19 1.6% rates relief for all properties across Scotland, effectively reversing the planned below inflation uplift in the poundage from 1 April 2020 Fixed rates relief of up to Â£5,000 for all pubs with a rateable value of less than Â£100,000 from 1 April 2020 Finance secretary Kate Forbes has offered Â£320m to help business The finance secretary will also write to all local authorities urging them to respond positively to requests from ratepayers for payment deferrals for a fixed period. Ms Forbes said: ""Covid-19 will have challenging implications for businesses and the economy over the coming weeks and months. ""As well as following the latest health and travel advice, it's also crucial we consider the latest economic analysis and listen carefully to what the business community is telling us. We know that the tourism and hospitality sectors are facing immediate pressure, which is why we have directed support to them in particular."" She said that all ratepayers would benefit from a relief that effectively reversed the planned inflationary uplift that was due to come into effect in April. She also said the Scottish government was preparing a Â£50m fund for people who lose their jobs as a result of measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. This makes up the rest of the Â£360m-plus grant given by the Treasury in last week's budget. She told BBC News: ""Â£50m will go to a hardship fund which will be announced shortly. That will look at, for example, people who are self- employed or people who have lost their jobs. ""We have allocated every consequential penny we have received towards business support but I would believe and hope that further support comes to help us meet business needs."" David Lonsdale - Scottish Retail Consortium ""In dealing with this unprecedented scenario the Scottish government has listened to business and has taken steps which should improve cashflow and confidence for those impacted by the virus. These are the right decisions for the present, albeit both the UK and Scottish government may have to take further steps as this very unpredictable and unprecedented situation evolves."" Andrew McRae - Federation of Small Businesses Scotland ""While the shape of this help is slightly different to the support being offered to businesses south of the border, it is a substantial attempt by ministers in Edinburgh to help perfectly sound businesses facing severe short-term cashflow problems. Time is of the essence, so this new money must be easy to access. This is no time for bureaucratic hold-ups. Further, should this initial package of measures prove insufficient, we must not hesitate in delivering a further expansion."" Liz Cameron - Scottish Chambers of Commerce ""The Scottish government have outlined an initial number of measures that will be welcomed by businesses - particularly in the most affected sectors such as retail, hospitality and tourism - following on from the measures introduced in the UK Budget earlier this week. This is a positive initial response by the Scottish Government, but the situation needs to be reviewed on a daily basis to identify what additional support is required, particularly around how business can retain employees and the cost of businesses changing their operating models, for example to flexible working practises. Tracy Black - CBI Scotland ""These are substantive steps from the Scottish government that will be hugely welcomed by business. Sector-specific support is vital in hospitality, leisure and retail.  Freezing rates and introducing direct grants are also important elements - and more may be needed, as knock-on effects are emerging daily in sectors and businesses of all sizes. So the scale of response must keep pace with the impact. Agility is essential."" Gail Macgregor - Cosla ""We recognise that the Scottish government is taking action to mitigate the impacts of coronavirus and the measures announced today will help local businesses and communities. Cosla will continue to work closely with the Scottish government and other agencies to ensure our businesses and communities across Scotland are supported during this exceptionally challenging period.""

Breaking|Breaking newsUK coronavirus deaths double in 24 hours,"Ten more people in the UK have died in the last 24 hours after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 21. The UK government's chief medical adviser said the patients were all in ""at-risk"" groups from across England. The total number of confirmed cases in the UK has reached 1,140 while 37,746 people have been tested. It comes as the government revealed plans to boost the number of NHS beds and ventilators to treat people. British manufacturing companies are to be tasked with increasing the production of ventilators and other medical equipment, while the NHS could also buy up thousands of beds in private hospitals. In a conference call with manufacturers on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will urge them to join a ""national effort"" to tackle the virus. Downing Street says it has already been working with suppliers in the UK and abroad to increase the nation's supply of ventilators. Earlier, the Labour Party and GMB union called for the government to use empty beds in ""plush private hospitals"" to ease the pressure on the NHS. It comes as Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, warned that facilities for people needing oxygen and critical care beds would be the parts of the NHS that will come under pressure first as the scale of the outbreak increases. Meanwhile, US PresidentDonald Trump decided to suspend all travel between the US and the UK and Ireland. A No 10 spokesman said Mr Johnson had since spoken to Mr Trump, and set out the ""science-led approach"" the UK is taking. During their conversation, the two leaders also agreed on the ""importance"" of international collaboration to fast-track the development of a vaccine. It comes as Franceordered non-essential locations used by the public to close, and asked citizens to go out as little as possible. Several European countries have closed their borders or shut their airports. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic US vice president Mike Pence said the ban would begin at midnight on Monday eastern standard time (04:00 GMT), following a ""unanimous recommendation"" from health experts. The US has already banned travel from26 European countries. Of the latest deaths in the UK, eight were men aged over 80 and all were in ""at-risk"" groups. They were being treated in hospitals in Buckinghamshire, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Leicester, London and Chester. Prof Whitty said: ""I understand this increase in the number of deaths linked to Covid-19 will be a cause for concern for many. The public should know every measure we are taking is seeking to save lives and protect the most vulnerable."" Most of the confirmed UK cases are in England. There have been121 confirmed cases in Scotland,60 in Walesand34 in Northern Ireland. Have symptoms:If you are experiencing a new, continuous cough and/or a fever - defined as a temperature of above 37.8C - you should self-isolate at home for at least seven days,according to guidance released on Friday by Public Health England (PHE).,external People with mild symptoms who are self-isolating at home are not currently being tested.All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Live with or been in close contact with a positive case:The seven day isolation period now applies to everyone regardless of where you might have travelled or if you have had close contact with a confirmed case. Read more here. People who are self-isolating with mild symptoms are no longer being tested for the virus. The government said on Friday it estimated the true number of UK cases to be around 5,000 to 10,000. The PM has been meeting with officials at Downing Street to discuss the pandemic. Virus fear strikes shoppers and sports fans Scotland sees highest daily rise in virus cases UK flights to virus-hit Spain turn around mid-air Spain set to declare national emergency A mother and her newborn baby are among the latest confirmed to have the virus in England. Medics are trying to confirm whether the baby, who was tested at North Middlesex Hospital, was infected during birth or before, according tothe Sun newspaper,external. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said there was no evidence the virus can be passed on from pregnant women to babies before birth, but that due to how little is known about the new virusit would continue to update its guidance,external. Government advice,externaladds there is ""no clinical evidence"" to suggest the virus can be transmitted through breast milk. ""Infection can be spread to the baby in the same way as to anyone in close contact with you,"" it says. The increase in deaths is obviously alarming for the public - as well as being a tragedy for the families involved. What we don't know is the extent to which coronavirus played a role in their deaths. We only know they had it when they died. Every patient death announced in the coronavirus outbreak in the UK has been a person who has had underlying health conditions. That is a term that covers a range of different illnesses from heart disease and diabetes to asthma. There is certainly transmission of the virus within hospital - on Thursday three quarters of those patients with coronavirus in intensive care had not been abroad to an affected country. They may have caught it in the community and the Covid-19 illness they developed lead to their admission or they could have caught it in hospital when they were already ill. There are more than 1,500 deaths a day in the UK on average and what is certain is that growing numbers of people who die are going to have tested positive for coronavirus. People visiting elderly and vulnerable relatives have been reminded to take extra care, afterthe government released new advice,external. Care home providers should ask anyone who is ""generally unwell"" not to visit, the advice says. Meanwhile, government sources saidmass gatherings might soon be banned in the UK to ease pressure on emergency services.It is thought a ban could take effect as early as next weekend. This video can not be played Doctor Clare Gerada on recovering from ""grim"" coronavirus Events still set to go ahead include the Grand National in April, the 75th anniversary VE Day commemorations and Chelsea Flower Show in May, andGlastonbury Festival in June. The increase in cases in the UK comes as people continue to stockpile food and household items. The government has said there was ""no need"" for people to do so but has also relaxed restrictions on delivery hours for shops to make sure they remain stocked. Online supermarketOcado has taken its app offline,externaldue to ""performance issues driven by continued high demand"" while the website has crashed for many users. Former MP Luciana Berger called for members of the public to ""look out for"" each other after she said she witnessed a man in a London supermarket refusing to give an elderly lady one of his packets of pasta. She said the incident, which she posted abouton Twitter,external, was ""very upsetting"". Meanwhile British holidaymakers face being stranded abroad as Spain is set to begin a two-week state of emergency, with bars, restaurants, shops and activities all closed. Seven Jet2 planes heading to Spain wereturned around in mid-airas the airline cancelled all flights to the mainland, Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands. The firm says it has suspended all holidays and flights to all of Spain for at least a week. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has advised against all but essential travel toparts of Spain,externalas well as the whole of Poland. The Polish government is closing all its borders for 10 days at midnight. Some non-Polish nationals - such as spouses or children of Polish nationals - will still be allowed to enter the country, All flights to and from Poland by airlines in the Ryanair group have been cancelled from midnight on Saturday to midnight on 31 March.

French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has ordered the closure of all non-essential public locations from midnight (23:00 GMT Saturday) in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The measure applies to restaurants, cafes, cinemas and nightclubs, as well as ""non-essential"" businesses. Mr Philippe also called on French people to reduce their travel, especially between towns. Nine doctors and
nurses from China who worked on the frontline of the first coronavirus outbreak
in Wuhan visited the Italian capital Rome on Saturday. They brought supplies, and shared their experiences of tackling the virus at a hospital in the Italian capital which specialises in
infectious diseases. Speaking to
journalists outside the Spallanzani hospital, they said that they believed the
Italian doctors they had met in Rome were doing a very good job, and that the
measures the Italian government had taken across the country met the
international standard required. They said that
in China, they had learned that detecting infection early and quarantining
early was very important in bringing the virus under control. They also said
that releasing information to the media regularly was important for
transparency. Yemen's government says it is suspending all flights to and from
airports under its control for two weeks from 18 March. Prime Minister Maeen
Abdulmalik Saeed's office said there would be an exemption for flights for
humanitarian purposes. The main airports his government controls are Aden, Sayoun and Mukalla. Earlier on Saturday, Houthi rebels said they were closing the capital Sanaa's airport. It means United Nations flights can no longer fly into Sanaa. All other flights to Sanaa had already been banned by the Saudi-led military coalition that is backing the government against the Houthis. France now has 4,499 confirmed cases, up from 3,661 on Friday, officials say. Some 91 people have died in the country after getting the virus, up from 79 on Friday. There are now 189 coronavirus cases in the Czech Republic - a rise of 39 since the morning. Neighbouring Slovakia is reporting 44 positive cases. 
Both countries have introduced draconian measures to slow the spread of the virus. The authorities say the measures will be tightened even further if the situation deteriorates. Meanwhile, Slovenian TV is reporting the first coronavirus death in the country. The international beauty brand says it is stopping demonstrations of make-up and other products, and will no longer supplying tester pots for customers to try out goods. Trying out make-up products is seen as a core part of the consumer's experience. The company wants to minimise skin-to-skin contact in stores, it said in an email to customers.

He said US citizens and US legal residents would still be able to return to the US from those countries after the ban came into effect. They would be ""funnelled through specific airports"" and told to self-quarantine, he said.

He expects the results in the next one to two days, he told journalists at the White House. US President Donald Trump in the White House Helier CheungBBC News A US pharmacy warning that hand sanitisers may be in short stock Stockpiling and panic buying seems to have stepped up a notch over
the past few days, since President Donald Trump banned visitors from Europe's
Schengen area and announced a national emergency. Masks and hand sanitisers have been missing from shelves for weeks
- now pharmacies have started putting up signs outside the shop doors,
pre-emptively warning people they are out of stock. Even sanitising wipes and
thermometers are limited to two or four per customer - and appear to be sold
out on most days. People have also been stocking up on food in anticipation of the
need to self-isolate or work from home. At one local supermarket, the check out
queue was so long it wound the entire way around the store - all the way to the
front of the shop, and then back to near the cashiers - with customers waiting
about 20 minutes before they could pay for their groceries. I asked the cashier if it was normally this busy on a Saturday
morning. She replied with a resigned smile: ""It's virus busy."" Queues in a supermarket in Washington DC Everyone who comes into contact with President Donald Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence will have their temperature checked, the White House spokesperson Judd Deere says. âOut of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,â he said. Journalist Courtney Subramanian tweeted that a reporter has been escorted out of the White House briefing room after his temperature was found to be too high. On Saturday Mr Trump tweeted a reminder of the measures people should take to avoid spreading the new coronavirus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Spain has declared a national emergency and announced 1,500 new cases on Saturday. Spanish media are expecting the government to announce a lockdown similar to the quarantine in Italy, which would allow people out of their homes only in emergencies, to buy food or to go to work.

Several hundred people marched in the city, and police arrested 17. The group frequently organise large anti-establishment protests to highlight rises in the the cost of living - particularly petrol.

The interior ministry would control all police forces, including those at local and regional level. Adding to the drama, Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias broke his own quarantine - which he went into after coming into contact with an infected colleague - to attend Saturday's talks. It had not been possible for Mr Iglesias, who did not test positive for the virus, to attend remotely and his presence was agreed with the government after sanitary measures were taken, government sources told Efe news agency. Two other ministers who are ill with coronavirus, Irene Montero and Carolina Darias, did not attend. This will be the second state of emergency in the country since the transition to democracy began in 1975, the first being a 2010 air traffic controllers' strike. Some measures have already been enforced at local level. The authorities in Madrid and its surrounding area have ordered the closure of most bars, restaurants and shops. Shops selling foodstuffs, pharmacies and petrol stations are exempt. Similar measures have been brought in elsewhere, including the regions of Galicia and Catalonia. The mayor of the southern city of Seville said he had suspended the famous Easter processions. Catalan regional leader Quid Torra has said he wants to seal off the whole region, and has asked the authorities in Madrid to block access by air, rail and sea.

There are also widespread curbs on large gatherings and measures to close theatres, restaurants and bars. The number of cases of coronavirus reported every day in Europe has surpassed China at its peak. But Europe is in a worse position. The overwhelming majority of China's cases were in one place, Hubei province, and those were largely concentrated in one city, Wuhan. The outbreak was dealt with by an authoritarian government that imposed the biggest quarantine in human history. While there are hotspots in Europe, this is an outbreak across a continent, and different countries are adopting very different strategies for dealing with coronavirus. All these figures are based on cases that have been detected, but scientists fear there could be large outbreaks going on unnoticed in countries that don't have the tools to spot them.

Leaders discuss cross-border coronavirus plansThe first and deputy first ministers are meeting Irish ministers including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Northern Ireland,"Five new coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Northern Ireland, bringing the total up to 34 When schools shut in Northern Ireland over coronavirus it will be for at least 16 weeks, Arlene Foster has said. The first minister was speaking after a meeting between senior ministers from the NI Executive and Irish government. Two primary schools have said they will close voluntarily, the first primary schools in NI to do so. The two are Lurgan Model Primary School, in County Armagh, and St Scire's in Trillick, County Tyrone. Lurgan Model said it would close for the week, while St Scire's will close on Monday ahead of planned St Patrick's closures on Tuesday and Wednesday. Five new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in NI while a second person has died in the Republic of Ireland. There have been 129 confirmed cases in the Republic of Ireland whilecoronavirus deaths have doubled in 24 hours in the UK. The first and deputy first ministers met counterparts include Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar in Armagh on Saturday. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Speaking after the meeting, Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill were both still split over the issue of school closures. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill repeated her call for them to be shut immediately, in line with the Republic of Ireland. Meanwhile,in a statement on social media,external, Lurgan Model Primary School said it remain closed all this week. The school said it was already due to be shut on Monday and Tuesday due to St Patrick's Day and will bring planned closures due for May forward to this week. It is the first school in Northern Ireland to close voluntarily over the outbreak. The school said it ""will not officially reopen until Monday, 23 March"" but will ""monitor the situation of this incoming week"". St Scire's, in Trillick, said the school would stay closed on Monday ahead of planned closures on Tuesday and Wednesday for St Patrick's Day. It added that the situation will be reviewed prior to Thursday. Speaking after the meeting in Armagh, Mrs Foster said that schools will close ""when we are advised on the medical evidence"". ""Children will be at home for quite a considerable period of time, given that when we do close the schools they will be closed for at least 16 weeks. ""Then of course you are into the summer period, so they will be off school for a very long time."" Ms O'Neill said all parties in the executive agreed schools would have to close but it was a matter of timing. Michelle O'Neill repeated her call for schools to close She said: ""In my opinion schools should close now. I think we need to be consistent across this island ""I think the fact that you can have two schools a mile apart and one school's open and one school's closed that's a very confusing picture and a very confusing message for the public."" Ms O'Neillfirst called for schools to close immediately on Friday, a day after she, along with First Minister Arlene Foster, said the executive did not believe the situation had reached that stage. On Saturday, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also called for schools to close, after Archibishop Eamon Martin, the leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland,wrote to NI's education minister to ask him to consider closures. However, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said the main differences between the two governments was over timing. He said the Northern Ireland Executive and Irish government shared the same objective in slowing the advance of coronavirus but it was inevitable there would be differences in how they approached it. He added: ""But the differences that exist are mostly around timing. ""What there isn't any difference about is our common objective, which is to slow down this virus in its tracks and push it back as much as possible and limit the harm to human health and human life."" Mrs Foster said both governments had ""very coherent messages"". Mr Varadkar also explained that the short notice of Irish school closures given to counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK was ""not how we intended it to happen"". ""I absolutely guarantee you I did not intend to make that announcement or speak to Irish people on the steps of Blair House in Washington DC,"" he said. ""We had a plan in place to move to delay phase. We had to bring that forward almost overnight."" This video can not be played Washing hands no longer ""a luxury"" â Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney He added that Irish officials gave ""as many people a heads up as we could, including authorities here in Northern Ireland"" but it was also ""important that the Irish people should hear the news first from me and from the government"". ""That's why the notice that we gave people here and elsewhere was so short but there was no perfect way of doing this unfortunately and I appreciate the understanding of the first minister and deputy first minister,"" he added. Health Minister Robin Swann, TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney and Irish Health Minister Simon Harris also attended the meeting. Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald - who was not at the meeting - said the UK's response to coronavirus ""should be rejected"" and is ""totally unacceptable in the north of Ireland"".

Virus an 'existential threat' to cafe and bar jobs,"Restaurant, pub and cafe chains employ tens of thousands of people across the UK Hotel, cafe and dining chains will fail and jobs will go if the government does not do more to help the industry, a trade group has warned the chancellor. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, lobby group UK Hospitality said coronavirus was an ""existential threat"" to the sector. It wants to change laws to allow temporary staff redundancies. UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls said, without help, ""a significant number"" of jobs could disappear by May. In the letter, seen by the BBC, Ms Nicholls suggested broader support for the sector such as introducing measures ""to permit temporary staff redundancies where demand falls substantially - with Universal Credit covering wage costs"". Other government policies UK Hospitality would like to see include a business rates holiday for all businesses regardless of size, all payments to HMRC suspended for three months and Government Statutory Sick Pay payments to all hospitality businesses. Ms Nicholls told the BBC that even some of the largest hotel chains, pub chains and casual dining brands all ""run the risk of not existing going forward"", such is the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. ""This is business-critical - these are cash businesses, put simply, if you don't have people coming through the door, you will run out of cash very quickly. ""So we are talking about intervention that is needed next week to make sure that in six to eight weeks these businesses continue to trade, and if we don't get that support, by May, we will be facing business failures and a significant number of jobs at risk."" ""This is affecting hospitality companies of all sizes and shapes...it's high street businesses that are seeing footfall decline, so your pubs, bars, your cafes where you pop in for a sandwich, but also it's the larger companies across the sector - they are the firms that employing the most people,"" she added. Chancellor Rishi Sunak offered business rates relief for some small businesses in this week's Budget In Mr Sunak's first Budget this week, business rates relief was granted to companies with a rateable value of less than Â£51,000, which he said could save a business up to Â£25,000. The measure applies to firms including shops, cinemas, restaurants and hotels. However, Ms Nicholl said that the because many of the biggest employers in the hospitality industry operate from the largest premises on the UK high street, they will not benefit from the new business rate support. The financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the hospitality sector is being shouldered by businesses large and small, but one hotel manager said businesses of his size were ignored by the chancellor and are teetering on the brink. Mark Cotman is the group operations director at York House hotel in Eastbourne, and said his bookings are down 60% and he expects them to get worse. ""We've got the money to carry on for maybe two or three months, and then we're out of money. Then what do we do about paying staff, paying VAT, paying the veg man, the butcher?â¦We will run out of money, Mr Cotman said. Mark Cotman says his hotel is usually full at weekends, but is now running at only 40% occupancy ""The larger businesses like ours have received no assistance in the budget. ""We've been offered a facility of maybe applying for loan but of course that's got to be paid back. If we're not taking any money, how can we pay the loan back?"" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""On Wednesday, the chancellor announced, in total, a Â£30bn fiscal stimulus to support British people, jobs and businesses through this moment. ""Because of our extension of business rate relief, including to the hospitality and leisure sectors, around 900,000 properties, 45% of those in England, won't pay any business rates in 20/21. ""HMRC will also help businesses and self-employed individuals experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to Covid-19.""

To better co-ordinate the global response to the pandemic, leaders of the world's richest economies - the G7 group - will hold a crisis summit via videoconference on Monday. In all, travel is suspended for 30 days from 26 Schengen countries - 22 European Union members and four non-EU. They are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Mr Trump said the UK's exemption had been made on the advice of ""a group of professionals"" but could be reviewed because the number of cases had ""gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours"". The US travel ban was met with anger and confusion, with EU leaders accusing President Trump of making the decision ""without consultation"". Announcing the state of emergency, Mr Trump stressed that the ""next eight weeks are critical"". Among the measures envisaged as part of the emergency response are: The US Health Secretary Alex Azar and health officials can waive certain laws and licence requirements, giving more flexibility to healthcare providers Hospitals have been asked to activate their emergency preparedness plans Up to 500,000 additional coronavirus tests will be available by early next week, though authorities are not recommending tests without clear need; private labs and vaccine developers will be able to provide five million coronavirus tests within the month, though authorities are not recommending tests for those without symptoms Interest on all student loans is to be waived until further notice as a measure to ease the burden for students as universities and colleges across the country shut their doors Democrats in Congress - and heavily-affected states - had been urging Mr Trump to issue the emergency order, which will also allow more people to qualify for government health insurance.

It includes two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave, free virus testing for those without insurance and food aid. Late on Friday a relief bill, agreed with bipartisan support, was passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives. Urged again to explain why he hasn't taken a coronavirus test following reports that he has been in the company of people who have tested positive recently, Mr Trump said he had no symptoms and there was no need for a test. But he added that he  was likely to have one ""fairly soon"", anyway. In Canada,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau began a 14-day self-isolationperiod on Friday after his wife tested positive. Brazil's President Jair Bolsanaro has tested negative, despite one of his top aides falling sick recently. Both men had recently met US officials including President Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence. The Brazilian Charge d'Affairs in Washington, Nestor Forster Jr, who was also present at the dinner with Trump, has tested positive, GloboNews TV reported. The 1988 Stafford Act gives the president alone the ability to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to co-ordinate a national response to  ""natural catastrophes"" within the US. Donald Trump said ""national emergency"" were two very big words, but the declaration sounds more dramatic than it is, says the BBC's Anthony Zurcher. This video can not be played Ways to protect yourself from Covid-19 There are currently more than 30 national emergencies in effect. Mr Trump has declared several national emergencies in his presidency, including one last year to redirect military funds to build a southern border wall to prevent illegal immigration. He has also issued the order to deal with wildfires in California and flooding in the Midwest. It marks the first use of the order to fight a pandemic since President Barack Obama issued one to fight the swine flu virus. President Bill Clinton issued a national emergency to pay for efforts to stop the spread of West Nile virus in the US north-east. Are you in the US? Have you tried to get tested? Or self-isolated?

"Unlicensed charter flights happen 'every day'The Air Charter Association says the death of Emiliano Sala should be a ""watershed moment"".","Emiliano Sala was heading to his new club, Cardiff City, on board a plane being flown by David Ibbotson Unlicensed charter flights happen every day and the death of Emiliano Sala should serve as a ""watershed moment"", an industry association has said. The footballer and pilot David Ibbotsoncrashed in the English Channelin 2019. Air accident investigators said on Friday neither Mr Ibbotson nor the planehad the required licences. Dave Edwards, chief executive of the Air Charter Association (ACA), said in a commercial environment, the flight would have been stopped. ""If you look at the sequence of this particular flight, it's plain to see the difference that a legal charter would have made over this illegal flight,"" he said. ""The industry has said for a long time that there's an illegal element and sometimes it's quite difficult to quantify... but we know that it occurs, those of us who work on airfields see it every day."" No further action after manslaughter arrest Pilot Ibbotson 'not licensed for flight' Sala father: 'My son was abandoned for fatal flight' Striker Sala, 28, signed for Cardiff City from French side FC Nantes and visited the Cardiff City Stadium on 18 January. He was heading to his first training session with his new club at the time of the fatal crash. Sala signed for Cardiff City just two days before he was killed in the plane crash His body was later recovered underwater from the wreck of the plane, but Mr Ibbotson's body has not been found. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report found the plane began to break up in mid-air near Guernsey as Mr Ibbotson tried to regain control. It is believed lethal carbon monoxide gas was leaking into the cabin through the plane's heating system, probably from the exhaust. The report revealed the 59-year-old gas fitter, from Crowle in North Lincolnshire, had no valid licence to fly the plane that night - with or without a passenger. His rating for that type of aircraft had expired in November 2018, invalidating his private pilot's licence for flying the plane. He was not qualified to fly at night and inexperienced at flying using the plane's instruments. The investigation concluded ""neither the plane nor the pilot had the required licences or permissions to operate commercially"". It concluded: ""The pilot's ability to control the aircraft was probably impaired by the effects of CO poisoning, but he appeared to have some level of function at a late stage of the flight. ""The pilot's lack of training in night flying and recent practice in instrument flying is likely to have increased the risk of loss of control."" As a private pilot flying a US-registered plane, Mr Ibbotson was not licensed to carry passengers unless in a ""cost-sharing"" arrangement, whereby pilot and passenger have ""common purpose"" for making the journey and share the cost equally. Investigators found ""significant evidence"" he was expecting to be paid, which could have influenced his decision to push ahead with the flight at night and in poor weather. Arrangements for the flight were made ""via a third party who asked the accident pilot whether he would be interested in flying the outbound and inbound flights"". The AAIB released this photograph of the wreckage of the Piper Malibu The plane had undergone its annual maintenance check at the end of November 2018 - about 11 flying hours before the flight. If it had been operating commercially, it would have been subject to stricter maintenance requirements than those for private aircraft. No permission had been sought to use the aircraft commercially and it was ""not being operated in accordance with safety standards applicable to commercial operations"". Issues reported by Mr Ibbotson from France included an oil leak from the engine, a problem with the brakes and a malfunction of the stall warning system, which was sounding for the final 10 minutes of the flight to Nantes. The source of the carbon monoxide found in Sala's blood could not be confirmed, but all possibilities except one had largely been discounted. ""The most probable cause was considered to be exhaust gases leaking into the heater muff with the cabin heating selected on."" In one of several recommendations, the report calls on the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to ""maintain accurate and up-to-date records"" for pilots' licences, certificates and ratings. The CAA's database listing for Mr Ibbotson's flying licences and ratings was ""incomplete and contained numerous errorsâ¦ this mismatch between database records and a pilot's licence is not unique and previous AAIB investigations have encountered similar discrepancies"". The report notes the CAA is not required to have any oversight of US-registered planes based in the UK. Unlicensed charter flight operations - also known as grey charters - are becoming more widespread according to the ACA. They are often associated with sporting events such as race meetings and may be uninsured due to their unregulated nature. The AAIB report said: ""Due to the unlicensed nature of such flights, it is difficult to gauge the level of activity accurately. ""Enforcement is challenging because it requires a large commitment of resources.""

"Senior policewoman sacked over child abuse videoRobyn Williams has been unfairly targeted due to her race, the Met Black Police Association says.","Supt Robyn Williams has been sacked for gross misconduct after a 36-year police career One of the UK's most senior black female police officers has been sacked after her conviction for possessing a video clip of child abuse. Supt Robyn Williams was ruled by Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball to have committed gross misconduct. At a fast-track misconduct hearing, Ms Ball said Williams's failure to report the matter was ""very grave"". She pointed to Williams's ""lack of truthfulness and judgement"". The superintendentwas found guilty in Novemberof having footage of child sexual abuse on her phone. At her trial, Williams said she had not viewed the 54-second video, which was sent by her sister, and did not know it was on her phone. But Ms Ball said that Williams's conduct amounted to ""discreditable behaviour"" likely to undermine public confidence and was not a ""trivial lapse"". The assistant commissioner said her failure to report the matter could have caused significant further harm to the child. She said it was ""entirely unacceptable"" for police officers responsible for enforcing the law to break it themselves. Ms Ball added that racial bias had played ""no part"" in her decision, although the Metropolitan Black Police Association argues Williams has been unfairly targeted because she is black and accuses the force of ""institutional racism"". In a statement, the association said the decision to sack Williams was ""outrageous"". ""There are guidelines that allow for discretion, however Robyn was not afforded this privilege from start to finish of the process,"" it added. ""Despite the unprecedented and overwhelming expressions of support from colleagues, communities of London and beyond, calling for Robyn to continue to serve London, their voices were ignored."" Williams's friends and supporters, who were following the hearing on monitors in a separate room, gasped as the decision was read out. One of them started applauding sarcastically. Williams, pictured with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, was highly commended for her work helping families affected by the Grenfell Tower disaster During Williams's trial, Judge Richard Marks QC said she had made a ""grave error of judgement"" in failing to report the video after it was sent to her. The superintendent, who has been a police officer for 36 years, was ordered to do unpaid work in the community andregister as a sex offender, even though the court accepted there was no sexual element to her offending. Gerard Boyle QC, for Williams, told the special misconduct hearing that she had spent her entire police career since the age of 18 acting on behalf of victims of crime and abuse and that she was appalled by such abuse imagery. He added that she was accused of one allegation of one breach of one paragraph of professional standards behaviour. Mr Boyle told the hearing his client ""poses no risk to anyone, let alone children or young people"". Williams has lodged an appeal against her conviction but judges have not yet decided whether to grant approval for the case to be heard.
