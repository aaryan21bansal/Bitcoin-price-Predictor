Fake online reviews 'for sale',"Fake online reviews are being openly traded on the internet, a BBC investigation has found. BBC 5 live Investigates was able to buy a false, five-star recommendation placed on one of the world's leading review websites, Trustpilot. It also uncovered online forums where Amazon shoppers are offered full refunds in exchange for product reviews. Both companies said they do not tolerate false reviews. The popularity of online review sites mean they are increasingly relied on by both businesses and their customers, with the government'sCompetition and Markets Authority,externalestimating such reviews potentially influence Â£23 billion of UK customer spending every year. Maria Menelaou, whose Yorkshire Fisheries chip shop is the top-ranked fish and chip shop in Blackpool on several review sites, said the system has replaced traditional advertising. ""It brings us a lot of customers ... It really does make a difference. We don't do any kind of advertising,"" Mrs Menelaou said. While three quarters of UK adults use online review websites, almost half of those believe they have seen fake reviews, according to a survey of 1500 UK residents conducted by theChartered Institute of Marketing,externaland shared with BBC 5 live Investigates. Some US analysts estimate as many as half of the reviews for certain products posted on international websites such as Amazon are potentially unreliable. ""Sellers are trying to game the system and there's a lot of money on the table,"" said Tommy Noonan, who runs ReviewMeta, a US-based website that analyses online reviews. ""If you can rank number one for, say, bluetooth headsets and you're selling a cheap product, you can make a lot of money,"" he said. In 2016, Amazon introduced a range of measures prohibiting what it called ""incentivised reviews"", where businesses offered customers free goods in exchange for positive reviews. Mr Noonan said this effectively drove the problem underground, leading to the emergence of Facebook groups where potential Amazon customers were encouraged to buy a product and post a review in return for a full refund. BBC 5 live Investigates identified several of these groups and, within minutes of joining, was approached with offers of full refunds on products bought on Amazon in exchange for positive reviews. ""5 star is better for us"" said one person making such an offer, in an exchange of messages with the BBC. ""We value our brand, will refund you as we promised ... All my company do in this way."" It was not possible to identify the people making these offers, nor contact the businesses whose products they were seeking reviews for. ""We do not permit reviews in exchange for compensation of any kind, including payment. Customers and Marketplace sellers must follow our review guidelines and those that don't will be subject to action including potential termination of their account,"" Amazon said in a statement. Responding to adverts posted on eBay, the BBC was also able to purchase a false 5-star review on Trustpilot, an online review website that describes itself as ""committed to being the most trusted online review community on the market"". ""Dan Box is one of the most respected professionals I have dealt with. It was a pleasure doing business with him,"" this review said - word for word as requested by 5 live Investigates. Trustpilot, whose platform allows anyone to post a review, said they have ""a zero-tolerance policy towards any misuse"". ""We have specialist software that screens reviews against 100's of data points around the clock to automatically identify and remove fakes,"" the company said. In a statement, eBay said the sale of such reviews is banned from its platform ""and any listings will be removed"". 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 29 April at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.

Rudd 'made a mistake but didn't mislead',"Senior Tories have rallied around Amber Rudd, amid criticism for her failure to know specific migrant removal targets. The home secretary said she had not seen a memo leaked to the Guardian suggesting she knew of the objectives. Justice Secretary David Gauke said Ms Rudd ""made a mistake but didn't knowingly mislead"" while Environment Secretary Michael Gove pointed to the vast sum of emails ministers receive. But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott continued to call for Ms Rudd to quit. ""I am just surprised that she doesn't seem to take the issue seriously enough to offer her resignation,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme. Ms Abbott said it was the decision to set a numerical target for removing illegal immigrants that contributed to problems faced by the Windrush generation, where Commonwealth citizens, who came to Britain in the decades after World War Two were wrongly targeted. ""The danger is that very broad target put pressure on Home Office officials to bundle Jamaican grandmothers into detention centres,"" she said. Some of the Windrush generation have been threatened with deportation, lost their jobs or been refused access to medical treatment. Their plight has sparked a storm of criticism for the government, with Prime Minister Theresa May apologising for their treatment. Windrush: Who exactly was on board? Who are the Windrush generation? 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories On Saturday, almost 100 people met at the Black Cultural Archives in Brixton, where lawyers joined people who may have been affected by the Windrush fallout. Among them was Louis Smart who came to Britain as a child in 1963, travelling on his mother's passport. ""I've got a National Insurance number but I have tried to get a passport, and every time I lose the fee because you have to have certain documents,"" he said. ""I think the home secretary should resign. This is deliberate."" But one lawyer, Jacqueline McKenzie, said a new home secretary was not necessarily the answer since the system itself needed addressing. ""That's all people want,"" she said. ""They want evidence that they are British and then they can move on with their lives."" Louis Smart, who came to Britain in 1963, says he was 'left in limbo' Ms Rudd faced calls to resign from her position as home secretary after telling MPs earlier this week there had been no targets for migrant removal then later admitting ""local"" targets existed. In a series of late night tweets on Friday, she apologised, saying that although her office had been copied into the document she did not see it herself. The memo, seen by the Guardian, from June 2017 set out Home Office targets for achieving 12,800 ""enforced returns"" in 2017-18. It also said targets had been exceeded for ""assisted returns"". She is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons on Monday to respond to what she called ""legitimate questions"" about illegal migration. This video can not be played Amber Rudd ""can't be held responsible for a document she didn't see"" By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent One by one cabinet ministers have offered support to their colleague Amber Rudd. After a tense few hours on Friday evening when her position seemed to be uncertain, there is now an effort to rally round the home secretary. She has given an explanation and an apology, and for MPs in her own party and the prime minister, that would appear to be enough. To lose Amber Rudd would leave Theresa May further exposed to criticism of her own record at the home office. It would also upset the delicate balance of opinions on Brexit in cabinet with crunch votes on the government's policy looming at Westminster. But the home secretary's position is far from rock solid. She has promised a statement to parliament on Monday. For Amber Rudd it may feel like a very long weekend. The chair of the home affairs select committee, Yvette Cooper, has said ""serious questions"" need to be answered when Ms Rudd returns to the committee to give further evidence. ""We have obviously been given inaccurate information to Parliament twice now,"" she said. Asked whether ministers could cite the volume of emails received as an excuse, Ms Cooper said a ""huge amount"" of documents are received but systems had to be in place. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK The environment secretary said that if these memos were not brought to the home secretary's attention that was ""regrettable"". Michael Gove told Radio 4's Today: ""There are hundreds of documents which are copied in to a secretary of state's office every day and week. ""She was very clear both in her apology and also in the fact that this specific document wasn't placed in her box, wasn't brought to her attention. It wasn't a matter for decision."" Justice Secretary David Gauke told the programme that Ms Rudd is an ""excellent"" home secretary. ""She has accepted that she made a mistake, she didn't knowingly mislead the House of Commons, but she accepted she was inaccurate in her statements. ""She's coming back to the House of Commons on Monday to correct the record."" Under the Ministerial Code, if any minister ""knowingly"" misleads Parliament they are expected to resign. Downing Street has already pledged its support to Ms Rudd, saying the prime minister has ""full confidence"" in her. The six-page document, from Immigration Enforcement Agency boss Hugh Ind, states: ""IE has set a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18, aided by the redistribution of resources towards this area. ""This will move us along the path towards the 10% increased performance on enforced returns, which we promised the home secretary earlier this year."" It adds: ""We have exceeded our target of assisted returns. We set an internal target of 1,250 of these returns for 2016-17â¦ we delivered 1,581.""

Thousands flee near Myanmar-China borderThe UN sounds alarm as civilians face growing violence in a longstanding conflict in Kachin state.3h3 hours agoAsia,"At least 10,000 people are believed to have fled their homes in Kachin this year Thousands of people have fled renewed fighting between the army and ethnic Kachin rebels in Myanmar's northernmost state. Some 4,000 people have been driven from their homes since early April, according to the UN. It comes as a longstanding conflict between the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) and government troops escalates. The military is said to be pounding the rebels with airstrikes and artillery. As well as the thousands displaced, there are fears that many people remain trapped in conflict-stricken areas, near the border with China. Aid organisations have urged the government to allow them access. Myanmar profile Tales of horror from Myanmar ""Our biggest concern is for the safety of civilians - including pregnant women, the elderly, small children and people with disabilities,"" Mark Cutts, the head of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told AFP news agency. ""We must ensure that these people are protected."" In addition to the Rohingya crisis in western Myanmar (also known as Burma), the country's north has seen clashes involving other ethnic minorities. The Kachin, who are mostly Christian, have fought for greater autonomy in this predominantly Buddhist nation since 1961. Across Kachin and northern Shan state, an estimated 120,000 people are displaced by the fighting. The Myanmar government has for the past six years pursued peace agreementswith many other ethnic insurgent armies, says the BBC's South Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. But fighting with the relatively well-armed KIO has continued, and they remain one of the most powerful rebel groups. Sporadic fighting has taken place since a ceasefire broke down between the KIO and the military in 2011. Rights groups say the army has stepped up its campaign while global attention focuses on the Rohingya crisis, which has seen some 700,000 people flee to Bangladesh. Allow Twitter content?

Londoners warned over toxic caterpillars,"The Forestry Commission has issued a warning to steer clear of the toxic caterpillar An outbreak of toxic caterpillars that can cause asthma attacks, vomiting and skin rashes has descended on London, officials have warned. Oak processionary moths (OPM), which are in their larval stage, have been spotted across the south-east of England and in the capital. Hairs on the caterpillars can cause fevers and eye and throat irritations, the Forestry Commission said. The organisation has issued a caution not to touch the species. The biggest infestations of OPM were recorded in Greater London, stemming from Kingston upon Thames to Brent. Some infestations were also spotted in Bracknell Forest, Slough and Guildford. The red dots indicate where OPM nests were found in 2017/18 OPM caterpillars were spotted emerging from egg plaques in mid-April, and trees were later treated on 23 April, the Forestry Commission added. ""The treatment programme is expected to continue until late May or early June,"" a spokesman said. ""After that the caterpillars will be too large to be affected by our preferred treatment product."" One gardener was clearing an overgrown allotment unaware that an oak tree above her was infested with OPM. She said she suffered ""severe symptoms"" after coming into contact with the species. ""My first symptom was a rash on my tummy. I was unaware of what is was and thought at first it was a heat rash,"" she said. ""During this time I had spells of feeling violently sick. I thought I might have shingles. ""The rash got worse and the left side of my face became covered in this sore irritating rash. My left eye became very sore and weepy. ""I contacted my doctor and it was confirmed I had been severely affected by OPM and must keep away from the source as over time I had developed a severe allergic reaction."" Do not touch or approach nests or caterpillars Do not let children touch or approach nests or caterpillars Do not let animals touch or approach nests or caterpillars; or try removing nests or caterpillars yourself Source: Forestry Commission The caterpillar of the oak processionary moth has about 62,000 toxic hairs As a caterpillar, each OPM has about 62,000 hairs, which they can eject. Hairs that fall to the ground can be active for up to five years. The moths only live for two to three days in July or August. It is thought that the moths were brought into the UK on trees imported from Europe for a landscape project. A population of OPM established itself in the west London area in 2006. Move about in nose-to-tail processions Often form arrow-headed processions, with one leader and subsequent rows containing several caterpillars abreast Are most likely to be found in oak trees, and sometimes on the ground under oak trees Are most likely to be seen in late spring and early summer Have very long, white hairs which contrast markedly with other, shorter hairs Do not live on fences, walls and similar structures, as some caterpillar species do Oak moth prompts asthma warning Warning over toxic moth outbreak Forestry Commission Buying Coordinator (14 months FTC) Robot-guided âsmart biopsyâ technique tested on patients in UK first South London's Christmas Lane Community pays tribute to 14-year-old with âpure heartâ stabbed to death on bus The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Kanye West defends Trump in new song,"Donald met Kanye in 2016 After a week of controversial Twitter postings, Kanye West has defended his support of the US president in a new song. The track Ye vs. The People sees the star trading lyrics with fellow-rapper T.I., who takes him to task over his support of Donald Trump. ""You representin' dudes who seem crude and cold-hearted,"" argues T.I., adding that West is emboldening ""white supremacy"". But the star stands his ground, insisting that he's ""fighting for the people"". Alluding to a photo he posted of himself wearing Donald Trump's famous Make America Great Again baseball cap, West raps: ""Wearing the hat will show people that we are equal."" ""You gotta see the vantage point of the people,"" spits back T.I. ""What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil."" West won't be swayed, however.

But he later added: ""I don't agree with everything Trump does. I don't agree 100% with anyone but myself."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Unfortunately, my attempt to support Kanye is being used to discredit my brothers and sisters in the movement and I can't sit by and let that happen.""

The track opens with a sped-up sample of the 1973 Amnesty song Liberty, a soulful call to arms that states, ""we need to strive for more liberty"".

The two releases are West's first new music since 2016's Life Of Pablo album. He has hinted he will release a new album on 1 June, followed a week later by a collaborative record with Kid Cudi.

Healthy Tasmanian devils give species hope,"Tasmanian devils (like these) were found in a remote part of Tasmania A healthy group of Tasmanian devils has been discovered in Australia, giving new hope for the survival of the endangered species. They were found by scientists on a conservation expedition in south-west Tasmania. The marsupials' numbers have been slashed because of the spread of an infectious facial cancer. More than 80% of devils across Tasmania have been lost to the disease, according to local media. It is passed between them when they fight or mate. Human drugs target Tasmanian devil cancer How the Tasmanian devil has responded to infectious cancers The search expedition was funded by a crowdfunding campaign, and is a collaboration between the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program, the University of Sydney Faculty of Science, University of Sydney and Toledo Zoo from Ohio in the US. Their scientists spent eight days exploring the wilderness across Wreck Bay and Nye Bay, looking for devils to trap so they could run tests. After taking tissue samples, they will now study the genetics of the healthy devils to compare them to the infected populations. ""The 14 individual devils trapped were in good condition,"" said Dr Sam Fox, the team's leader and the adjunct biologist to Toledo Zoo. ""And more importantly, there were no signs of disease. Overall the results show that the population in this area of the south-west coast is small and healthy."" Save the Tasmanian Devil Program manager Dr David Pemberton told Australia's ABC news network that the find was ""very significant"". ""Finding devils with fresh genetic diversity gives us opportunities,"" he said. The Tasmanian Devil is the world's largest carnivorous marsupial, native only to the island state of Tasmania, 240km (150 miles) south of the mainland. The growl-like scream made by the animals helped them earn their devil nickname. Earlier this year,researchers from the UK's Cambridge University said that human cancer drugs could help save the species.

Saudi 'sorry' for airing women wrestlers,"Wrestling is popular throughout the Middle East Saudi Arabia's sport authority has apologised for the appearance of scantily clad women during a wrestling broadcast. World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) held matches in Jeddah, billed as its Greatest Royal Rumble. Men and women attended, although no female wrestlers were allowed to take part in the fights. But state television cut off its broadcast of the event when promotional footage showing female wrestlers aired. The footage rolled on giant television screens around the arena during the fight. Saudi General Sports Authority apologised for what it described as ""indecent scenes"". No female WWE wrestlers at Saudi show Saudis announce $64bn entertainment fund Allow Twitter content?

By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs editor The razzmatazz of this wrestling extravaganza would once have seemed deeply alien in Saudi Arabia. But public entertainment has arrived in the country with a bang in the past year or two - and some 60,000 people filled the auditorium, including many women, who have already been allowed to attend football matches for the first time this year. There had been criticism of the WWE before the event for bowing to Saudi tradition by keeping female wrestlers off the bill. As it turned out, the event - which was broadcast live on several Saudi outlets - did infringe on local sensitivities when a promotional film featuring female wrestlers was broadcast on the screens. State television broke off its coverage at this point - but it still provoked criticism on social media from a variety of conservative Saudi voices. The show also drew a mixed reception for a staged fight between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Saudis easily beat their regional rivals, but online some were surprised an Iranian flag was allowed to be waved in the stadium. Others however viewed it more as wishful thinking from the Gulf kingdom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Burning Man festival founder dies,"Larry Harvey was ""never one for labels"", the Burning Man CEO said Larry Harvey, founder of the Burning Man arts festival, has died in San Francisco aged 70. He suffered a stroke earlier this month and passed away at home on Saturday morning, a statement on the organisation's website said. The annual counterculture festival sees up to 70,000 people gather in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. It features giant interactive art installations and a huge wooden man that is burnt at the end of the event. ""Larry was never one for labels. He didn't fit a mould; he broke it with the way he lived his life,""Burning Man CEO Marian Goodell wrote,external. ""He was a landscape gardener, a philosopher, a visionary, a wit, a writer, an inspiration, an instigator, a mentor, and at one point a taxi driver and a bike messenger."" ""The loss of his presence in our daily lives will be felt for years, but because of the spirit of who he is, we will never truly be without him,"" she added. What does it take to run Burning Man? Burning Man bicycles on the move Hedonistic festival's unlikely relocation Burning Man was founded in June 1986 when Mr Harvey and his friend Jerry Goodell burned a wooden man on Baker Beach in San Francisco to mark the summer solstice. This then grew into the festival, which in 1990 was held in Nevada's Black Rock Desert for the first time. It quickly became one of America's most well-known cultural events, attracting famous faces such as singer Katy Perry and the actor Will Smith. This video can not be played Burning Man: Hedonistic festival's unlikely relocation By 2015 the Burning Man Project reported annual revenues of $37.5m (Â£27.2m), of which $30.4m was ploughed back into running the event. Mr Harvey, who had the title Chief Philosophical Officer, spoke to the BBC in 2016 about how the festival came to be. ""It happened to be the anniversary of a broken love affair,"" he said. ""That story has been inflated forever. I was burning my girlfriend, you hear that, I was burning my girlfriend's lawyer, I made that one up just to make it interesting! Where the man came from I don't know."" ""The spirit of the (event) is alive and well,"" he said.

"Londoners warned over toxic caterpillarsHairs on the caterpillars can cause fevers and eye and throat irritations, officials say.6h6 hours agoLondon","The Forestry Commission has issued a warning to steer clear of the toxic caterpillar An outbreak of toxic caterpillars that can cause asthma attacks, vomiting and skin rashes has descended on London, officials have warned. Oak processionary moths (OPM), which are in their larval stage, have been spotted across the south-east of England and in the capital. Hairs on the caterpillars can cause fevers and eye and throat irritations, the Forestry Commission said. The organisation has issued a caution not to touch the species. The biggest infestations of OPM were recorded in Greater London, stemming from Kingston upon Thames to Brent. Some infestations were also spotted in Bracknell Forest, Slough and Guildford. The red dots indicate where OPM nests were found in 2017/18 OPM caterpillars were spotted emerging from egg plaques in mid-April, and trees were later treated on 23 April, the Forestry Commission added. ""The treatment programme is expected to continue until late May or early June,"" a spokesman said. ""After that the caterpillars will be too large to be affected by our preferred treatment product."" One gardener was clearing an overgrown allotment unaware that an oak tree above her was infested with OPM. She said she suffered ""severe symptoms"" after coming into contact with the species. ""My first symptom was a rash on my tummy. I was unaware of what is was and thought at first it was a heat rash,"" she said. ""During this time I had spells of feeling violently sick. I thought I might have shingles. ""The rash got worse and the left side of my face became covered in this sore irritating rash. My left eye became very sore and weepy. ""I contacted my doctor and it was confirmed I had been severely affected by OPM and must keep away from the source as over time I had developed a severe allergic reaction."" Do not touch or approach nests or caterpillars Do not let children touch or approach nests or caterpillars Do not let animals touch or approach nests or caterpillars; or try removing nests or caterpillars yourself Source: Forestry Commission The caterpillar of the oak processionary moth has about 62,000 toxic hairs As a caterpillar, each OPM has about 62,000 hairs, which they can eject. Hairs that fall to the ground can be active for up to five years. The moths only live for two to three days in July or August. It is thought that the moths were brought into the UK on trees imported from Europe for a landscape project. A population of OPM established itself in the west London area in 2006. Move about in nose-to-tail processions Often form arrow-headed processions, with one leader and subsequent rows containing several caterpillars abreast Are most likely to be found in oak trees, and sometimes on the ground under oak trees Are most likely to be seen in late spring and early summer Have very long, white hairs which contrast markedly with other, shorter hairs Do not live on fences, walls and similar structures, as some caterpillar species do Oak moth prompts asthma warning Warning over toxic moth outbreak Forestry Commission Buying Coordinator (14 months FTC) Robot-guided âsmart biopsyâ technique tested on patients in UK first South London's Christmas Lane Community pays tribute to 14-year-old with âpure heartâ stabbed to death on bus The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Missing rapper 'threw himself into sea'Kenny Mukendi disappeared in Rio de Janeiro after telling his girlfriend he was coming home.,"The rapper's disappearance was registered with police by worried girlfriend, Renata Lima (pictured) A London hip hop artist missing in Rio de Janeiro may have ""thrown himself into the sea"", police in Brazil said. Kenny Mukendi, 22, also known as Kenny Vulcan, disappearedon 13 April after telling his girlfriend he was coming home from a recording studio. Police said his backpack containing his wallet, phone and passport was found by surfers the following day, ruling out suspicions of violent crime. Searches for his body were conducted for seven days, ending on Thursday. According to inspector Elen Souto, investigations led to the conclusion that the rapper from Woolwich ""threw himself into the sea from a viewpoint in western Rio"". Ms Souto said Mr Mukendi's family members reported that he had a history of depression. His father and uncle were in Rio and had been following the investigations, she added. Mr Mukendi's cousin, Rais Bona Mapianda, said the musician's girlfriend became worried when she noticed his Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook accounts had all disappeared.

O'Sullivan beaten by Carter at Worlds,"This video can not be played Ronnie O'Sullivan & Ali Carter collide at the Crucible 2018 World Championship Venue:Crucible Theatre, SheffieldDates:21 April - 7 May Coverage:Watch live across BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Red Button, Connected TV, the BBC Sport website and mobile app. Five-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan was surprisingly beaten in the second round of the World Championship, losing 13-9 to Ali Carter in an ill-tempered match. O'Sullivan, who had lost to Carter just once in 17 previous meetings, appeared to barge into his fellow Englishman's shoulder during the 19th frame. O'Sullivan trailed Carter 5-3, which was extended to 8-3, before he hit back for a 9-7 overnight deficit. But he could not get ahead as Carter kept his composure for a famous win. After the two players shook hands at the end, two-time finalist Carter - beaten in both the 2008 and 2012 finals by O'Sullivan - celebrated wildly in front of the Crucible crowd. Carter played down the clash with O'Sullivan, saying: ""It was nothing. He is walking to his chair, I'm walking to the table, we brushed shoulders, it's no big deal. ""Ronnie is a master in all areas, a master of one-upmanship, but I was going to do whatever it took to win."" O'Sullivan added: ""I've known Ali since he was 10 years of age. Sometimes it gets a bit tense out there but it's all behind us."" Read more: O'Sullivan plays down Carter clash World Championship schedule & BBC coverage times This video can not be played Ronnie O'Sullivan is out after 'careless' missed pots Carter, who has had lung and testicular cancer, as well as Crohn's disease, recorded his first win over his fellow Essex player in a ranking event. He had said after his first-round win over Graeme Dott that ""it was the Ronnie O'Sullivan show all the time"" but there are other players competing in the event too. And putting O'Sullivan under pressure from the first session paid dividends. ""In the past I've been guilty of Ronnie intimidating me like he probably has with other players,"" said Carter. ""It's nice to finally get one up but I feel like a different person since I last played him in 2012. I've been through so much in my life. ""He's got such a presence and he's such an amazing snooker player but he wasn't having it all his own way."" With defending champion Mark Selby suffering a shock first-round exit, the event has now been thrown wide open. Carter lost to O'Sullivan in the 2008 and 2012 World Championship finals Having won a record-equalling five ranking titles this season, O'Sullivan has been the tour's form player - but he failed to showcase his brilliance in Sheffield. He was not at his best against Stephen Maguire in the first round and was outplayed by Carter on this occasion. It was a throwback to previous years when O'Sullivan has crumbled at snooker's biggest tournament. And the temperature rose when he shoved Carter while going back to his seat in the 19th frame. O'Sullivan had put Carter in a snooker on the green ball and while walking back to his seat, stuck an elbow into the arm of Carter, who seemed to laugh it off, before a tetchy exchange took place. Carter kept his cool and took the frame for an 11-8 lead. O'Sullivan claimed the next but missed a simple blue on a break of 54 and Carter cleared up, with a further 51 sufficient for victory. ""He was the better player throughout the whole match,"" O'Sullivan said. ""I battled back last night but I was second to the punch every time. ""You can't win World Championships when you're having bad spells like that. Ali is a tough competitor, he's always had that feisty character. He was strong out there and deserved his victory."" This video can not be played Five best shots - Kyren Wilson through to quarter-finals after defeating Jamie Jones Meanwhile, former runner-up Barry Hawkins survived a scare to beat debutant Lyu Haotian 13-10 and reach the quarter-finals. China's Lyu recovered from 4-0 and 8-3 down to level the contest at 10-10, but missed chances allowed Englishman Hawkins to win three frames in a row. ""He just kept potting balls and did not look flustered. I could not shake him off,"" said Hawkins. He will face China's Ding Junhui or Scot Anthony McGill in the last eight. Englishman Kyren Wilson completed a comfortable 13-5 victory over Welshman Jamie Jones and sets up a repeat of this year's Masters final against Mark Allen in the next round. Two-time champion Mark Williams opened up a slender 5-3 lead over Robert Milkins. They resume on Sunday at 14:30 BST.

Pamplona protests over bull-run rape case,"Thousands of people turned out on the streets of the Spanish city Pamplona on Saturday for the third day of protests after five men were cleared of rape. The men, who called themselves the Wolf Pack, were found guilty of sexual abuse, which many consider too lenient. The case has caused a national outcry, with protests also taking place in Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia since Thursday's verdict. The victim, then 18, was assaulted at the city's bull-running festival. The Spanish hashtag #cuÃ©ntalo, meaning ""tell it"", has been widely tweeted in recent days, as people shared their own stories of abuse in solidarity with her. The five men - JosÃ© Ãngel Prenda, Alfonso Cabezuelo, Antonio Manuel Guerrero, JesÃºs Escudero and Ãngel Boza - were each sentenced to nine years in prison. Prosecutors had asked for sentences of more than 20 years. A sign reads: ""The judges' message is clear. To prove you've been raped, you must be dead or nearly dead"" Under Spanish law, the charge of sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. The Spanish government has said it will review the classification of sexual offences. More than 30,000 people protested on Saturday, according to police. The demonstrators strode down the roads where the bulls run during the annual festival, known locally as San FermÃ­n. 'Wolf pack' gang rape trial angers Spain Viewpoint: Rape case highlights enduring machismo Many said they were motivated not only by this case, but they also wanted to take a stand against the whole legal system, which they said was stacked against women. ""Justice is still patriarchal, it puts the blame on us and we are unprotected,"" said one of the female protesters to local radio station RTVE, according to Reuters news agency. The protesters gathered behind a giant banner, which said (in Basque): ""No one judges our opinion."" A group of nuns from Hondarribia convent, in the Basque Country, also spoke out against the verdict. ""We wanted there to be a voice in the Church to criticise the sentence,"" a spokesperson for the sisters, Sister Mariluz, told AFP news agency. The five-month trial was held behind closed doors to protect the woman's identity. According to a police report, the five men surrounded her in a small alcove, removed her clothes and had unprotected sex. Some of the men filmed the sexual act on their phones. In their WhatsApp group, named ""la manada"" (meaning wolf pack), they celebrated afterwards and promised to share the recording. The police report said the victim maintained a ""passive or neutral"" attitude throughout the scene, keeping her eyes closed at all times. Her phone was then stolen. Defence lawyers argued the apparent passivity was proof of consent. The prosecutors said she was too traumatised to move. The men, who have been in custody since 2016, were also ordered to pay the woman â¬50,000 ($61,000; Â£44,000) in compensation. Guerrero, a police officer for the paramilitary Guardia Civil, was fined an extra â¬900 for stealing her phone. Both the woman and the defendants say they will appeal against the verdict. After it was announced, the national police tweeted: ""No is no"", plus the emergency number, adding: ""We are always with you.""

"North Korean media hail 'historic' summitIn a rare move, Pyongyang's state media hails declaration for peace and denuclearisation.","This video can not be played Welcoming Kim Jong-un with pomp and ritual Friday's summit between the leaders of North and South Korea was a ""historic meeting"" paving the way for the start of a new era, North Korea's media say. The North's Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in of South Korea agreed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. In a rare move, state-run TV and the official KCNA news agency hailed the talks and the leaders' commitment to seek ""complete denuclearisation"". The summit came just months after warlike rhetoric from the North. It saw Mr Kim become the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The two men warmly shook hands and then stepped symbolically over the military demarcation line to the North Korean side. Historic summit as it happened Five key moments from the meeting Read the Korean declaration in full,external For years, Pyongyang has insisted that it would never give up its nuclear arsenal, which it claims it needs to defend itself against aggression from the US. Seeing even a small mention of denuclearisation in a public newspaper will be perceived as a breakthrough by South Korean officials, says the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul. The two leaders said they would pursue talks with the US and China to formally end the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a truce, not total peace. The commitment to denuclearisation does not explicitly refer to North Korea halting its nuclear activities but rather to the aim of ""a nuclear-free Korean peninsula"".

Other points the leaders agreed on in a joint statement were: An end to ""hostile activities"" between the two nations Changing the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides the country into a ""peace zone"" by ceasing propaganda broadcasts An arms reduction in the region pending the easing of military tension To push for four-way talks involving the US and China Organising a reunion of families left divided by the war Connecting and modernising railways and roads across the border Further joint participation in sporting events, including this year's Asian Games Mr Kim's bold decision to stride confidently into nominally hostile territory reflects the young dictator's confidence and acute sense of political theatre and expertly executed timing.

Missing rapper 'threw himself into sea',"The rapper's disappearance was registered with police by worried girlfriend, Renata Lima (pictured) A London hip hop artist missing in Rio de Janeiro may have ""thrown himself into the sea"", police in Brazil said. Kenny Mukendi, 22, also known as Kenny Vulcan, disappearedon 13 April after telling his girlfriend he was coming home from a recording studio. Police said his backpack containing his wallet, phone and passport was found by surfers the following day, ruling out suspicions of violent crime. Searches for his body were conducted for seven days, ending on Thursday. According to inspector Elen Souto, investigations led to the conclusion that the rapper from Woolwich ""threw himself into the sea from a viewpoint in western Rio"". Ms Souto said Mr Mukendi's family members reported that he had a history of depression. His father and uncle were in Rio and had been following the investigations, she added. Mr Mukendi's cousin, Rais Bona Mapianda, said the musician's girlfriend became worried when she noticed his Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook accounts had all disappeared. More than Â£2,500 has been raised via a fundraising page to help Mr Mukendi's family with the search.

O'Sullivan in second-round loss to Carter,"This video can not be played Ronnie O'Sullivan & Ali Carter collide at the Crucible 2018 World Championship Venue:Crucible Theatre, SheffieldDates:21 April - 7 May Coverage:Watch live across BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Red Button, Connected TV, the BBC Sport website and mobile app. Five-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan was surprisingly beaten in the second round of the World Championship, losing 13-9 to Ali Carter in an ill-tempered match. O'Sullivan, who had lost to Carter just once in 17 previous meetings, appeared to barge into his fellow Englishman's shoulder during the 19th frame. O'Sullivan trailed Carter 5-3, which was extended to 8-3, before he hit back for a 9-7 overnight deficit. But he could not get ahead as Carter kept his composure for a famous win. After the two players shook hands at the end, two-time finalist Carter - beaten in both the 2008 and 2012 finals by O'Sullivan - celebrated wildly in front of the Crucible crowd. Carter played down the clash with O'Sullivan, saying: ""It was nothing. He is walking to his chair, I'm walking to the table, we brushed shoulders, it's no big deal. ""Ronnie is a master in all areas, a master of one-upmanship, but I was going to do whatever it took to win."" O'Sullivan added: ""I've known Ali since he was 10 years of age. Sometimes it gets a bit tense out there but it's all behind us."" Read more: O'Sullivan plays down Carter clash World Championship schedule & BBC coverage times This video can not be played Ronnie O'Sullivan is out after 'careless' missed pots Carter, who has had lung and testicular cancer, as well as Crohn's disease, recorded his first win over his fellow Essex player in a ranking event. He had said after his first-round win over Graeme Dott that ""it was the Ronnie O'Sullivan show all the time"" but there are other players competing in the event too. And putting O'Sullivan under pressure from the first session paid dividends. ""In the past I've been guilty of Ronnie intimidating me like he probably has with other players,"" said Carter. ""It's nice to finally get one up but I feel like a different person since I last played him in 2012. I've been through so much in my life. ""He's got such a presence and he's such an amazing snooker player but he wasn't having it all his own way."" With defending champion Mark Selby suffering a shock first-round exit, the event has now been thrown wide open. Carter lost to O'Sullivan in the 2008 and 2012 World Championship finals Having won a record-equalling five ranking titles this season, O'Sullivan has been the tour's form player - but he failed to showcase his brilliance in Sheffield. He was not at his best against Stephen Maguire in the first round and was outplayed by Carter on this occasion. It was a throwback to previous years when O'Sullivan has crumbled at snooker's biggest tournament. And the temperature rose when he shoved Carter while going back to his seat in the 19th frame. O'Sullivan had put Carter in a snooker on the green ball and while walking back to his seat, stuck an elbow into the arm of Carter, who seemed to laugh it off, before a tetchy exchange took place. Carter kept his cool and took the frame for an 11-8 lead. O'Sullivan claimed the next but missed a simple blue on a break of 54 and Carter cleared up, with a further 51 sufficient for victory. ""He was the better player throughout the whole match,"" O'Sullivan said. ""I battled back last night but I was second to the punch every time. ""You can't win World Championships when you're having bad spells like that. Ali is a tough competitor, he's always had that feisty character. He was strong out there and deserved his victory."" This video can not be played Five best shots - Kyren Wilson through to quarter-finals after defeating Jamie Jones Meanwhile, former runner-up Barry Hawkins survived a scare to beat debutant Lyu Haotian 13-10 and reach the quarter-finals. China's Lyu recovered from 4-0 and 8-3 down to level the contest at 10-10, but missed chances allowed Englishman Hawkins to win three frames in a row. ""He just kept potting balls and did not look flustered. I could not shake him off,"" said Hawkins. He will face China's Ding Junhui or Scot Anthony McGill in the last eight. Englishman Kyren Wilson completed a comfortable 13-5 victory over Welshman Jamie Jones and sets up a repeat of this year's Masters final against Mark Allen in the next round. Two-time champion Mark Williams opened up a slender 5-3 lead over Robert Milkins. They resume on Sunday at 14:30 BST. Four-time champion John Higgins, runner-up to Selby last year, whitewashed Jack Lisowski 8-0 in the first session of their second-round tie. They continue on Sunday at 14:30 BST.

Half of French museum's art was fakeMore than half of the paintings in a museum in French artist Ãtienne Terrus' birthplace were fake.,"More than 80 paintings said to be by Ãtienne Terrus were fake (this one, of Collioure in the Pyrenees, is real and is now on display) A French museum dedicated to painter Ãtienne Terrus has discovered paintings it thought were by him were fakes. The Terrus museum in Elne in the south of France discovered 82 works originally attributed to the artist were not painted by him. More than half the collection is thought to be fake. The paintings cost about â¬160,000 (Â£140,000). Staff at the museum were not aware of the forgeries until a visiting art historian alerted them. The council in Elne bought the paintings, drawings and watercolours for the museum over a 20-year period. Eric Forcada, an art historian, contacted the museum in the town near Perpignan several months ago to express his doubts about the authenticity of the paintings. The museum assembled a committee of experts from the cultural world, who inspected the works and concluded that 82 of them had not been painted by the Elne-born artist. The news was announced on Friday as the museum opened after a renovation. Could you spot a fake work of art? Italian police chase Modigliani fakers Could you still love a fake piece of art? In interviews on Friday,the mayor of the Pyrenees town, Yves Barniol, said the situation was ""a disaster"",externaland apologised to those who had visited the museum in good faith. Terrus was born in 1857 and died in 1922 in Elne, although he lived most of his life in Roussillon, also in the Pyrenees. He was a close friend of painter Henri Matisse. The authentic Vue CathÃ©drale remains on display Some of the paintings show buildings that were built after Terrus' death,external, France 3 said. The town hall has filed a complaint against those who ordered, painted, or sold the fake paintings. Local police are investigating the case, which they say could affect other regional artists too.

But fear not, if you're still crying out for a Premier League fix then you can enjoySwansea v Chelsea right here. Or feast on one (or all...) of our match reports from today's earlier kick-offs.  And don't forget to tune in for Match of the Day from 22:20 BST on BBC One tonight. Swansea are currently 1-0 down against Chelsea. But the Swanswillsend West Brom down if they avoid defeat by the Blues today - and here is why: West Brom can reach a maximum of 34 points. A draw today takes Swansea to that total - and they play Southampton in one of their final matches (Tuesday, 8 May). If Swansea go into that game on 34 points then every possible outcome - win, draw, defeat - leaves either them or Southampton on a total greater than 34 points. So, West Brom must hope for a Chelsea victory today - and nothing less. Crystal Palace 5-0 Leicester Leicester City Leicester manager Claude Puel, speaking to MOTD:""Tough game. We lost our balance in the team after conceding two goals. After second half we tried to make a tactical change and after five minutes it was crazy. The injury from Ndidi after the sending off and penalty. It was difficult to accept all this. Everything was against us today. ""I think it is harsh (the red card). The decisions didn't favour us. On the sending off and penalties. We had some situations that we cannot explain. ""We didn't have enough balance on the team without Ndidi. No ball winner. We stayed with offensive players without the chance to change it. We tried to play. On speculation about his future:""No attention to it. No comments about it. At the moment it is diff for my team."" Southampton 2-1 Bournemouth Bournemouth Bournemouth defender Charlie Daniels:""Very disappointed, we
gifted them two goals, got one in just before half time but didnât perform to
our best. Gave it a go with 15 minutes left but we canât do that against a team
fighting relegation. ""We were in control at the
start of second half, but we conceded a sloppy goal and then you are up against it. We
created some half chances, but it didnât go in today. ""We want to finish the season
on a high, not walk to the end, have a good finish. We need to do better in
these last few games."" Burnley 0-0 Brighton Burnley Burnley manager Sean Dyche:""There is a strong chance (of Europe) now. The performance of the players over the season, it is very difficult for me to question them, they've been super strong and it looks like probable European football. ""We had to work in the market, recruit well. We lost some good players but got some more in. The staff reflected on last season too, we looked at the way we operated away from home and affected that. ""Players have to take on the information you offer then, run with it and believe in it, and they've done that. ""We've had some tough times here down the year, and I think it's an important part of the community and raises everyone around here."" Burnley 0-0 Brighton Brighton & Hove Albion Brighton defender Shane Duffy:""They are where they are in the league because they are a good team, so I would say it's a positive result. ""From day one we always believed we could stay in the league. It's in our hands and if we keep sticking to our beliefs we can win the games."" Crystal Palace 5-0 Leicester Crystal Palace More from Palace boss Roy Hodgson, talking to Sky Sports:""Wilf (Zaha) today, that was maybe one of the very best during my time at the club. He balanced running with the ball, creating chances and tracking back. His all-round game was great. He got the balance between when  to hold on to the ball and when to lay it off. If he can continue like that there is no barrier for how high he can reach. On Christian Benteke taking the second penalty:""He didn't wrestle the ball today (for the penalty). Luka (Milivojevic) was on his way to take the penalty but I got the message out for Benteke to take the penalty after he had been fouled. I was confident he was going to score it. He is a popular guy. He has not had the season he or the fans would want but that is not because he hasn't tried. Some times the harder you try and the worse it gets. ""I think basically we are safe. We are talking about teams that have not won three in a row all season. It is possible but very tough. Teams below us also have to play each other."" And how's this for a stat? That was Palace's joint-biggest winning margin in a top-flight game along with their 5-0
     thrashing of Manchester United in December 1972. Crystal Palace 5-0 Leicester Crystal Palace Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson talking to Sky Sports:""The last 15-20 minutes were good. We played very well in first half but lived dangerously one or two times. Second half it was important we went out with the same attitude. We didn't at first but once we got the third goal and the man was sent off we were more relaxed and aggravated the scoreline. When you are at the bottom those five goals are very useful. ""I am so proud of the players and happy for them. We have not had an easy time. We have shot ourselves in the foot at times but to overcome that and keep going it makes me very proud. It is a testament not just to their ability but their character. They have gone out and given performances. The scoreline flatters us as 5-0 scoreline usually do but we deserved it."" Newcastle 0-1 West Brom Newcastle United Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez speaking to MOTD:""We tried to do it, but I'm not happy with our performance, on the ball, without the ball, everything we did in the last few games, we didn't do. ""We wanted to get more points to finish higher in the table, but we didn't do well today, we made a lot of mistakes, and we weren't good enough. ""We didn't think the job was done, but it's a pity because we've had a good season, but we want to finish better, too. I congratulate the players for a good season, but we need to be better than today. ""The target was to stay up, but if we can finish ninth we want to do that."" Southampton 2-1 Bournemouth Bournemouth Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe:""The goals we conceded were big mistakes and we got punished for them. Disappointed with how we played,
it was a game we could and should have won if we play like we can, but we didnât. ""We were disappointed
with attacking play, got in promising positions but the quality wasnât there. We made
life difficult for ourselves, had good spells but not enough. ""We have got to show that pride
in trying to achieve and win. We have got two games to do that now."" Newcastle 0-1 West Brom West Bromwich Albion More from Darren Moore, on what he's changed at the club:""Not me, but we. We've come together and all the results are for everyone part of West Brom Football Club, everyone can share in this result, because everyone helped us get it. ""I've stepped into the role, and I get to speak on behalf of the club, but it's just the next game for me, I've been asked to step in and do a job for the club, but it's just the next game for me."" FT: Newcastle 0-1 West Brom West Bromwich Albion West Brom midfielder Chris Brunt speaking to MOTD about Darren Moore:""I think he's come in Monday to Friday and been through everything, he's put a lot of trust in us, and I think that's helped. ""He's very modest and very positive, he gives everyone a lot of belief they can do a job, and since he's come in he's stepped up to the plate. Even the way he's done the training sessions, he makes the lads want to listen to him. He's definitely had a positive influence."" What needs to change?""We carry the can for what happens on the pitch, but from top to bottom in the club, there's things people will think could have been done better this year."" How will you prepare for Spurs next week:""It'll be no different to how we prepared for Liverpool or Man United, obviously Spurs are a good team, but it would be nice to win one at home because we haven't done that in a while."" FT: Newcastle 0-1 West Brom West Bromwich Albion West Brom first-team coach Darren Moore, speaking to MOTD:""I've been extremely proud of the lads, we're really happy with another really solid performance today, we've played well and come out with a good result."" On the Baggies' recent form:""It's unbelievable, I'm just taking each game as it comes, trying to play my part. I've come up against world class managers, but I just keep looking to the next game. ""I can't speculate where we are going to be in the next game, but I'm just trying to control what I can control, and it's just onto the next game for me. We did really well today, we showed great courage."" Southampton 2-1 Bournemouth Southampton Southampton manager Mark Hughes:""Everyone knew the
circumstance, we needed a win and draw or a loss wouldnât do. This is only a
part of what we need to do, but good for us. ""It thought we were good
value for the lead, then we conceded from a set piece. Worry sets in about how
the guys react, we have been damaged by previous results, but to a man they all
stepped up, dug in, got back in the lead. ""At the end we were throwing
bodies to keep them out. It is a huge result for us, doesnât mean anything yet
but potentially significant. ""Everyone is behind the
guys, they showed great endeavour, no shortage of skill either, two great goals
from Dusan Tadic. ""We need to have the
teams above us looking over their shoulder, and this result does that. They
know we have good quality, we just need to keep momentum. If we keep going like today it will go close."" Crystal Palace 5-0 Leicester Crystal Palace Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson, speaking to MOTD on Ruben Loftus-Cheek:""I think he is an excellent player. I worked with good players for England and I would put him up there. Today he was immense at times and has been since he came back from injury., We wonder what it would have been like had we not lost him to injury. Maybe he is coming good at the right time. I know if they do decide to pick him he won't let them down. He will provide a few options. On getting a big win:""Sometimes the celebrations come at times when you don't expect. It is a case of relief more than celebration. We will save the celebrations for the end of the season."" FT: Newcastle 0-1 West Brom West Bromwich Albion West Brom caretaker boss Darren Moore:""We did everything that was asked of us today, we came here today to a tough arena, against a good team, and we needed to perform well to come away with a result. ""I was pleased with the result, it was a good, solid performance. We could have even scored more goals, we had plenty of chances, and after we scored our defence was resolute too. ""We're just continuing to look forward to the next game now, we'll enjoy today, and look forward."" On going down if Swansea draw:""There's nothing we can do, we're just looking after ourselves, we're just doing everything we can at our end, and the boys have done really well. ""The players have been excellent since I came in, and the staff too, and the club as a whole really, we've gained strength in unity. Everyone's done their part and we just need to keep doing the same. ""We're just priding ourselves on doing well for the club at the moment, and I'm delighted for everyone connected with the club, but again, we can't control the other factors."" Huddersfield 0-2 Everton Huddersfield Town Huddersfield boss David Wagner:""The support from the stands was great, we gave everything but we were beaten by quality in the end. ""We missed opportunities and they scored with their first effort on goal and then in the second half we were not at the same level. ""We have to deal with it and we will deal with it. We had four match points before this game and now we have three left. ""We are focussed on the games, even if we know they are against very good opponents. We sometimes needed a second too much on the ball, a touch too much and this is why we couldn't get a shot away. ""The players need a lift and we will give them that. We had good momentum. We will fight until the final end."" Crystal Palace 5-0 Leicester Leicester City Leicester defender Harry Maguire:""It was from start to finish not good enough. We expected to give them a game but it wasn't good enough. ""We spoke about getting the first goal in the second half but the red card changed it. For a bit of time we did OK but as soon as the third goal went in it was all over. ""We fully want to achieve as high as we can in the Premier League. Today we looked like we were all on our holidays."" Burnley 0-0 Brighton Brighton & Hove Albion Brighton manager Chris Hughton speaking to Match of the Day:""Certainly a point we deserved. I thought we were the better side, more likely to score. Burnley are very effective and we had to defend well, but I thought we had the better opportunities."" On whether the ball hit Lewis Dunk's arm during a goalmouth scramble in the first half:""There is a chance it did, but it's less than a yard away. It was a moment in the box where the ball has come very quickly, so certainly not a penalty for me."" On Brighton's chances of staying up:""We have had the points in the bag and those below us have to win games. We will go into every game with the possibility of getting the points in all of them - we have every chance if we go into the games with the endeavour we did today. ""Burnley are the seventh best team in the Premier League and thoroughly deserve it. Sean has done a terrific job."" Â© 2025 BBC.

O'Sullivan in second-round loss to CarterFive-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan suffers a surprise second-round exit in the World Championship after an ill-tempered 13-9 defeat by Ali Carter.,"This video can not be played Ronnie O'Sullivan & Ali Carter collide at the Crucible 2018 World Championship Venue:Crucible Theatre, SheffieldDates:21 April - 7 May Coverage:Watch live across BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Red Button, Connected TV, the BBC Sport website and mobile app. Five-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan was surprisingly beaten in the second round of the World Championship, losing 13-9 to Ali Carter in an ill-tempered match. O'Sullivan, who had lost to Carter just once in 17 previous meetings, appeared to barge into his fellow Englishman's shoulder during the 19th frame. O'Sullivan trailed Carter 5-3, which was extended to 8-3, before he hit back for a 9-7 overnight deficit. But he could not get ahead as Carter kept his composure for a famous win. After the two players shook hands at the end, two-time finalist Carter - beaten in both the 2008 and 2012 finals by O'Sullivan - celebrated wildly in front of the Crucible crowd. Carter played down the clash with O'Sullivan, saying: ""It was nothing. He is walking to his chair, I'm walking to the table, we brushed shoulders, it's no big deal. ""Ronnie is a master in all areas, a master of one-upmanship, but I was going to do whatever it took to win."" O'Sullivan added: ""I've known Ali since he was 10 years of age. Sometimes it gets a bit tense out there but it's all behind us."" Read more: O'Sullivan plays down Carter clash World Championship schedule & BBC coverage times This video can not be played Ronnie O'Sullivan is out after 'careless' missed pots Carter, who has had lung and testicular cancer, as well as Crohn's disease, recorded his first win over his fellow Essex player in a ranking event. He had said after his first-round win over Graeme Dott that ""it was the Ronnie O'Sullivan show all the time"" but there are other players competing in the event too. And putting O'Sullivan under pressure from the first session paid dividends. ""In the past I've been guilty of Ronnie intimidating me like he probably has with other players,"" said Carter. ""It's nice to finally get one up but I feel like a different person since I last played him in 2012. I've been through so much in my life. ""He's got such a presence and he's such an amazing snooker player but he wasn't having it all his own way."" With defending champion Mark Selby suffering a shock first-round exit, the event has now been thrown wide open. Carter lost to O'Sullivan in the 2008 and 2012 World Championship finals Having won a record-equalling five ranking titles this season, O'Sullivan has been the tour's form player - but he failed to showcase his brilliance in Sheffield. He was not at his best against Stephen Maguire in the first round and was outplayed by Carter on this occasion. It was a throwback to previous years when O'Sullivan has crumbled at snooker's biggest tournament. And the temperature rose when he shoved Carter while going back to his seat in the 19th frame. O'Sullivan had put Carter in a snooker on the green ball and while walking back to his seat, stuck an elbow into the arm of Carter, who seemed to laugh it off, before a tetchy exchange took place. Carter kept his cool and took the frame for an 11-8 lead. O'Sullivan claimed the next but missed a simple blue on a break of 54 and Carter cleared up, with a further 51 sufficient for victory. ""He was the better player throughout the whole match,"" O'Sullivan said. ""I battled back last night but I was second to the punch every time. ""You can't win World Championships when you're having bad spells like that. Ali is a tough competitor, he's always had that feisty character. He was strong out there and deserved his victory."" This video can not be played Five best shots - Kyren Wilson through to quarter-finals after defeating Jamie Jones Meanwhile, former runner-up Barry Hawkins survived a scare to beat debutant Lyu Haotian 13-10 and reach the quarter-finals. China's Lyu recovered from 4-0 and 8-3 down to level the contest at 10-10, but missed chances allowed Englishman Hawkins to win three frames in a row. ""He just kept potting balls and did not look flustered. I could not shake him off,"" said Hawkins. He will face China's Ding Junhui or Scot Anthony McGill in the last eight. Englishman Kyren Wilson completed a comfortable 13-5 victory over Welshman Jamie Jones and sets up a repeat of this year's Masters final against Mark Allen in the next round. Two-time champion Mark Williams opened up a slender 5-3 lead over Robert Milkins. They resume on Sunday at 14:30 BST. Four-time champion John Higgins, runner-up to Selby last year, whitewashed Jack Lisowski 8-0 in the first session of their second-round tie. They continue on Sunday at 14:30 BST.

Half of French museum's art was fake,"More than 80 paintings said to be by Ãtienne Terrus were fake (this one, of Collioure in the Pyrenees, is real and is now on display) A French museum dedicated to painter Ãtienne Terrus has discovered paintings it thought were by him were fakes. The Terrus museum in Elne in the south of France discovered 82 works originally attributed to the artist were not painted by him. More than half the collection is thought to be fake. The paintings cost about â¬160,000 (Â£140,000). Staff at the museum were not aware of the forgeries until a visiting art historian alerted them. The council in Elne bought the paintings, drawings and watercolours for the museum over a 20-year period. Eric Forcada, an art historian, contacted the museum in the town near Perpignan several months ago to express his doubts about the authenticity of the paintings. The museum assembled a committee of experts from the cultural world, who inspected the works and concluded that 82 of them had not been painted by the Elne-born artist. The news was announced on Friday as the museum opened after a renovation. Could you spot a fake work of art? Italian police chase Modigliani fakers Could you still love a fake piece of art? In interviews on Friday,the mayor of the Pyrenees town, Yves Barniol, said the situation was ""a disaster"",externaland apologised to those who had visited the museum in good faith. Terrus was born in 1857 and died in 1922 in Elne, although he lived most of his life in Roussillon, also in the Pyrenees. He was a close friend of painter Henri Matisse. The authentic Vue CathÃ©drale remains on display Some of the paintings show buildings that were built after Terrus' death,external, France 3 said. The town hall has filed a complaint against those who ordered, painted, or sold the fake paintings. Local police are investigating the case, which they say could affect other regional artists too.

"North Korean media hail 'historic' summitIn a rare move, Pyongyang's state media hails declaration for peace and denuclearisation.2h2 hours agoAsia","This video can not be played Welcoming Kim Jong-un with pomp and ritual Friday's summit between the leaders of North and South Korea was a ""historic meeting"" paving the way for the start of a new era, North Korea's media say. The North's Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in of South Korea agreed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. In a rare move, state-run TV and the official KCNA news agency hailed the talks and the leaders' commitment to seek ""complete denuclearisation"". The summit came just months after warlike rhetoric from the North. It saw Mr Kim become the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The two men warmly shook hands and then stepped symbolically over the military demarcation line to the North Korean side. Historic summit as it happened Five key moments from the meeting Read the Korean declaration in full,external For years, Pyongyang has insisted that it would never give up its nuclear arsenal, which it claims it needs to defend itself against aggression from the US. Seeing even a small mention of denuclearisation in a public newspaper will be perceived as a breakthrough by South Korean officials, says the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul. The two leaders said they would pursue talks with the US and China to formally end the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a truce, not total peace. The commitment to denuclearisation does not explicitly refer to North Korea halting its nuclear activities but rather to the aim of ""a nuclear-free Korean peninsula"". The statement talks about this taking place in a phased manner, but does not include further details. Many analysts remain sceptical about the North's apparent enthusiasm for engagement. Five conflicts that continued after they ended Profile: Kim Jong-un North Korea crisis in 300 words This video can not be played Kim Jong-un issues his pledge for peace with South Korea Previous inter-Korean agreements have been abandoned after the North resorted to nuclear and missile tests and the South elected more conservative presidents. Mr Kim said the two leaders had agreed to work to prevent a repeat of the region's ""unfortunate history"" in which progress had ""fizzled out"". Other points the leaders agreed on in a joint statement were: An end to ""hostile activities"" between the two nations Changing the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides the country into a ""peace zone"" by ceasing propaganda broadcasts An arms reduction in the region pending the easing of military tension To push for four-way talks involving the US and China Organising a reunion of families left divided by the war Connecting and modernising railways and roads across the border Further joint participation in sporting events, including this year's Asian Games Mr Kim's bold decision to stride confidently into nominally hostile territory reflects the young dictator's confidence and acute sense of political theatre and expertly executed timing. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea His clever, seemingly spontaneous gesture to President Moon to reciprocate his step into the South by having him join him for an instance in stepping back into the North was an inspired way of asserting the equality of the two countries and their leaders. It also, by blurring the boundary between the two countries, hinted at the goal of unification that both Seoul and Pyongyang have long sought to realise. The rest of the day was full of visual firsts and a set of cleverly choreographed images of the two leaders chatting informally and intimately in the open air - deliberately advancing a powerful new narrative of the two Koreas as agents of their own destiny. Read full analysis from Dr John Nilsson-Wright China, North Korea's ally, and the United States both welcomed the outcome of the talks. On Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted that ""things are going well"" and that preparations were being made for his own meeting with Mr Kim in the coming weeks. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier he pledged continue to exert maximum pressure on North Korea, saying: ""We're not going to be played, OK?"" US officials are still deciding where to hold the summit, but Mongolia and Singapore are understood to be two countries on the shortlist. Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told reporters on Saturday that the city-state had so far received no formal request to host the event. Korea summit sparks cold noodle craze Diplomacy on the menu: How food can shape politics Mr Kim travelled in a car surrounded by jogging bodyguards Few had predicted a development like this, as North Korea continued its nuclear and missile tests and stepped up its rhetoric through 2016 and 2017. The rapprochement began in January whenMr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea. Did the Winter Olympics repair relations? North and South set up hotline ahead of summit The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, held in the South. Many South Koreans were overcome with emotion as they saw the historic moment on TV Mr Kim announced last week that he was suspending nuclear tests. Chinese researchers have indicated that North Korea's nuclear test site may be unusableafter a rock collapse. Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? Moment Kim Jong-un crossed Korean border.

Missing rapper 'threw himself into sea'Kenny Mukendi disappeared in Rio de Janeiro after telling his girlfriend he was coming home.6h6 hours agoLondon,"The rapper's disappearance was registered with police by worried girlfriend, Renata Lima (pictured) A London hip hop artist missing in Rio de Janeiro may have ""thrown himself into the sea"", police in Brazil said. Kenny Mukendi, 22, also known as Kenny Vulcan, disappearedon 13 April after telling his girlfriend he was coming home from a recording studio. Police said his backpack containing his wallet, phone and passport was found by surfers the following day, ruling out suspicions of violent crime. Searches for his body were conducted for seven days, ending on Thursday. According to inspector Elen Souto, investigations led to the conclusion that the rapper from Woolwich ""threw himself into the sea from a viewpoint in western Rio"". Ms Souto said Mr Mukendi's family members reported that he had a history of depression. His father and uncle were in Rio and had been following the investigations, she added. Mr Mukendi's cousin, Rais Bona Mapianda, said the musician's girlfriend became worried when she noticed his Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook accounts had all disappeared. More than Â£2,500 has been raised via a fundraising page to help Mr Mukendi's family with the search.

Could the big four become the big three?,"Could the big four become the big three? It's a question many had been asking given how the grocery landscape has been changing. All the main supermarket chains have been looking to find new sources of growth because there's not much of it around their own aisles. Not least because discounters like Aldi and Lidl have been hugely disruptive, stealing customers and eating into their market share. And then looming on the horizon is the mighty Amazon and its desire for a bigger slice of the grocery pie.  It's already squeezing them in non food. Sainsbury's and Asda in merger talks Aldi tops supermarket satisfaction survey Tesco profits up as turnaround continues Tesco shook the industry by buying Booker, Britain's biggest wholesaler, to tap into the growing ""out of home"" food market, where people are eating out or buying prepared food to eat at home or on the go. It would also give Tesco even greater scale and buying power with suppliers. Morrisons has done a tie-up with Amazon to supply the online retailer with hundreds of products.  It has also done a deal to supply McColls, the convenience store chain. And then, of course, Sainsbury's bought Argos, giving it a Â£6bn general merchandise business at a stroke. That left Asda. Owned by Walmart of the US, it had been the poorest performer of the big four. The industry has been wondering what its big strategic move might be. Now we know. Combining the two businesses will greatly increase their bargaining clout, providing better economies of scale, although the two brands will remain. If this merger goes through, it will be the biggest shake up in UK grocery retailing since Morrisons took over Safeway in 2004. But will it pass the competition authorities? Asda's former boss, Andy Clarke, told me last year that the CMA's ruling on the Tesco/Booker deal meant it was ""open season"" for further deals in the sector. But this planned merger will get plenty of scrutiny, for sure. This is perhaps the starkest sign yet of how fast the retail world is changing.

Challenging parole could get easier,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women Victims of crime could find it simpler to challenge parole decisions, as part of a major overhaul of the Parole Board process. Justice Secretary David Gauke is proposing reforms after the decision, which was overturned, to grant parole to serial sex-offender John Worboys. Under the changes victims would get more information about cases and it would be easier to challenge decisions. But ex-Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick said more resources were key. The review of the Parole Board in England and Wales was ordered after the decision to release Worboys was overturned by a judicial review brought by two of his victims. The Parole Board had faced criticism when it emerged that some of Worboys' victims had learned about the decision from the media. It prompteda legal challenge which quashed the decision to grant Worboys' parole, prompting Mr Gauke to force Mr Hardwick to resign. Mr Hardwick, who apologised ""unreservedly"" to the victims, told the BBC that, without extra resources, the proposals would ""be another justice mess up"". He added that the review ""says nothing about the Ministry of Justice failures in the Worboys case"". Worboys ruling quashed as parole head quits The implications of the Worboys judgement A prisoner who is released on parole or licence has to adhere to certain conditions and can be sent back to jail if they don't comply. Currently, those wishing to overturn a Parole Board decision have one option - bringing judicial review proceedings. Under the new proposals, a decision would be provisional for a period of time - allowing for objections to be lodged. The proposals would allow parole decisions to be challenged via a simpler, judge-led process that - ""in some circumstances"" - could be open to the public. In the most high-profile cases, decisions could be automatically reviewed, without anyone having to lodge a challenge. This video can not be played Victim: I will do whatever it takes to keep Worboys behind bars A consultation on the proposals - including who would be eligible to challenge a ruling - will run until the end of July. Before then, the government will introduce legislation requiring the Parole Board to disclose decisions - and the reasons behind them - to anyone in the Victim Contact Scheme. Any journalist or member of the public will also be able to request a decision and the reasons. The Parole Board will provide this information ""subject to a public interest test but with a presumption towards providing the information"". This video can not be played In March, Justice Secretary David Gauke told MPs there were serious failings in the Worboys case Mr Gauke said: ""It is my ambition that the outcome of this process will mean victims have more confidence in the system. ""We have moved at pace to address the shortcomings of the parole system which the Worboys case has brought to light.""

Who was Alfie Evans?,"Alfie Evans had a progressive neurological degenerative condition The tragic case of a 23-month-old boy who died after spending more than a year in hospital attracted widespread media attention. Alfie Evans's parents had been fighting to take the toddler to Rome for further treatment, but a court ruled his life support could be turned off several days ago. Here is how the story unfolded. Alfie was born to parents Tom Evans and Kate James, from Bootle in Merseyside, on 9 May 2016. He was first admitted to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool in December 2016 after suffering seizures and has been a patient in the hospital ever since. Doctors diagnosed a degenerative neurological condition, which they have not been able to identify definitively. Alfie's parents and the hospital clashed over what should happen to Alfie, who had been in a semi-vegetative state for more than a year. His parents said they wanted to fly him to a hospital in Italy but this was blocked by Alder Hey, which said continuing treatment was ""not in Alfie's best interests"". Alfie's parents fought against the withdrawal of ventilation from their son The Alder Hey Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust went to the High Court to seek a declaration that ""continued ventilator support is not in Alfie's best interests and in the circumstances it is not lawful that such treatment continue"". Sitting at the High Court in Liverpool, Mr Justice Hayden began overseeing the case on 19 December. Alder Hey said scans showed ""catastrophic degradation of his brain tissue"" and thatfurther treatment was not only ""futile""but also ""unkind and inhumane"". But his parents disagreed and wanted permission to fly him to the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome in the hope of prolonging his life. The Italian hospital, which has links to the Vatican, suggested operations to help Alfie breathe and keep him alive for an ""undefined period"". The judge said he would make a decision on what was best for Alfie if an agreement was not reached. Charlie Gard's parents faced a similar battle over the care of their baby One of the dilemmas Alfie's case raised is whether doctors are the right people to determine if withdrawing life-support treatment is in ""the best interests"" of a terminally ill child. One of the key arguments presented by his parents was that they should decide what is best for their son. It was the same case made by the parents ofCharlie Gard, the 11-month-old baby who died last year following a similar battle over his treatment. The law in the UK falls somewhere in-between. The 1989 Children's Act makes it clear that where a child is at risk of harm the state can and should intervene. This means that the rights of parents are not absolute and the state has been emboldened to challenge the view of parents where they believe a child's best interests are not being served. If a public body disagrees with the parents' choices, they must go to court in order to override this parental responsibility. Reality Check: When are parents denied the final say? One of the key arguments presented by his parents was that they should decide what is best for their son On 20 February, Mr Justice Hayden said doctors couldstop providing life support for Alfie against his parents' wishes, saying the child required ""peace, quiet and privacy"". Mr Evans said he believed his son was still responsive, telling reporters outside court Alfie was ""improving"". But Michael Mylonas QC, representing the hospital, said: ""One of the problems of this case is they [Alfie's parents] look at him and, barring the paraphernalia of breathing and feeding, he's a sweet, lovely, normal-looking boy who opens his eyes, [and] will smile..."" The hospital asserted that any movements by the child were ""spontaneous seizures as a result of touching"". Mr Justice Hayden ruled in favour of hospital bosses and doctors were set to withdraw ventilation on 23 February before his parents embarked on a lengthy legal battle. Tom Evans had told reporters he thought his son was ""improving"" Alfie's parents refused to give up hope and took the case to the Court of Appeal on 6 March where judges upheld Mr Justice Hayden's decision. On 20 March, the couple appealed to the Supreme Court where justices refused to give the couple permission to mount another appeal. Despite this, their lawyers went to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after exhausting all legal avenues in the UK. But three judges ruled the submission ""inadmissible"", saying they were unable to find any violation of human rights. On 11 April, Mr Justice Hayden then endorsed an end-of-life care plan for Alfie, setting a date to switch off life support. This was the first time Alfie's parents were represented by the Christian Legal Centre (CLC) in court. The CLC is a sister body to Christian Concern and describes itself as an organisation that defends ""individuals and churches who have suffered discrimination and challenges because of their desire to live and work according to biblical beliefs"". The case attracted protests outside Alder Hey Hospital CLC lawyers began a final legal bid to the parents to take control over the treatment of their son on 16 April, claiming he was being ""unlawfully detained"". But this was rejected for a second time bythe Court of Appealandthe Supreme Court. Two days later Mr Evans flew to Rome for a meeting with the Pope, pleading with him to ""save our son"". Despite an urgent application to the ECHR on Monday, judges refused to intervene in the case, prompting angry scenes at Alder Hey Children's Hospital. Mr Evans kissed Pope Francis's hand when he met him at the Vatican Within hours, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs granted 23-month-old Alfie Italian citizenship, hoping it would allow an ""immediate transfer to Italy"". Pope Francis then tweeted his support for the family: ""I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted."" But this last-ditch appeal was dismissed by Mr Justice Hayden who stated that ""Alfie is a British citizen"" who ""falls therefore under the jurisdiction of the High Court"". The Italian Embassy has since clarified it was not trying to challenge any decisions made previously by the British courts. A spokesman described the granting of citizenship as a ""signal"" to the judge that should he change his mind, they are ready to facilitate his transfer to the Italian hospital. A further hearing then took place on Tuesday afternoon in which Mr Hayden said the case had now reached its ""final chapter"". He rejected claims by Mr Evans's lawyers that his son was ""significantly better"" than first thought because he had been breathing unaided for 20 hours after doctors first withdrew life support. Alfie's parents then launched a further appeal against the order stopping them from taking him to Italy, which was heard on Wednesday afternoon by a panel of three Court of Appeal judges, headed by Sir Andrew McFarlane. The judges upheld a ruling preventing the 23-month-old from travelling abroad after life support was withdrawn. Alfie protesters try to storm hospital Reality Check: When can't parents decide? 'Alfie breathing alone for hours', dad says - BBC News Supporters held vigils in support of Alfie's family Throughout its campaign the family has been encouraged by Alfie's Army, a social media campaign whose supporters gathered regularly outside the hospital. But after claims that the protesters wereverbally abusing staff and making visits ""scary"", police launched an investigation into acts of intimidation. Alfie's parents apologised, saying they did not intend to ""harm or cause conflict or upset"". Before their son was granted Italian citizenship, a group of protesters tried to storm the front entrance before police officers formed a line to block the entrance. A group of about 100 Alfie supporters held a candle-lit vigil outside the hospital overnight on Monday. Doctors took Alfie Evans off the ventilator on Monday evening On Monday, Alfie's life support was turned off at 21:00 BST after a High Court judge dismissed fresh submissions heard in private from CLC lawyers. Alfie's father had said his son was continuing to breathe unassisted and his life support should be reinstated. On Tuesday morning, Ms James posted a picture on Facebook showing him sleeping in her arms. ""No matter what happens, he has already proved these doctors wrong. How amazing is he. How beautiful does he look,"" she wrote. Asked on Wednesday if he had given up on taking their son to Italy, Mr Evans said: ""No, we haven't. He's proving them wrong."" ""It's time to give him some grace and dignity and let him go home or to Italy"", he told ITV's This Morning. Alder Hey Children's Hospital said it would not issue any updates on the toddler's condition ""out of respect for the privacy of Alfie and his family"". Speaking outside the hospital on Thursday after a meeting with doctors, Mr Evans praised the staff for how they were treating Alfie. He also thanked supporters Alfie's Army, but asked them to go home.

When are parents denied final say?,"This video can not be played ""I will not consent to my daughter's death"", Shelina Begum told the BBC The parents of five-year-old Tafida Raqeeb, who is on life support, have won permission to take her abroad for treatment. So, why did the family have to go to court to decide what care she receives? Tafida Raqeeb suffered a traumatic brain injury in February as a result of a rare condition. She has arteriovenous malformation, where a tangle of blood vessels with abnormal connections between the arteries and veins risks causing a ruptured vessel. Tafida's mother, Shelina Begum, and her father, Mohammed Raqeeb, wanted to seek treatment in Italy. But the Royal London Hospital, which is caring for their daughter, said releasing her was not in her best interests. A spokesperson for Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said that its clinicians and independent medical experts had found ""further medical treatment would not improve her condition"". It said it was in Tafida's best interests to withdraw treatment. Tafida Raqeeb: Brain-damaged girl can go abroad for treatment Tafida Raqeeb: Parents go to High Court Parents want to get daughter treated in Italy In England and Wales the concept of parental responsibility is set out in law, in the Children Act 1989. This gives parents the responsibility broadly to decide what happens to their child, including the right to consent to medical treatment. But this right is not absolute. If a public body considers that a parent's choices are not in the best interests of their child, and an agreement cannot be reached, it can challenge these choices by going to court. A judge makes the final decision, based on the evidence available. The law does not consider either doctors or parents to be automatically right - instead, it says that the best interests of the child are the deciding factor. A judge will have heard evidence about Tafida's clinical condition, the impact of moving her and the possibility of further treatment having any success, in order to decide the best course of action. At the High Court, Mr Justice MacDonald said ""life-sustaining treatment"" for Tafida must continue. He dismissed Barts NHS Trust's application to withdraw life support. Campaigners outside the courts supporting Charlie Gard's parents Two recent high-profile cases - of babiesCharlie GardandAlfie Evans- also tested the limits of parents' rights to decide what happens to their sick children. Unlike the case of Tafida, both sets of parents lost their cases and were not able to move their children abroad for treatment. Charlie was born on 4 August 2016 with an exceptionally rare genetic condition called encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS) which left him with severe brain damage, partial paralysis and unable to breathe unaided. His parents wanted to take him to the US for experimental treatment, but the hospital treating him felt his life support should be switched off and he should be allowed to die with dignity. Charlie's case eventually reached the highest UK court, the Supreme Court, which ruled that it was likely that Charlie would ""suffer significant harm if his present suffering was prolonged without any realistic prospect of improvement"". His parents applied to appeal this decision in the European Court of Human Rights - which is not part of the EU. The European court said it would defer to the decision of the UK court, and ruled the appeal inadmissible. Charlie died days later. In the case of Alfie, there was no suggestion of new treatment - his parents wanted to transfer him to a hospital in Italy in order to prolong his life on ventilation. He had a degenerative neurological condition and had been in a semi-vegetative state for most of his life. Posters for the campaign to keep Alfie Evans on life support Alfie died at the age of 23 months after a judge ruled that doctors could stop providing life support, against his parents' wishes, In Tafida's case, the lawyer representing her family said there was ""no evidence"" she would suffer pain or harm from being moved. But the NHS trust had said further treatment would be ""invasive"" and ""futile"". At the moment, medical teams can lawfully refuse treatment if they can prove it is not in a child's best interests. Charlie's parents are campaigning for a change in the law which they have dubbed Charlie's Law. They want doctors to have to prove a child would be at risk of ""significant harm"" as a result of the treatment. This test is already used in other areas of child law, for example if a local authority applies to the courts to remove an at-risk child from its parents. Charlie's mother, Connie Yates, says she also wants mediation to be provided to help doctors and parents come to a decision together without going to court.

US hit by lettuce-linked E. coli outbreak,"US health officials are investigating a major E. coli outbreak involving romaine lettuce that has already affected 98 people in 22 states. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said 14 new cases were registered on Friday.,external Ten people have kidney failure and 46 are in hospital. The CDC linked the outbreak to the Yuma growing region in Arizona, advising consumers not eat or buy romaine lettuce from that area. How should you wash salad and vegetables? However, the search for the exact source of the outbreak is continuing, and dozens of farms are being investigated. No deaths have been reported. Coloured scanning electron micrograph of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 The Washington Post reported the story of a 16-year-old girl from California who was rushed to hospital,externalin severe pain and has been diagnosed with kidney failure as part of this outbreak. ""She was trying to cut out junk food and be healthier,"" her mother told the newspaper. Tests have confirmed that the strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 bacteria in the current outbreak produces a type of toxin that causes more severe illness. E. coli: Are the bacteria friend or foe? People usually notice symptoms three to four days after they have been infected, but symptoms can start any time between one and 14 days afterwards and last for up to two weeks. Vegetables and fruits that come in contact with gut and faeces of infected animals are a common source of E. coli-related illnesses. After news of the outbreak was first made public a week ago, people used social media to express their surprise that they were being warned off lettuce, and make jokes about healthy eating.

Golden State Killer suspect in court,"Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, did not enter a plea and was denied bail The former policeman charged with committing a series of murders and rapes attributed to the ""Golden State Killer"" has made his first court appearance in Sacramento, California. Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit, handcuffed to a wheelchair. He was formally arraigned on two murder charges dating back to 1978. Mr DeAngelo is a suspect in 11 other murders and 51 rapes committed across California between 1976 and 1986. He was arrested on Tuesday at his home in Citrus Heights, a Sacramento suburb, after a 40-year manhunt. Investigators linked him to DNA left at crime scenes, in part thanks to a genealogy database designed to trace family histories. DNA sent to such a site by a relative of the murderer may have provided a crucial clue to police. The Golden State Killer, also known as the East Area Rapist, Original Night Stalker, and the Diamond Knot Killer, terrorised communities in central, northern and southern California. Mr DeAngelo spoke only briefly in court to confirm he had a lawyer. He did not enter a plea, and was denied bail.

Elections voter ID scheme 'deeply flawed',"Government plans to make people prove their identity before voting are ""deeply flawed"", the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) has warned. The scheme, which is being piloted in Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking for the local elections on 3 May, is designed to combat voter fraud. But the ERS says the new system could be a ""calculated effort"" to make voting harder for some citizens. Voter ID fraud was ""incredibly rare"", it said. The claim comes after a leaked letter from the Equality and Human Rights Commission warned the change could have a ""disproportionate impact"" on voters from minority groups, who may not possess appropriate ID. ""With millions of people lacking the right photographic ID - and no government plans for a universal, free alternative - this can only mean another barrier for honest voters,"" said ERS chief executive Darren Hughes. Guide: What you need to know about the elections How can you tell who's won the local elections? What to look out for in May's local elections Do voters care more about bins than Brexit? He added: ""Mandatory voter ID is a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It's time for an evidence-based approach instead."" The ERS is part of a coalition of charities and campaign groups opposed to the plans, including Age UK, Stonewall, Liberty and the Salvation Army. On Monday, Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith told the House of Commons no one would need to buy new ID documents to be able to vote. ""We already ask that people prove who they are in order to claim benefits, to rent a car or even to collect a parcel from the Post Office, so this is a proportionate and reasonable approach,"" Ms Smith told MPs. ""Democracy is precious and it is right to take that more robust approach to protect the integrity of the electoral process.""

Stormy case against Trump lawyer on hold,"Stormy Daniels says she was paid $130,000 by Michael Cohen to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with Mr Trump A US judge has halted for 90 days a lawsuit by adult film actress Stormy Daniels against President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Judge James Otero said Mr Cohen's constitutional rights could be endangered if the case proceeded while he was under criminal investigation. Ms Daniels is seeking to end a non-disclosure deal signed over an alleged sexual encounter with Mr Trump in 2006. Mr Cohen had said he would invoke his right to remain silent over the case. He had argued that any statement he made in court could affect a criminal inquiry in New York into his business affairs. As part of the investigation into the Daniels case, the FBI raided Mr Cohen's offices for information, including on the non-disclosure agreement the actress - whose real name is Stephanie Clifford - signed days before the 2016 presidential election. Who is Michael Cohen? Why the raid on Trump's lawyer is a big deal District Judge Otero in Los Angeles said there was ""a large potential factual overlap"" between the civil and criminal proceedings against Mr Cohen. He said that ""would heavily implicate Mr Cohen's Fifth Amendment rights"", in a reference to the Constitution's protection against self-incrimination. Lawyers for Mr Cohen had earlier asked for the Daniels case to be put on hold for three months. They had argued that their client faced a Catch-22 situation: giving evidence in Los Angeles might mean incriminating himself in New York; while invoking his right to silence in the civil suit could undermine his defence there. It states that no individual can be ""compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself"". Invoking the amendment means Mr Cohen will not have to reveal sensitive information in the wider investigation into his affairs. A lawyer for Ms Daniels, Michael Avenatti, earlier described Mr Cohen's move as a ""stunning development"". The raid on Mr Cohen followed a tip-off by the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Russia denies interfering in the election and Mr Trump has denied any collusion. Ms Daniels (centre) says she and Mr Trump had sex on one occasion Separately, Ms Daniels alleges she had a sexual relationship with Mr Trump in 2006. Mr Trump has denied having sex with Ms Daniels or any knowledge of the $130,000 (Â£92,000) payment to Ms Daniels by Mr Cohen during the 2016 presidential campaign. Ms Daniels says she accepted the sum in return for signing the non-disclosure agreement. The president and the porn star: Why this matters This video can not be played 'That's between Trump and his family' During a recent television interview, she said she had been threatened in 2011 in a Las Vegas car park while she was with her infant daughter, and had been told to keep quiet about her alleged relationship with Mr Trump. Ms Daniels is now suing the president in an attempt to invalidate the non-disclosure agreement, which she alleges is invalid because he did not sign it personally. Legal analysts have said that Mr Cohen's $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels could have violated the rules on financing Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

Amber Rudd 'didn't see' migrant memo,"Home Secretary Amber Rudd has apologised for not being aware of ""specific"" migrant removal targets. TheGuardian reported a leaked memo,externaldated last year, which suggested she had been informed of those targets. In a series of tweets, Ms Rudd said she had not seen this memo and apologised for not being aware of the objectives. Ms Rudd added she would make a statement to the House of Commons on Monday in response to ""legitimate questions"" about illegal migration. A Downing Street spokesman said Ms Rudd retained the ""full confidence"" of the prime minister. But Labour's Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott again called for Ms Rudd to resign, saying she was ""hanging by a thread"". BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the home secretary ""was not going anywhere"" on Friday night,  but added that the pressure on her ""was not letting up"". The Guardian reported that the leaked memo from June 2017, copied to Ms Rudd, set out Home Office targets for achieving 12,800 ""enforced returns"" in 2017-18. It also said that they had exceeded targets for ""assisted returns"". On Wednesday, the home secretary had told MPs investigating the Windrush scandal there had not been targets for migrant removal. She later admitted ""local"" targets had been set before telling the Commons on Thursday she had not been aware of them. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Windrush row erupted after it emerged some migrants from Commonwealth Caribbean countries who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s, and their relatives, had been declared illegal immigrants. Some of the Windrush generation have been threatened with deportation, lost their jobs, or been refused access to medical treatment. Home Office 'to scrap removals targets' Home Office 'knew about Windrush issues' Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush: Who exactly was on board? Ms Abbott said Ms Rudd's failure to read ""crucial documents"" meant she was not aware of targets that have ""led to people's lives being ruined"". She added: ""Another apology is not enough, she should take responsibility for chaos in the Home Office and resign."" But Cabinet Office minister, and close ally of the prime minister, David Lidington backed the home secretary publicly, tweeting that Ms Rudd had the ""determination and resourcefulness"" to tackle one of the government's biggest challenges. By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent After an ominous few hours of complete radio silence by the Home Office and Number 10, Amber Rudd tweeted her response to the latest claims about home office targets on illegal migration. The problem was not the policy. Targets are often used by government departments to monitor performance. Labour had many targets of its own on immigration. But Ms Rudd has been under pressure because she appeared to be unaware of what her own department was doing. She has stated her intention to ride out the storm and it has been met with a show of support from Conservative MPs and another statement of ""full confidence"" from Theresa May. A cabinet resignation is the last thing the prime minister would want, especially one which would leave Mrs May further exposed to criticism of her record at the home office and with a high profile Remainer on the back benches. The six-page memo, from Immigration Enforcement Agency boss Hugh Ind, states: ""IE has set a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18, aided by the redistribution of resources towards this area. ""This will move us along the path towards the 10% increased performance on enforced returns, which we promised the home secretary earlier this year."" It adds: ""We have exceeded our target of assisted returns. We set an internal target of 1,250 of these returns for 2016-17â¦ we delivered 1,581."" In her tweets on Friday night, Ms Rudd said the memo was copied to her office - ""as many documents are"" - but she didn't see it.

Half of French museum's art was fakeMore than half of the paintings in a museum in French artist Ãtienne Terrus' birthplace are fake.3m4 minutes agoEurope,"More than 80 paintings said to be by Ãtienne Terrus were fake (this one, of Collioure in the Pyrenees, is real and is now on display) A French museum dedicated to painter Ãtienne Terrus has discovered paintings it thought were by him were fakes. The Terrus museum in Elne in the south of France discovered 82 works originally attributed to the artist were not painted by him. More than half the collection is thought to be fake. The paintings cost about â¬160,000 (Â£140,000). Staff at the museum were not aware of the forgeries until a visiting art historian alerted them. The council in Elne bought the paintings, drawings and watercolours for the museum over a 20-year period. Eric Forcada, an art historian, contacted the museum in the town near Perpignan several months ago to express his doubts about the authenticity of the paintings. The museum assembled a committee of experts from the cultural world, who inspected the works and concluded that 82 of them had not been painted by the Elne-born artist. The news was announced on Friday as the museum opened after a renovation. Could you spot a fake work of art? Italian police chase Modigliani fakers Could you still love a fake piece of art? In interviews on Friday,the mayor of the Pyrenees town, Yves Barniol, said the situation was ""a disaster"",externaland apologised to those who had visited the museum in good faith. Terrus was born in 1857 and died in 1922 in Elne, although he lived most of his life in Roussillon, also in the Pyrenees. He was a close friend of painter Henri Matisse. The authentic Vue CathÃ©drale remains on display Some of the paintings show buildings that were built after Terrus' death,external, France 3 said. The town hall has filed a complaint against those who ordered, painted, or sold the fake paintings. Local police are investigating the case, which they say could affect other regional artists too.

"Daughter left mum to die in own faecesThe body of Cecily Kurtz, 79, was found in clothes she had been wearing for a decade.15h15 hours agoOxford","Emma-Jane Kurtz was a qualified solicitor who specialised in caring for elderly clients The daughter of a woman who died covered in faeces on a sofa in the same clothes she had worn for a decade has been jailed. Emma-Jane Kurtz, 41, of Blackwater Way, Didcot, was found guilty of wilful neglect at Oxford Crown Court. Cecily Kurtz's body was found at the family home in 2014 ""covered from head to toe"" in excrement, police said. Judge Peter Ross said Kurtz would serve at least half of her two-and-a-half year sentence in prison. The rest would be ""served in the community subject to licence"", he added. Emma-Jane Kurtz was a qualified solicitor who specialised in caring for elderly clients. She was charged in April 2017 with wilful neglect after paramedics removed the body of her mother in July 2014. Sentencing, Judge Ross said: ""Cecily Kurtz was left to rot. ""There was a closing of the door both metaphorically and literally."" He said the pictures from the post-mortem examination of Mrs Kurtz ""looked like a photo from a concentration camp"". Cecily Kurtz's body was found slumped on the soiled sofa An investigation was launched after concerns were raised about the condition of her dilapidated property and the state the 79-year-old's body was found in. The court heard how when the paramedics lifted Cecily Kurtz's body, her trousers began to disintegrate, her white underwear was a ""dark mahogany brown"", and excrement and urine had ""engrained"" into her hands, feet and face. Following sentencing, investigating officer Det Con Francesca Griffin said Mrs Kurtz ""was found on a sofa and she had been slumped over with her chin on her knees for five days"". ""She had become incontinent and was covered from head to toe in faeces, had not changed her clothing for a decade and had urine burns."" The officer added: ""Emma-Jane Kurtz said she had gone into the room with her mother three or four times a day. ""There had been many opportunities over months and years to help her and remove her from that situation."" Judge Ross said he recognised Kurtz had mild autism and was undergoing therapy. He said he believed she was capable of showing empathy, but that she had stopped caring for her mother, who had depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Kirsty Allman, senior crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, described Mrs Kurtz as ""emaciated"" at just 39kg. She said she had ""suffered unimaginably"" in ""horrifically squalid conditions"". She added: ""It is rare to come across a case that involves such sheer and blatant neglect against a vulnerable, elderly woman, by someone who was supposed to love and care for her. ""This has been one of the most shocking and sickening cases of neglect I have come across.""

When are parents denied the final say?,"This video can not be played ""I will not consent to my daughter's death"", Shelina Begum told the BBC The parents of five-year-old Tafida Raqeeb, who is on life support, have won permission to take her abroad for treatment. So, why did the family have to go to court to decide what care she receives? Tafida Raqeeb suffered a traumatic brain injury in February as a result of a rare condition. She has arteriovenous malformation, where a tangle of blood vessels with abnormal connections between the arteries and veins risks causing a ruptured vessel. Tafida's mother, Shelina Begum, and her father, Mohammed Raqeeb, wanted to seek treatment in Italy. But the Royal London Hospital, which is caring for their daughter, said releasing her was not in her best interests. A spokesperson for Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said that its clinicians and independent medical experts had found ""further medical treatment would not improve her condition"". It said it was in Tafida's best interests to withdraw treatment. Tafida Raqeeb: Brain-damaged girl can go abroad for treatment Tafida Raqeeb: Parents go to High Court Parents want to get daughter treated in Italy In England and Wales the concept of parental responsibility is set out in law, in the Children Act 1989. This gives parents the responsibility broadly to decide what happens to their child, including the right to consent to medical treatment. But this right is not absolute. If a public body considers that a parent's choices are not in the best interests of their child, and an agreement cannot be reached, it can challenge these choices by going to court. A judge makes the final decision, based on the evidence available. The law does not consider either doctors or parents to be automatically right - instead, it says that the best interests of the child are the deciding factor. A judge will have heard evidence about Tafida's clinical condition, the impact of moving her and the possibility of further treatment having any success, in order to decide the best course of action. At the High Court, Mr Justice MacDonald said ""life-sustaining treatment"" for Tafida must continue. He dismissed Barts NHS Trust's application to withdraw life support. Campaigners outside the courts supporting Charlie Gard's parents Two recent high-profile cases - of babiesCharlie GardandAlfie Evans- also tested the limits of parents' rights to decide what happens to their sick children. Unlike the case of Tafida, both sets of parents lost their cases and were not able to move their children abroad for treatment. Charlie was born on 4 August 2016 with an exceptionally rare genetic condition called encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS) which left him with severe brain damage, partial paralysis and unable to breathe unaided. His parents wanted to take him to the US for experimental treatment, but the hospital treating him felt his life support should be switched off and he should be allowed to die with dignity. Charlie's case eventually reached the highest UK court, the Supreme Court, which ruled that it was likely that Charlie would ""suffer significant harm if his present suffering was prolonged without any realistic prospect of improvement"". His parents applied to appeal this decision in the European Court of Human Rights - which is not part of the EU. The European court said it would defer to the decision of the UK court, and ruled the appeal inadmissible. Charlie died days later. In the case of Alfie, there was no suggestion of new treatment - his parents wanted to transfer him to a hospital in Italy in order to prolong his life on ventilation. He had a degenerative neurological condition and had been in a semi-vegetative state for most of his life. Posters for the campaign to keep Alfie Evans on life support Alfie died at the age of 23 months after a judge ruled that doctors could stop providing life support, against his parents' wishes, In Tafida's case, the lawyer representing her family said there was ""no evidence"" she would suffer pain or harm from being moved. But the NHS trust had said further treatment would be ""invasive"" and ""futile"". At the moment, medical teams can lawfully refuse treatment if they can prove it is not in a child's best interests. Charlie's parents are campaigning for a change in the law which they have dubbed Charlie's Law. They want doctors to have to prove a child would be at risk of ""significant harm"" as a result of the treatment. This test is already used in other areas of child law, for example if a local authority applies to the courts to remove an at-risk child from its parents. Charlie's mother, Connie Yates, says she also wants mediation to be provided to help doctors and parents come to a decision together without going to court.

Who are the Windrush migrants?,"This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Windrush Day has been held on 22 June since 2018, to celebrate the contribution Caribbean migrants and their families have made to the UK. HMT Empire Windrush docked in Tilbury, Essex, in 1948, bringing hundreds of passengers from the Caribbean to the UK. In 2018, it emerged that the government had not properly recorded the details of people granted permission to stay in the UK, and many were wrongly mistreated. HMT Empire Windrush became a symbol of a wider mass-migration movement. People in the Caribbean were invited to the UK to help rebuild post-war Britain. According to the National Archives,which holds the ship's passenger list,,externalthere were 1,027 people on board. More than 800 gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean. Several hundred passengers were Jamaican, but others arrived from islands including Trinidad, St Lucia, Grenada and Barbados. These travellers - and those on other ships which came to the UK until 1971 - became known as the Windrush generation. Many had served in the British armed forces in World War Two. In 1948, the British Nationality Act gave people from colonies the right to live and work in Britain. The government needed workers to help fill post-war labour shortages and rebuild the economy. Caribbean countries were also struggling economically, and job vacancies in the UK offered an opportunity. Many of those who came became manual workers, drivers, cleaners, and nurses in the newly established NHS. In Pictures: The Windrush generation Rare Windrush images on display in art trail This video can not be played What was life like for first-generation Windrush migrants? Commemoration events have been held on 22 June every year since 2018. In 2023, the 75th anniversary of the arrival of HMT Windrush was marked witha series of concerts, exhibitions and seminars across the country.,external King Charles, who held a reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the anniversary, hailed the Windrush generation's ""profound and permanent contribution to British life"". 'We have come a long way': Windrush generation on 75th anniversary New 50p coin to mark Windrush anniversary released Poet Benjamin Zephaniah to get posthumous honour on Windrush Day It is unclear how many people from the Windrush generation are still in the UK, but the number is thought to be in the thousands. They are among more than 500,000 UK residents who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971, according to University of Oxford estimates. The 1971 Immigration Act gave Commonwealth citizens living in the UK indefinite leave to remain - the permanent right to live and work in the UK. This included the Windrush generation, but also people from other former British colonies in South Asia and Africa. This video can not be played ""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael Braithwaite However, in April 2018, it emerged that the UK Home Office had kept no records of those granted permission to stay, and had not issued the paperwork they needed to confirm their status. It had also destroyed landing cards belonging to Windrush migrants, in 2010. Those affected were unable to prove they were in the country legally and were prevented from accessing healthcare, work and housing. Manywere also threatened with deportation. A review of historical cases also found that at least 83 people who had arrived before 1973 had been wrongly deported.

Home Office asks Windrush man's son for DNA test This video can not be played Theresa May's Windrush apology to Caribbean leaders In April 2018, then-Prime Minister Theresa Mayapologised for their treatment.An inquiry was announced and a compensation scheme established. The inquiry, whichreported in March 2020,,externalsaid that the scandal was both ""foreseeable and avoidable"", and criticised ""a culture of disbelief and carelessness"" in the Home Office. The inquiry made 30 recommendations, including: a full Home Office review of the UK's ""hostile environment"" immigration policy appointing a migrants' commissioner establishing a race advisory board Inquiry author Wendy Williamswarned there was a ""grave risk""of similar problems happening again without government action. Then-Home Secretary Priti Patel accepted the recommendations in full. Then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced plans to scrap three recommendations from Wendy Williams's review But in January 2023, then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced the Home office wasdropping three of the commitments: to appoint a migrants' commissioner responsible for ""speaking up for migrants and those affected by the system directly or indirectly"" to give the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration new powers to hold events with people affected to ""listen and reflect on their stories"" Ms Williams criticised the decision, saying the proposals would have raised the ""confidence of the Windrush community"". TheWindrush Compensation Scheme,externalwas established in April 2019, and about 15,000 people were thought to be eligible. But the scheme has been consistently criticised for processing delays, low offers, and unfair rejections reversed on appeal. In 2021, the Home Affairs Committee of MPsfound the scheme had itself become a further trauma for those eligible.It said many of those affected were ""still too fearful of the Home Office to apply"". In April 2023, Human Rights Watchsaid the scheme was ""failing"" victims,and repeated calls for it to be removed from the Home Office's control. In response, the Home Office said it was ""committed to righting the wrongs of Windrush"". The government insisted it would ensure ""similar injustices can never be repeated and [was] creating a Home Office worthy of every community it serves"".

Bjorn, Anni-Frid, Agnetha and Benny pictured at the Swedish production of Mamma Mia in 2016 ""I heard about Abba releasing new songs and I was instantly, like everyone else in the Abba community, really excited to know what the songs were and how they're going to sound. Will it have that 1970s sound or will it be up to date? ""It's brilliant really, because we love Abba's music to death. I just hope they're great songs, I hope they're equivalent to Dancing Queen or Mamma Mia."" He added: ""I know Benny and Bjorn wouldn't release something in this way unless they were good songs."" Speaking to the BBC's Adam Fleming last week, Ulvaeus had hinted that there could be new material. Here's what he said: This video can not be played Bjorn Ulvaeus hints there could be new ABBA material How did the Abba avatar idea come about? We were introduced to an idea by Simon Fuller who is, as you know, an entertainment entrepreneur -  [creator of] the format of American Idol and manager of the Spice Girls and so forth. He came to Stockholm and he presented this idea to us that we could make identical digital copies of ourselves of a certain age and that those copies could then go on tour and they could sing our songs, you know, and lip sync. I've seen this project halfway through and it's already mind-boggling. What does it actually look like? Does it look like a younger you? Yes. Real. And they say once it's finished you'll never see that it's not a human being. And what attracted me personally to this is of course I'm always curious, scientifically-curious and this is new technology and we are pioneers. So I thought, 'Yeah let's go for it,' and you know the other three went for it as well. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

What is the actual format of the tribute show going to be? Is it going to be these Abba-tars all the way though? No, other people as well. And as for the format I'm not entirely sure what it's going to look like but some sort of tribute show with these Abba-tars for want of a better word as the kind of centrepiece. Will you write new material for it? We don't know what the Abba-tars will sing yet but there's lots to choose from of the old stuff and yeah, I'm not ready to say that yet. So there could be new songsâ¦ I'mâ¦ it's up in the air. Stay tunedâ¦ Yeah. Why not reform and have a reunion? The real you, rather than the virtual ones. Yeah, why not? Wellâ¦ it never seemed like a good idea. It's not that we haven't had offers over the years. But somehow we always thought that the Abba that people have in their minds are the once-young and energetic group from the '70s. And we just never felt the urge to go on tour, I guess. On the whole we toured very little. We had like 10 years together and of those 10 years maybe we toured, like, seven months. Not more than that. So to go on tour as a geriatric, I don't know! Formed in 1972, Abba were essentially a Swedish supergroup, consisting of songwriters Ulvaeus and Andersson from The Hep Stars and singers Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, who had scored success as solo artists. But their joint project completely eclipsed their previous successes. After winning the Eurovision Song Contest with Waterloo in 1974, the band sold almost 400 million singles and albums around the world. Mamma Mia!, the musical based on their hits and produced by Ulvaeus and Andersson, has been seen by more than 50 million people. During their most successful period, the band survived marriage break-ups between Ulvaeus and Faltskog, and Lyngstad and Andersson, but they finally called it a day in 1983. Their final recording sessions, in 1982, produced the hits Under Attack and The Day Before You Came, which featured on the compilation album The Singles. Their last public performance came three years later, on the Swedish version of TV show This Is Your Life, which honoured their manager Stig Anderson.

"Elections voter ID scheme 'deeply flawed'Plans to make people prove their identity before voting will create new problems, say campaigners.2m3 minutes agoUK Politics","Government plans to make people prove their identity before voting are ""deeply flawed"", the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) has warned. The scheme, which is being piloted in Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking for the local elections on 3 May, is designed to combat voter fraud. But the ERS says the new system could be a ""calculated effort"" to make voting harder for some citizens. Voter ID fraud was ""incredibly rare"", it said. The claim comes after a leaked letter from the Equality and Human Rights Commission warned the change could have a ""disproportionate impact"" on voters from minority groups, who may not possess appropriate ID. ""With millions of people lacking the right photographic ID - and no government plans for a universal, free alternative - this can only mean another barrier for honest voters,"" said ERS chief executive Darren Hughes. Guide: What you need to know about the elections How can you tell who's won the local elections? What to look out for in May's local elections Do voters care more about bins than Brexit? He added: ""Mandatory voter ID is a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It's time for an evidence-based approach instead."" The ERS is part of a coalition of charities and campaign groups opposed to the plans, including Age UK, Stonewall, Liberty and the Salvation Army. On Monday, Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith told the House of Commons no one would need to buy new ID documents to be able to vote. ""We already ask that people prove who they are in order to claim benefits, to rent a car or even to collect a parcel from the Post Office, so this is a proportionate and reasonable approach,"" Ms Smith told MPs.

Pig brains kept alive without a bodyScientists raise ethical concerns as the brain cells of decapitated pigs are kept alive for 36 hours.,"The scientists used pumps, heaters, and bags of artificial blood to restore circulation to the pig brains Researchers at Yale University have restored circulation to the brains of decapitated pigs, and kept the organs alive for several hours. Their aim is to develop a way of studying intact human brains in the lab for medical research. Although there is no evidence that the animals were aware, there is concern that some degree of consciousness might have remained. Details of the study were presented at a brain science ethics meeting held at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda in Maryland on 28 March. The research has also been reported on this week in the MIT Technology Review.,external The work, by Prof Nenad Sestan of Yale University, was discussed as part of an NIH investigation of ethical issues arising from neuroscience research in the US. Prof Sestan explained that he and his team experimented on more than 100 pig brains. They discovered that he could restore their circulation using a system of pumps, heaters, and bags of artificial blood. As a result the researchers were reportedly able to keep the cells in the brain alive and capable of normal activity for as long as 36 hours. Prof Sestan is said to have described the result as ""mind-boggling"". If this could be repeated with human brains, researchers would be able to use them to test out new treatments for neurological disorders. But Prof Sestan is among the first to raise potential ethical concerns. These include whether such brains have any consciousness and if so deserve special protection, or whether their technique could or should be used by individuals to extend their lifespans - by transplanting their brains when their bodies wear out. The Yale University researchers recognise that their work raises potential ethical concerns In a commentary published in the Journal Nature this week,Prof Sestan and 15 other leading US neuroscientists called for clear regulation to guide them in their work,external. ""If researchers could create brain tissue in the laboratory that might appear to have conscious experiences or subjective phenomenal states, would that tissue deserve any of the protections routinely given to human or animal research subjects?"", the researchers ask in the commentary. ""This question might seem outlandish. Certainly, today's experimental models are far from having such capabilities. But various models are now being developed to better understand the human brain, including miniaturised, simplified versions of brain tissue grown in a dish from stem cells. And advances keep being made."" The researchers say that ways of measuring consciousness need to be developed and strict limits set for them to be able to continue their work with the public's support. Brain back-up venture 'will kill users' Rules of memory 'beautifully' rewritten Would you preserve your brain for future generations? Prof Colin Blakemore, of the School of Advance Study at the University of London, backs the research team's call for a public debate on the issue. ""The techniques, even to a researcher, sound pretty ghoulish - so it is very, very important that there should be a public discussion about this, and not least because the researchers who have some investment can tell the public why it would be so important to develop such techniques,"" he told BBC News. ""There is a paradox here, and that is - the better such methods are at maintaining a whole brain, fully functional but without connection to a body, the more useful that would be for research purposes. But the more likely it would also be for the brain to have some sentience and consciousness, which would be deeply worrying"". This video can not be played WATCH: Can you freeze your body for the future? Prof Blakemore said that he was ""very uneasy about the quest for immortality"" by those considering preserving their brains until surgery advances, in order to place them in a new body. ""Our planet is already overpopulated. You need space for young people and new ideas, and the notion of desperately clinging on to any mechanism possible for human beings living forever, I find very unsavoury.""

"Man jailed for boys' hit-and-run deathsDrug-driver sentenced to nine years for killing brothers Corey and Casper Platt-May, six and two.7h7 hours agoCoventry & Warwickshire","Casper Platt-May, two, and his brother Corey, six, were on a family trip to a park when they were hit by a car A driver who killed two young brothers in a hit-and-run crash while high on cocaine has been jailed for nine years. Casper Platt-May, two, and his brother Corey, six, were struck while on their way to a Coventry park. Robert Brown, 53, of Attwood Crescent, Wyken, who was doing more than 60mph,admitted causing the deathsby dangerous driving. Brown had 30 previous convictions for driving without a licence or insurance, Warwick Crown Court heard. The court was told that the boys' lives had been ""ripped away"" in the incident on 22 February. Robert Brown and Gwendoline Harrison showed no emotion as they were sentenced Midlands Live: GP jailed for assaulting patient; taxi driver fined for refusing to pick up disabled passenger The boys' mother, Louise Platt-May, was unable to speak in court. Her husband Reece read her statement in which she wrote: ""I can't work, my heart is broken, and time will never heal this. I will miss them forever. This monstrous act will haunt me."" Corey (left) and Casper Platt-May were described by Corey's head teacher as ""lovely boys"" Gwendoline Harrison, 42, of Triumph Close, Wyken, who was a passenger in the car, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. She had admitted a charge of assault intending to resist arrest and trying to leave the scene when she ""knew two children lay dying"". ""No sentence can alleviate the pain of the family of these precious children,"" the judge Andrew Lockhart QC said. Brown and Harrison were both found to be four times over the limit for cocaine when the Ford Focus driven by Brown ""ploughed"" into the boys as they crossed Longfellow Road with their family. Corey was thrown into the air by the impact of the collision and landed some distance away, the court heard. The scene of the crash was ""like a bomb had gone off"", the boys' grandfather said West Midlands Police Collision Investigation Unit calculated that Brown was driving at more than 60mph. The crash happened at about 14:00 GMT as the boys were out with their brothers Connor, nine, and Cooper, four. In court, Connor said he ""misses play nights and games"" with his brothers. Casper, he said, was ""really good at running and jumping in puddles"", while Corey was talented at ""football, games, drawing and reading"". The brothers relive the accident, Ms Platt-May said, and suffer nightmares and panic attacks. Judge Lockhart said CCTV of the moment of the collision was ""extremely distressing"" and that he would have ordered against playing it in court. Floral tributes were laid at a memorial service for the brothers at Coventry Cathedral Dashcam footage from a bus showed that members of the public intervened to prevent Brown and Harrison from leaving the ""terrible scene"". One man was attacked by Harrison who hit him over the head with a handbag containing cans of beer as he tried to restrain the pair. They were discovered by police hiding behind a nearby garden shed and arrested. A week before the crash Brown had been released from prison for possessing an offensive weapon. He was disqualified from driving for 10 years after his release, while Harrison was disqualified for 27 months. Ms Platt-May said Brown had ""got off lightly"", and called on the government to ""honour"" the death of her sons with ""tougher punishments for drivers who think they are above the law"". ""Because of [Brown], we are living a life sentence knowing we will never see our boys grow up, while he will be out of prison in just a few years and will be free to continue his life,"" she said. The judge said that the family's dignity would ""shine out like a beacon"".

"Islamic State 'Sim card man' jailedRabar Mala, who lived in Warrington, became what amounted to an IT support worker for the group.9h9 hours agoUK","Rabar Mala: IT support for Islamic State group A man who helped hundreds of jihadist fighters to communicate by activating mobile phone Sim cards for them in the UK has been jailed for eight years. Rabar Mala, who lived in Warrington, became what amounted to an IT support worker for the Islamic State group. He helped hundreds of militants in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey get online by exploiting how social media accounts are registered to phone numbers. Court documents revealed that Mala was living illegally in the UK. It's not clear whether the Home Office had tried to remove him. Mala - originally from Iraq - admitted two counts of possession of property for a terrorist purpose. Manchester Crown Court heard he also had unfulfilled aspirations to attack the Royal Cheshire County Show. Sentencing Mala, Judge Patrick Field QC, said: ""Your support of this cause engaged you in playing a significant role in the dissemination of IS propaganda and facilitating communications between the followers of IS."" Sim cards: Hundreds activated When detectives searched Mala's home they found hundreds of Sim cards and 29 social media accounts on a number of handsets. These contained a vast number of chat groups and more than 700,000 messages, many of which were between IS militants. As they delved deeper into these records, they established that over 18 months, Mala had registered and activated 360 Sim cards - and he used these in turn to help fighters who had no easy means of registering social media accounts without drawing attention to themselves. Every time Mala bought and activated a Sim card in one of his mobile phones, he forwarded the number to his contacts abroad In turn they could use that number to start creating a new social media account These services, such as Twitter, send a verification code to the phone number to make sure it definitely belongs to the user But Mala exploited this security check by forwarding the verification codes he received back in the UK The fighter was then able to trick the system into believing they owned the phone number - and that completed the creation of the account. Mala kept the Sim cards, more than 100 of which had names written on them in Arabic and Kurdish, so that militants could create further accounts as required. He was caught only because police linked him to extremist material posted on YouTube. There's no evidence that Mala made any money from offering the service, leading police to conclude he did it because he believed in the cause. Some of his messages indicated his commitment to the IS group. In one, he urged associates to consider joining him to attack the Royal Cheshire County Show. ""I am in a place... itchy for operation. About half a million people will attend the show,"" he wrote. ""I have about seven tickets - it only needs people and weapon."" The 33-year-old arrived in the UK in 2008. At the time of his arrest last August he had been refused leave to remain. He was working illegally under an assumed name as a car valet. It's not clear why he was still in the UK and whether the Home Office, which has been approached for comment, made any attempt to locate and remove him. ""By day Mala appeared to be a hardworking well-liked man but when he got home he'd dedicate his time to helping promote truly evil causes,"" said Detective Superintendent Will Chatterton of Counter Terrorism Policing North West. ""This was an incredibly complex investigation due to the sheer amount of data the team had to analyse.""

Royal baby named Prince Louis,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have named their third child Louis Arthur Charles. The couple's second son was born at 11:01 BST on Monday at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London, weighing 8lb 7oz. A tweet from Kensington Palace,externalsaid the baby would be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge (pronounced Lou-ee, not Lou-iss). The new prince is fifth in line to the throne. Prince Louis Arthur Charles on the day he was born Louis is one of the middle names of Prince William and of the new prince's brother, George. It was also the first name of Lord Mountbatten - his great-great-great uncle - who was killed by the IRA in 1979. Lord Mountbatten had a strong influence in the upbringing of great-nephew Prince Charles and was described by the latter as ""the grandfather I never had"". Lord Mountbatten profile (from 2015) Arthur is also one of the duke's middle names, and was a middle name of King George VI - the Queen's father. By Sarah Campbell, BBC royal correspondent The pool of names considered suitable for a prince is not large and yet, the wait between birth and public naming suggests there was some indecision about what to call the new baby. It did give punters four days to place their bets, though - and most of them will be disappointed. Louis certainly wasn't the front-runner as far as the bookies were concerned, but it is clearly a family favourite. William and George both have it as a middle name. But with its French and German origins, it will no doubt generate some eyebrow-raising, Brexit-related comment. There will also no doubt be some confusion over the pronunciation (Loo-ee not Loo-iss). What is certain is that we are unlikely to see much of Prince Louis of Cambridge in the coming months and years. His parents remain determined to bring up all three of their children away from the public's gaze as much as is possible. Bookmakers had Arthur as the favourite name for the prince, followed by James and Philip. Historian Judith Rowbotham said Louis is ""not a traditional Windsor name"" and a ""little surprising"" - but said it was still a safe choice for the royals. ""It's very much an acknowledgement of a wider heritage,"" Dr Rowbotham said, adding that it is also ""very much an affectionate tribute"" to the Prince of Wales, who was ""deeply devoted"" to Lord Mountbatten. Lord Mountbatten, who was a mentor to great-nephew Prince Charles, in 1959 Former One Direction star Louis Tomlinson tweeted: ""Young Louis welcome to the world. I'll take you under my wing lad.

Louis is the 71st most popular name for a boy in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The name was 38th out of the top 100 baby names for boys in 2004 but has been declining in popularity. In 2016, 911 newborn boys were named Louis by their parents compared to more than 5,000 who were named George. 'We have baby Louis bragging rights' Where are you on the UK fat scale? Couple to repeat World Cup sticker feat On Thursday evening, Prince William told reporters that they were still deciding on a name, saying: ""I'm working on that."" Earlier in the week, he said Catherine and the baby were ""in good form, luckily"", and added: ""Sleeping's going reasonably well so far, so he's behaving himself, which is good news.""

Learning to love school in a foreign land,"This video can not be played Syrian children learn Turkish so they can join classes with their Turkish peers With millions of Syrians spilling into Turkey as they flee the conflict tearing their homeland apart, schools are at the frontline of the battle to integrate the newcomers into society. On a crisp spring morning in Gaziantep, the playground of Sehit Karayilan school is abuzz with cheers as eight-year-olds face off in a football tournament. Boys compete with passion on the pitch while girls celebrate the goals with songs and laughter. The south-eastern city is only 70km (43 miles) from Syria and almost half the 1,650 students at the school are Syrian. But you wouldn't know it from watching them. They all speak in Turkish. ""I really like this school. I read, learn and I have many Turkish friends. They're great,"" says 10-year-old Eye Kenco in near-perfect Turkish. The Syrian girl says she'd like to stay in Turkey. ""I don't have friends in Syria. It's like home here."" Some 1,650 pupils attend Sehit Karayilan primary school - nearly half of them Syrian Some 3.5 million Syrian refugees have poured into Turkey since the conflict began in 2011. Until recently, many of them preferred makeshift Syrian-only schools with lessons conducted in Arabic. But the government now prioritises integrating Syrian children into Turkish schools, like Sehit Karayilan primary. It is one of thousands that are part of a new project called Promoting Integration of Syrian Children into the Turkish Education System (PICTES), costing 300m euros ($365m) and funded by the EU. Under the model, Syrian children are taught Turkish so they feel able to attend other mixed classes with their Turkish peers. Muhammed Ali Cinar, 25, is one of 5,500 specially trained teachers involved in the scheme. He is clearly popular with students, who run across the playground to hug him. Muhammed Ali Cinar: One of 5,500 specially trained teachers involved in the integration scheme In the classroom, pictures of Turkish and Syrian flags, painted by the children, decorate the walls. But it has not been easy for the youngsters to adjust, says Cinar.  ""The first time I entered the classroom, it was as if I wasn't there. They totally ignored me."" So he employed different tactics. The day the BBC visited, his class was holding a mock song contest in the style of The Voice, with the entire programme played out in Turkish. ""I let them pick the songs and they all chose Turkish tunes,"" says Cinar in surprise. In return, he takes part wearing traditional Arabic costume with a song in Arabic, prompting enthusiastic cheers from his students. Helping Syrian children psychologically is one of the main aims of PICTES. Some 500 counsellors have been deployed to the schools for this purpose. ""The Syrian kids cried if the door was shut too loudly,"" Cinar recalls. ""Once, when they saw the smoke from an aeroplane that passed overhead, they all said 'is that an airstrike or a terror attack?' ""One of my students used to cut himself, fight with his classmates and smoke. He hated Turks,"" Cinar remembers. It took months of effort to get him to co-operate. Cinar says they are now like brothers: ""He says that he loves me the most after [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad."" When Syrian refugees first started coming to Turkey, President Erdogan called them 'guests' - the expectation being that they would stay temporarily. Since then some 300,000 Syrian children have been born in Turkey and it is widely believed many will remain. When asked if the PICTES project is an acknowledgement of this, Cengiz Mete from the education ministry says the goal is to invest in children while they are here. ""If Syrians are going to stay here until the war is over, they have to be in harmony with the society they live inâ¦ We're doing these projects not because we think they will stay but to help them after they return."" Since the project started in November 2016, the number of Syrian children enrolled in Turkish schools has doubled to 344,156 - or about a third of all school-age Syrians in Turkey. The goal is for all of them to join official schools. The education ministry says it will take another three to four years for the project to be sustainable and to get all Syrian children into Turkish schools. They are now in talks to extend EU funding beyond October 2018. The need for greater assimilation of Syrians is clear. An International Crisis Group report says the incidents of violence between Turks and Syrians increased threefold in 2017. At least 35 people died in these incidents. Syrian communities in Turkey tend to cluster together. In some areas in Gaziantep, women are seen in black veils and only Arabic is spoken. The school project is therefore also about integrating these families into Turkish society. ""I've met Turkish and Syrian families who lived in the same building for six years without talking to each other,"" Cinar says. ""Unless they integrate, the Syrian community will become like a ghetto."" He makes a point of visiting his students' homes and takes the family of a Turkish classmate with him each time. That's allowed friendships to flourish outside school, like that of Arif Ince and his twin Syrian classmates Omer and Ali Daba. ""I have both Turkish and Syrian friends,"" says 10-year-old Arif, playing toy darts with the twins at their home. ""There's no difference between us"". Home visits involving Syrians and Turks mean friendships can develop outside school His mother, Ceylan, sips tea with the brothers' parents, communicating with gestures and a few Turkish phrases. She recalls other parents' concerns about the mixed school: ""There was suspicion and prejudice. They said if we were in that situation, Syrians wouldn't help us. They were worried about having too many kids in the classrooms, they said the teachers would focus on the Syrian kids and ignore ours."" Perceptions have changed with time, she adds. But not everyone is happy about the Syrian children's presence in Turkish schools. A bus driver who takes Turkish and Syrian pupils to school thinks they are not grateful enough. ""Most Syrian children are older than their Turkish classmates. They beat our kids. I see it in the bus every day. Instead, they should be grateful they are allowed in the school,"" he says. He is not alone. Many in Turkish society think Syrian refugees have overstayed their welcome. Some, including politicians, argue that Syrian men should return to their country to fight.

Reality Check: Where are all the female statues?,"Millicent Fawcett campaigned for women's right to vote, and now she has a statue in Parliament Square memorialising her and her achievements. But the suffragist's sisters in stone are more likely to be nymphs than intellectuals. The Public Monuments and Sculpture Association (PMSA) is a volunteer-run charity which has been recording public sculpture across the UK for three decades, although its database is not an exhaustive list of every statue in the country. Of the 828 statues it recorded, 174 of them were female - around one in five. But that doesn't tell the whole story. Looking just at named women rather than nameless female figures whittles the figure down to 80. In contrast, out of 534 statues of men, 422 of them are named. Taking Headless Woman (Nymph), Woman Taking off Dress or any of four caryatids out of the equation, even among the 80 female figures with names 15 are allegorical, mythical or otherwise fictional. And 38 of them are royal. Queen Victoria is the woman most commonly memorialised. In total, there were 66 allegorical or fictional female statues compared with 16 fictional males. Fawcett statue unveiled at Westminster Why are there so few female statues? And these fictional men were more likely to be soldiers on war memorials while many female figures were nudes and nymphs. There were 65 male politicians recorded by the PMSA in public spaces around the UK, and zero female politicians. There were other statuary depictions of women alongside men, but almost all of them are allegorical or generic images, rather than honouring a specific woman for her achievements. As the new statue of Millicent Fawcett suggests, there is some movement in the right direction. A PMSA spokesperson said: ""It is worth taking account of the fact that over the past couple of years, there have been significantly more statues of women created, many of which do not yet feature in our database. ""There are currently over 300 statues and memorials in Westminster. In 2005, there were 163 figurative sculptures in central London, which is likely to be closer to 300 now."" The charity plans to produce an accurate statistic for the actual number of statues of women in the UK by 2020. Another way of honouring the contribution made by individuals to society is English Heritage's London Blue Plaques Scheme. That also shows a gender imbalance with just 127 of the 931 plaques honouring women. Since the scheme is based on public nominations, there is a greater opportunity to influence who gets rewarded and the charity has been keen to do this. In 2016, English Heritage launched an appeal calling for more nominations of notable women from history. They note that since then, women have made up just over 50% of the blue plaques shortlisted by the panel.
