El Salvador plans to make Bitcoin legal tender,"President Nayib Bukele says it will make it easier for people to send payments home El Salvador's president says he will make the Bitcoin cryptocurrency legal tender in the country. If his plan is backed by congress, the Central American country would be first in the world to formally adopt the digital currency. It would be used alongside the US dollar, El Salvador's official currency. President Nayib Bukele says Bitcoin will make it easier for Salvadorans living abroad to send payments home. ""In the short term, this will generate jobs and help provide financial inclusion to thousands outside the formal economy,"" Mr Bukele told a Bitcoin conference in Florida, adding that it could also boost investment to the country.

He said he would send the legislation to congress next week. Should it pass, the move would open up financial services to the 70% of Salvadorans who do not have bank accounts, the president said. Family help that's bigger than aid budgets What is Bitcoin? El Salvador country profile El Salvador's economy relies heavily on remittances, or money sent home from abroad, which make up around 20% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). More than two million Salvadorans live outside the country, but they continue to keep close ties to their place of birth, sending back more than $4bn (Â£2.9bn) each year.

Current services can charge fees for such transfers, which can take days to arrive and sometimes need to be picked up in person, according to the announcement. ""This will improve lives and the future of millions,"" Mr Bukele said. He did not give more details about how the policy would work. Bitcoin, a virtual asset with no direct connection to the real economy, has seen large fluctuations in value over the years. Most of the world's central banks are looking into the possibility of creating their own digital currencies. In April, the Bank of Englandannounced it was looking into creating a digital money that would exist alongside cash and bank deposits. Strike, a mobile payments app set up in El Salvador, is working on the introduction of Bitcoin in the country, Reuters reports. ""Adopting a natively digital currency as legal tender provides El Salvador the most secure, efficient and globally integrated open payments network in the world,"" founder Jack Mallers said. Rohan Grey, an expert with the Digital Currency Global Initiative, told BBC World Mr Bukele was ""a young president trying to capitalise on a popular image"". ""There is a lot of PR value in announcing something like this even if you haven't worked out all the details,"" he said. Mr Grey cautioned more generally that a country adopting a cryptocurrency as legal tender would give considerable control ""to a network that isn't stable, doesn't have accountable actors and doesn't have track record of providing the kind of price stability and liquidity that a currency is supposed to provide"". The plan announced by President Nayib Bukele would make the small Central American nation the first in the world to adopt the digital currency, Bitcoin, as legal tender alongside the dollar. It would be a unique and bold step, the first by a sovereign country, and that may well be part of the attraction for Mr Bukele, a young, media-savvy and very popular leader who worries Washington over his increasingly autocratic tendencies. There are still many questions over how the digital currency would become the country's legal tender - a major overhaul of El Salvador's financial infrastructure would be needed with Bitcoin at its heart. But, in essence, it appears that is what Mr Bukele is proposing. Much of El Salvador's developing economy is based on remittances from abroad and the move to a digital currency may allow family members to avoid the costly fees involved in sending money home each month. Either way, it is a move which is likely to bolster Bitcoin's image as the ""currency of the future"" and President Bukele's standing among his supporters as an innovator.

Child migrant legal threat to Home Secretary,"So far this year, 242 child migrants have arrived on Kent shores Child migrants arriving at Dover may be turned away by Kent County Council (KCC) within days as its services are overwhelmed, the authority has said. KCC has taken its first steps in legal action against Home Secretary Priti Patel and wants her to make other councils take ""their fair share"". It comes days after Ms Patel lost a High Court legal fight over theNapier Barracks asylum centrein Folkestone. The Home Office said it continued to encourage more areas to do their part. Bridget Chapman, of Kent Refugee Action Network, said local authorities across the country would be willing to take child asylum-seekers into care if the government provided greater funding. ""Councils aren't going to accept the responsibility without it being funded properly,"" she said. ""These young people are incredible,"" she said. ""With the right foundation they are going to contribute an enormous amount to our communities."" Children arriving by boat risk overwhelming services, KCC said Conservative council leader Roger Gough said it was ""a repeat of the same crisis of nine months ago"", when services for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children reached breaking point. With more young people arriving this year compared to last, he said the pressures were ""severe"". He told the BBC: ""We are now in a situation which is not sustainable, and we do not wish to... suspend our legal duties, but that is very close to where we are,"" he added. So far this year, 242 lone child migrants have arrived on Kent shores and been passed to children's services, but only 52 have been moved to other local authorities under a voluntary transfer scheme, KCC said. It said the authority is now caring for 403 unaccompanied minors - nearly double the number the government said it was safe to have. Council has 'no capacity for more child migrants' How many migrant children cross the Channel? Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? Mr Gough wants the existing voluntary transfer scheme to be compulsory, because ""those others who do not participate frankly put a lot of pressure those who do"". A proposed judicial review claims there has been a ""refusal and/or continuing failure by the Home Secretary to exercise her powers to prepare a mandatory scheme"". Border Force may be asked to take youngsters directly to other local authorities Mr Gough said: ""We have not seen what is most needed: a robust National Transfer Scheme that prevents port authorities such as Kent coming under unmanageable pressure."" He said Kent would no longer be able to safely accept new arrivals before the end of the week. From that point, Border Force will be asked to place youngsters directly into other local authorities around the country from Dover port. Roger Gale, the Conservative MP for North Thanet, said: ""Kent basically is now full. We cannot safely take any more, so the Home Secretary has got to do something about it."" He said Ms Patel faced two questions. ""Why has nothing been done over the last nine months? And what is she going to do about it?"" he asked. KCC has served a formal Letter Before Action to the Home Office. The council said without any substantive response to its proposals by 17 June, it would issue a claim for judicial review. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: ""We recognise the longstanding role that Kent County Council has played in supporting unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and are extremely grateful for their contribution. ""We continue to encourage more areas to join the National Transfer Scheme and do their part. ""We have already consulted on how to improve the scheme to make it fairer, the outcome of which will be published very shortly."" While there was a rise in young migrants entering KCC's care last year, the total number of unaccompanied children seeking asylum across the UK fell by more than 1,300. Kent believes it can no longer safely accept new arrivals From April 2020 to March 2021, 2,044 asylum claims were made by lone children, compared to 3,530 in the previous 12 months. The majority of asylum-seeking children arrive with their families, Home Office figures show. The number of people reaching the UK in small boats rose in 2020 due to a reduction in flights and ferries during the pandemic, but the ""overall organised immigration crime threat reduced"", theNational Crime Agency,externalhas said. ""According to the Home Office, numbers are down on last year, but the method of arrival has changed and it's just more visible,"" Ms Chapman said.

Covid vaccine stickers come to dating apps in UK,"Tinder will offer a selection of Covid vaccine status badges including ""vaccinated"" and ""vaxing soon"" UK online daters will be able to choose to display a badge on their profiles to show if they have been vaccinated against Covid or support the jab drive. However there will be no way of verifying whether those displaying the badge have genuinely had the vaccine. Tinder, Match, Hinge, Bumble, Badoo, Plenty of Fish, OurTime and Muzmatch have all signed up to the scheme, in partnership with the UK government. The idea of vaccine badges on dating apps was launched in the US in May. Some of the apps are including additional incentives for those who say they are vaccinated - such as free credits or access to premium features that usually cost extra, like profile boosts, virtual rose giving and ""super likes"". Bumble will also enable its members to share pandemic dating preferences such as views on social distancing, mask-wearing and whether users are comfortable meeting in crowded places. Iâm under 30 - which Covid vaccine will I get? Bumble's profile includes ""Covid preferences"" in terms of how a potential date might work. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi described the new initiative as an ""incredible asset"" to the UK's Covid-19 vaccination programme. A recent YouGov poll of nearly 5,000 UK adults,externalfound that only 28% of those who responded said they would not date someone unvaccinated, with 2% saying they would not date someone who had received the jab. In England and Wales people aged over 30 are now eligible for the vaccine. In Northern Ireland and Wales it is available to everyone over 18. The government says thataround 40 million people have received at least one of the two doses so far. However, there are some concerns around vaccine status and privacy. Last monththe NHS revised its booking system in Englandafter complaints that it was possible to work out how many jabs an individual had received, by inputting basic details such as their name and postcode. Privacy campaigner Dr Stephanie Hare said that because the dating app badge is voluntary and no official documentation is required, the privacy risk is low. ""It's already very common in the gay male dating community to share HIV status,"" she added. LGBTQ-focused dating apps such as Grindr and Scruff have so far not been named in the government's Covid jab scheme. Who can get an NHS Covid jab this autumn?

Cricketer Robinson suspended for offensive tweets,"This video can not be played 'I deeply regret my actions' - Robinson apologises for offensive tweets England pace bowler Ollie Robinson has been suspended from international cricket pending an investigation into historical racist and sexist tweets. The posts from 2012 and 2013 were revealed while he was making his England debut during the drawn first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. Robinson, 27, has been dropped from the squad for the second Test, which begins on Thursday at Edgbaston. He will leave the England camp on Sunday and return to his county Sussex. The tweets, posted when Robinson was aged 18 and 19, came to light on Wednesday afternoon, while he was on the field. After play, he apologised, saying he was ""embarrassed"" and ""ashamed"". ""I am sorry, and I have certainly learned my lesson today,"" he said. ""I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and I'm not sexist."" Robinson apologises for racist and sexist tweets England turn down chase to grind out drawn against New Zealand At the conclusion of the match on Sunday, England captain Joe Root said the tweets were ""not acceptable"". ""Ollie has made a huge mistake,"" Root told BBC Test Match Special. ""He fronted up to the dressing room and the rest of the world, and he's very remorseful."" Robinson returned match figures of 7-101 and scored 42 in his only innings against New Zealand. Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Sport: ""He has got to go away, learn and educate himself - and become a better person for it. ""In terms of what he has delivered on the cricket field, he is a Test-match player. He will certainly be back playing Test cricket."" On the morning his tweets were shared online, England shared a 'moment of unity' with the tourists, with Root's side wearing T-shirts carrying messages of anti-discrimination. ""It's a lesson to everyone in the game,"" added Root. ""More has to be done, that continued education and learning about how to behave in society and within our sport. ""We've started doing a lot of good work as a team and we'll continue to do that. We want to make the game as inclusive and diverse as we possibly can and we'll continue to keep looking at finding ways to make that possible."" The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) must determine if Robinson was contracted at the time of the tweets, which cover a period when he left Kent and joined Yorkshire. If he did not have a contract, the investigation will be carried out by the ECB. If Robinson had a county contract at the time, the Cricket Discipline Commission, which is independent from the ECB, will carry out the investigation.

Has pandemic made breastfeeding easier or harder?,"Stacey Davies tandem breastfeeds her 19-month-old and four-year-old and supports other breastfeeding mothers Lack of support during the pandemic has left many breastfeeding mothers feeling lost, a peer support worker has said. Stacey Davies, who breastfeeds two of her four children, said the ""affection and camaraderie"" of support groups could not be replicated online. The Welsh government saidits data,externalshowed breastfeeding rates were in fact ""the highest on record in 2020"". An academic said lockdowns had been ""really tough"" for some but others had a better breastfeeding experience. The Stats Wales data shows, for the last three months of 2020, 26.7% of mothers reported breastfeeding their baby at 6 months, up from 23.2% for the same period in 2019. From July to September 2020, that figure was 26.4%, up from 22.5% for the same period in 2019. Charley Greatrix says she has been""muddling through with help of Facebook pages"" Charley Greatrix, 27 lives in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, with her 16-month-old son Theo. She gave birth to him in the Midlands in January 2020 and moved home to Wales after splitting from her husband weeks later, just before the first lockdown in March 2020 . She said it was a ""really tough"" start, with no face-to-face breastfeeding support and ""muddling through with help of Facebook pages"". Covid restrictions allow up to30 people to meet for organised indoor activitiesbut many breastfeeding support groups are still being held virtually. ""Other than from family members, I haven't had much emotional support with it and it has been a difficult time,"" she said. But she said she was glad she had continued to breastfeed: ""Breastfeeding has kept us sane through the pandemic,"" she said. ""When he's needed comfort it's been there, I think he's probably fed a lot more than he would have if we were out and about because the opportunity was always there."" She said online support group had been""really important"". ""Any kind of questions you've got, any concerns you can put straight up on there and within two or three minutes you've got three or four responses... ""There's a wealth of experience there and you get feedback instantly, although they can't give medical advice, their experiences say it all really."" She said some days the online groups had kept her going, but now she is ready for some face-to-face interaction. ""I've been watching out for when people will be meeting up with these groups because it is so important, especially for me. ""I don't really recall seeing many people publicly feeding older children - that's something I need to see because I need to realise I'm not doing the wrong thing by letting him wean himself when he's ready."" Katherine Jones says breastfeeding has been ""really lonely"" without in-person support groups Katherine Jones, 37, gave birth to James, now six-and-a-half months, during thefirebreak lockdown. James was born five weeks early and she said she had endured the additional stress of not being able to buy him clothes while he had been in special care (SCBU) because non-essential shops had been closed and at the time supermarkets hadnot been allowed to sell clothing. He was initially tube-fed a combination of her breastmilk and formula and midwifery staff helped her establish her supply using a pump andskin-to-skin contact. Returning home to Aberkenfig in Bridgend was ""really, really difficult"" in the first few weeks, she said. She said two community midwives who were ""brilliant"" and visited to help her with positioning. ""It was really lonely with regards to people like family members who couldn't come and help me... I just struggled with finding time to shower, finding time to eat."" She said she had been lucky to have been part of a WhatsApp group with other new mums she'd met through pregnancy yoga and some had been second-time mums able to offer breastfeeding advice. ""If I hadn't done that yoga class, honestly I don't know what mental state I'd be in now,"" she said. Restrictions have also meant she has not become accustomed to breastfeeding outside her home. ""When things started to open up I suddenly realised I hadn't been feeding in public and I don't know how I'm going to cope with this - I've been overthinking it and I've just got to do it but anxiety did get quite high about it."" But she said there had been positives too. ""It's allowed me to do nothing other than sit there with a Netflix and have lots of skin-on-skin time, establish feeding... because of lockdown, I was able to just go 'I'm just going to stay in bed all day'. So that's been a massive positive."" Stacey's four-year-old has a go at tandem nursing like him mum Mother-of-four Stacey Davies, 31, from Port Talbot, is currentlytandem feeding,externalher 19-month-old and four-year-old and training with her heath board to be a peer support to other breastfeeding mothers. She said: ""I had a lot more chance to just sit and 'boob' freely because there's been no worries about doing school runs and being out and about... we've just been at home."" But she said she had missed the ""affection and camaraderie"" of in-person groups. She has found providing peer support a totally different experience during the pandemic: ""Normally you'd be going to groups, you'd be seeing people, you'd be seeing your mentor, whereas now I've had to do everything online."" She said she sympathised with some of the first-time mums she had met online. ""They just seem a bit lost - we're all on the internet and that's fine but there's no actual person sitting there listening to you and, as a new mother, sometimes you just need someone, a human in front of you just listening and appreciating and bouncing stories off."" Richmal Eden says she does not know any other breastfeeding mothers Richmal Eden, 24, from Bridgend, gave birth to Soren, aged 13 months, during the first lockdown. ""On balance, it hasn't been great to be honest,"" she said. ""We've struggled with a lack of face-to-face support, particularly, peer support from other breastfeeding mums. ""I don't know any other breastfeeding mums and I've found that quite difficult."" Soren has been treated fortongue-tie. ""He was four months old before we realised that was causing a lot of our issues and that was suggested to me on a one-to-one Zoom call with a La Leche League leader."" She has also relied mainly on Facebook groups and has also seen infant feeding coordinators. ""I know lots of people say it's great they didn't have visitors so they were able to focus on feeding the baby but I don't know - I suppose that is a positive, but I've actually found it quite difficult."" She added: ""I don't have anything I'm looking forward to more than going to an actual in-person  breastfeeding support group - I can't wait."" Prof Amy Brown has been researching the experiences of breastfeeding mothers during the pandemic Prof Amy Brown, a professor of child public health from Swansea University, said: ""Mothers seem to have one of two experiences - so they either had a really tough time or they actually had a much better time. ""Those already in more privileged positions and well-supported anyway had the much better time and those who were struggling in all different ways, had a much worse time."" She and Dr Natalie Shenker from Imperial College Londonpublished a paper in September,externalwhich found increased time at home, less pressure and fewer visitors had been a positive for some breastfeeding women in the UK. It also found others had a more challenging experiences, such as  struggling to get support, worrying about the safety of feeding and feeling isolated, which made them more likely to stop breastfeeding before they were ready. The paper also said women from black, Asian and minority ethic (BAME) groups and those with a lower education were more likely to be represented in this group. A Welsh government spokeswoman said: ""We recognise that the pandemic has added additional pressures to families. ""Breastfeeding rates were the highest on record in 2020. ""Midwives and health visitors continued to provide support to women to breastfeed throughout the pandemic. In-person support groups are now also restarting.""

Robinson suspended for offensive tweets,"This video can not be played 'I deeply regret my actions' - Robinson apologises for offensive tweets England pace bowler Ollie Robinson has been suspended from international cricket pending an investigation into historical racist and sexist tweets. The posts from 2012 and 2013 were revealed while he was making his England debut during the drawn first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. Robinson, 27, has been dropped from the squad for the second Test, which begins on Thursday at Edgbaston. He will leave the England camp on Sunday and return to his county Sussex. The tweets, posted when Robinson was aged 18 and 19, came to light on Wednesday afternoon, while he was on the field. After play, he apologised, saying he was ""embarrassed"" and ""ashamed"". ""I am sorry, and I have certainly learned my lesson today,"" he said. ""I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and I'm not sexist."" Robinson apologises for racist and sexist tweets England turn down chase to grind out drawn against New Zealand At the conclusion of the match on Sunday, England captain Joe Root said the tweets were ""not acceptable"". ""Ollie has made a huge mistake,"" Root told BBC Test Match Special. ""He fronted up to the dressing room and the rest of the world, and he's very remorseful."" Robinson returned match figures of 7-101 and scored 42 in his only innings against New Zealand. Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Sport: ""He has got to go away, learn and educate himself - and become a better person for it. ""In terms of what he has delivered on the cricket field, he is a Test-match player. He will certainly be back playing Test cricket."" On the morning his tweets were shared online, England shared a 'moment of unity' with the tourists, with Root's side wearing T-shirts carrying messages of anti-discrimination. ""It's a lesson to everyone in the game,"" added Root. ""More has to be done, that continued education and learning about how to behave in society and within our sport. ""We've started doing a lot of good work as a team and we'll continue to do that. We want to make the game as inclusive and diverse as we possibly can and we'll continue to keep looking at finding ways to make that possible."" The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) must determine if Robinson was contracted at the time of the tweets, which cover a period when he left Kent and joined Yorkshire. If he did not have a contract, the investigation will be carried out by the ECB. If Robinson had a county contract at the time, the Cricket Discipline Commission, which is independent from the ECB, will carry out the investigation.

Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7,"The UK gives much of its humanitarian aid to Yemen, with projects similar to this one run by a Kuwaiti charity Families are going hungry and girls are missing school because of the UK's cuts to foreign aid spending, dozens of charities and academics have warned. Charities including Oxfam and ActionAid UK said they had caused ""devastation"" that could undermine the UK's credibility at the upcoming G7 summit. In a letter to Boris Johnson, they said there was ""no justifiable economic need"" for cuts of almost Â£4bn a year. The government says it will still spend more than Â£10bn on foreign aid in 2021. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show it was a ""temporary"" reduction, which was ""entirely reasonable"" given that the pandemic had caused a ""once-in-300-year economic interruption"". Foreign aid: What is it used for? Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside? More Conservative rebels join bid to reverse cuts The letter comes ahead of a potential Commons vote on Monday when more than 30 rebel Tory MPs, including former Prime Minister Theresa May, hope to reverse the cuts. Last year, ministers decided to reduce this year's spending on overseas aid from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%,saying it was hard to justify,given that the UK faces record levels of peacetime borrowing to cope with the pandemic. This video can not be played Sir Bob Geldof: ''We don't take the piece of bread from that child's mouth in Yemen'' But charities including Save the Children, WWF UK and Cafod said the reduction had already led to the closure of feeding centres and clinics - and forced the cancellation of projects including water sanitation and training for healthcare workers. The letter - signed by more than 1,700 academics, charities and business leaders - was shared with the BBC as the UK prepares to welcome leaders from the G7 group of major advanced economies to a summit in Cornwall. ""While other G7 countries have stepped up their aid budget, the UK is the only one to have rowed back on its commitments,"" it said. The letter added that doing this during the pandemic was a ""double blow to the world's poorest communities"". The UK gave Â£1.5bn humanitarian aid - short-term help in an immediate crises - in 2019, in in projects like this one by the World Food Programme in Yemen Foreign aid is resources given from one country to another. It can involve a transfer of things like food or equipment, or even people to provide training and medical help. In 2020, the UK spent Â£14.5bn on aid, meeting its 0.7% target,according to provisional data,external. Overall, the top five recipients were Pakistan, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Yemen and Nigeria, with almost all the money going to countries in Africa and Asia. The government has pledged to restore aid spending to 0.7% ""when the fiscal situation allows"" - but it has not specified a date. Ministers cut the spending without changing a 2015 law which made the 0.7% target legally binding. More than 30 Conservative rebels, including former ministers Damian Green, Stephen Crabb and Johnny Mercer, say they are planning to reverse the cuts on Monday by voting to amend legislation related to a newscientific research agency. Their amendment - which will need the support of more Tory MPs to pass - would oblige the agency to make up any shortfall from the 0.7% target from January 2022. It will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether the amendment is within the scope of the bill and whether it should be put to a vote. Anti-poverty campaigner Sir Bob Geldof told the Andrew Marr Show said of the aid cut: ""It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense economically, financially, politically, diplomatically, morally or in the humanitarian consequences of it. ""And I'm very much afraid that something that we're told is temporary will become permanent."" Mr Hancock said: ""The decisions that the government has taken around this are entirely reasonable. We face a once-in-300-year economic interruption."" He added that much of the work done by the UK, including distributing vaccines to other countries ""at cost"", did not officially ""count as aid"".

LiveLiveDelta variant is around 40% more transmissible8 minutes ago,"The Delta variant is 40% more transmissible, the health secretary says, adding that protection against it is just as good with two doses of a vaccine Matt Hancock says the variant, first identified in India, makes life more challenging, and the government is ""open"" to delaying England's 21 June unlocking if needed Asked if measures such as face coverings and working from home could continue in the long term, he says he ""wouldn't rule that out"" Vaccination is being opened up to the under 30s in England from next week Boris Johnson will urge wealthy countries to commit to vaccinating the world against Covid-19 by the end of next year, at a G7 summit Pupils in England should take Covid tests following the half-term break, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson The Bafta Television Awards will be held later, with some stars attending in person and some virtually The UK reports another 5,341 positive tests for coronavirus, and 4 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis We're bringing the coronavirus live page to a close for today, but we'll be back with more coverage tomorrow. Today's writers were Lauren Turner, Joshua Cheetham and Joseph Lee.  The page was edited by Holly Wallis. Queues formed at a vaccine centre in Harrow, offering jabs to all over-18s We're wrapping up today's live coverage shortly. But before we go, here's a look back at some of the main stories today: Amid outbreaks of the new Delta variant in parts of the country, the daily total of positive tests is rising - reaching an average of 4,785 over the last seven days. But so far, that has not translated into a significant change in the number of people in hospital. That's remained pretty steady, with 932 Covid-19 patients at the last count. That's also true of the daily reported toll of people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test, which has also remained low at an average of 8 over the last seven days. That may be down to the protection acquired through the UK's vaccination programme, which has now means 40,333,231 people have had at least one dose and 27,661,353 are fully vaccinated. There are more second doses being given out daily than first doses, as the UK aims to boost the protection of vulnerable members of the population against the Delta variant. A coronavirus variant, first identified in India, is causing a spike in cases in some parts of the UK and experts are worried. Experts say this variant,named Delta by the World Health Organization, is more transmissible than even the ""Kent"" or Alpha variant, and is now dominant in the UK. It could pose ""serious disruption"" to the final stage of lockdown easing in England on 21 June, the prime minister has said. There are a few ""India"" variants, but one called B.1.617.2 appears to be spreading more quickly in the UK. Surge testing has been deployed in some areas, including Bolton and Blackburn, to identify infections - but it may not be stopping the spread. Second jabs for all over-50s (and the clinically vulnerable) in England are now being brought forward to protect more people, faster. Second doses will come eight weeks after the first, rather than 11-12 weeks. Read more here. Renowned American author Naomi Wolf has been suspended from Twitter after spreading a range of unfounded theories about vaccines on her account, Dr Wolf, well known for her acclaimed third-wave feminist book The Beauty Myth, claimed in one tweet that vaccines were a ""software platform that can receive uploads"". She also compared Dr Anthony Fauci, the top Covid adviser in the US, to Satan. Her suspension has been welcomed by many on the platform. But some have voiced concern that her suspension was stifling free speech. Read more here. There were another 676,991 vaccine doses given out yesterday, according to official figures, with 203,613 first doses and 473,378 second doses. It means 40,333,231 people have now had at least one dose and 27,661,353 have had both doses. That brings the total UK uptake to 76.6% of over-18s for first doses and 52.5% for both doses. The UK has reported another 5,341 positive tests for coronavirus, meaning that the total number of positive tests over the last week has risen by 49% compared to the previous seven days. Weekend figures are sometimes lower due to reporting delays. Last Sunday, there were just 3,240 new confirmed cases recorded. There were also 4 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,the figures show.,externalOn Saturday, 11 deaths were reported. Police were pelted with objectsby ""hostile"" ravers as they attempted to shut down an event attended by 200 people. Essex Police were called to a unlicensed music event in a field off Forest Drive in Theydon Bois, Essex, at 23:00 BST on Saturday. The force said a DJ had been playing loud music and officers were targeted as they tried to engage with revellers. Officers seized a set of decks, speakers and a generator, while one man was arrested on suspicion of a breach of coronavirus legislation. This video can not be played Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh: ""Vaccinating the world protects against variants"" Scotland should focus on the ""huge gap"" in global vaccine rollout before vaccinating teenagers, a public health expert has said. Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she hoped the UK would ""step up"" to donate vaccines to poorer countries. It comes after the UK regulator approved use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15 on Friday. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is yet to give its advice on the vaccine use for children. Prof Bauld toldBBC Scotland's The Sunday Showthat a decision to vaccinate teenagers in Scotland could be ""controversial"" globally. ""[With] the huge gap in the vaccine rollout around the world, many people, including some of my colleagues, are saying let's not press ahead with this,"" she said. ""Let's focus on helping out low and middle-income countries. So we wait to see what the decision is."" She also said vaccinating the rest of the world could help protect against the emergence of new variants. Read more. Matt Hancock was on the Andrew Marr Show earlier, when he said the date for easing further restrictions could be delayed in England. Watch the clip below: This video can not be played Matt Hancock 'open' to delaying 21 June lockdown end Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check, Delhi About 12,000 cases of a condition known as ""black fungus"" have been reported in India, mostly in patients recovering from Covid-19. This severe infection is normally very rare and has a mortality rate of about 50%. Some medical experts have suggested India has seen cases growing because of the high prevalence of diabetes. But are other factors at work and what is happening in other countries? Read more here. The pace of Europe's Covid-19 vaccination campaign has picked up and in many countries infection rates have been falling.

Read our explainer on the lockdown rulesin force across various countries in the continent. This video can not be played 'I had breast cancer and then Covid' A woman who caught coronavirus after recovering from breast cancer has described how she felt so nervous she struggled to leave her house following her illness. Katy Meldrum, from Market Harborough in Leicestershire, tells her story above. It will be a while until we see the end of Covid, the World Health Organisation's special envoy on the disease has told Sky News. ""Eradication is currently not a reasonable target for the world,"" Dr David Nabarro said. ""Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we're going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future,"" he added. ""This virus isn't going away anytime soon, there will be variants emerging."" His comments were echoed by Dame Anne Johnson, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, also on the channel. Dame Anne said people would not want the lifting of restrictions to carry on being delayed; instead the aim must be to minimise the amount of severe diseases that the virus causes. She added that any reopening would be a ""very finely judged decision"" and that next week would be ""absolutely critical"" for gathering data on infections in the UK to decide whether the lockdown should be extended. A man who spent 20 years living in destinations around the world has ditched jet-setting for life on a narrowboat. Cameron Forbush, from Leicester, ran a scuba diving school in the Philippines before the Covid-19 pandemic.

The government announced that it would start issuing the electronic passes from 7 June. Those who have been fully vaccinated will be able to download their passes from a national database. Users will receive a personalised QR code to be shown to the authorities when prompted, and it can be downloaded onto a smartphone or printed out. A government statement obtained by Lakome said the passport would allow holders to travel across Morocco and abroad without restrictions.

Profile: The Duchess of Sussex,"Meghan Markle made her name as an actress, campaigner and blogger before marrying Prince Harry in May 2018 and becoming the Duchess of Sussex. Before meeting Prince Harry, she had been best known for playing lawyer Rachel Zane in US TV drama Suits. When she became a member of the Royal Family, she gave up her acting career - and immersed herself in the life of a working royal, using the platform to highlight the charities and causes close to her heart. She became a mother in May 2019 but within a year she and Prince Harry had stepped away as working members of the Royal Family and started a new life in North America. She and Prince Harry had their second child, Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, in June 2021. Born Rachel Meghan Markle on 4 August 1981, she grew up in a prosperous part of Los Angeles. Her mother's home is in an area known as the ""Black Beverly Hills"". Meghan went to a private primary school in Hollywood and started campaigning for gender equality at an early age. At 11, she wrote a letter to the then US first lady, Hillary Clinton, lamenting a washing-up liquid's TV ad strapline: ""Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans."" Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey in March 2019 Within a month, manufacturers Procter and Gamble had changed the word ""women"" to ""people"". ""It was at that moment that I realised the magnitude of my actions,"" she later said. ""I had created my small level of impact by standing up for equality."" At 15, she was volunteering in soup kitchens as her studies continued at a girls' Roman Catholic college, and she graduated from Northwestern University School of Communication, near Chicago, in 2003. A stint working as an intern at the US embassy in Argentina made her think her path might lead her into politics, but she changed course when her acting career began to take off. Between auditions, she has told of making money by doing calligraphy for wedding invitations, using skills developed in handwriting classes at school. Duchess of Sussex expecting a baby Meghan Markle's career in pictures How Meghan made her mark as a 'real deal' campaigner Five moments from Meghan's last Suits Her father was a cinematographer on the hit 1980s show Married... With Children, and her first television appearance in the US was in an episode of the medical drama General Hospital in 2002, before moving on to roles in CSI, Without a Trace and Castle. There were leading roles in TV movies such as When Sparks Fly and Dater's Handbook, and bit parts in Hollywood films including Get Him to the Greek, Remember Me and Horrible Bosses, and she was a ""briefcase girl"" on the US version of game show Deal or No Deal. This video can not be played Watch Meghan Markle in a US wedding drama She also appeared in the sci-fi series Fringe, playing FBI special agent Amy Jessup, but her most famous role was in Suits. Meghan was in the show from its launch in 2011, but was written out in the finale of the seventh series. Fittingly, perhaps, she left after her character got married. Allow Twitter content?

In real life, Meghan's union with Prince Harry wasn't her first marriage. In September 2011, she wed film producer Trevor Engelson, but the pair divorced two years later. In September,it was reported,externalthat her ex-husband was producing a new TV show based on a man's custody battle with his ex-wife who marries into the Royal Family. In 2014, she began writing about topics such as food, beauty, fashion and travel, as well as her own story, on her lifestyle website The Tig. Meghan said setting up the website was an attempt to ""reframe the beauty content to include think pieces about self-empowerment"" and feature dynamic, inspirational women. In one post, she explained: ""I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches - I've always wanted to be a woman who works."" The site also carried candid blogs she wrote on every birthday. On turning 33 in 2014, she wrote: ""My 20s were brutal - a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as 'whatever' as everyone else."" Royal wedding: All you need to know Who will change - Meghan or the Royal Family? She also grew a large social network profile, with 1.9 million followers on Instagram and more than 350,000 on Twitter. But she shut The Tig in April 2017, and deleted her social accounts January 2018. Her media career has gone hand-in-hand with support for causes that are important to her. Meghan taught children to paint with watercolours on a 2016 visit to Rwanda as a global ambassador for World Vision She tackled the issue of the stigma around menstrual health inan article for Time magazine,externalin March 2017 and was a global ambassador forWorld Vision Canada,external, which campaigns for better education, food and healthcare for children around the world. As part of her role, the actress travelled to Rwanda for the charity's Clean Water Campaign. Meghan's commitment to gender equality has seen her work with the United Nations, and she received a standing ovation from an audience including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon fora stirring speech on International Women's Day 2015,external. Commenting on how she combined acting with campaigning, she said: ""While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, co-exist. And for me, they must."" She has written about her pride in her mixed racial heritage Meghan, whose father is white and mother is African-American, has also spoken about coming to terms with her racial identity. In anarticle for Elle magazine,external, she wrote: ""While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. ""To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman."" In late 2016, Prince Harry confirmed he was in relationship with Meghan -while issuing a statement accusing journalists of harassing her,external. The pair had met on a blind date, organised by a mutual friend. After just two dates, they went on holiday together to Botswana. In September 2017 Meghan told Vanity Fair magazine they were ""two people who are really happy and in love"". And in an interview that November,when their engagement was announced,Prince Harry admitted he had never heard of Meghan before his friend introduced them, and was ""beautifully surprised"". Meghan and Prince Harry got married at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on 19 May 2018. The Queen gave them the title of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their wedding day Thousands of members of the public turned out for the couple's wedding Meghan and Prince Harry embarked on their first royal tour together in October 2018 - visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga over 16 days. The trip coincided with the coupleannouncing they were expecting their first baby. Meghan at the British High Commissioner's Residence in Suva, Fiji The duke and duchess followed in the footsteps of Prince Harry's parents - Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales - whose first royal tour was to Australia and New Zealand. Harry and Meghan at Taronga Zoo in Sydney Meghan and Prince Harry at the unveiling of the Labalaba Statue in Nadi, Fiji In February 2019 the Duke and Duchess travelled to Morocco for a three-day visit In September 2019, the couple undertook a 10-day tour of Africa, a continent that has always been particularly dear to Prince Harry's heart, leading to some speculation early in their marriage that they might at some stage choose to live there. Meghan met Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Sophia Williams-De Bruyn, as well as other key figures in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement. Sophia Williams-De Bruyn was aged 18 when she helped lead about 20,000 protesters Prince Harry and Meghan met Nelson Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, at a reception in Johannesburg She also made a speech to business people in Johannesburg in which she said such entrepreneurs had the power to change a world that seems ""aggressive, confrontational and dangerous"". But by the end of the tour, the couple's talk about fighting injustice was being reported alongside newsthat they were beginning legal action against the Mail on Sundayfor publishing a private letter sent by the Duchess of Sussex to her father. This video can not be played Harry and Meghan's royal engagements When Meghan gave birth to her son Archie Harrison - on 6 May 2019 - the reaction from the New York Times reflected the mass interest in the event around the world as it wrote: ""He is the first multiracial baby in the British monarchy's recent history, an instant star in a country where multiracial children make up the fastest-growing ethnic category."" But the royal couple had already decided to do things a little differently, underlining their determination not to follow the traditions of other recent royal births. In advance, they chose not to reveal where the baby would be born and said there would be no running commentary of what was happening, instantly stopping the spectacle of the press pack joining the ranks of ""royal superfans"" camped outside a hospital for several days waiting for the first glimpse of the new royal. And the birth wasn't initially announced in the traditional royal way of  being posted on a placard outside Buckingham Palace. Instead, Prince Harry popped out of their home to tell the world (although the placard then followed). The very private christening that followed just added to some media frustration that they could not, in their minds, fully report on one of the year's happiest stories. Held at Windsor Castle, the ceremony was not witnessed by any press photographers or TV cameras and the list of guests and godparents was not made public. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond surmised: ""It all points to a very different royal event, part of the continuing desire by the duke and duchess to raise their son Archie out of the spotlight."" Now you see them.... ...now you don't. Madame Tussauds removed Harry and Meghan from its royal set, leaving an empty space Amid ongoing spats with the media, increasingly through lawyers, it would soon become clear that both Meghan and her husband were becoming increasingly disenchanted with the expectations that came with their royal role. The announcement in June 2019 that they were breaking away from the Royal Foundation charity - which had seen them work closely with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - led to frenzied speculation about Prince Harry and Meghan's relationship with Prince William and Catherine. The cost to taxpayers of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's UK home at Frogmore Cottage reopened the debate about how the Royal Family is funded Then there was the revelation that their home, Frogmore Cottage,had been renovated with Â£2.4m of taxpayer-funded costs.It waslater announced that Prince Harry had paid back the cost. Meghan's comments during the couple's African tour that she had not felt supported as she struggled with motherhood and her new role did not go down well with senior royals, according to sources at the time. At the end of 2019, the couple took an extended Christmas break from royal duties, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia. The couple and their son Archie spent time in Canada over Christmas 2019 It gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped the bombshell announcement that they planned to step back as senior royals and become financially independent. Amid the further detail that the couple planned to split their time between the UK and North America, Buckingham Palace expressed its disappointment aspalace sources revealed that that no other royal - including the Queen or Prince William - was consultedbefore the statement was issued. The couple's final engagement as working royals saw them in the familiar surroundings of Westminster Abbey Talks then ensued between Prince Harry and the Queento iron out the detailsbefore it was confirmed that their couple's final duties as working members of the Royal Family would be in March 2020. The very final engagement saw them attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. The Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William were all there although one of the abiding memories of Meghan's royal exit - by now widely renamed ""Megxit"" - was getting a hug from singer Craig David. Prince Harry bumped forearms with Craig David when they met at the end of the service - while Meghan opted to hug him In February 2021, before a formal review of the situation had begun,Buckingham Palace confirmed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would not be returningas working members of the Royal Family. It meant Prince Harry and Meghan would return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. The couple will still attend some royal events in the future but these will not be classed as official duties. After time was spent in Canada, the couple settled at a new home in California. It has allowed them to spend much more time with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland, who lives in the state. But they are never completely out of the spotlight. There was a media fascination in tracking the couple's whereabouts in the early days of the coronavirus lockdown. In April 2020, they sued and eventually won an apology from a US news agency after drones were allegedly used to take pictures of their son, Archie, at their home. The same month, the couple announced that they were ending all co-operation with four tabloid newspaper groups in the UK, blaming ""distorted, false or invasive"" stories. But they do remain keen to seek publicity for the causes or issues they are interested in. As a duchess, Meghan took on portfolio of charitable work and patronages, which included the National Theatre and charity Smart Works. She also launched a charity cookbook in September 2018 to help those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. Meghan was joined be her mother, Doria Ragland, and Prince Harry for the cookbook launch After moving back to the US, she jointly wrote a newspaper article calling for the end of ""structural racism"" and the couple also urged US citizens to vote in the presidential election, saying that they should""reject hate"". In November 2020, Meghanwrote an article,externalrevealing her ""almost unbearable grief"" at enduring a miscarriage in July of that year. As for their future career plans, a big clue came when theyreached a deal with streaming giant Netflixto make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in. Meghan and Prince Harry featured in a succession of headlines in February 2021. At the High Court in London,Meghan won her claim for misuse of private informationagainst the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.  A further hearing will decide the ""next steps"" in her legal action which covers claims of copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act. Days laterMeghan and Prince Harry announced they were expecting their second child. Then came the news the couple had decided to talk about their decision to step away from the monarchy, in a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey. And there was a statement fromBuckingham Palace that it would investigate claims the Duchess of Sussex bullied royal staffin 2018. Her spokesman said the duchess was ""saddened"" by the ""latest attack on her character"" - and the following day a clip from her Winfrey interview was issued by CBS in whichMeghan said Buckingham Palace could not expect her and Prince Harry to be silentif it was ""perpetuating falsehoods about us"". In June, Meghanhad her first daughter, Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, and she and Prince Harry said Lili ""is more than we could have ever imagined"". The couple named their second child Lilibet after the Royal Family's nickname for the Queen, the baby's great-grandmother. And her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honour her ""beloved late grandmother"", the Princess of Wales, they said.

Breaking|Breaking newsHarry and Meghan announce birth of baby girl,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have announced the birth of their second child, a baby girl. Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born on Friday morning in a hospital in Santa Barbara, California. Both mother and child are healthy and well, the couple said in a statement. Buckingham Palace said: ""The Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been informed and are delighted with the news."" Prince Harry and Meghan said they named their second child Lilibet after the Royal Family's nickname for the Queen, the baby's great-grandmother. Her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honour her ""beloved late grandmother"", the Princess of Wales, the statement said. Royal Family tree and line of succession Profile: Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex Lilibet was born at 11:40am local time, weighed 7 lbs 11oz and is now ""settling in at home"". She is the Queen's 11th great-grandchild and is eighth in line to the throne. It means Prince Andrew, who was born as second in line in 1960, moves down to ninth place. In a message of thanks on the couple's Archewell website, they said: ""On June 4, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. ""She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we've felt from across the globe. ""Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family."" The message adds that anyone wishing to send gifts is asked to ""support or learn more about"" organisations working for women and girls. They have not released any photos of their daughter. The Prince of Wales, Prince Harry's father, and the Duchess of Cornwalltweeted,external: ""Congratulations to Harry, Meghan and Archie on the arrival of baby Lilibet Diana. Wishing them all well at this special time."" And the Duke of Duchess and Cambridge said: ""We are all delighted by the happy news of the arrival of baby Lili."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent his ""many congratulations"" to the couple and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the ""wonderful news"". Prince Harry, 36, and Meghan, 39, met on a blind date and married in May 2018 in a ceremony at Windsor Castle. They welcomed their first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, a year later. Meghan's friend, Misan Harriman, who took black-and-white photographs of the couple for their pregnancy announcement, tweeted his congratulations: ""Lilibet has arrived! Congratulations to my brave friend and her lovely family!"" The couple, pictured here with their son Archie, announced on Valentine's Day in February they were expecting their second child Prince Harry has publicly reflected on his approach to parenthood recently, sayinghe wanted to ""break the cycle"" of the ""pain and suffering""of his upbringing with his own children. He and Meghan quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020. Speaking last month, the duke said moving to the US had not been part of the plan, but he felt he had to put his family and mental health first. As a result of the move, Lilibet is the most senior royal in the current line of succession to be born overseas and she would be eligible to become president of the United States. But like her older brother Archie, who was not entitled to a royal title when he was born, Lilibet would not be allowed to be a princess nor an HRH until the Queen dies and Prince Charles becomes king, under rules set down more than 100 years ago. The Queen, pictured here with her grandparents in 1932, was called Lilibet by her grandfather King George V Lilibet - the Queen's family nickname - was coined when then-Princess Elizabeth was just a toddler and couldn't pronounce her name properly. Her grandfather, King George V, would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her own attempts to say her name. It soon stuck and she became Lilibet to her family from then on. The Queen's late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, also called her by the nickname, and wrote to his mother-in-law after their wedding: ""Lilibet is the only 'thing' in the world which is absolutely real to me."" Baby Lili's middle name, Diana, is in tribute to Prince Harry's later mother Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997 when he was 12 years old. Lili's cousin, Princess Charlotte, the daughter of Prince William and Catherine, also has Diana as one of her middle names, as well as Elizabeth. Duncan Larcombe, former royal editor at the Sun, said he thought the name was ""the most royal name you could give"". ""There's no doubt that the choice of name for Harry and Meghan's first daughter is the first significant - possibly the only - olive branch that the Sussexes as a couple have offered to the British Royal Family since... they walked away from the family,"" he told the BBC. In November, Meghanrevealed she had a miscarriageseveral months earlier, writing about her ""almost unbearable grief"" in a deeply personal article for the New York Times. In the piece, she said ""despite the staggering commonality of [miscarriages], the conversation remains taboo, riddled with (unwarranted) shame"" and went on to commend those who ""bravely shared their stories"", saying: ""When one person speaks truth, it gives license for all of us to do the same.""

LiveLiveDelta variant is around 40% more transmissible4 minutes ago,"The Delta variant is 40% more transmissible, the health secretary says, adding that protection against it is just as good with two doses of a vaccine Matt Hancock says the variant, first identified in India, makes life more challenging, and the government is ""open"" to delaying England's 21 June unlocking if needed Asked if measures such as face coverings and working from home could continue in the long term, he says he ""wouldn't rule that out"" Vaccination is being opened up to the under 30s in England from next week Boris Johnson will urge wealthy countries to commit to vaccinating the world against Covid-19 by the end of next year, at a G7 summit Pupils in England should take Covid tests following the half-term break, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson The Bafta Television Awards will be held later, with some stars attending in person and some virtually The UK reports another 5,341 positive tests for coronavirus, and 4 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis We're bringing the coronavirus live page to a close for today, but we'll be back with more coverage tomorrow. Today's writers were Lauren Turner, Joshua Cheetham and Joseph Lee.  The page was edited by Holly Wallis. Queues formed at a vaccine centre in Harrow, offering jabs to all over-18s We're wrapping up today's live coverage shortly. But before we go, here's a look back at some of the main stories today: Amid outbreaks of the new Delta variant in parts of the country, the daily total of positive tests is rising - reaching an average of 4,785 over the last seven days. But so far, that has not translated into a significant change in the number of people in hospital. That's remained pretty steady, with 932 Covid-19 patients at the last count. That's also true of the daily reported toll of people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test, which has also remained low at an average of 8 over the last seven days. That may be down to the protection acquired through the UK's vaccination programme, which has now means 40,333,231 people have had at least one dose and 27,661,353 are fully vaccinated. There are more second doses being given out daily than first doses, as the UK aims to boost the protection of vulnerable members of the population against the Delta variant. A coronavirus variant, first identified in India, is causing a spike in cases in some parts of the UK and experts are worried. Experts say this variant,named Delta by the World Health Organization, is more transmissible than even the ""Kent"" or Alpha variant, and is now dominant in the UK. It could pose ""serious disruption"" to the final stage of lockdown easing in England on 21 June, the prime minister has said. There are a few ""India"" variants, but one called B.1.617.2 appears to be spreading more quickly in the UK. Surge testing has been deployed in some areas, including Bolton and Blackburn, to identify infections - but it may not be stopping the spread. Second jabs for all over-50s (and the clinically vulnerable) in England are now being brought forward to protect more people, faster. Second doses will come eight weeks after the first, rather than 11-12 weeks. Read more here. Renowned American author Naomi Wolf has been suspended from Twitter after spreading a range of unfounded theories about vaccines on her account, Dr Wolf, well known for her acclaimed third-wave feminist book The Beauty Myth, claimed in one tweet that vaccines were a ""software platform that can receive uploads"". She also compared Dr Anthony Fauci, the top Covid adviser in the US, to Satan. Her suspension has been welcomed by many on the platform. But some have voiced concern that her suspension was stifling free speech. Read more here. There were another 676,991 vaccine doses given out yesterday, according to official figures, with 203,613 first doses and 473,378 second doses. It means 40,333,231 people have now had at least one dose and 27,661,353 have had both doses. That brings the total UK uptake to 76.6% of over-18s for first doses and 52.5% for both doses. The UK has reported another 5,341 positive tests for coronavirus, meaning that the total number of positive tests over the last week has risen by 49% compared to the previous seven days. Weekend figures are sometimes lower due to reporting delays. Last Sunday, there were just 3,240 new confirmed cases recorded. There were also 4 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,the figures show.,externalOn Saturday, 11 deaths were reported. Police were pelted with objectsby ""hostile"" ravers as they attempted to shut down an event attended by 200 people. Essex Police were called to a unlicensed music event in a field off Forest Drive in Theydon Bois, Essex, at 23:00 BST on Saturday. The force said a DJ had been playing loud music and officers were targeted as they tried to engage with revellers. Officers seized a set of decks, speakers and a generator, while one man was arrested on suspicion of a breach of coronavirus legislation. This video can not be played Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh: ""Vaccinating the world protects against variants"" Scotland should focus on the ""huge gap"" in global vaccine rollout before vaccinating teenagers, a public health expert has said. Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she hoped the UK would ""step up"" to donate vaccines to poorer countries. It comes after the UK regulator approved use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15 on Friday. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is yet to give its advice on the vaccine use for children. Prof Bauld toldBBC Scotland's The Sunday Showthat a decision to vaccinate teenagers in Scotland could be ""controversial"" globally. ""[With] the huge gap in the vaccine rollout around the world, many people, including some of my colleagues, are saying let's not press ahead with this,"" she said. ""Let's focus on helping out low and middle-income countries. So we wait to see what the decision is."" She also said vaccinating the rest of the world could help protect against the emergence of new variants. Read more. Matt Hancock was on the Andrew Marr Show earlier, when he said the date for easing further restrictions could be delayed in England. Watch the clip below: This video can not be played Matt Hancock 'open' to delaying 21 June lockdown end Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check, Delhi About 12,000 cases of a condition known as ""black fungus"" have been reported in India, mostly in patients recovering from Covid-19. This severe infection is normally very rare and has a mortality rate of about 50%. Some medical experts have suggested India has seen cases growing because of the high prevalence of diabetes. But are other factors at work and what is happening in other countries? Read more here. The pace of Europe's Covid-19 vaccination campaign has picked up and in many countries infection rates have been falling. Lockdowns are gradually being eased ahead of the summer tourist season, and the EU's 27 member states aim to have adigital vaccination certificate,externalfor travel in place by the end of June. Read our explainer on the lockdown rulesin force across various countries in the continent. This video can not be played 'I had breast cancer and then Covid' A woman who caught coronavirus after recovering from breast cancer has described how she felt so nervous she struggled to leave her house following her illness. Katy Meldrum, from Market Harborough in Leicestershire, tells her story above. It will be a while until we see the end of Covid, the World Health Organisation's special envoy on the disease has told Sky News. ""Eradication is currently not a reasonable target for the world,"" Dr David Nabarro said. ""Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we're going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future,"" he added. ""This virus isn't going away anytime soon, there will be variants emerging."" His comments were echoed by Dame Anne Johnson, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, also on the channel. Dame Anne said people would not want the lifting of restrictions to carry on being delayed; instead the aim must be to minimise the amount of severe diseases that the virus causes. She added that any reopening would be a ""very finely judged decision"" and that next week would be ""absolutely critical"" for gathering data on infections in the UK to decide whether the lockdown should be extended. A man who spent 20 years living in destinations around the world has ditched jet-setting for life on a narrowboat. Cameron Forbush, from Leicester, ran a scuba diving school in the Philippines before the Covid-19 pandemic.

The government announced that it would start issuing the electronic passes from 7 June. Those who have been fully vaccinated will be able to download their passes from a national database. Users will receive a personalised QR code to be shown to the authorities when prompted, and it can be downloaded onto a smartphone or printed out. A government statement obtained by Lakome said the passport would allow holders to travel across Morocco and abroad without restrictions.

"Turkey vows to solve 'sea snot' blanketing coastA thick, slimy layer of mucus-like matter is spreading along Turkey's coast near Istanbul.Europe","This video can not be played ""Sea snot"" spreads across Turkish sea Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has promised to save the country's shores from ""sea snot"" building up in its waters. A thick, slimy layer of the mucus-like matter is spreading along the Sea of Marmara near Istanbul, damaging marine life and the fishing industry. Experts blame pollution and climate change. ""Hopefully, we will save our seas from this mucilage calamity,"" President Erdogan said. ""Sea snot"", or marine mucilage, is a naturally-occurring green sludge that forms when algae is overloaded with nutrients as a result of hot weather and water pollution. It was first found in Turkey in 2007 but has also been discovered in the Aegean Sea near Greece. Turkey's recent outbreak along large areas of the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, is believed to be the biggest in history and is causing havoc for local communities. Fishing boats are being covered by sea snot President Erdogan blamed untreated sewage being dumped into the sea, as well as rising temperatures, and urged officials to investigate. ""My fear is, if this expands to Black Sea... the trouble will be enormous. We need to take this step without delay,"" he said. His government has dispatched a 300-strong team to inspect potential sources of pollution. Boats travelling through the Sea of Marmara have to navigate the grey sludge, and some fishermen are being prevented from working as it clogs up their motors and nets. Divers have reported that large numbers of fish and other species are dying from suffocation. Professor Bayram Ozturk of the Turkish Marine Research warned such problems would continue unless there was fresh investment to treat and purify waste water being pumped out of Istanbul.

How revamping markets risk shutting out locals,"Tracy Taylor who runs Fresh and Fruity greengrocers relies on local produce suppliers It's lunch time at Preston Market. At one end of the large Victorian market hall, a generous pile of fried egg and chips will leave you with change from a fiver. Two friends have claimed the window seats and grin. ""These are ours - we sit here every day."" At the other end of the covered market it's a different crowd and roasted halloumi in a fresh ciabatta will cost you a fraction or so more. A solicitor pops in for a latte: ""It's nice to have something here that's modern, it's trendy,"" he says. Both locations serve important purposes for local people. Street markets like this one in Lancashire are being revitalised across the country as part of urban regeneration plans. The decline of British High Streets has put councils under pressure to draw new customers into town centres. However, The National Market Traders Federation says they must not forget their old customers, too. The trade body wants these upgraded markets to maintain traditional, affordable stalls and produce. Market traders have strong ties to local community groups Joe Harrison is chief executive of the NMTF and works alongside county councils and businesses to get the best of both worlds into any redevelopment plans. ""We'll have swanky artisan markets - and that's all that will exist. We need to make sure that we don't take away from people that need access to that affordable food,"" he says. Preston's newly glazed market hall is part of a Â£50m regeneration project. Alongside fruit and vegetable stalls are new coffee shops, mobile phone, and fashion stalls. Outside, traders of all kinds from the old market have new tables to sell their wares, ranging from toys, homemade soaps, and bric-a-brac. Joe thinks the balance in Preston is right but is appealing to other councils to think carefully about existing customers and traders before they make changes. Mother and daughter business team, Tracy and Becky Taylor, run Fresh and Fruity greengrocers inside the new trading hall. Their produce is high quality, fresh and popular. Preston's newly glazed market hall is part of a Â£50m regeneration project They agree that selling affordable vegetables is still their staple trade but they've started offering more luxury or exotic items since the refurbishment now that new customers are picking up their shopping in the hall. They believe they can walk that line because of their connections to local suppliers: ""I think a big thing for us is local produce - because we can go straight to the growers and the farmers,"" says Becky. But for some it's not so easy. ""We've found that a lot of things the markets used to sell, they don't sell anymore, like clothes,"" adds Tracy. Their views are supported by a research project, led by associate professor Sara Gonzalez from the University of Leeds, measuring the importance of markets to local communities. ""Markets tend to attract elderly people; people who are from low-income neighbourhoods; those with long-term illnesses, a disability, or people with young children, and migrants or [people from] ethnic minorities,"" explains Prof Gonzalez. People who regularly shop at local markets get something else besides their purchases - company, says Prof Gonzalez ""We worry that these more disadvantaged customers will be left aside."" For three years she and her team have analysed indoor and outdoor markets in London, Newcastle and Bury, to learn about the contribution they make to these local community groups. Their value is not just about good produce at good prices to feed stomachs - it's about regular human contact and interactions that feed the soul. Prof Gonzalez says that people who shop regularly at local markets get something a supermarket could never give them - company - and that's why many customers make a whole day out of a trip. ""They might have a haircut, they'll have a cup of tea, they'll meet with a friend, they'll do some shopping. And it's weather-proof, it's warm,"" she says. Regeneration of older marketplaces is happening across the country ""But more than that, they get to speak to people they don't know. That might be the only people they meet for the whole day, the whole week. So, they actually do develop friendships,"" says Prof Gonzalez. At the height of the pandemic, she spoke to traders in Newcastle's Grainger Market, who had attended a regular customer's funeral. While in Preston, bookstall holder Pete Burns delivered books to regulars he knew relied on the social connection. ""A lot of the die-hard regulars look at you as more of a friend than a trader,"" he says. Prof Gonzalez and her team fear these groups are being excluded from council redevelopment plans, because there's no way to measure or make a profit from the valuable sociable interactions markets provide for local communities. Instead, regeneration plans have focused on higher-end, higher-priced offerings. Citing examples like Borough Market in London or Altrincham Market, that offer late-night fine dining and artisan produce, she explains these can ""alienate"" many of the vulnerable groups she has worked with. ""We want local authorities to think about the market not as a property asset but as a community asset.""

"Turkey vows to solve 'sea snot' blanketing coastA thick, slimy layer of mucus-like matter is spreading along Turkey's coast near Istanbul.","This video can not be played ""Sea snot"" spreads across Turkish sea Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has promised to save the country's shores from ""sea snot"" building up in its waters. A thick, slimy layer of the mucus-like matter is spreading along the Sea of Marmara near Istanbul, damaging marine life and the fishing industry. Experts blame pollution and climate change. ""Hopefully, we will save our seas from this mucilage calamity,"" President Erdogan said. ""Sea snot"", or marine mucilage, is a naturally-occurring green sludge that forms when algae is overloaded with nutrients as a result of hot weather and water pollution. It was first found in Turkey in 2007 but has also been discovered in the Aegean Sea near Greece. Turkey's recent outbreak along large areas of the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, is believed to be the biggest in history and is causing havoc for local communities. Fishing boats are being covered by sea snot President Erdogan blamed untreated sewage being dumped into the sea, as well as rising temperatures, and urged officials to investigate. ""My fear is, if this expands to Black Sea... the trouble will be enormous. We need to take this step without delay,"" he said. His government has dispatched a 300-strong team to inspect potential sources of pollution. Boats travelling through the Sea of Marmara have to navigate the grey sludge, and some fishermen are being prevented from working as it clogs up their motors and nets. Divers have reported that large numbers of fish and other species are dying from suffocation. Professor Bayram Ozturk of the Turkish Marine Research warned such problems would continue unless there was fresh investment to treat and purify waste water being pumped out of Istanbul. ""Due to the overgrowth of the mucilage, several species are under threat [including] oysters, mussels, sea stars,"" Prof Ozturk told the BBC. ""It's a real catastrophe.""

More than 130 killed in Burkina Faso attack,"The Burkinabe army has been struggling to contain militant violence Armed men killed at least 160 people in an attack on a village in northern Burkina Faso, the country's worst attack in recent years, officials say. Homes and the local market were burned during the raid on Solhan in the early hours of Saturday morning. No group has said it was behind the violence, but Islamist attacks are increasingly common in the country, especially in border regions. The UN chief said he was ""outraged"" by the incident. AntÃ³nio Guterres ""strongly condemns the heinous attack and underscores the urgent need for the international community to redouble support to member states in the fight against violent extremism and its unacceptable human toll,"" his spokesperson said. On Sunday, a total of 160 bodies were recovered from what local officials in Solhan described as three mass graves, AFP news agency reported. ""It's the local people themselves who have started exhuming the bodies and burying them after transporting them,"" an unnamed local source said, according to AFP. The number of people killed in Solhan has increased from earlier reports of about 132 deaths, and there are concerns that the death toll may rise further. Following the news of Saturday's attack,the Burkinabe President Roch Kabore declared three days of national mourning,external, writing in a tweet that ""we must stand united against the forces of evil"". He described the attack as ""barbaric"" and said that security forces were trying to track down the perpetrators. Critical stage for fight against jihadis in West Africa In another attack on Friday night, 14 people were reported to have been killed in the village of Tadaryat, about 150km (93 miles) to the north of Solhan. Last month, 30 people died in an attack in the east of Burkina Faso. The country is facing a deepening security crisis, like many of its neighbours, as armed groups carry out raids and kidnappings across much of the region. In May, the Burkinabe army launched a large-scale operation in response to a resurgence of militant attacks. Despite this, the security forces are struggling to prevent the violence that has forced more than a million people from their homes over the past two years. Africa's semi-arid Sahel region has been hit by an insurgency since militants captured large parts of northern Mali in 2012 and 2013. French forces have been supporting troops from Mali, Chad, Mauritania, Niger and Burkina Faso to fight the militants. But this weekFrance halted co-operation with Maliover the recent coup there.

Why is the G7 coming to Cornwall?,"Leaders of the world's seven richest nations - including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - are gathering in Italy to decide what to do to about the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Ukraine. The G7 summit will also involve leaders from Africa and the Indo-Pacific region, and will discuss economic co-operation with developing countries. The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. Russia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014for its takeover of Crimea. China has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's second-largest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are. Both these nations are in the G20 group of developed and developing nations. The EU is not a member of the G7, but attends the annual summits. Throughout the year, G7 ministers and officials hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Italy has the G7 presidency in 2024. Italy's premier, Giorgia Meloni, is hosting the 2024 G7 summit The 2024 G7 summit will be held from 13 to 15 June in Apulia, in Italy. It will bethe first major international forum hosted by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,since she took office in October 2022. As well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Italy says it wants the summit to focus on Africa and migration, economic security, and international co-operation on artificial intelligence (AI). Between them, the G7 nations have already imposed on Russiathe biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy. They have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system. G7 and EU nations have also frozen about $325bn (Â£254bn) of Russian financial assets which were held in their territories, such as the foreign currency reserves of Russia's central bank. The G7 nations are nowworking on a schemeto take the interest those assets have earned and pass it to Ukraine in the form of a loan. This could amount to $50bn. On 3 June, G7 leadersall backed the plan put forward by US President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza.,external He has proposed an immediate ceasefire by Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages, an increase in aid for Gaza and a peace deal which guarantees Israel's security and the safety of Gazan residents. Italy says""the relationship with developing nations and emerging economies will be central"",externalto the G7 summit, and that it ""will work to build a co-operation model based on mutually beneficial partnerships"". It has invited leaders from 12 developing countries in Africa, South America and the Indo-Pacific region. Under thethe Mattei Plan,,externalItaly will give grants and loans worth 5.5bn euros (Â£4.6bn) to several African countries, to help develop their economies. The scheme would also position Italy as an energy hub, building gas and hydrogen pipelines between Africa and Europe. However, many commentatorssuspect it may be a cover,externalfor Italy to crack down on further migration from Africa. Italy is asking other nations to contribute financially to the scheme. As the G7's president in 2023, Japan pushed for the group to draw up a plan for international economic security. The G7 adopted ananti-coercion pact,,externaldesigned to stop countries such as China and Russia using their economic strength to impose their will on others. In December 2023,Italy pulled out of the Belt and Road Initiative- a scheme to expand China's ports and transport routes worldwide to boost trade. Ms Meloni said that joining had been ""a serious mistake"". The US has called the initiative ""debt-trap diplomacy"" on China's part. It is thought thatthe US is keen for G7 leaders to take further action on economic security,externalat the summit in Italy. The safety of AI was raised at the 2023 summit in Japan and resulted in theHiroshima AI Process,external, intended to promote ""safe, secure, and trustworthy AI worldwide"". However, this was only a collection of voluntary measures. The G7 summit may look at drawing up further international regulations for AI safety, building on theAI Act adopted by the EUand theUS president's executive order on AI. The G7 cannot pass laws. However, some of its past decisions have had global effects. For example, the G7 played a crucial role in setting up aglobal fund to fight malaria and Aids,externalin 2002. Ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in the UK, the group's finance ministersagreed to make multinational companies pay more tax. It has also provided financial aid to developing countries, and taken steps to tackle climate change.

LiveLiveVaccinating world is greatest challenge - Johnson5 minutes ago,"The Delta variant is 40% more transmissible, the health secretary says, adding that protection against it is just as good with two doses of a vaccine Matt Hancock says the variant, first identified in India, makes life more challenging, and the government is ""open"" to delaying England's 21 June unlocking if needed Asked if measures such as face coverings and working from home could continue in the long term, he says he ""wouldn't rule that out"" Vaccination is being opened up to the under 30s in England from next week Boris Johnson will urge wealthy countries to commit to vaccinating the world against Covid-19 by the end of next year, at a G7 summit Pupils in England should take Covid tests following the half-term break, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson The Bafta Television Awards will be held later, with some stars attending in person and some virtually The UK reports another 5,341 positive tests for coronavirus, and 4 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis We're bringing the coronavirus live page to a close for today, but we'll be back with more coverage tomorrow. Today's writers were Lauren Turner, Joshua Cheetham and Joseph Lee.  The page was edited by Holly Wallis. Queues formed at a vaccine centre in Harrow, offering jabs to all over-18s We're wrapping up today's live coverage shortly. But before we go, here's a look back at some of the main stories today: Amid outbreaks of the new Delta variant in parts of the country, the daily total of positive tests is rising - reaching an average of 4,785 over the last seven days. But so far, that has not translated into a significant change in the number of people in hospital. That's remained pretty steady, with 932 Covid-19 patients at the last count. That's also true of the daily reported toll of people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test, which has also remained low at an average of 8 over the last seven days. That may be down to the protection acquired through the UK's vaccination programme, which has now means 40,333,231 people have had at least one dose and 27,661,353 are fully vaccinated. There are more second doses being given out daily than first doses, as the UK aims to boost the protection of vulnerable members of the population against the Delta variant. A coronavirus variant, first identified in India, is causing a spike in cases in some parts of the UK and experts are worried. Experts say this variant,named Delta by the World Health Organization, is more transmissible than even the ""Kent"" or Alpha variant, and is now dominant in the UK. It could pose ""serious disruption"" to the final stage of lockdown easing in England on 21 June, the prime minister has said. There are a few ""India"" variants, but one called B.1.617.2 appears to be spreading more quickly in the UK. Surge testing has been deployed in some areas, including Bolton and Blackburn, to identify infections - but it may not be stopping the spread. Second jabs for all over-50s (and the clinically vulnerable) in England are now being brought forward to protect more people, faster. Second doses will come eight weeks after the first, rather than 11-12 weeks. Read more here. Renowned American author Naomi Wolf has been suspended from Twitter after spreading a range of unfounded theories about vaccines on her account, Dr Wolf, well known for her acclaimed third-wave feminist book The Beauty Myth, claimed in one tweet that vaccines were a ""software platform that can receive uploads"". She also compared Dr Anthony Fauci, the top Covid adviser in the US, to Satan. Her suspension has been welcomed by many on the platform. But some have voiced concern that her suspension was stifling free speech. Read more here. There were another 676,991 vaccine doses given out yesterday, according to official figures, with 203,613 first doses and 473,378 second doses. It means 40,333,231 people have now had at least one dose and 27,661,353 have had both doses. That brings the total UK uptake to 76.6% of over-18s for first doses and 52.5% for both doses. The UK has reported another 5,341 positive tests for coronavirus, meaning that the total number of positive tests over the last week has risen by 49% compared to the previous seven days. Weekend figures are sometimes lower due to reporting delays. Last Sunday, there were just 3,240 new confirmed cases recorded. There were also 4 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,the figures show.,externalOn Saturday, 11 deaths were reported. Police were pelted with objectsby ""hostile"" ravers as they attempted to shut down an event attended by 200 people. Essex Police were called to a unlicensed music event in a field off Forest Drive in Theydon Bois, Essex, at 23:00 BST on Saturday. The force said a DJ had been playing loud music and officers were targeted as they tried to engage with revellers. Officers seized a set of decks, speakers and a generator, while one man was arrested on suspicion of a breach of coronavirus legislation.

Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she hoped the UK would ""step up"" to donate vaccines to poorer countries. It comes after the UK regulator approved use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15 on Friday. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is yet to give its advice on the vaccine use for children. Prof Bauld toldBBC Scotland's The Sunday Showthat a decision to vaccinate teenagers in Scotland could be ""controversial"" globally. ""[With] the huge gap in the vaccine rollout around the world, many people, including some of my colleagues, are saying let's not press ahead with this,"" she said. ""Let's focus on helping out low and middle-income countries. So we wait to see what the decision is."" She also said vaccinating the rest of the world could help protect against the emergence of new variants. Read more. Matt Hancock was on the Andrew Marr Show earlier, when he said the date for easing further restrictions could be delayed in England. Watch the clip below: This video can not be played Matt Hancock 'open' to delaying 21 June lockdown end Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check, Delhi About 12,000 cases of a condition known as ""black fungus"" have been reported in India, mostly in patients recovering from Covid-19. This severe infection is normally very rare and has a mortality rate of about 50%. Some medical experts have suggested India has seen cases growing because of the high prevalence of diabetes. But are other factors at work and what is happening in other countries? Read more here. The pace of Europe's Covid-19 vaccination campaign has picked up and in many countries infection rates have been falling. Lockdowns are gradually being eased ahead of the summer tourist season, and the EU's 27 member states aim to have adigital vaccination certificate,externalfor travel in place by the end of June. Read our explainer on the lockdown rulesin force across various countries in the continent. This video can not be played 'I had breast cancer and then Covid' A woman who caught coronavirus after recovering from breast cancer has described how she felt so nervous she struggled to leave her house following her illness. Katy Meldrum, from Market Harborough in Leicestershire, tells her story above. It will be a while until we see the end of Covid, the World Health Organisation's special envoy on the disease has told Sky News. ""Eradication is currently not a reasonable target for the world,"" Dr David Nabarro said. ""Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we're going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future,"" he added. ""This virus isn't going away anytime soon, there will be variants emerging."" His comments were echoed by Dame Anne Johnson, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, also on the channel. Dame Anne said people would not want the lifting of restrictions to carry on being delayed; instead the aim must be to minimise the amount of severe diseases that the virus causes. She added that any reopening would be a ""very finely judged decision"" and that next week would be ""absolutely critical"" for gathering data on infections in the UK to decide whether the lockdown should be extended. A man who spent 20 years living in destinations around the world has ditched jet-setting for life on a narrowboat.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Moroccan authorities will begin issuing Covid-19 passports for those who have received two doses of a vaccine, according to local news outlet Lakoume. The government announced that it would start issuing the electronic passes from 7 June. Those who have been fully vaccinated will be able to download their passes from a national database. Users will receive a personalised QR code to be shown to the authorities when prompted, and it can be downloaded onto a smartphone or printed out. A government statement obtained by Lakome said the passport would allow holders to travel across Morocco and abroad without restrictions. To date, the kingdom's health ministry has inoculated more than 9.1 million people with one dose of a vaccine, whilst nearly 5.9 million people have received their second dose, reports state news agency MAP. Current estimates put the country's population at almost 37 million people.

Today's writers were Lauren Turner, Joshua Cheetham and Joseph Lee.  The page was edited by Holly Wallis. Queues formed at a vaccine centre in Harrow, offering jabs to all over-18s We're wrapping up today's live coverage shortly. But before we go, here's a look back at some of the main stories today: Amid outbreaks of the new Delta variant in parts of the country, the daily total of positive tests is rising - reaching an average of 4,785 over the last seven days. But so far, that has not translated into a significant change in the number of people in hospital. That's remained pretty steady, with 932 Covid-19 patients at the last count. That's also true of the daily reported toll of people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test, which has also remained low at an average of 8 over the last seven days. That may be down to the protection acquired through the UK's vaccination programme, which has now means 40,333,231 people have had at least one dose and 27,661,353 are fully vaccinated. There are more second doses being given out daily than first doses, as the UK aims to boost the protection of vulnerable members of the population against the Delta variant. A coronavirus variant, first identified in India, is causing a spike in cases in some parts of the UK and experts are worried. Experts say this variant,named Delta by the World Health Organization, is more transmissible than even the ""Kent"" or Alpha variant, and is now dominant in the UK. It could pose ""serious disruption"" to the final stage of lockdown easing in England on 21 June, the prime minister has said. There are a few ""India"" variants, but one called B.1.617.2 appears to be spreading more quickly in the UK. Surge testing has been deployed in some areas, including Bolton and Blackburn, to identify infections - but it may not be stopping the spread. Second jabs for all over-50s (and the clinically vulnerable) in England are now being brought forward to protect more people, faster. Second doses will come eight weeks after the first, rather than 11-12 weeks. Read more here. Renowned American author Naomi Wolf has been suspended from Twitter after spreading a range of unfounded theories about vaccines on her account, Dr Wolf, well known for her acclaimed third-wave feminist book The Beauty Myth, claimed in one tweet that vaccines were a ""software platform that can receive uploads"". She also compared Dr Anthony Fauci, the top Covid adviser in the US, to Satan. Her suspension has been welcomed by many on the platform. But some have voiced concern that her suspension was stifling free speech. Read more here. There were another 676,991 vaccine doses given out yesterday, according to official figures, with 203,613 first doses and 473,378 second doses. It means 40,333,231 people have now had at least one dose and 27,661,353 have had both doses. That brings the total UK uptake to 76.6% of over-18s for first doses and 52.5% for both doses. The UK has reported another 5,341 positive tests for coronavirus, meaning that the total number of positive tests over the last week has risen by 49% compared to the previous seven days. Weekend figures are sometimes lower due to reporting delays. Last Sunday, there were just 3,240 new confirmed cases recorded. There were also 4 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,the figures show.,externalOn Saturday, 11 deaths were reported. Police were pelted with objectsby ""hostile"" ravers as they attempted to shut down an event attended by 200 people. Essex Police were called to a unlicensed music event in a field off Forest Drive in Theydon Bois, Essex, at 23:00 BST on Saturday. The force said a DJ had been playing loud music and officers were targeted as they tried to engage with revellers. Officers seized a set of decks, speakers and a generator, while one man was arrested on suspicion of a breach of coronavirus legislation.

Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she hoped the UK would ""step up"" to donate vaccines to poorer countries. It comes after the UK regulator approved use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15 on Friday. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is yet to give its advice on the vaccine use for children. Prof Bauld toldBBC Scotland's The Sunday Showthat a decision to vaccinate teenagers in Scotland could be ""controversial"" globally. ""[With] the huge gap in the vaccine rollout around the world, many people, including some of my colleagues, are saying let's not press ahead with this,"" she said. ""Let's focus on helping out low and middle-income countries. So we wait to see what the decision is."" She also said vaccinating the rest of the world could help protect against the emergence of new variants. Read more. Matt Hancock was on the Andrew Marr Show earlier, when he said the date for easing further restrictions could be delayed in England. Watch the clip below: This video can not be played Matt Hancock 'open' to delaying 21 June lockdown end Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check, Delhi About 12,000 cases of a condition known as ""black fungus"" have been reported in India, mostly in patients recovering from Covid-19. This severe infection is normally very rare and has a mortality rate of about 50%. Some medical experts have suggested India has seen cases growing because of the high prevalence of diabetes. But are other factors at work and what is happening in other countries? Read more here. The pace of Europe's Covid-19 vaccination campaign has picked up and in many countries infection rates have been falling. Lockdowns are gradually being eased ahead of the summer tourist season, and the EU's 27 member states aim to have adigital vaccination certificate,externalfor travel in place by the end of June. Read our explainer on the lockdown rulesin force across various countries in the continent. This video can not be played 'I had breast cancer and then Covid' A woman who caught coronavirus after recovering from breast cancer has described how she felt so nervous she struggled to leave her house following her illness. Katy Meldrum, from Market Harborough in Leicestershire, tells her story above. It will be a while until we see the end of Covid, the World Health Organisation's special envoy on the disease has told Sky News. ""Eradication is currently not a reasonable target for the world,"" Dr David Nabarro said. ""Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we're going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future,"" he added. ""This virus isn't going away anytime soon, there will be variants emerging."" His comments were echoed by Dame Anne Johnson, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, also on the channel. Dame Anne said people would not want the lifting of restrictions to carry on being delayed; instead the aim must be to minimise the amount of severe diseases that the virus causes. She added that any reopening would be a ""very finely judged decision"" and that next week would be ""absolutely critical"" for gathering data on infections in the UK to decide whether the lockdown should be extended. A man who spent 20 years living in destinations around the world has ditched jet-setting for life on a narrowboat. Cameron Forbush, from Leicester, ran a scuba diving school in the Philippines before the Covid-19 pandemic.

Federer could pull out of French OpenRoger Federer had double knee surgery last year and does not want to damage his Wimbledon prospects.BBC Sport,"Federer hit 63 unforced errors to 51 winners and had his serve broken in four games Roger Federer says he may pull out of the French Open if there is too much risk to his knee, and to his Wimbledon prospects, from playing on. The Swiss beat Dominik Koepfer over three-and-a-half hours late on Saturday in only his sixth match since having double knee surgery. Federer, 39, is due to play Matteo Berrettini in the last 16 on Monday. But he said he will decide later on Sunday whether now would be the ""perfect time to take a rest"". The 20-time Grand Slam champion lacked fluency and trust in his game before coming through to beat Germany's Koepfer 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (7-4) 7-5 at a near-empty Roland Garros. Eighth seed Federer is playing in only his third tournament since January 2020 and says he is using it to build up fitness for Wimbledon, which starts on his favoured grass surface at the end of June. ""We go through these matches, we analyse them highly and look on what's next,"" he said. ""We will do the same here on Sunday, because I need to decide if I keep on playing or not. Is it not too much risk at this moment to keep on pushing or is this just a perfect way to just take a rest?"" Italy's ninth seed Berrettini, 25, reached the fourth round at Roland Garros for the first time with a 7-6 (8-6) 6-3 6-4 win over South Korea's Kwon Soon-woo. After hitting 52 winners against Kwon to continue a fine clay-court season, Madrid runner-up Berrettini will be widely considered the favourite against 2009 champion Federer. Nadal beats Norrie to end British hopes Svitolina out as seeds exodus continues GB's Hewett through to wheelchair finals Federer increasingly struggled against Koepfer, ranked 59th in the world, in a gruelling contest that lacked quality and was played in a soulless atmosphere without fans. In a lengthy opening set, Federer was unable to clinch any of five break points - including a set point in the 10th game - before an untimely double fault from Koepfer helped the Swiss to nick the tie-break. The ruthless edge appeared, eventually, in the opening game of the second set when Federer whipped a crosscourt forehand past Koepfer to convert his third break point. Little separated the pair, who traded three more breaks in a row, during another close and cumbersome set. The solid Koepfer was able to draw unforced errors out of the erratic Federer, who also struggled with his usually reliable serve. Federer's demeanour became increasingly despondent after Koepfer broke in the first game of the third set and he looked to be waning physically as the German remained in control. Somehow, the Swiss shifted the momentum back in his favour out of nowhere with a break back in the eighth game and, after missing a set point in the 12th, took the third tie-break. The fourth set looked destined for another tie-break before Federer dug deep to pick up his level and win the final three games for victory. But there were no fans to celebrate the moment, which seemed particularly stark when it was a player who has entertained packed stadiums for so many years. ""There are still a few people here, I don't know who they are: sponsors, journalists, my team too,"" Federer said. ""I love tennis, I like to play. I might have been more nervous if the stadium had been full."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Only one of the six night matches so far have been a women's match - Serena Williams' opener against Irina-Camelia Begu on Monday - and it would be optimistic to think a men's match would only last two hours, making late finishes inevitable. Russel Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent It was a match that will live long in the memory, although not always for the right reasons. Roger Federer is not supposed to play like this - even though this was just his sixth match in the past 16 months. There was little fluency, and some horrible errors. But in his 40th year, and at nearly a quarter to one on a Sunday morning in a soulless and empty stadium, Federer still found the key to victory. Night sessions are here to stay. They will look and sound great in years to come - as long as they don't start as late as 9pm. But they are absolutely no fun when there is a curfew in town.

Where does foreign aid go?,"The UK's temporarily cutting back money it gives to other countries, in a move which some charities say will harm poor communities around the world. The government says the impact of the pandemic on the UK's finances means there has to be a temporary reduction in foreign aid. The target for foreign aid spend has usually been 0.7% of gross national income - but that will come down to 0.5% which will be around Â£4bn less. But what is the money actually used for? The UK provides aid to crisis hit areas In 2020, Britain spent Â£14.5bn on aid, meeting that 0.7% target,according to provisional data,external. There's always been debate over the UK's aid spend, with some people saying the UK shouldn't be helping people overseas while cutting services at home. They argue problems of poverty and inequality are being fuelled by conflict, corruption and political instability which makes foreign aid worthless. Others say it's a mark of the UK's generosity and helps address the difference in wealth between developed and developing countries - and helping to save lives. In its most basic definition, foreign aid is resources given from one country to another. It can involve a transfer of things like food or military equipment, or even people to provide training and medical help. Usually these are loaned by governments, organisations and individuals in richer countries to help people in poorer countries. An example would be the UK sendingÂ£200m to help developing nationsbattle coronavirus. The UK is among countries to send medical supplies to India to help its coronavirus efforts There are different types of aid, such as emergency or short-term aid which is needed after sudden disasters such as earthquakes, flooding or tsunamis. Conditional or tied aid is when one country donates money or resources to another but with conditions attached, for example a trade deal. There is also aid funded by donations from the public through charities such as Children in Need. Long-term or development aid involves providing local communities with education and skills. Money shared through international organisations such as the World Bank or UN, rather than by one specific country, is called multilateral aid. Overall, the top five countries receiving UK aid were Pakistan, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Yemen and Nigeria, with almost all the money going to countries in Africa and Asia. In 2019, the UK spent Â£1.5bn on humanitarian assistance - which is short-term help in immediate crises - mostly in Yemen, Syria and Bangladesh, statistics show. Around Â£1.4bn was spent on health projects including medical research, family planning and infectious disease control globally. There will be cuts across lots of different areas. ""The impact will be profound and very damaging, particularly for poor people,"" says Professor Guy Howard, an expert in international development from the University of Bristol. The UN Population Fund, which supports family planning, says an initial commitment by the UK to spend Â£154m on supplies this yearwill shrink to Â£23m- and there'll also be a drop in funding to the UN's children fund, Unicef. And funding for things like water, sanitation and hygiene projects will reportedly becut by more than 80%. The UK contributed Â£176m to water, sanitation and hygiene projects in 2019 - so an 80% cut would represent a budget of around Â£36m Prof Howard feels cutting back aid from a ""core public health area seems odd."" He wants to see a reverse to cuts in water and sanitation because ""that's the foundation of public health"" and vital in dealing with different diseases. ""We often forget a thousand children a day die of diarrhoea because of poor water sanitation."" It's an important goal in its own right, he says, ""but what Covid has shown us is just how important water supply is in combatting the disease. ""If you have to collect water from a shared water point, social distancing will be virtually impossible."" As the amount the UK donates is a percentage of national income, the amount of money it spends on foreign aid would have been less this year even before the cut was announced. That's because the economy'sgot smallerduring the pandemic. But Prof Howard says the decision to cut 0.2% makes it an even more difficult situation for the countries which receive the aid. Several countries have met the 0.7% UN aid target including Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. But many others don't hit the target. International organisations have schemes to provide food to poorer countries Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the changes reflected a ""strategic shift"" in UK aid spending. A spokeswoman from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development office told Newsbeat reducing spend was a ""tough but necessary decision"" and the government's ""committed to returning to 0.7%"" once the financial situation allows. More than Â£1bn will be spent on Covid and global health, Â£500m towards tackling climate change and Â£400m on getting girls into education. Much of the humanitarian aid budget will be focused on countries most at risk of famine such as Yemen, Syria, Somalia and South Sudan.

Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside?,"Leaders of the world's seven richest nations - including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - are gathering in Italy to decide what to do to about the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Ukraine. The G7 summit will also involve leaders from Africa and the Indo-Pacific region, and will discuss economic co-operation with developing countries. The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. Russia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014for its takeover of Crimea. China has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's second-largest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are. Both these nations are in the G20 group of developed and developing nations. The EU is not a member of the G7, but attends the annual summits. Throughout the year, G7 ministers and officials hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Italy has the G7 presidency in 2024. Italy's premier, Giorgia Meloni, is hosting the 2024 G7 summit The 2024 G7 summit will be held from 13 to 15 June in Apulia, in Italy. It will bethe first major international forum hosted by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,since she took office in October 2022. As well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Italy says it wants the summit to focus on Africa and migration, economic security, and international co-operation on artificial intelligence (AI). Between them, the G7 nations have already imposed on Russiathe biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy. They have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system. G7 and EU nations have also frozen about $325bn (Â£254bn) of Russian financial assets which were held in their territories, such as the foreign currency reserves of Russia's central bank. The G7 nations are nowworking on a schemeto take the interest those assets have earned and pass it to Ukraine in the form of a loan. This could amount to $50bn. On 3 June, G7 leadersall backed the plan put forward by US President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza.,external He has proposed an immediate ceasefire by Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages, an increase in aid for Gaza and a peace deal which guarantees Israel's security and the safety of Gazan residents. Italy says""the relationship with developing nations and emerging economies will be central"",externalto the G7 summit, and that it ""will work to build a co-operation model based on mutually beneficial partnerships"". It has invited leaders from 12 developing countries in Africa, South America and the Indo-Pacific region. Under thethe Mattei Plan,,externalItaly will give grants and loans worth 5.5bn euros (Â£4.6bn) to several African countries, to help develop their economies. The scheme would also position Italy as an energy hub, building gas and hydrogen pipelines between Africa and Europe. However, many commentatorssuspect it may be a cover,externalfor Italy to crack down on further migration from Africa. Italy is asking other nations to contribute financially to the scheme. As the G7's president in 2023, Japan pushed for the group to draw up a plan for international economic security. The G7 adopted ananti-coercion pact,,externaldesigned to stop countries such as China and Russia using their economic strength to impose their will on others. In December 2023,Italy pulled out of the Belt and Road Initiative- a scheme to expand China's ports and transport routes worldwide to boost trade. Ms Meloni said that joining had been ""a serious mistake"". The US has called the initiative ""debt-trap diplomacy"" on China's part. It is thought thatthe US is keen for G7 leaders to take further action on economic security,externalat the summit in Italy. The safety of AI was raised at the 2023 summit in Japan and resulted in theHiroshima AI Process,external, intended to promote ""safe, secure, and trustworthy AI worldwide"". However, this was only a collection of voluntary measures. The G7 summit may look at drawing up further international regulations for AI safety, building on theAI Act adopted by the EUand theUS president's executive order on AI. The G7 cannot pass laws. However, some of its past decisions have had global effects. For example, the G7 played a crucial role in setting up aglobal fund to fight malaria and Aids,externalin 2002. Ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in the UK, the group's finance ministersagreed to make multinational companies pay more tax. It has also provided financial aid to developing countries, and taken steps to tackle climate change.

Visitors face fines for stealing Sardinia beach sand,"The white sands of Sardinia's beaches are treasured on the island - and elsewhere Dozens of people are facing fines of up to â¬3,000 (Â£2,580; $3,650) for removing beach sand and shells from the Italian island of Sardinia, local media report. Authorities said on Saturday that 41 individuals had been reported for the theft of about 100kg (220lb) of items from beaches in separate incidents. Sardinia's famed white sand is treasured on the island and it is strictly forbidden to remove it. The trade in Sardinian sand, pebbles and shells was made illegal in 2017. The fines imposed might seem heavy-handed, but for years islanders have complained about the theft of their natural assets. Tourists, mainly Europeans and including some Italians, bottle the sand to keep as souvenirs or auction it online. Why Sardinia's tourists taking sand 'souvenirs' face fines As part of an ongoing investigation, military and customs police in Sardinia have been monitoring airports and harbours, and also searching websites for illegal sales. Tourists attempting to remove bottled sand in their luggage have been caught during customs checks using X-rays. Police said that in recent days they had discovered dozens of online adverts for the sale of items collected from the Mediterranean island's coasts illegally, some at what they described as ""high prices"". The details of those accused of wrongdoing have been reported to the Forestry Corps (national state police) of Sardinia and face fines under the island's regional law. The police said they had already collected about â¬13,000 in fines, adding that the seized items were being returned to the areas from which they were taken where possible. Allow Facebook content?

On a Facebook page set up to highlight the issue called ""Sardinia robbed and plundered,external"", users often describe the threat of such thefts as an environmental emergency. Pierluigi Cocco, an environmental scientist and resident of the Sardinian capital Cagliari, told the BBC that the beaches were ""the main reason why tourists are attracted to the island of Sardinia"". For some people, he said, taking the sand home served as a reminder of a ""treasured memory"". But he said the removal of sand could contribute to the reduction of beaches over the years, which would pose an environmental threat as climate change brings about a rise in sea levels. Images like this are shared on social media as an example of sand seized at airports The island's Forestry Corps has also said that taking sand could, over time, destroy Sardinia's beaches, which were created over millions of years. In 2019, a French couple visiting Sardinia werecaught with 40kg of sand in the boot of their SUV. Police discovered the sand crammed into 14 plastic bottles taken from a beach in Chia, southern Sardinia. The couple told police they wanted to take it home as a ""souvenir"" and did not realise they had committed an offence.
