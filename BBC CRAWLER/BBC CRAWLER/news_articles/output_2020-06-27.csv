The company said the move was designed to keep them safe from Covid-19.

""They have access to healthcare and all of their essential living needs and costs are met.""

MicheÃ¡l Martin becomes new Irish PM after vote,"MicheÃ¡l Martin will lead his Fianna FÃ¡il party into a historic coalition with Fine Gael and the Greens Ireland's new taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said the fight against Covid-19 will be his government's first priority. The 59-year-old Cork native was elected at a special meeting of the Irish parliament in Dublin. He has been the leader of the Fianna FÃ¡il party since 2011. He will lead a three-party coalition consisting of Fianna FÃ¡il, Fine Gael and the Green Party. Mr Martin said that to be elected to serve as taoiseach was ""one of the greatest honours which anyone can receive"". Speaking to the DÃ¡il (Irish lower house) as taoiseach for the first time, Mr Martin said the focus would be on the social, economic, and cultural recovery from the coronavirus. He said would would begin immediately on preparing an investment-led jobs and recovery initiative. These proposals would be brought before the DÃ¡il next month. It is the first time in history that former Civil War rivals Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael have governed together. Mr Martin is expected tolead the country until December 2022before handing back over to Leo Varadkar, the Fine Gael leader. MicheÃ¡l Martin pictured leaving Dublin's Convention Centre after being elected Mr Martin has been a member of the DÃ¡il (lower house of Irish parliament) for just over 30 years. He served as cabinet minister in several Fianna FÃ¡il governments from 1997 to 2011. As health minister in 2004, he became the first national government minister in any part of the world to introducea workplace smoking ban,external, which also banned the public from lighting up in pubs. 2020 Election Profile: Fianna FÃ¡il's MicheÃ¡l Martin Mr Martin was elected taoiseach by members of the DÃ¡il in a special sitting on Saturday. The vote took place at the Convention Centre in Dublin, rather than its traditional home at Leinster House, due to Covid-19 social distancing rules. TDs gathered at the convention centre in Dublin, due to social distancing requirements A majority of 93 members of the DÃ¡il voted in favour of him taking the role, while 63 members voted against him. Mr Martin made the trip to the president's official residence, Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in to be presented with the seal of office Mr Martin appointed a new cabinet on Saturday evening, dividing the roles between all three parties. Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar is now the tÃ¡naiste (deputy PM) as well as minister for enterprise, trade and employment. Writing on Twitter on Saturday evening, he said he was ""honoured"" to be appointed to the position, and that his party was ""doing what is right for the country"". Green Party leader Eamon Ryan is minister for transport, energy and climate action. The rest of the posts were distributed as follows: Minister for Finance - Paschal Donohoe (Fine Gael) Minister for Health  - Stephen Donnelly (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence - Simon Coveney (Fine Gael) Minister for Justice - Helen McEntee  Fine Gael) Minister for Education - Norma Foley (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Agriculture - Barry Cowen (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Housing - Darragh O'Brien (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Public Expenditure - Michael McGrath (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Rural Affairs and Social Protection - Heather Humphreys (Fine Gael) Minister for Higher Education - Simon Harris (Fine Gael) Minister for Communications and Culture - Catherine Martin (Green Party) Minister for Children and Disability and Equality - Roderic O'Gorman (Green Party) Mr Varadkar has been caretaker taoiseach since the general election in February. Higher Education Minister Simon Harris (centre left), remains in the cabinet, having previously served as health minister No party came close to winning a majorityin the poll which would enable them to govern alone, but coalition talks were then halted by the coronavirus pandemic. Fianna FÃ¡il won the most seats, but the two larger parties needed the support of the Greens to have a working majority in the Irish parliament (the DÃ¡il). The party leaders and their negotiating teams reached agreement on a coalition deal earlier this month. This video can not be played What challenges lie ahead for the new Irish government? There have also been nominations made to the Seanad, the upper house of the Irish legislature. Of the house's 60 seats, the Taoiseach has made 11 nominations, of which there are four each for Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il, with two for the Green Party. The final nomination goes to Traveller rights activist Eileen Flynn. MicheÃ¡l Martin confirmed on Saturday he would be setting up a shared island unit within the Department of the Taoiseach. This was criticised on Twitter by Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard, who highlighted that none of the Seanad picks represented Northern Ireland. Ian Marshall, a unionist from County Armagh, previously served in the Seanad from 2018 until 2020, and was supported in his original nomination by Sinn FÃ©in. MicheÃ¡l Martin was the only Fianna FÃ¡il leader in the party's history not to have served as taoiseach, but that changed today. MicheÃ¡l Martin is expected to be taoiseach (prime minister) for two and a half years He will hold the role for 30 months before handing over to Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar. The two parties, both centrist, Fianna FÃ¡il slightly to the left and Fine Gael to the right, have dominated the politics of the state since its foundation. Although there has been little to separate them policy-wise for decades, their decision to share power in government for the first time is historic. But it's also a political necessity for their leaders to keep Sinn FÃ©in, the party that got the most votes in February's general election, away from government. Sinn FÃ©in has accused the two of using the Greens as a ""fig leaf"" to disguise their denial of the electorate's demand for change. The three parties have five years to disprove those who claim the new coalition is simply a slightly greener version of business as usual in such areas as housing and dealing with climate change in a radical manner. A meeting between Mr Martin and Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill, is likely in the coming days. While there will be new faces, there will be some old problems to talk about such as Brexit and Covid-19. Not everyone supported the new taoiseach during Saturday's vote in the Convention Centre. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald accused Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael of conspiring to exclude them from government. Mary Lou McDonald claimed Sinn FÃ©in had been excluded from power At February's election, Sinn FÃ©in took 24.5% of first-preference votes, compared to 22% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 21% for Fine Gael. ""Faced with the prospect of losing their grip on power, Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael have circled the wagons,"" she said, claiming the new coalition was a ""marriage of convenience"". Fine Gael leader and outgoing taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his party would not make a nomination but instead would support the nomination of MicheÃ¡l Martin. Leo Varadkar and MicheÃ¡l Martin chat before the vote in the Convention Centre Green Party leader Eamon Ryan also supported the nomination of Mr Martin for taoiseach, saying the Fianna FÃ¡il leader was ""perfectly qualified to run the country"". Labour leader Alan Kelly said his party would not support the nomination of either Mr Martin or Ms McDonald. People Before Profit Richard Boyd Barrett did not support Mr Martin's nomination and said the coalition's programme for government was a ""re-hash and reheating of the same failed policies"".

Demonstrations in support of the Black Lives Matter movement were also held in Portsmouth, Oxford, Coventry and Stoke-on-Trent. Fadumo Osman, one of the organisers of the Manchester event, said: ""I myself am a black Muslim female, I can see myself with Shukri. It could have been myself, my sister."" She said organisers wanted to ""put pressure on the institutions involvedâ¦ to be transparent"". Ms Osman, who came to the UK as a Somali child refugee, said: ""A lot of underprivileged children face difficulty within schools when they first arrive in the country and I hope that something is done institutionally to prevent this happening again."" Hundreds of people marched through London on Saturday Shukri grew up with her Somali family in a refugee camp in Kenya until 2017, before moving to the UK. In February, her mother Zam Zam Ture told the coroner's inquest that Shukri had never liked swimming. The inquest heard from witnesses who saw Shukri with other children, who cannot be named for legal reasons due to their ages, before her death. The hearing was told that Child One confessed to her foster carer that she had said ""if you don't get in the water I'm going to kill you"" but added the comment had been made in a ""joking manner"". The hearing was adjourned before lockdown restrictions, with the next date yet to be confirmed. More than a million people have signed a petition over the case After Shukri's death, her school said it would review its anti-bullying policy amid speculation over the circumstances. In June 2019, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it was treating the circumstances as a ""tragic incident"", adding that it did not believe there were any suspicious circumstances. However, the Independent Office of Police Conduct announced an investigation in August into GMP's handling of the case, which was completed in January. Its conclusions have been shared with Shukri's family and GMP, and will be published following the inquest.

The attack happened at the 91-room hotel, which is understood to have been housing about 100 asylum seekers during the coronavirus pandemic. Siraj, an asylum seeker who was staying at the hotel, told BBC News the suspect had complained about noise from people in adjoining rooms disturbing him before the attack.

Vietnam's British patient: 'I'd be dead in any other country',"""If I'd been almost anywhere else on the planet, I'd be dead. They would have flicked the switch after 30 days,"" says Stephen Cameron from his hospital bed. The 42-year-old Scottish pilot spent 68 days on a ventilator, thought to be a longer stretch of time than any patient in the UK. He did so not in a hospital in his hometown of Motherwell, but in Vietnam's sprawling and hectic Ho Chi Minh City, with no close friends or family for thousands of miles. Cameron, the last Covid-19 patient in an intensive care unit in Vietnam, has been the sickest doctors have had to deal with during the outbreak. The country, home to 95 million people, has seen only a few hundred confirmed cases, single-digit ICU admissions and not a single recorded death. So rare was a case of Cameron's severity in Vietnam, every minute detail of his recovery was reported in national newspapers and on TV news bulletins. He's now known nationwide as Patient 91, the moniker given to him by public health officials when he fell ill in March. ""I'm very humbled by how I've been taken into the hearts of the Vietnamese people,"" says Cameron, speaking exclusively to the BBC. ""And most of all I'm grateful for the bloody-mindedness of the doctors in not wanting me to die on their watch."" Dozens of Vietnam's intensive care specialists held regular conference calls to discuss Cameron's condition. ""The very small number of critical care patients meant anyone who was severely ill got the attention of all the country's top-level clinicians,"" explains Dr Kidong Park, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative to Vietnam. How 'overreaction' made Vietnam a virus success Tracking the global outbreak Vietnam's handwashing song goes global For much of Cameron's two-and-a-half months in a medically induced coma, he depended on an Ecmo machine, a form of life support only used in the most extreme cases, to survive. The machines extract blood from a patient's body and infuse it with oxygen, before pumping it back in. ""I'm lucky that the only lasting effect seems to be that my legs aren't yet strong enough to hold me, but I'm doing physiotherapy twice a day,"" says Cameron. ""At one point, my friend Craig was told by the Foreign Office I had a 10% chance of survival, so he planned for the worst - he gave up my apartment and started doing things somebody would do if I was coming home in a box."" Since he regained consciousness, he describes several tearful phone conversations with friends back home, who ""didn't think [he'd] ever come back"". Doctors had to contend with multiple complications while Cameron was in a coma. His blood became extremely sticky leading to clots. His kidneys failed meaning they required dialysis and his lung capacity plummeted to 10%. Doctors from hospitals across Vietnam discussing Patient 91's condition ""When it came out in the press here that I needed a lung transplant, apparently loads of people offered their lungs, including a 70-year-old Vietnam war veteran,"" he smiles. ""But it would have been a double lung transplant so that wouldn't have ended well for him."" Despite the outpouring of support from the Vietnamese people and the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on Stephen Cameron's care, the reaction when he first tested positive for the virus was less welcoming. Cameron became ill only a few weeks after arriving in Vietnam in early February. Like many Western pilots, he'd headed to Asia to ply his trade for higher pay in the booming regional air travel industry. Two nights before he was due to pilot his first flight for Vietnam Airlines, and the night before most bars and clubs were set to shut in Ho Chi Minh City to contain the virus, he headed to meet a friend in an expat bar in an upmarket district of the city. At the time, Vietnam had had fewer than 50 confirmed cases but, according to Prof Guy Thwaites, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit based in Ho Chi Minh City and a government advisor on infectious diseases, the population ""already had a healthy amount of respect for and fear of the virus"". It was the weekend before St Patrick's Day, so the Buddha Bar and Grill was packed with revellers wearing Irish fancy dress when Cameron arrived just after 22:00. ""I don't drink, I largely kept myself to myself in the corner, played a few rounds of pool and went home at around 3.15am,"" he recalls. However, when he developed a fever, the day after his maiden flight, and 12 others at the bar tested positive in the days following, sympathy for him among locals was in short supply. The Buddha bar cluster, as it became known in the local press, was the single biggest outbreak of coronavirus in south Vietnam, infecting nearly 20 people both indirectly and directly. The bar was checked thoroughly by police before being allowed to reopen And for some on social media, Cameron, who had criss-crossed the city taking in the sights, was to blame. Despite there being no proof he was the source of the outbreak, one prominent businessman, Luong Hoai Nam, labelled Patient 91 a ""time bomb"". He called for foreigners breaking the rules to be deported, earning plaudits from his followers on social media ""There seemed to be a desire to pin it on me coming from abroad, as I did a visa run to Bangkok a week earlier,"" says Cameron, who's convinced he too was infected at the Buddha bar, and was not the source of the outbreak. ""I was the first person to put my hands up and say: 'Look I don't feel well'. It was inevitable I would be blamed."" On 18 March, Cameron was admitted to hospital after testing positive for the virus, and authorities moved swiftly to shut down the bar and quarantine everyone in his apartment building. In total, 4,000 people linked to the Buddha bar outbreak were tested. ""Patient 91's condition got worse very quickly,"" recalls Prof Luong Ngoc Khue, who serves on the Vietnamese health ministry's Covid-19 taskforce and advised on Cameron's treatment. ""There was a worrying decrease in the function of not just his lungs, but his kidneys, liver and blood flow."" With his condition deteriorating, Cameron remembers taking the bold decision of asking to be ventilated. ""I was exhausted as I couldn't sleep and I just thought: 'Oh, put me under and get it sorted',"" he says. He was then comatose for weeks and weeks on end, as doctors agonised over his treatment. Meanwhile, the small number of other ICU patients in Vietnam recovered and went home. All the while, his case gained prominence, with top politicians promising to put every effort into keeping him alive, as the hospital temporarily footed the bill for the spiralling costs of his care. ""There's a lot of political kudos that Vietnam can take from my recovery,"" he observes, ""and it keeps their record, which is pretty phenomenal on Covid, very, very low."" Prof Khue insists everyone - foreign or Vietnamese - had access to good quality care. ""We focused on treating sick people at the highest level, both in terms of facilities and human resources, regardless of whether they were Vietnamese or from abroad,"" he says. But he gleefully reports that ""49 out of 50 foreign patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital"". When Stephen Cameron was first ventilated in early April, there were just over a million cases of coronavirus around the world. When doctors woke him up, on 12 June, there were in excess of seven million. But Vietnam had avoided the worst of the virus. There has not been a recorded case of community transmission since 16 April. ""I never thought it would take as long as 10 weeks to wake me up. I remember being roused, I remember getting my tracheotomy, I remember being wheeled through hospital corridors - and then the next few days are a blur."" From his recovery bed in a private room in Cho Ray Hospital on the other side of Ho Chi Minh City, where he was transferred after being taken off a ventilator and testing negative for the virus, Cameron is feeling the fallout of several months being motionless and severely ill. He's lost 20kg (3.1 stone) and his muscles are so wasted it's an effort to swing his leg up even a few inches. He's also suffered from severe fatigue and depressive lows since waking up, in addition to the nagging fear that post-traumatic stress could be just around the corner. ""I've been through a lot mentally. Right now, all I want to do is return home. It's the lack of noise and heat I miss the most. There's such a buzz here from all the scooters' horns and it's monsoon season. Fifteen degrees back home for me is just nice."" In the past few weeks, he's been visited at his bedside by not just a procession of doctors and nurses, but also high-ranking diplomats, government officials and politicians. Most recently, his hospital room played host to the British consul general and the chairman of Ho Chi Minh City's People's Committee. Stephen Cameron with the British consul general Ian Gibbons and the chairman of Ho Chi Minh City's People's Committee Nguyen Thanh Phong He recalls the mayor promising he'll ""be back in England soon"", before being swiftly corrected. ""I told him, if I get dumped in England, I won't be too happy,"" he jokes. ""I need to get home to Scotland, it's 400 miles away."" There's also a practical side to Cameron's desire to return home as soon as possible. The twice-daily rehab sessions he receives are made more difficult by the language barrier as very few medical staff speak good English. Rehabilitation for the most severely ill patients after ICU is always a delicate dance. Progress and pitfalls are faced in equal measure, and it can be dragged out over several years. The hospital, in which Cameron is a patient, dates back to Vietnam's French colonial era  - it's one of the country's leading medical facilities ""I feel like I'm taking up a bed that somebody who is really ill could take."" But his care hasn't come free. An Ecmo machine costs $5,000-10,000 (Â£4,000 - Â£8,000) a day to operate and he was reliant on one for eight-and-a-half weeks. The ongoing wrangling over who will cover the costs are causing him stress and diverting attention away from his recovery. At first, the Hospital for Tropical Diseases paid out of its own pocket for his treatment. Then, it seemed the British embassy would intervene. His work insurance eventually covered the cost. But the funds for his stay in Cho Ray Hospital are still up in the air. ""It's become really, really frustrating. At the beginning, I'd send the insurance company an email and they would say: 'Yeh, we'll sort that'. Now, the response is 'We'll deal with this shortly' and nothing seems to happen."" The 42-year-old Scot is undergoing intensive rehab to try and walk again There's a place for Cameron on a Vietnam Airlines flight back to the UK on 12 July. Meanwhile, planes continue to shuttle Vietnamese nationals back from Europe, and having been declared fit to fly a week ago, Cameron is confused why he can't return home sooner. ""As I'm such a well-known public figure here now, everything about my case is controlled by the government."" The politics of his return are a reminder that the miraculous recovery of Patient 91 is not just a story of a Scottish pilot who recovered from Covid-19 and overcame the odds. It is the story of how a developing Southeast Asian country with a turbulent recent history beat the odds too.

UK to open up European holidays from 6 July,"Spain is just one of many European countries to reopen its beaches, with additional safety measures in place Blanket restrictions on non-essential overseas travel will be relaxed in the UK from 6 July, ministers have said. Holidaymakers are expected to be allowed to travel to certain European countries without having to spend 14 days in quarantine when they return. They are thought to include Spain, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Turkey, Germany and Norway - but not Portugal or Sweden. The full list of travel corridors with the UK will be published next week. A government spokesman said the new rules would give people ""the opportunity for a summer holiday abroad"" while also boosting the UK economy - but stressed the relaxation depended on risks staying low. When can I go on holiday in the UK? What it's like to fly in the 'new normal' A traffic light system will be introduced - with countries classified as green, amber and red depending on the prevalence of coronavirus. The UK is likely to discuss arrangements with countries over the coming days. The government said it ""wouldn't hesitate to put on the brakes"" if the situation changes. Ministers in Scotland have said thata decision has not yet been taken to ease restrictions on holiday travel. Although the UK government has powers over border controls, health protection issues on overseas travel must be supported by Scottish government regulations because health is a devolved matter. Travel services have seen a sharp rise in the number of holiday bookings. Andrew Flintham, managing director at TUI UK and Ireland, said the company had seen bookings increase by 50% this week compared to last, with Spain and Greece the most popular destinations. John Keefe, director of public affairs at Eurotunnel, said phones have been ""ringing off the hook"" with eager customers wanting to make bookings. Maximum service of four departures an hour at peak times will resume from 6 July, he added. Mr Keefe said bookings had been ""growing"" in the past three weeks, but they ""exploded when the news came out last night"". Portugal has seen a rise in the number of new cases in and around Lisbon recently, while Sweden is also unlikely to be on the list because the infection rate there is higher than in the UK. They are both likely to be classified as red. But the government spokesman conceded there would be nothing to stop someone avoiding quarantine by flying into a Spanish airport, driving over the border into Portugal for their holiday and returning by the same route. UK travellers will still have to hand over the address they plan to stay at on their return from abroad, no matter which country they are coming back from. And they will also be legally required to wear face coverings on planes and ferries. Portugal's Secretary of State for Tourism Rita Baptista Marques told BBC Breakfast her country had been named the most secure destination in Europe by the World Tourism and Travel Council and is a ""clean and safe destination"". ""Some countries are in this list and Portugal is fighting for a place,"" Ms Marques said, adding that the situation is ""completely under control"", with significant testing being carried out. The travel sector has gone to war with the government over its blanket quarantine policy. So a more nuanced, risk-based approach will quieten the critics to some extent. But the storm of controversy swirling around this policy won't completely go away. Portugal, which will probably not be on next week's list of exemptions, feels hard done-by. The country is desperate that UK tourists return. And although in public health terms the US is not currently close to being on the list, it does potentially present a tricky diplomatic dynamic, given the normally cosy relationship between Washington and London. And the transatlantic flight market is lucrative too. This announcement is a step in the right direction for UK aviation, but they want testing at airports to also provide another way for passengers to be exempt. So far, in public, the government has said very little about that. Greece's Tourism Minister Haris Theoharis suggested that it could be up to three weeks before the country is happy to open up an air bridge to the UK, as discussions with health experts are continuing. Mr Theoharis told BBC Breakfast: ""As soon as we have more clarity, we'll be able to convey the right dates and the right message so that's why it's not easy for me to pinpoint exact dates."" Spainlifted its state of emergency last Sunday, reopening its borders to visitors from most of Europe and allowing British tourists to enter the country without having to quarantine. Travel industry group ABTA said the travel sector ""eagerly"" anticipates confirmation of the list of countries, which ""should encourage customers to book"". ""The blanket Foreign Office advice against all but essential travel is still a major impediment to travel, however, and we look forward to the government adopting a similar risk-based approach to that advice,"" it said in a statement. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters COMPARING COUNTRIES:The pitfalls of doing so R0, FURLOUGH:The language of the outbreak RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? Jonathan Smith, from ABTA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that more travel companies were likely to go bust before a full recovery was felt. He said people should expect holidays to look different - not just at airports and on aircraft, but in terms of social activities, like eating out. The UK introduced rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days on 8 June. It was widely criticised by the travel industry and MPs of all parties. People arriving in the UK should drive their own car to their destination, where possible, and once there they must not use public transport or taxis Arrivals must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors - except for essential support. They are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others Those arriving in England, Wales and Northern Ireland could face a fine of Â£1,000 if they fail to self-isolate for the full 14 days, while they face a Â£480 finein Scotland.The maximum fine for repeat offenders in Scotland is Â£5,000 For more on the rulesclick here. Foreign Office advice against all but essential international travel has been in place since 17 March. ""Our new risk-assessment system will enable us to carefully open a number of safe travel routes around the world - giving people the opportunity for a summer holiday abroad and boosting the UK economy through tourism and business,"" said a government spokesman. ""But we will not hesitate to put on the brakes if any risks re-emerge.""

Designer of iconic 'I â¥ NY' logo dies aged 91,"This video can not be played Milton Glaser says the I love New York design ""almost never came into existence"" Milton Glaser, the influential American graphic designer who created the ""I â¥ NY"" logo, has died aged 91. Made for a 1977 tourism campaign, the logo rapidly gained recognition across the world and has been described as the most frequently imitated in history. Glaser later said he was ""flabbergasted by what happened to this little, simple nothing of an idea"". He also created a famous poster of Bob Dylan with psychedelic hair and was a co-founder of New York magazine. The cause of his death was a stroke,his wife Shirley told the New York Times,external. Milton Glaser was given the the National Medal of Arts in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama Glaser was born in the Bronx borough of New York City in 1929. He studied at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, a college in Manhattan, and at the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna, Italy. In 1954, Glaser set up Push Pin Studios with three Cooper Union classmates and helped bring a new visual language to commercial art, seeking inspiration from everything from Art Nouveau to Chinese wash drawing, German woodcuts, and the cartoons of the 1930s. His poster of Bob Dylan,externalfeatured a silhouette of the musician based on a self-portrait by Marcel Duchamp and brightly coloured locks of hair borrowed from Islamic art. The poster was included in Dylan's 1967 album Greatest Hits, which was bought by six million fans, and adorned countless walls. The poster for Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits was inspired by Marcel Duchamp and Islamic art In 1968, Glaser co-founded New York magazine and was its design director for nine years. ""Around our office, of course, he will forever be one of the small team of men and women that, in the late sixties, yanked New York out of the newspaper morgue and turned it into a great American magazine,""the magazine's obituary said,external. In 1974, he established his own design firm, Milton Glaser, Inc. Three years later, he designed the ""I â¥ NY"" logo free of charge to help promote tourism in his home city, amid a crime wave and financial crisis. He came up with the idea while riding in a taxi andscribbled it in red crayon on an envelope,external, which is now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). ""It is one of those peculiarities of your own life where you don't know the consequences of your own actions,""he told the New York Times in 2008,external. ""Who in the world would have thought that this silly little bit of ephemera would become one of the most pervasive images of the 20th Century?"" After the 9/11 attacks, Glaser released an amended version of the logo that featured a bruised heart and read ""I â¥ NY MORE THAN EVER,external"". After the 9/11 attacks, the Daily News printed a modified version of the 'I â¥ NY' logo Glaser is also known for his designingthe World Health Organization's international Aids symbol and poster,external, thelogo for the Brooklyn Brewery,external, andan advertisement for the final series of Mad Men,external.

What are my holiday and refund rights?,"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

Martin to become Irish PM after parties back deal,"MicheÃ¡l Martin will lead his Fianna FÃ¡il party into a historic coalition with Fine Gael and the Greens Ireland's new taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said the fight against Covid-19 will be his government's first priority. The 59-year-old Cork native was elected at a special meeting of the Irish parliament in Dublin. He has been the leader of the Fianna FÃ¡il party since 2011. He will lead a three-party coalition consisting of Fianna FÃ¡il, Fine Gael and the Green Party. Mr Martin said that to be elected to serve as taoiseach was ""one of the greatest honours which anyone can receive"". Speaking to the DÃ¡il (Irish lower house) as taoiseach for the first time, Mr Martin said the focus would be on the social, economic, and cultural recovery from the coronavirus. He said would would begin immediately on preparing an investment-led jobs and recovery initiative. These proposals would be brought before the DÃ¡il next month. It is the first time in history that former Civil War rivals Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael have governed together. Mr Martin is expected tolead the country until December 2022before handing back over to Leo Varadkar, the Fine Gael leader. MicheÃ¡l Martin pictured leaving Dublin's Convention Centre after being elected Mr Martin has been a member of the DÃ¡il (lower house of Irish parliament) for just over 30 years. He served as cabinet minister in several Fianna FÃ¡il governments from 1997 to 2011. As health minister in 2004, he became the first national government minister in any part of the world to introducea workplace smoking ban,external, which also banned the public from lighting up in pubs. 2020 Election Profile: Fianna FÃ¡il's MicheÃ¡l Martin Mr Martin was elected taoiseach by members of the DÃ¡il in a special sitting on Saturday. The vote took place at the Convention Centre in Dublin, rather than its traditional home at Leinster House, due to Covid-19 social distancing rules. TDs gathered at the convention centre in Dublin, due to social distancing requirements A majority of 93 members of the DÃ¡il voted in favour of him taking the role, while 63 members voted against him. Mr Martin made the trip to the president's official residence, Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in to be presented with the seal of office Mr Martin appointed a new cabinet on Saturday evening, dividing the roles between all three parties. Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar is now the tÃ¡naiste (deputy PM) as well as minister for enterprise, trade and employment. Writing on Twitter on Saturday evening, he said he was ""honoured"" to be appointed to the position, and that his party was ""doing what is right for the country"". Green Party leader Eamon Ryan is minister for transport, energy and climate action. The rest of the posts were distributed as follows: Minister for Finance - Paschal Donohoe (Fine Gael) Minister for Health  - Stephen Donnelly (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence - Simon Coveney (Fine Gael) Minister for Justice - Helen McEntee  Fine Gael) Minister for Education - Norma Foley (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Agriculture - Barry Cowen (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Housing - Darragh O'Brien (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Public Expenditure - Michael McGrath (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Rural Affairs and Social Protection - Heather Humphreys (Fine Gael) Minister for Higher Education - Simon Harris (Fine Gael) Minister for Communications and Culture - Catherine Martin (Green Party) Minister for Children and Disability and Equality - Roderic O'Gorman (Green Party) Mr Varadkar has been caretaker taoiseach since the general election in February. Higher Education Minister Simon Harris (centre left), remains in the cabinet, having previously served as health minister No party came close to winning a majorityin the poll which would enable them to govern alone, but coalition talks were then halted by the coronavirus pandemic. Fianna FÃ¡il won the most seats, but the two larger parties needed the support of the Greens to have a working majority in the Irish parliament (the DÃ¡il). The party leaders and their negotiating teams reached agreement on a coalition deal earlier this month. This video can not be played What challenges lie ahead for the new Irish government? There have also been nominations made to the Seanad, the upper house of the Irish legislature. Of the house's 60 seats, the Taoiseach has made 11 nominations, of which there are four each for Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il, with two for the Green Party. The final nomination goes to Traveller rights activist Eileen Flynn. MicheÃ¡l Martin confirmed on Saturday he would be setting up a shared island unit within the Department of the Taoiseach. This was criticised on Twitter by Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard, who highlighted that none of the Seanad picks represented Northern Ireland. Ian Marshall, a unionist from County Armagh, previously served in the Seanad from 2018 until 2020, and was supported in his original nomination by Sinn FÃ©in. MicheÃ¡l Martin was the only Fianna FÃ¡il leader in the party's history not to have served as taoiseach, but that changed today. MicheÃ¡l Martin is expected to be taoiseach (prime minister) for two and a half years He will hold the role for 30 months before handing over to Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar. The two parties, both centrist, Fianna FÃ¡il slightly to the left and Fine Gael to the right, have dominated the politics of the state since its foundation. Although there has been little to separate them policy-wise for decades, their decision to share power in government for the first time is historic. But it's also a political necessity for their leaders to keep Sinn FÃ©in, the party that got the most votes in February's general election, away from government. Sinn FÃ©in has accused the two of using the Greens as a ""fig leaf"" to disguise their denial of the electorate's demand for change. The three parties have five years to disprove those who claim the new coalition is simply a slightly greener version of business as usual in such areas as housing and dealing with climate change in a radical manner. A meeting between Mr Martin and Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill, is likely in the coming days. While there will be new faces, there will be some old problems to talk about such as Brexit and Covid-19. Not everyone supported the new taoiseach during Saturday's vote in the Convention Centre. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald accused Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael of conspiring to exclude them from government. Mary Lou McDonald claimed Sinn FÃ©in had been excluded from power At February's election, Sinn FÃ©in took 24.5% of first-preference votes, compared to 22% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 21% for Fine Gael. ""Faced with the prospect of losing their grip on power, Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael have circled the wagons,"" she said, claiming the new coalition was a ""marriage of convenience"". Fine Gael leader and outgoing taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his party would not make a nomination but instead would support the nomination of MicheÃ¡l Martin. Leo Varadkar and MicheÃ¡l Martin chat before the vote in the Convention Centre Green Party leader Eamon Ryan also supported the nomination of Mr Martin for taoiseach, saying the Fianna FÃ¡il leader was ""perfectly qualified to run the country"". Labour leader Alan Kelly said his party would not support the nomination of either Mr Martin or Ms McDonald. People Before Profit Richard Boyd Barrett did not support Mr Martin's nomination and said the coalition's programme for government was a ""re-hash and reheating of the same failed policies"".

Fianna FÃ¡il won the most seats, but the two larger parties needed the support of the Greens to have a working majority in the Irish parliament (the DÃ¡il). The party leaders and their negotiating teams reached agreement on a coalition deal earlier this month. This video can not be played What challenges lie ahead for the new Irish government? There have also been nominations made to the Seanad, the upper house of the Irish legislature. Of the house's 60 seats, the Taoiseach has made 11 nominations, of which there are four each for Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il, with two for the Green Party. The final nomination goes to Traveller rights activist Eileen Flynn. MicheÃ¡l Martin confirmed on Saturday he would be setting up a shared island unit within the Department of the Taoiseach. This was criticised on Twitter by Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard, who highlighted that none of the Seanad picks represented Northern Ireland. Ian Marshall, a unionist from County Armagh, previously served in the Seanad from 2018 until 2020, and was supported in his original nomination by Sinn FÃ©in. MicheÃ¡l Martin was the only Fianna FÃ¡il leader in the party's history not to have served as taoiseach, but that changed today. MicheÃ¡l Martin is expected to be taoiseach (prime minister) for two and a half years He will hold the role for 30 months before handing over to Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar. The two parties, both centrist, Fianna FÃ¡il slightly to the left and Fine Gael to the right, have dominated the politics of the state since its foundation. Although there has been little to separate them policy-wise for decades, their decision to share power in government for the first time is historic. But it's also a political necessity for their leaders to keep Sinn FÃ©in, the party that got the most votes in February's general election, away from government. Sinn FÃ©in has accused the two of using the Greens as a ""fig leaf"" to disguise their denial of the electorate's demand for change. The three parties have five years to disprove those who claim the new coalition is simply a slightly greener version of business as usual in such areas as housing and dealing with climate change in a radical manner. A meeting between Mr Martin and Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill, is likely in the coming days. While there will be new faces, there will be some old problems to talk about such as Brexit and Covid-19. Not everyone supported the new taoiseach during Saturday's vote in the Convention Centre. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald accused Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael of conspiring to exclude them from government. Mary Lou McDonald claimed Sinn FÃ©in had been excluded from power At February's election, Sinn FÃ©in took 24.5% of first-preference votes, compared to 22% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 21% for Fine Gael. ""Faced with the prospect of losing their grip on power, Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael have circled the wagons,"" she said, claiming the new coalition was a ""marriage of convenience"". Fine Gael leader and outgoing taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his party would not make a nomination but instead would support the nomination of MicheÃ¡l Martin. Leo Varadkar and MicheÃ¡l Martin chat before the vote in the Convention Centre Green Party leader Eamon Ryan also supported the nomination of Mr Martin for taoiseach, saying the Fianna FÃ¡il leader was ""perfectly qualified to run the country"". Labour leader Alan Kelly said his party would not support the nomination of either Mr Martin or Ms McDonald. People Before Profit Richard Boyd Barrett did not support Mr Martin's nomination and said the coalition's programme for government was a ""re-hash and reheating of the same failed policies"".

How Vietnam saved a British patient and kept a clean sheet,"""If I'd been almost anywhere else on the planet, I'd be dead. They would have flicked the switch after 30 days,"" says Stephen Cameron from his hospital bed. The 42-year-old Scottish pilot spent 68 days on a ventilator, thought to be a longer stretch of time than any patient in the UK. He did so not in a hospital in his hometown of Motherwell, but in Vietnam's sprawling and hectic Ho Chi Minh City, with no close friends or family for thousands of miles. Cameron, the last Covid-19 patient in an intensive care unit in Vietnam, has been the sickest doctors have had to deal with during the outbreak. The country, home to 95 million people, has seen only a few hundred confirmed cases, single-digit ICU admissions and not a single recorded death. So rare was a case of Cameron's severity in Vietnam, every minute detail of his recovery was reported in national newspapers and on TV news bulletins. He's now known nationwide as Patient 91, the moniker given to him by public health officials when he fell ill in March. ""I'm very humbled by how I've been taken into the hearts of the Vietnamese people,"" says Cameron, speaking exclusively to the BBC. ""And most of all I'm grateful for the bloody-mindedness of the doctors in not wanting me to die on their watch."" Dozens of Vietnam's intensive care specialists held regular conference calls to discuss Cameron's condition. ""The very small number of critical care patients meant anyone who was severely ill got the attention of all the country's top-level clinicians,"" explains Dr Kidong Park, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative to Vietnam. How 'overreaction' made Vietnam a virus success Tracking the global outbreak Vietnam's handwashing song goes global For much of Cameron's two-and-a-half months in a medically induced coma, he depended on an Ecmo machine, a form of life support only used in the most extreme cases, to survive. The machines extract blood from a patient's body and infuse it with oxygen, before pumping it back in. ""I'm lucky that the only lasting effect seems to be that my legs aren't yet strong enough to hold me, but I'm doing physiotherapy twice a day,"" says Cameron. ""At one point, my friend Craig was told by the Foreign Office I had a 10% chance of survival, so he planned for the worst - he gave up my apartment and started doing things somebody would do if I was coming home in a box."" Since he regained consciousness, he describes several tearful phone conversations with friends back home, who ""didn't think [he'd] ever come back"". Doctors had to contend with multiple complications while Cameron was in a coma. His blood became extremely sticky leading to clots. His kidneys failed meaning they required dialysis and his lung capacity plummeted to 10%. Doctors from hospitals across Vietnam discussing Patient 91's condition ""When it came out in the press here that I needed a lung transplant, apparently loads of people offered their lungs, including a 70-year-old Vietnam war veteran,"" he smiles. ""But it would have been a double lung transplant so that wouldn't have ended well for him."" Despite the outpouring of support from the Vietnamese people and the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on Stephen Cameron's care, the reaction when he first tested positive for the virus was less welcoming. Cameron became ill only a few weeks after arriving in Vietnam in early February. Like many Western pilots, he'd headed to Asia to ply his trade for higher pay in the booming regional air travel industry. Two nights before he was due to pilot his first flight for Vietnam Airlines, and the night before most bars and clubs were set to shut in Ho Chi Minh City to contain the virus, he headed to meet a friend in an expat bar in an upmarket district of the city. At the time, Vietnam had had fewer than 50 confirmed cases but, according to Prof Guy Thwaites, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit based in Ho Chi Minh City and a government advisor on infectious diseases, the population ""already had a healthy amount of respect for and fear of the virus"". It was the weekend before St Patrick's Day, so the Buddha Bar and Grill was packed with revellers wearing Irish fancy dress when Cameron arrived just after 22:00. ""I don't drink, I largely kept myself to myself in the corner, played a few rounds of pool and went home at around 3.15am,"" he recalls. However, when he developed a fever, the day after his maiden flight, and 12 others at the bar tested positive in the days following, sympathy for him among locals was in short supply. The Buddha bar cluster, as it became known in the local press, was the single biggest outbreak of coronavirus in south Vietnam, infecting nearly 20 people both indirectly and directly. The bar was checked thoroughly by police before being allowed to reopen And for some on social media, Cameron, who had criss-crossed the city taking in the sights, was to blame. Despite there being no proof he was the source of the outbreak, one prominent businessman, Luong Hoai Nam, labelled Patient 91 a ""time bomb"". He called for foreigners breaking the rules to be deported, earning plaudits from his followers on social media ""There seemed to be a desire to pin it on me coming from abroad, as I did a visa run to Bangkok a week earlier,"" says Cameron, who's convinced he too was infected at the Buddha bar, and was not the source of the outbreak. ""I was the first person to put my hands up and say: 'Look I don't feel well'. It was inevitable I would be blamed."" On 18 March, Cameron was admitted to hospital after testing positive for the virus, and authorities moved swiftly to shut down the bar and quarantine everyone in his apartment building. In total, 4,000 people linked to the Buddha bar outbreak were tested. ""Patient 91's condition got worse very quickly,"" recalls Prof Luong Ngoc Khue, who serves on the Vietnamese health ministry's Covid-19 taskforce and advised on Cameron's treatment. ""There was a worrying decrease in the function of not just his lungs, but his kidneys, liver and blood flow."" With his condition deteriorating, Cameron remembers taking the bold decision of asking to be ventilated. ""I was exhausted as I couldn't sleep and I just thought: 'Oh, put me under and get it sorted',"" he says. He was then comatose for weeks and weeks on end, as doctors agonised over his treatment. Meanwhile, the small number of other ICU patients in Vietnam recovered and went home. All the while, his case gained prominence, with top politicians promising to put every effort into keeping him alive, as the hospital temporarily footed the bill for the spiralling costs of his care. ""There's a lot of political kudos that Vietnam can take from my recovery,"" he observes, ""and it keeps their record, which is pretty phenomenal on Covid, very, very low."" Prof Khue insists everyone - foreign or Vietnamese - had access to good quality care. ""We focused on treating sick people at the highest level, both in terms of facilities and human resources, regardless of whether they were Vietnamese or from abroad,"" he says. But he gleefully reports that ""49 out of 50 foreign patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital"". When Stephen Cameron was first ventilated in early April, there were just over a million cases of coronavirus around the world. When doctors woke him up, on 12 June, there were in excess of seven million. But Vietnam had avoided the worst of the virus. There has not been a recorded case of community transmission since 16 April. ""I never thought it would take as long as 10 weeks to wake me up. I remember being roused, I remember getting my tracheotomy, I remember being wheeled through hospital corridors - and then the next few days are a blur."" From his recovery bed in a private room in Cho Ray Hospital on the other side of Ho Chi Minh City, where he was transferred after being taken off a ventilator and testing negative for the virus, Cameron is feeling the fallout of several months being motionless and severely ill. He's lost 20kg (3.1 stone) and his muscles are so wasted it's an effort to swing his leg up even a few inches. He's also suffered from severe fatigue and depressive lows since waking up, in addition to the nagging fear that post-traumatic stress could be just around the corner. ""I've been through a lot mentally. Right now, all I want to do is return home. It's the lack of noise and heat I miss the most. There's such a buzz here from all the scooters' horns and it's monsoon season. Fifteen degrees back home for me is just nice."" In the past few weeks, he's been visited at his bedside by not just a procession of doctors and nurses, but also high-ranking diplomats, government officials and politicians. Most recently, his hospital room played host to the British consul general and the chairman of Ho Chi Minh City's People's Committee. Stephen Cameron with the British consul general Ian Gibbons and the chairman of Ho Chi Minh City's People's Committee Nguyen Thanh Phong He recalls the mayor promising he'll ""be back in England soon"", before being swiftly corrected. ""I told him, if I get dumped in England, I won't be too happy,"" he jokes. ""I need to get home to Scotland, it's 400 miles away."" There's also a practical side to Cameron's desire to return home as soon as possible. The twice-daily rehab sessions he receives are made more difficult by the language barrier as very few medical staff speak good English. Rehabilitation for the most severely ill patients after ICU is always a delicate dance. Progress and pitfalls are faced in equal measure, and it can be dragged out over several years. The hospital, in which Cameron is a patient, dates back to Vietnam's French colonial era  - it's one of the country's leading medical facilities ""I feel like I'm taking up a bed that somebody who is really ill could take."" But his care hasn't come free. An Ecmo machine costs $5,000-10,000 (Â£4,000 - Â£8,000) a day to operate and he was reliant on one for eight-and-a-half weeks. The ongoing wrangling over who will cover the costs are causing him stress and diverting attention away from his recovery. At first, the Hospital for Tropical Diseases paid out of its own pocket for his treatment. Then, it seemed the British embassy would intervene. His work insurance eventually covered the cost. But the funds for his stay in Cho Ray Hospital are still up in the air. ""It's become really, really frustrating. At the beginning, I'd send the insurance company an email and they would say: 'Yeh, we'll sort that'. Now, the response is 'We'll deal with this shortly' and nothing seems to happen."" The 42-year-old Scot is undergoing intensive rehab to try and walk again There's a place for Cameron on a Vietnam Airlines flight back to the UK on 12 July. Meanwhile, planes continue to shuttle Vietnamese nationals back from Europe, and having been declared fit to fly a week ago, Cameron is confused why he can't return home sooner. ""As I'm such a well-known public figure here now, everything about my case is controlled by the government."" The politics of his return are a reminder that the miraculous recovery of Patient 91 is not just a story of a Scottish pilot who recovered from Covid-19 and overcame the odds. It is the story of how a developing Southeast Asian country with a turbulent recent history beat the odds too.

UN chief 'disturbed' by Israel car sex act videoA video apparently showing a sex act in a UN-marked vehicle in Israel is under investigation.Middle East,"A spokesman for the UN's chief said the actions of those in the video were ""abhorrent"" The United Nations says it is ""shocked and deeply disturbed"" by footage of an apparent sex act in one of its official cars in Israel. The clip shows a woman in a red dress straddling a man in the back seat of a white 4x4 with UN markings. The video, shared widely on social media, was apparently filmed on a main street by Tel Aviv's seafront. The UN said it was investigating the incident and was close to identifying the individuals seen in the video. Those involved are believed to be staff members of a peacekeeping organisation in Israel, the UN said. Another passenger can be seen slumped in the front, but the driver can't be seen as the car moves away. StÃ©phane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN's Secretary General, AntÃ³nio Guterres, described the behaviour seen in the 18-second video as ""abhorrent"". That kind of behaviour ""goes against everything we stand for and having been working to achieve in terms of fighting misconduct by UN staff"", Mr Dujarric told the BBC on Friday. When asked if the apparent sex act was consensual or involved payment, Mr Dujarric said those questions were part of the ongoing investigation. The UN has strict policies against sexual misconduct by its staff members. Third of UN workers sexually harassed UN peacekeepers sexual abuse cases rise Staff may be disciplined if they are found to be in breach of conduct rules. They may be repatriated or banned from UN peacekeeping operations, but it is the responsibility of their home nation to take further disciplinary or legal action. The UN has long been under scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct by its peacekeepers and other staff. There have been frequent allegations in recent years. Secretary General Guterres has pledged to take a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to sexual misconduct with the UN's ranks. ""We are shocked and deeply disturbed by what is seen on this video,"" Mr Dujarric said. He said an investigation led by the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services was ""moving very quickly"". Mr Dujarric said the location of the incident was known and identification of the individuals seen in the video was ""close to being completed"". Based on buildings visible in the video, the footage appears to have been captured on HaYarkon Street, a usually busy area parallel to the promenade. ""We expect the process to be concluded very quickly and intend to promptly take the appropriate action,"" Mr Dujarric said. The UN has been under scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct in recent years Mr Dujarric said the individuals involved were probably assigned to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO), which has served in the region since 1948. Heather Barr, co-director of Human Rights Watch's women's rights division, said she was ""not surprised"" by the video from Israel. Ms Barr, who worked for the UN in Burundi and Afghanistan, said it was ""good they're investigating it"", but added that the UN ""has a bigger problem than this one video"". ""That problem is about allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse committed by staff members of the UN,"" Ms Barr said. In 2019, there were 175 allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse against UN staff members,a report said,external. Of those allegations, 16 were substantiated, 15 were unsubstantiated and all others were still being investigated.
