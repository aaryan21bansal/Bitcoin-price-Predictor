Payment for people told to isolate by app in Wales,"People living in Wales and England have been urged to download the government's contact-tracing app People in Wales who are told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid-19 phone app can now apply for a Â£500 payment, the Welsh Government has announced. Until now it has only been available to low-earners who have been asked to isolate by either Test, Trace, Protect or their child's school. People need to contact their council to access thescheme,external. The Conservatives said it was confusing and said people should be able to have payments backdated. But the Welsh Government said payments would not be backdated for anyone who had been told to self-isolate by the app before the latest announcement. People will also have to show evidence their income will be reduced by isolating. It is available to people who are employed or self-employed and unable to work from home. 'I've relied on parents to keep my family afloat' The applicant or their partner must be currently receiving universal credit, working tax credit, income-based employment and support allowance, income-based jobseeker's allowance, income support, housing benefit or pension credit. Some will have their application accepted under the discretionary element of Self-Isolation Support Scheme. People living in Wales and England have been urged to download the contact-tracing app. NHS Covid-19instructs users to self-isolate if it detects they were near to someone who has the virus. The Housing and Local Government Minister Julie James said the Welsh Government was ""committed to protecting people's health and well-being"". ""We will continue to support the people of Wales during this difficult time,"" she said. ""The Â£500 payment has already provided financial security to those asked to self-isolate, helping to break the cycle of transmission and ensure no-one has to choose between feeding their family or going to work and potentially spreading the virus."" She said local authorities had ""once again risen to the challenge"" of ensuring all those who need financial support throughout receive it while developers amend the process so people can apply for help directly through the app. Angela Burns, the Welsh Conservative health spokeswoman, criticised the fact that ""applications still cannot be backdated to September, meaning people in Wales who need this Â£500 payment - and who are likely to fall into the financially vulnerable category - cannot access it and are therefore badly disadvantaged"".

Osborne to leave newspaper for investment bank,"George Osborne's new firm has just 13 staff - but a big presence in corporate takeover deals George Osborne, the former UK chancellor known for having an eclectic range of jobs since leaving office, is taking up a full time role at a small investment bank, Robey Warshaw. It will mean leaving jobs at London's Evening Standard newspaper and BlackRock, the powerful financial firm. At Robey Warshaw, Mr Osborne, chancellor from 2010 to 2016, will specialise in big takeover deals. He said he was ""proud to be joining... the best of the best"". Mr Osborne had been editor of the Evening Standard. Last year he became editor-in-chief of the London free-sheet when Emily Sheffield took over as the day-to-day editor. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said he leaves the paper ""at a time when its business model, depending on heavy commuter footfall in London, is broken"". Mr Osborne was a key lieutenant in David Cameron's Conservative government, pushing through policies to reduce Britain's deficit in an austerity drive that divided popular opinion. Shortly before leaving Parliament he took up an advisor role at fund manager BlackRock, a one-day-week job that reportedly paid Â£650,000 a year. He also had jobs in academia and at the McCain Institute, a think-tank founded by the late Republican senator John McCain. Mr Osborne joins Robey Warshaw as a partner in April. The boutique investment bank specialises in mergers and acquisitions, and its clients include Centrica, Vodafone, and BP. The firm is thought to have only about 13 staff, but has advised on some major deals, most recently the London Stock Exchange's $27bn takeover of Refinitiv, a data company. Mr Osborne said: ""Robey Warshaw is the best of the best, advising great businesses on how to grow, and I'm proud to be joining this first-rate team."" He will remain as chairman of the advisory board of Exor, the holding company through which Italy's billionaire Agnelli family manages its investments. Last year Sajid Javid, who served as chancellor from 2019 to 2020, took an advisory role at US investment bank JP Morgan.

Defiant gym owner remains open despite Covid ban,"Steve Todd says he has been fined Â£3,000 for breaching coronavirus regulations An unrepentant gym owner who has been fined three times for ignoring Covid-19 regulations is still refusing to close. Steve Todd, owner of Reps Gym in Preston, received his latest Â£1,000 fixed penalty notice on Friday. He was given a prohibition notice, ordering the gym to stay shut during the national lockdown, on 15 January. Despite being visited 11 times by police, Mr Todd told the BBC he was remaining open for customers ""desperate to train for their mental health"". Under current lockdown rules in England designed to reduce the spread of coronavirus,all gyms must remain closed until further notice.,external Preston City Council warned that serious breaches could lead to prosecution. And Lancashire Police confirmed it has been to the gym a number of times and issued a total of 24 fixed penalty notices to the owner and customers. The force added it would ""continue to work with partners to address issues with those who flout the restrictions"". ""People are really struggling with their mental health and the gym massively helps,"" said Mr Todd, who has owned the gym for more than 30 years. ""This isn't about the money, because I'm not charging,"" added the 55-year-old. ""I could close and claim a business grant from the government but there is more to life than money."" Mr Todd said that while he shut the doors of his gym at Roman Way industrial estate during the first lockdown, he felt unable to do so again. ""Some of my members are desperate to train for their mental health. So I told them not to worry - they can still come free of charge. ""Lives are more important than money."" Peter Moss, deputy leader of Preston City Council, said the local authority was aware of a ""small number of businesses who continue to break [restrictions] and put the health and safety of staff and customers at risk by remaining open"". ""Businesses that continue to disregard this and put the safety of others at risk will face formal regulatory action leading in more serious cases to prosecution,"" he added.

Council withdraws Brexit staff over safety fears,"The first lorries to cross the sea border arrived in NI on January 4 Checks on animal and food products at Larne and Belfast ports have been suspended amid concerns for staff safety. The Department of Agriculture said this was pending talks with the PSNI. This comes after Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew staff from Brexit inspection duties at Larne Port over security concerns. Graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in recent days. The mayor of Larne, the DUP's Peter Johnston, said the council decision had been taken due to ""menacing behaviour"" referencing growing tensions over theNI Protocol. The BBC understands the PSNI is due to meet Mid and East Antrim council and officials from  Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) on Tuesday morning to  discuss the threats to workers at Larne and Belfast ports. The Northern Ireland Executive will also discuss the latest developments. Police said they have increased patrols at Larne port and other ""points of entry"". ""The safety of staff working at points of entry is of the utmost importance to us,"" the PSNI tweeted. ""Where we have credible information we will share that with our partners and take appropriate action."" The BBC has asked the EU for comment on the withdrawal of staff and security fears. In its statement the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said: ""On the basis of information received today and, pending further discussions with the PSNI, Daera has decided in the interests of the wellbeing of staff to temporarily suspend physical inspections of products of animal origin at Larne and Belfast. ""The situation will be kept under review and in the meantime full documentary checks will continue to be carried out as usual."" Checks on animals and food products containing meat, fish, dairy or eggs are among those affected. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he had taken the decision to withdraw staff from the ports following consultation with staff. Allow Twitter content?

First Minister Arlene Foster said she ""utterly condemned"" the threats. Speaking on UTV, she said: ""I think it is utterly reprehensible that anyone who is going to their place of work should be threatened in this way."" Mrs Foster said she was on the phone with UK minister Michael Gove when she was told of the council's decision. ""I was able to inform him of the development this evening,"" she said, adding that the way to deal with the NI Protocol was through ""constitutional politics"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Parties must 'work together' over NI Protocol row PSNI monitoring 'growing unionist Brexit discontent' Earlier on Monday evening, Larne mayor Peter Johnston told a council meeting that staff assisting with checks had raised concerns about ""suspicious activity"". ""We have no option but to withdraw them [staff] in order to fulfil our duty of care,"" said Mr Johnston. He added that he would write to Mr Poots, who holds responsibility over the issue, to make him aware of the decision. In a statement, the council said there had been an ""upsurge in sinister behaviour"" in recent weeks, including graffiti describing port staff as ""targets"", and what appeared to be attempts to gather workers' personal information, including vehicle registration plates. The council said it will carry out a full risk assessment with the PSNI, Food Standards Agency and Daera. Before council's decision on Monday, there were 12 environmental health officers working at Larne Port, as well as several senior council officers. Sinn FÃ©in's group party leader, councillor James McKeown, said staff would only return when it was safe. ""There are simmering tensions within the local community at present and we will not stand by and let our staff be targeted when they are just doing their jobs."" SDLP councillor Eugene Reid said leaders had fallen short: ""The language used and tone of the discussion relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol has raised tensions and whipped up fear. ""It should be the role of all leaders to extract the poison from public dialogue, and I'm challenging everyone to do that."" East Antrim Sammy Wilson said the NI Protocol has to go - ""but politics is the way"". He said staff safety was paramount. ""All threats must be condemned and cross party support for withdrawal is welcome. ""Those parties who talked up the threat of violence during the negotiations need to reflect. Border Control Posts (BCPs) were built at Larne harbour, and two other facilities in NI as a consequence of Brexit. They are facilities for inspecting food and live animals when they arrive from other parts of the UK. At the end of the Brexit transition on 1 January 2021, Northern Ireland remained in the single market for goods. The rest of the UK did not, so some products entering Northern Ireland from GB must be checked on entry. The EU has particularly strict rules on food and animals, requiring all those products to enter through a BCP. Victor Chestnutt, the President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said he was concerned that the supply of food may be affected by the suspension of checks. He told BBC News NI: ""Some of our food companies bring in ingredients from the UK mainland. If they needed checks and those checks are not done, is that going to be held at the port or is that going to be released? ""Trade needs to flow and flow freely. If we see more delays, it will add more cost and more problems.""

The story of the suspected gangster at the heart of world boxing," By Darragh MacIntyre By Darragh MacIntyre It was the Gypsy King himself who revealed it all in a near joyous social media post last June. “I’m just after getting off the phone with Daniel Kinahan. He’s just informed me that the biggest fight in British boxing history has just been agreed. Get in there my boy!” The big fight was on. Terms had been agreed for the contest boxing fans wanted more than any other - Tyson Fury versus Anthony Joshua. Fury’s post was exultant. “Big thank you Dan for getting this deal over the line.” For British fight fans, it couldn’t have been better news. The two best heavyweight boxers in the world would fight it out to be the undisputed world champion. Boxing loves hype but it is almost impossible to overstate the significance of this contest. When it happens, it will be the biggest and most moneyed fight in British boxing history. Hundreds of millions of pounds will be in the mix for the fighters, promoters and broadcasters. And at the end of it, one of two British boxers will stand on top of the world, holding the belts once hoisted high by the likes of Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. But Tyson Fury hadn’t just given boxing fans the news they wanted to hear. He had also given up one of boxing’s darkest secrets. The man he thanked three times in his 55-second video, is alleged to be one of Europe’s top mobsters, whose cartel deals in drugs, guns and murder. That’s Tyson Fury’s adviser Daniel Kinahan. Three months later and I was talking to a former boxer outside the gym he runs in a major British city, for a BBC Panorama documentary. Social scientists would describe the neighbourhood as suffering from long-term economic decline. This man has worn a few hats in his time - most significantly as a part-time guardian to a number of young folk. I asked him what he thought of Tyson Fury’s news when he first heard it. “Delighted, delighted. Great news,” he says. But not because of the big fight. “I thought, ‘Finally they will have to deal with Daniel Kinahan,’” he says. “They will have to get rid of him from boxing. The police will deal with him. Everyone knows now.” But this day, he was totally disillusioned. Months had passed and nothing had changed. “Look up the street there,” he demands. “There’s teenage girls turning to prostitution to pay for their drug habit. Kids all around on drugs.” Although Daniel Kinahan has never been convicted, this man is all too aware of the Irishman’s reputation and that he has been named in court as the head of a drug cartel. The man I was meeting wanted to know why he should be trying to convince kids that boxing offered them a safe haven. How could he argue that boxing protected them from drugs, from gangs, from violence, when a man like Daniel Kinahan was at the top of the sport? My colleague Stephen Dempster and I had spent weeks trying to find people in boxing who would speak to us about Kinahan. This was at the start of a very unusual road trip that had begun with a conversation with a long-retired boxing fanatic in Belfast. He gave us one name. And a phone number. We followed his lead and got another name. And so it went. It was as if there was a secret association at the heart of professional boxing. All united on one point, Daniel Kinahan was a disaster for the fight game. “But please,” they all said, “don’t mention my name.” These people were big men mostly.  All of them had been around a few tough nuts in their time. And all of them were afraid of Daniel Kinahan, Tyson Fury’s main man. It was a little after two o’clock on Friday 5 February, 2016. Newspaper photographer Ernie Leslie was scanning the outside of the Regency Hotel in north Dublin. He was looking for signs of Daniel Kinahan, a man he knew as the alleged boss of a powerful drugs cartel. Leslie and Alan Sherry, a reporter colleague from Ireland’s Sunday World newspaper, thought there was a fair chance Kinahan would be about. His boxing management company, MGM, was hosting a big tournament - the Clash of the Clans - on Saturday. It was a joint promotion between Kinahan’s MGM and Frank Warren, one of the biggest names in British boxing. On this afternoon, the boxers were all taking part in a weigh-in at the hotel. Fans and supporters were in attendance. Leslie drove past the front of the hotel but there was no sign of Kinahan. “Then we spotted this guy we knew to be part of the gang. He was going from a car back to the hotel so we decided to park up and maybe get some shots of him and others at the end of the weigh in.” But inside the hotel murder and mayhem were imminent. The last fighter to be weighed-in was Gary Sweeney. Done. The Irishman turned to walk off stage and continue preparations for his first professional fight since he had turned pro under Daniel Kinahan and MGM. A camera phone captured what happened next. Panorama - Boxing and the Mob There’s a sudden explosion of noise. Screams of fear and panic, and at least one gunshot.  Sweeney, and everyone else, dash to get away and out. On the phone footage the voice of a terrified child can be heard: “Daddy help me!” That was Sweeney’s eight-year-old nephew, there to cheer on his Uncle Gary. Now they were all running for their lives. Minutes earlier, a middle-aged man wearing a distinctive flat cap had walked through the hotel linked arm-in-arm with what appeared to be a female companion. They were looking for Daniel Kinahan, with the aim of shooting him dead. Later, witnesses would say they made an odd couple. For starters the “female” was wearing a wig, and seemed to be having trouble walking in high-heeled boots. So when they appeared in the Regency suite, it didn’t take very long before people realised something was very off. That they were now both wielding handguns completed the picture. Three other gunmen arrived in the lobby of the hotel. They were dressed in the uniform of the Irish police Emergency Response Unit and carried what appeared to be Kalashnikov rifles.  Some of those fleeing from the weigh-in ran straight into them. One of them, David Byrne, regarded as a top criminal associate of Daniel Kinahan’s, was shot dead. Security cameras tracked the progress of all the gunmen as they began roaming the hotel, hunting Kinahan. Two more associates of Kinahan were shot and injured. But their quarry had escaped. Photographer Ernie Leslie had heard the first shot. “We were sitting in the car when we heard a loud “crack”. We looked at each other in shock. We couldn’t believe it. Then we saw people running, in a state of panic.” He spotted a man wearing a flat cap running towards a parked van. “It was instinct. I thought I could see something in his hand,” says Leslie. “I stopped the car and grabbed the camera. And just started to shoot away.” Reporter Alan Sherry noticed something else. A long-barrelled gun was pointing out of the van’s window. Then it was pointed directly at them. Leslie threw the car into reverse. The van drove off in the opposite direction. Without pausing to study the pictures, the photographer sent them to his news desk. What he didn’t know until his editor rang him was that he had captured not one, but two gunmen, leaving the scene. One photograph was crisp and clear. It showed “flat cap” with his gun, and running just ahead of him the “female”, also with a gun. Both faces were in sharp focus. Ernie Leslie (The Sunday World) Ernie Leslie (The Sunday World) “Flat cap” was quickly identified as Kevin Murray from Strabane in Northern Ireland. The 46-year-old, known to have ties with dissident Republicans, remnants of the IRA, was arrested. He didn’t face trial, though, because he was very ill with motor neurone disease, and died 18 months after the shooting. Irish police were convinced the “female” attacker was Dubliner Patrick Hutch. His brother Gary had once been Daniel Kinahan’s right-hand man. But they had fallen out, and Gary had been shot dead. The Hutch family blamed Kinahan. The Irish police had their motive. Hutch, then 24, was charged with murder but his trial collapsed two years ago and he remains a free man. Except that he, like other members of his family, now lives with a permanent death threat over him.  There was a time when heroin couldn’t be found in Dublin. Half a century ago, maybe. But by the time Daniel Kinahan’s father Christopher was dealing heroin in the 1980s, it had taken a grip in the city. “A particular group of criminals saw the market,” says Michael O’Sullivan, a former assistant commissioner in the Garda Síochána, the Irish police force. “They had contacts in the UK. They sought to make a lot of money, and introduced heroin into Dublin city around 1980.” Back in the day, Michael O’Sullivan was a drugs squad officer in Dublin. In 1986, he arrested Christopher Kinahan Snr for heroin dealing. “He was operating a safe flat, a luxury apartment which was the nerve centre for the distribution of heroin through most of Dublin city.” Christopher Kinahan’s own background was, as they say in Ireland, “respectable”. The family home in north Dublin is reported to have been the childhood home of an Irish prime minister. Past pupils at a school he attended include literary giant James Joyce. As Dublin crime reporter Nicola Tallant tells us, unlike those people who fall into crime for one reason or another, Christopher Kinahan Snr chose a life of crime. According to O’Sullivan, “he wasn't your average guy who took over a drugs operation. He was a bit smarter, a bit more strategically focused in thinking down the road as to the next move.” After his arrest, Kinahan was sentenced to six years in jail. Other shorter prison terms would follow in Ireland, Netherlands and Belgium. But all the while Kinahan was building up his list of contacts, growing what became known in law enforcement circles as the Kinahan Organised Crime Group (KOCG). By 2010, the KOCG had centred its operations on Marbella in southern Spain. Brothers Daniel and Christopher Jnr were now suspected to be helping their father run the family cartel. Daniel Kinahan was already sufficiently prominent to be name-checked in an American diplomatic cable sent from Sierra Leone to Washington DC. The cable, sent in November 2009, said UK police described him as “an Irish businessman involved in narcotrafficking throughout Europe,” who “may be interested inexpanding his network to West Africa.” In May 2010, Spanish authorities with the assistance of Irish, British and Dutch police, launched what appeared to be a decisive series of raids as part of a far-reaching investigation into the KOCG.  The three Kinahans and associates were arrested. Homes and expensive cars were seized, and it looked like it could be the end of the road for the Kinahan firm. The Irish media feasted on the details of the Spanish investigation. Journalists Stephen Breen and colleague Owen Conlon actually got their hands on a copy of the police files. Co-authors of  The Cartel, a study of the KOCG, they are among a group of dedicated Irish journalists who have been rigorously detailing the activities of the Kinahans. “Their money laundering networks were global and included over 500m euro worth of properties in northern Brazil,” Breen claimed to us. “Money was then being sent to Cyprus, to Lichtenstein, to Switzerland, to Panama, all to hide the cartel’s cash.” And the authorities had made up their mind about the eldest Kinahan brother, as Breen explains: “They identify Daniel Kinahan as having overall control of the day-to-day running of the cartel.” But Operation Shovel, as it was called, proved to have no real bite. It lasted 10 years and resulted in a handful of minor charges. None at all for Daniel, who has no convictions. Once upon a time, the extended Hutch family from north inner-city Dublin, and the Kinahans got along just fine. Irish police say Gerry Hutch, the boss of the Hutch clan, and Christopher Snr laundered cash, processed stolen cheques and generally helped each other out. But there were differences. Gerry Hutch is known as The Monk. Christopher Snr is known as the Dapper Don. Gerry Hutch did robberies. He frowned on drugs. Kinahan Snr couldn’t deal enough of them. Gary Hutch was Gerry’s nephew. Unfortunately, as things turned out, he chose to follow the crime model of Christopher Kinahan Snr, and not his uncle’s. Gary Hutch (The Irish Sun) He moved to Spain, close to Daniel Kinahan. Investigators there concluded: “He is Daniel’s right-hand man and transmits Daniel’s orders to members of a lower rank.” Then came the fallout. By 2014 Gary was suspected of being an informant. This may or may not be the catalyst for what happened next. Sure and certain facts are rare in the cartel world except when it comes to who has been shot, or who has been killed. Two years earlier, Kinahan had helped set up a boxing management company and gym in Marbella. His business partner and the face of the enterprise was Birmingham boxer Matthew Macklin. It was called Macklin’s Gym Marbella, or MGM. Kinahan’s interest in boxing went back to his Dublin days. He’s more than a fan of the sport and had been running his own gym in the Spanish city before he teamed up with Macklin and opened MGM in 2012. In Britain, most in the sport probably shared the view of boxing writer Tris Dixon: “I don't think anyone predicted how big and powerful it would become, and that it was the seed for what would happen in the years that followed.” For sure, well-known criminals used the gym. But MGM became known as a serious professional base for boxers. And it was successful. Talented young British and Irish fighters began training at MGM. Good financial terms were on offer and the best of facilities were on tap. Among the recruits was Tom Stalker, the captain of the successful British 2012 Olympic boxing team. The most powerful people in British boxing are promoters Eddie Hearn and Frank Warren. By the summer of 2014 both had visited and broken bread with Daniel Kinahan. These relationships would only become more important with time. Frank Warren and Daniel Kinahan MGM was quickly becoming a player in the boxing business. And despite its apparent attraction to well-known criminals, it seemed divorced from the out-workings of criminality. That was to change. First came the shooting that August of top boxing trainer Jamie Moore at Daniel Kinahan’s Spanish home. Moore, who’d been working at the Marbella gym, survived. But he wasn’t the intended target. It’s widely reported that the gunman had been hunting Daniel Kinahan himself. One month later. Another regular at the gym - reputed mobster Gerard Kavanagh - was shot. CCTV footage: Gerard Kavanagh, Estepona Spain, 2014 (The Irish Sun) Murderous violence was suddenly stalking MGM. And somewhere in the furious mix of paranoia, alleged drug dealing, drug taking and guns, someone resolved to kill Gary Hutch. Word was that he had organised the attempted hit on Daniel Kinahan. Reports suggest a deal to save his life had been drawn up between his family and the KOCG. If it had been, it didn’t hold. He was shot dead in Spain a year later. Gangland killings are not unusual, but those with any understanding of the criminal networks in Dublin knew this was different. There would be consequences. In Marbella, you might have thought the shadow of the gunmen would have obliterated MGM’s trajectory. Three shootings. Two murders. But you would be wrong. By the year’s end MGM and Daniel Kinahan could boast of two world champions, Liam Smith and Billy Joe Saunders. That success would breed further success. Kinahan had had big plans from the start. Jason Coghlan ran a legal centre in Marbella at the time. No stranger to crime himself, he had served time in jail for robbery. “Danny Kinahan is a personal friend of mine,” says Coghlan. “When he first started this gymnasium, he had a lot of dreams in his head that we couldn't even keep up with. He said: ‘I will make this the biggest boxing promotion gym in the world.’” But first came the Clash of the Clans.  Days after the Regency weigh-in shooting, the killings started in earnest. Taxi driver Eddie Hutch was shot dead - an execution thought to have been carried out by the Kinahan cartel. Irish police sources have said he was an innocent man. But he was a brother of Gerry Hutch, the man alleged to have organised the hotel hit. The Kinahan cartel was blamed for most of the killings that followed. For two years, a small section of Dublin city appeared under siege. A total of 18 people would die, most of whom were relatives or associates of the Hutch’s. The Kinahan cartel came under ferocious scrutiny from the Irish authorities. Dozens of gang members were jailed. None of the alleged leaders of the cartel faced charges but in the view of the police, their role was made clear. In 2018, the Irish High Court accepted police evidence that the KOCG was an international crime group and that its drug operations were controlled by Daniel Kinahan. Later, the Irish Special Criminal Court accepted that the KOCG was involved in drugs and weapons trafficking, money laundering and “execution style” murders to protect its interests. Meanwhile in Spain, the police concluded that Daniel Kinahan was involved in the murder of Gary Hutch, though they admitted they didn’t have the evidence to prove it. We have been told by police sources in the UK that the Kinahans are under investigation for suspected drug trafficking in Britain. We asked the US Drug Enforcement Agency about the activities of the Kinahan cartel. They told us: “We will not be able to comment on this because it is part of an ongoing investigation.” And while all that was happening with law enforcement, a revolution of sorts was reaching maturity in the boxing world - at MGM in particular. First in January 2017 came the news that Daniel Kinahan was officially standing down from the company. Mathew Macklin said the move followed the “bad publicity”. The company changed name, too, rebranded as MTK Global. Later that year the company got a new boss - Sandra Vaughan, a Scottish fake tan entrepreneur and long-time friend of Daniel Kinahan’s. After buying the business from Matthew Macklin, she was at pains to point out that Kinahan and MTK had “cut ties”. Except it’s not as simple as that. Step into the picture Tyson Fury. Fury had been in a bad place. After winning the world heavyweight title in 2015, he spent most of the following year in a tumult of drugs, drink and depression. He had to relinquish his titles, and his weight ballooned. But in 2017, he began a remarkable comeback - in Marbella, at MTK.  He slowly regained his fitness and his health. Daniel Kinahan was close by. Matt Christie, who edits British publication Boxing News, has kept a keen eye on Fury’s journey. “I think what is generally known, or generally accepted, is that Daniel Kinahan played a massive part in getting Tyson Fury out of the darkness, and offering him a route back to the sport of boxing.” We haven’t been told on what precise date Daniel Kinahan became Tyson Fury’s official “adviser”, but in November 2017, on Kinahan’s advice, Fury signed up with MTK. The Dubliner may not have had any formal connection with MTK but he was advising Tyson Fury and many other MTK boxers. He was even advising Vaughan, as she later confirmed. Daniel Kinahan and the company he founded were joined at the hip, if not on the dotted line. When he moved to Dubai, MTK Global followed – setting up its headquarters there in 2018.  Its stock was rising in world boxing. More and more fighters were joining up. Talent like Belfast’s Carl Frampton. In hushed and sometimes almost furtive conversations, managers and trainers across Britain and Ireland have complained bitterly to us about MTK’s increasing power in the game. Some had lost fighters to MTK. But only one was prepared to speak publicly. Barry McGuigan once strode across the boxing world as one of the most popular and talented fighters on the planet. When he retired, he became a boxing manager. He has now lost five boxers to MTK’s pulling power. “Me and my boys had invested 18 years of our lives in those five fighters that left,” he tells me. I put to him that his complaints could be dismissed as sour grapes. “That's a fair comment. But put yourself in my position. You invest financially in these kids. You take them on and then out of the blue they're unhappy and they're gone.” The fact is that MTK and Kinahan were hurtling to the very top of boxing. Helped in large part by the remarkable rejuvenation of Tyson Fury, who was winning over America with astonishing performances. And in March 2019, a crucial link up was made with Bob Arum, just about the most influential  player in US boxing. The big television money followed. A five-fight deal worth $100m capped them all. Bob Arum and Daniel Kinahan Officially, Kinahan had nothing to do with these deals. Remember MTK had cut its ties with him. There was no word about him even when Fury secured the world title again this time last year. But MTK was no longer a start-up. With more than 200 boxers on its books it was the biggest boxing management in Europe, maybe the world It looked set to be centrally involved in what many people are calling the biggest fight in British boxing history - Fury against Joshua. This was the moment, in the late spring and early summer of 2020 when it appears Daniel Kinahan decided to claim his place in the boxing limelight. Tyson Fury then did his act of acclimation, praising him for setting up the big fight. In the media swirl came interviews with promoters Eddie Hearn and Bob Arum. Arum gushed about Daniel Kinahan, calling him his “captain”. “I am not naive about Daniel and his past. As long as I understand that dealing in this area,  sport, they are honourable, they are smart and are not doing anything that is anyway devious or wrong, why wouldn't I deal with him? “ Hearn said: “He is the guy leading this Tyson Fury ship. Everyone knows, particularly in boxing, that he represents a number of high profile boxers, [and] has represented Tyson Fury for a number of years.” Hearn has worked with Kinahan for years. His company told Panorama he has no influence over the people boxers choose to have within their management team. MTK boss Sandra Vaughan, who had told the world that MTK had no ties with Kinahan, clarified the relationship with the alleged gangster. “I will always go to Daniel for advice,” she trumpeted. “Does he personally advise other high-profile people? Bob Arum?  He speaks to Frank [Warren]. He speaks to Eddie. “If anybody in the boxing world is doing any type of business in boxing and doesn’t speak to Daniel, or speak to someone that speaks to Daniel, they are telling lies”. Pat Leahy, now retired but who had previously had to police the fallout of the Regency shooting, puts it this way: “I think he was trying to launder his name. He was laundering his reputation.” If Kinahan had hoped his re-entry from the shade of boxing’s backrooms would herald a permanent place in the limelight, he had called it wrong. Questions were asked about him at Westminster and in the Irish parliament. It was announced he would no longer negotiate fights for Tyson Fury. Then MTK said he was stepping away from boxing. As Kinahan slipped back into the shadows, MTK maintained its growth. In recent months, it has started to sign up a host of American talent. American sports lawyer and former boxing manager Kurt Emhoff had also noted MTK’s growth: “They have a tonne of fighters, and now they're signing even more fighters but, where's the money coming from to finance this?” Barry McGuigan has the same question: “It takes millions and millions of dollars to do what MTK have done. Where is the money coming from to allow MTK to grow at such a ferocious rate?” Like other private companies, little information is available about its finances, but in the US courts, a boxing manager has accused MTK of using Daniel Kinahan’s drug money to buy up talent. The court filing in California alleges it is simply a front for the Kinahan drug cartel: “MTK receives funds directly or indirectly from Mr Kinahan, which are derived from racketeering activities such as drug trafficking and money laundering.” MTK says the lawsuit will be most vigorously challenged. The allegation of money laundering was in my mind eight weeks ago when I drove from New York to semi-rural Connecticut see a man called Bob Yalen. The American was appointed as the new chief executive of MTK over the summer. It was he who announced that Kinahan had left boxing. I knocked on his front door. No recording devices. No camera. I hoped this approach might encourage him to talk because he hadn’t responded to a letter we sent him in Dubai months earlier. There followed an extraordinary conversation. I had expected him to tell me to leave. But no, Yalen, dressed in casual house garb, talked with me on his doorstep for about 15 minutes. The biggest reveal – that Daniel Kinahan was still in boxing, and still very much associated with  MTK despite all public claims to the contrary. Yalen said he was in regular contact with Daniel Kinahan, as business required it. He revealed that Kinahan was still advising MTK boxers but couldn’t say if that included Tyson Fury. We asked Tyson Fury whether he’s still being advised by Daniel Kinahan - but he didn’t respond. When I pressed Yalen about where the money was coming from to fund the expansion of the company, he said that ""a big pot"" had been developed over the years. I asked him if that pot came from Daniel Kinahan's drug cartel dealings. He said, “No”. He said that Kinahan had been the “driving force” in MTK when Yalen first joined the company in 2018 but now Kinahan had “no involvement in the business officially”. Daniel Kinahan’s lawyers told the BBC he has “no criminal record or convictions”. They say the “wild allegations” about him being a crime boss “are false and have no evidential basis whatsoever”. He’s an independent adviser in boxing and has “exited the business of MTK”. MTK’s solicitors told us it has a “perfectly sustainable business” and has grown by “offering excellent managerial services….at a very competitive price.” They said “Mr Kinahan has never owned or controlled our client company”. He’s never provided funding “nor has been a director, shareholder, officer, employee or consultant”. They said, “It’s true Mr Kinahan does provide personal advice to a number of boxers managed by MTK Global”, as well as fighters at other companies. I wanted to know why Yalen had chosen to join MTK at all, when allegations about Kinahan were well known. “I asked the fighters and they spoke well of him,” he told me. “I’ve never seen anything to concern me.” It had been an astonishing meeting. In our terms, journalistically decisive. We now knew that Daniel Kinahan, the alleged head of a cartel which is suspected of involvement in murder, drugs and weapons trafficking and money laundering, is still at the heart of the boxing business. Maybe not at the top table, but you’d bet he’s in the room next door.

"Council withdraws Brexit staff over safety fearsMayor says decision was taken due to ""menacing behaviour"" as tensions grow over the NI Protocol.Northern Ireland","The first lorries to cross the sea border arrived in NI on January 4 Checks on animal and food products at Larne and Belfast ports have been suspended amid concerns for staff safety. The Department of Agriculture said this was pending talks with the PSNI. This comes after Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew staff from Brexit inspection duties at Larne Port over security concerns. Graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in recent days. The mayor of Larne, the DUP's Peter Johnston, said the council decision had been taken due to ""menacing behaviour"" referencing growing tensions over theNI Protocol. The BBC understands the PSNI is due to meet Mid and East Antrim council and officials from  Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) on Tuesday morning to  discuss the threats to workers at Larne and Belfast ports. The Northern Ireland Executive will also discuss the latest developments. Police said they have increased patrols at Larne port and other ""points of entry"". ""The safety of staff working at points of entry is of the utmost importance to us,"" the PSNI tweeted. ""Where we have credible information we will share that with our partners and take appropriate action."" The BBC has asked the EU for comment on the withdrawal of staff and security fears. In its statement the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said: ""On the basis of information received today and, pending further discussions with the PSNI, Daera has decided in the interests of the wellbeing of staff to temporarily suspend physical inspections of products of animal origin at Larne and Belfast. ""The situation will be kept under review and in the meantime full documentary checks will continue to be carried out as usual."" Checks on animals and food products containing meat, fish, dairy or eggs are among those affected. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he had taken the decision to withdraw staff from the ports following consultation with staff. Allow Twitter content?

First Minister Arlene Foster said she ""utterly condemned"" the threats. Speaking on UTV, she said: ""I think it is utterly reprehensible that anyone who is going to their place of work should be threatened in this way."" Mrs Foster said she was on the phone with UK minister Michael Gove when she was told of the council's decision. ""I was able to inform him of the development this evening,"" she said, adding that the way to deal with the NI Protocol was through ""constitutional politics"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Parties must 'work together' over NI Protocol row PSNI monitoring 'growing unionist Brexit discontent' Earlier on Monday evening, Larne mayor Peter Johnston told a council meeting that staff assisting with checks had raised concerns about ""suspicious activity"". ""We have no option but to withdraw them [staff] in order to fulfil our duty of care,"" said Mr Johnston. He added that he would write to Mr Poots, who holds responsibility over the issue, to make him aware of the decision. In a statement, the council said there had been an ""upsurge in sinister behaviour"" in recent weeks, including graffiti describing port staff as ""targets"", and what appeared to be attempts to gather workers' personal information, including vehicle registration plates. The council said it will carry out a full risk assessment with the PSNI, Food Standards Agency and Daera. Before council's decision on Monday, there were 12 environmental health officers working at Larne Port, as well as several senior council officers. Sinn FÃ©in's group party leader, councillor James McKeown, said staff would only return when it was safe. ""There are simmering tensions within the local community at present and we will not stand by and let our staff be targeted when they are just doing their jobs."" SDLP councillor Eugene Reid said leaders had fallen short: ""The language used and tone of the discussion relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol has raised tensions and whipped up fear. ""It should be the role of all leaders to extract the poison from public dialogue, and I'm challenging everyone to do that."" East Antrim Sammy Wilson said the NI Protocol has to go - ""but politics is the way"". He said staff safety was paramount. ""All threats must be condemned and cross party support for withdrawal is welcome. ""Those parties who talked up the threat of violence during the negotiations need to reflect. Border Control Posts (BCPs) were built at Larne harbour, and two other facilities in NI as a consequence of Brexit. They are facilities for inspecting food and live animals when they arrive from other parts of the UK. At the end of the Brexit transition on 1 January 2021, Northern Ireland remained in the single market for goods. The rest of the UK did not, so some products entering Northern Ireland from GB must be checked on entry. The EU has particularly strict rules on food and animals, requiring all those products to enter through a BCP. Victor Chestnutt, the President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said he was concerned that the supply of food may be affected by the suspension of checks. He told BBC News NI: ""Some of our food companies bring in ingredients from the UK mainland. If they needed checks and those checks are not done, is that going to be held at the port or is that going to be released? ""Trade needs to flow and flow freely. If we see more delays, it will add more cost and more problems.""

Osborne to leave newspaper for investment bankThe former chancellor is leaving his job as the Standard's editor-in-chief for a boutique bank with 13 staff.,"George Osborne's new firm has just 13 staff - but a big presence in corporate takeover deals George Osborne, the former UK chancellor known for having an eclectic range of jobs since leaving office, is taking up a full time role at a small investment bank, Robey Warshaw. It will mean leaving jobs at London's Evening Standard newspaper and BlackRock, the powerful financial firm. At Robey Warshaw, Mr Osborne, chancellor from 2010 to 2016, will specialise in big takeover deals. He said he was ""proud to be joining... the best of the best"". Mr Osborne had been editor of the Evening Standard. Last year he became editor-in-chief of the London free-sheet when Emily Sheffield took over as the day-to-day editor. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said he leaves the paper ""at a time when its business model, depending on heavy commuter footfall in London, is broken"". Mr Osborne was a key lieutenant in David Cameron's Conservative government, pushing through policies to reduce Britain's deficit in an austerity drive that divided popular opinion. Shortly before leaving Parliament he took up an advisor role at fund manager BlackRock, a one-day-week job that reportedly paid Â£650,000 a year. He also had jobs in academia and at the McCain Institute, a think-tank founded by the late Republican senator John McCain. Mr Osborne joins Robey Warshaw as a partner in April. The boutique investment bank specialises in mergers and acquisitions, and its clients include Centrica, Vodafone, and BP. The firm is thought to have only about 13 staff, but has advised on some major deals, most recently the London Stock Exchange's $27bn takeover of Refinitiv, a data company. Mr Osborne said: ""Robey Warshaw is the best of the best, advising great businesses on how to grow, and I'm proud to be joining this first-rate team."" He will remain as chairman of the advisory board of Exor, the holding company through which Italy's billionaire Agnelli family manages its investments. Last year Sajid Javid, who served as chancellor from 2019 to 2020, took an advisory role at US investment bank JP Morgan.

Teenage neo-Nazi is UK's youngest terror offender,"The teenager admitted 12 terrorism offences and is due to be sentenced at the Old Bailey The teenage leader of a neo-Nazi group has become the youngest person in the UK to have committed a terrorist offence. The boy from Cornwall had admitted 12 offences, two of dissemination of terrorist documents and 10 of possession of terrorist material. At 13 years old he downloaded his first bombmaking manual and later that year joined online forum Fascist Forge. The sentencing hearing of the now 16 year old will continue on 8 February. The court heard he was the leader of the British version of a now banned neo-Nazi terrorist organisation. Between 2018 and July 2019, he collected a significant amount of far right material and expressed racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic views on online platforms. He talked about ""gassing"" Jewish people, hanging gay people and wanting to ""shoot up their parades"". Prosecuting, Naomi Parsons, said his home, where he lived with his grandmother, was searched and police found a Nazi flag and racist slogan on the garden shed, as well as several manuals about making weapons and instructions on how to kill people on his phone and computer. ""The age is the alarming factor and his conduct betrays a maturity beyond his chronological age,"" she added. The teenager, who cannot be identified, was in touch with an Estonian boy, who founded a now-banned group called Feuerkrieg Division. They used encrypted messages to discuss their hatred of particular groups. The defendant then set up FKD GB and recruited British members from online platforms, such as Paul Dunleavy, a teenager from Rugby, who was jailed last year for preparing a terrorist attack. The group wanted to enact ""white jihad"" and the genocide of non-white people, the court heard.

the coronavirus stories making headlines around the world: Annabel Rackham and Christian HewgillNewsbeat reporters Finding motivation to workout is harder than ever Spent more time in your pyjamas than your workout gear this lockdown?

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Breakfast in Rome Gobbling through a takeaway
sandwich at the office desk is normal for the Brits. But for the Italians?
Mamma mia, itâs as foreign a concept here as a cappuccino after midday. So the
relaxing of restrictions in most of Italy today â all but five areas of the
country moving from orange to yellow zones â means this nationâs sacred rituals
can resume: a morning espresso inside a cafe; fresh pasta for lunch at the
local trattoria; an Aperol spritz in the bar for the early-evening aperitivo on
the way home from work. Venues must still stop table service at 6pm â itâs only
takeaway after that â but the newfound freedom, with museums reopening during
weekdays and movement allowed within oneâs region, will lift the mood here. So much so that people crowded
into city centres in anticipation over the weekend, almost counting down the
hours until the measures were eased. That has prompted concern that complacency
will be costly. Itâs what led a busy summer to be followed by a deadly autumn. Reopening is risky â the first
country in the West to be slammed by Covid knows that. But for now, this nation
of foodies will savour the moment. There were protests in Cape Town calling for beaches to reopen There will be
relief in South Africa after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced an easing
of lockdown restrictions. He said public
places such as parks, beaches and swimming pools will reopen and restrictions eased on
the sale of alcohol. Faith-based
gatherings will be permitted but social gatherings must not exceed 50 people for
indoor venues and 100 people outdoors. Ramaphosa said
the changes had been made possible because there had been a significant reduction
of patients with Covid admitted to hospital since early December, reducing the pressure on beds and
medical staff. As we mentioned in
an earlier post, public patience with the lockdown restrictions has been
fraying. Scores of people
protested at beaches in Cape Town at the weekend calling for them to be
reopened, and two church associations were threatening to sue the president over
the closure of churches. This video can not be played Mumbai: One of world's largest train networks resumes services In India, trains in Mumbai are running public services again and yes, there are social-distancing rules on board. Among the busiest in the world, the trains carry nearly eight million people every day. But they were shut down to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Now they have reopened to the public with certain Covid-19 restrictions, including compulsory masks and temperature checks for commuters. Mumbai was one of the worst-hit cities in India but coronavirus numbers have begun to fall there, as they have elsewhere in country. BBC Radio 5 Live Alison with her mum Margaret Today, 5 Liveâs Your Call asked listeners if they were celebrating at news that every care home resident in England has been offered a Covid vaccine. Alison, in Colchester, said it was âvery hardâ to listen to the good news because her mum died in a care home last month after contracting coronavirus. âI just feel very sad. It was too late for her,â she said. Alison said she had been told that vaccinations could not always be administered in care homes where positive tests had been recorded. ""How do we protect those vulnerable people until they are vaccinated?â she said. Debs, in Eccles, said her parents required 24-hour care but lived at home with her.  Because they could not leave the home, they were unable to attend vaccination appointments. She wanted to highlight the ""forgotten group of people - the elderly that are at home and housebound"" who had not yet received their vaccination. ""Weâre a little bit in the dark,â she said. ""The vaccination programme is fantastic but housebound people donât seem to be getting mentioned anywhere."" Listen back to Your Call on the free BBC Sounds app. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This development sounds alarmingâ after all just a handful of
cases has prompted a massive effort to get tens of thousands of people tested. But as always context is needed. This variant is â like the UK one â more contagious. But there is no evidence that it causes more serious
illness. And data suggests the vaccines will work against it,
although maybe not quite as well as they do against the original one. So the logic of public health officials is to stop or at
least slow the spread. We are at a crucial point with the vaccine being rolled out
quickly and immunity being built up by significant numbers of vulnerable
people. Anything that interferes with that will slow our escape from
lockdown and, ultimately, the pandemic as well as increasing risk to the population. So the aim is to hit it hard and early. The fact the UK is the world leader in sequencing means
officials have been able to identify the early signs of community transmission,
giving the country a fighting chance of stamping down hard on this variant. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that
âthe contact tracing system now finds 95%, around 95%, of those contacts [of
people whoâve tested positive], so it has built up to this very effective
levelâ. When someone tests positive for
coronavirus in England they should be contacted by the Test and Trace system. They are then asked how many close contacts
theyâve had in the run-up to testing positive. Of these contacts, the tracing teams
successfully reached 93.2% - and told them to self-isolate - in the week ending 20 January. So the health secretary is broadly
right. But it is worth noting that in the same
week, of the 275,000 people who tested positive, only 85% were actually reached
in the first place and had their details passed to the contact tracing system. You can read more about how NHS Test and Trace workshere. While there's good news on vaccination in the UK and Israel, in New York vaccination centres have temporarily closed and
appointments re-arranged as the US city braces itself for a major snowstorm. As much as 60cm (20in) of snow is expected to fall along the US east
coast, with wind gusts of up to 80km/h (50mph) creating blizzard-like conditions. New York has declared a state of emergency, cancelling flights
and restricting non-essential travel. Mayor Bill de Blasio admitted the storm had disrupted the âvaccination
effortâ because âwe donât want folks, especially seniors, going out in unsafe
conditions to get vaccinatedâ. But he promised a fast restart after the danger has passed
because âwe can take the supply we have and distribute it very quickly in the
days to come and make sure everyone gets the appointmentsâ. Snow began falling in parts of Pennsylvania, New York state and New England late on Sunday night and the heaviest snowfalls were expected during Monday. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Around 20% of Israel's population has now been fully vaccinated As we mentioned
earlier, Israel's coronavirus
vaccination programme is showing signs of working to drive down infections and illness in the over-60s. Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) figures show 531 over-60s, out of almost 750,000 fully vaccinated, tested positive for coronavirus (0.07%). And far fewer fell ill, with 38 becoming needing hospital treatment with moderate, severe or critical disease. There were three deaths in vaccinated over-60s - although it is possible they contracted the infection earlier, before their immunity had time to build. Before the vaccine had time to take effect, more than 7,000 infections were recorded, just under 700 cases of moderate to critical illness and 307 deaths. The MoH data suggests infections and illnesses fell consistently from 14 days after receiving the first jab onwards. You can read Rachelâs report here. The number of new coronavirus cases being recorded in the UK is continuing to fall, with 18,607 reported today. However, the number of deaths remain high, with 406 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. Meanwhile, more than nine million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, with an average of 389,000 people getting their first jab every day over the past seven days. It means the government is on track to meet its target of offering the vaccine to about 15 million people in priority groups by mid-February. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock doesnât rule out
further restrictions in those postcodes where thereâs concern about the South
African variant. However, it doesnât sound like the governmentâs on the
verge of imposing extra measures with the health secretary pointing out that
the countryâs already in lockdown. Itâs clear the government hopes to get on
top of the issue via, in part, so-called âsurgeâ testing. People in those areas
are also being urged to, in particular, heed that stay at home advice. But questions may well continue over whether more should or could be done
to contain this variant. Yes, public health officials insist thereâs no evidence
it causes a more severe disease but Dr Susan Hopkins did also just repeat the
concern that vaccines may have a âdiminishedâ â albeit still âvery goodâ â
effect against the variant. Finally the scientists are asked about the South African variant and whether it is more likely to cause serious illness. Dr Hopkins says it has ""similar transmissibility"" to the variant that was first found in Kent but there is not evidence it is causing more severe disease than other variants circulating in the UK. However, she adds that it has slightly
more mutations in the spike protein which is perhaps causing vaccines to have ""diminished effectiveness"" although they still work very well. She says the government wants to prevent viruses with mutations acquiring more mutations which is why breaking the chains of transmission for the South African variant is essential. Hancock adds that the UK's flu vaccination programme is upgraded every year to make sure it is as effective as possible against new variants. He says he hopes the government will be able to get the coronavirus jab to the same place and it will become ""something people have as standard"". Jonathan Walker from the Birmingham Mail and Newcastle Chronicle asks whether areas in the North of England that are rolling out the vaccine faster could have supplies cut to give more doses to other areas that have been slower. Hancock says the government is making sure the vaccine goes to all parts of the country ""on a fair basis according to need"" and insists every area is getting its fair share. He adds that there is a ""bumpy supply schedule for the whole country"" and if some days there are more vaccines given than others this is because of the supply available nationally. Jane Merrick from the i newspaper asks if the geographical spread of the South African variant suggests it is endemic and whether those who have already been jabbed will need a booster with a tweaked vaccine? She also wants to know if school playgrounds can be reopened sooner than 8 March given the health benefits to children. Hancock says the government has taken action regarding schools with a ""very heavy heart"" and these are the first measures ministers want to lift. But he says the virus is still widespread and there's a lot of work to do to get it under control"". Dr Hopkins says it's unlikely those who have already been jabbed will need to start again, even if the vaccine has to be tweaked in light of the South African variant. She says it's most likely a booster would be given. She stresses that cases of this strain found in the UK are not linked and that she's confident that measures in place will close down and eliminate transmission. Emily Morgan from ITV asks how confident the government is that it can contain the new variant. Hancock says the enhanced testing is aimed at stopping the spread of the variant altogether. ""But it is not straightforward - there may be further cases we don't know about yet,"" he warns. He says it is therefore ""vital people in those areas minimise all social contact and get a test when the opportunity arises"". Tom Magner from Carers' World asks what assurances the health secretary can give that unpaid carers will always be at the heart of the government's policy making, saying many don't feel truly recognised because they are only in band six of the vaccine prioritisation list. Hancock says he knows from his own family just how important unpaid carers
are and the government has ""looked very closely"" at where they are on the prioritisation list, which is drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advisory group. Prof Powis agrees that ""in the NHS we absolutely recognise the huge value that
unpaid carers bring to our patientsâ. He says the NHS is working its way through the vaccination programme according to the priority list set by the JCVI but as soon as the top four priority groups have had their jab it will immediately move âvery rapidly, as quickly as we can"" through the groups next on the list. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Ministers have, over the past few days, begun to
hint at sharing the UKâs vaccine supply with other countries in the future â
including both the EU and the developing world. Matt Hancock just repeated that
pledge, saying that the UK will play its part to ensure vaccines are available
around the globe. But there have been no specifics yet from ministers on the
questions that inevitably follow. Which countries, when and on what terms? The
government may argue itâs really still too soon to say. But if supplies do
continue to grow, as expected, and the country moves away from a just-in-time
supply chain here at home, the pressure to answer these questions will also
increase. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

concern that vaccines may have a âdiminishedâ â albeit still âvery goodâ â
effect against the variant. Finally the scientists are asked about the South African variant and whether it is more likely to cause serious illness. Dr Hopkins says it has ""similar transmissibility"" to the variant that was first found in Kent but there is not evidence it is causing more severe disease than other variants circulating in the UK. However, she adds that it has slightly
more mutations in the spike protein which is perhaps causing vaccines to have ""diminished effectiveness"" although they still work very well. She says the government wants to prevent viruses with mutations acquiring more mutations which is why breaking the chains of transmission for the South African variant is essential. Hancock adds that the UK's flu vaccination programme is upgraded every year to make sure it is as effective as possible against new variants. He says he hopes the government will be able to get the coronavirus jab to the same place and it will become ""something people have as standard"". Jonathan Walker from the Birmingham Mail and Newcastle Chronicle asks whether areas in the North of England that are rolling out the vaccine faster could have supplies cut to give more doses to other areas that have been slower. Hancock says the government is making sure the vaccine goes to all parts of the country ""on a fair basis according to need"" and insists every area is getting its fair share. He adds that there is a ""bumpy supply schedule for the whole country"" and if some days there are more vaccines given than others this is because of the supply available nationally. Jane Merrick from the i newspaper asks if the geographical spread of the South African variant suggests it is endemic and whether those who have already been jabbed will need a booster with a tweaked vaccine? She also wants to know if school playgrounds can be reopened sooner than 8 March given the health benefits to children. Hancock says the government has taken action regarding schools with a ""very heavy heart"" and these are the first measures ministers want to lift. But he says the virus is still widespread and there's a lot of work to do to get it under control"". Dr Hopkins says it's unlikely those who have already been jabbed will need to start again, even if the vaccine has to be tweaked in light of the South African variant. She says it's most likely a booster would be given. She stresses that cases of this strain found in the UK are not linked and that she's confident that measures in place will close down and eliminate transmission. Emily Morgan from ITV asks how confident the government is that it can contain the new variant. Hancock says the enhanced testing is aimed at stopping the spread of the variant altogether. ""But it is not straightforward - there may be further cases we don't know about yet,"" he warns. He says it is therefore ""vital people in those areas minimise all social contact and get a test when the opportunity arises"". Tom Magner from Carers' World asks what assurances the health secretary can give that unpaid carers will always be at the heart of the government's policy making, saying many don't feel truly recognised because they are only in band six of the vaccine prioritisation list. Hancock says he knows from his own family just how important unpaid carers
are and the government has ""looked very closely"" at where they are on the prioritisation list, which is drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advisory group. Prof Powis agrees that ""in the NHS we absolutely recognise the huge value that
unpaid carers bring to our patientsâ. He says the NHS is working its way through the vaccination programme according to the priority list set by the JCVI but as soon as the top four priority groups have had their jab it will immediately move âvery rapidly, as quickly as we can"" through the groups next on the list. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Ministers have, over the past few days, begun to
hint at sharing the UKâs vaccine supply with other countries in the future â
including both the EU and the developing world. Matt Hancock just repeated that
pledge, saying that the UK will play its part to ensure vaccines are available
around the globe. But there have been no specifics yet from ministers on the
questions that inevitably follow. Which countries, when and on what terms? The
government may argue itâs really still too soon to say. But if supplies do
continue to grow, as expected, and the country moves away from a just-in-time
supply chain here at home, the pressure to answer these questions will also
increase. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Myanmar coup: 'Our world turned upside down',"This video can not be played Myanmar coup: What's happened so far? Myanmar woke to the news on Monday that the military was seizing control of the country. ""I guess I'll be live tweeting a coup now,"" former Reuters journalist Aye Min Thant wrote on Twitter shortly before 07:00 local time (00:30 GMT). ""Things are still pretty quiet for now, though people are awake and scared. I've been fielding calls since 6am from friends and relatives. The internet is in and out and my sim card no longer works."" The takeover wasannounced in a statement aired on a military-owned television station. It said the top army commander was in charge and a one-year state of emergency had been declared. The country's civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, had been detained, along with other members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. The move followed a landslide win by Ms Suu Kyi's party in an election in November that the army claims was marred by fraud. Ms Suu Kyi has urged her supporters to ""protest against the coup"". Myanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces from 1962 until 2011,  when a new government began ushering in a return to civilian rule. Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? How the military disrupted Myanmar's internet Aung San Suu Kyi: Democracy icon who fell from grace One resident of Myanmar's main city, Yangon, told the BBC she was ready to head out for an early morning walk when she received a message from a friend telling her of Ms Suu Kyi's detention. The 25-year-old, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, immediately logged on to social media. ""Waking up to learn your world has been completely turned upside down overnight was not a new feeling, but a feeling that I thought that we had moved on from, and one that I never thought we'd be forced to feel again,"" she said, reflecting on her childhood under military rule. ""What really hit me was seeing how our regional ministers were all detained. Because this meant that they really took everyone, not just Aung San Suu Kyi,"" she added. The arrest of regional lawmaker Pa Pa Han was livestreamed on Facebook by her husband. This video can not be played Pa Pa Han was escorted out of her home by soldiers Political activists, including filmmaker Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi, were also reported to have been detained. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) in Myanmar told the BBC it had documented the arrests of at least 42 officials, and 16 civil society activists. It said the process of verifying names was ongoing, while noting that some detainees had been released later in the day. ""We woke up with the news of the military coup in the early morning and some of our friends were detained,"" a local activist, who we are keeping anonymous, told the BBC's Newsday programme. ""The internet connectivity is not there anymore... I can't go out and use my phone, there is no data at all. This is what's happening right now. There are military cars roaming around the city,"" she said. Local journalist Cape Diamond tweeted that in the capital, Nay Pyi Daw, there had been no signal from 04:00 to 11:15 local time. ""No call, No Wifi,"" he later wrote on Twitter. By BBC Reality Check As the military took hold of power, internet disruption affected large areas. The restrictions began at 03:00 on Monday local time. Internet connectivity dropped to 50% of normal levels of internet connectivity by 08:00. The data shows disruptions impacting networks operators including state-owned Myanma Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and an international operator Telenor, according to internet monitoring service Netblocks. Netblocks say its findings indicate a ""centrally ordered mechanism of disruptionâ¦ progressing over time as operators comply"". By midday, internet connectivity appeared to be back up to 75%. The Myanmar government has restricted the internet before, especially in areas in Rakhine and Chin states, where the army is fighting local groups. Article 77 of Myanmar's Telecommunications Law passed in 2013 permits the government to cut off telecommunications during a national emergency. However, human rights groups have called for the law to be amended to protect freedom of expression. International and domestic TV channels, including the state broadcaster, went off air. The bright red flags of the NLD were taken off of homes and businesses in Yangon. ""My neighbour just took down his NLD flag... The fear of violence is real,"" journalist and researcher Annie Zaman wrote on Twitter. She later shared a video of a flag being removed at a local market. Allow Twitter content?

People stocked up on essential supplies and queued at ATMs. Banks suspended services because of poor internet connections but said they would resume from Tuesday. BBC Burmese Service journalist Nyein Chan Aye said the mood in Yangon was of ""fear, anger and frustration"". He said that after rushing out to buy staple supplies, like rice, many people were staying indoors waiting to see what happens next. Queues formed at banks and ATMs following the announcement It has been a tough time economically for many in Myanmar, and the arrival of a coup has had many fearing for basics. Ma Nan, a trader in Yangon, told the BBC: ""I'm worried if the price [of goods] will go up. I am worried because my daughter hasn't finished her school [education]. It's only halfway. Also this is the time of a pandemic."" Housewife Than Than Nyunt was also worried that the price of goods would rise and ""people will revolt"", adding: ""I hope that Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues will be freed sooner rather than later."" The fears are real if this coup means a return to the kind of life under the military rule of the 1990s and 2000s. The bloody crackdown of 1988 led to more than two decades of military rule The military had staged a bloody coup in 1988, with thousands dying as a student-led uprising against a Soviet-style one-party rule was put down. Ms Suu Kyi rose to prominence at the time and battled military rule and human rights abuses for two decades, after the military had refused to accept her election win of 1990. Life was punctuated by corruption, fluctuating prices, repression of daily life, chronic malnourishment in some areas and ethnic strife in others. Many are now concerned about what will come next. ""We are currently trying to tell ourselves that we will move on because we've moved on from worse before,"" the 25-year-old in Yangon told the BBC. ""But I wish we didn't have to do that, I wish we didn't have to tell ourselves to be strong."" Some military supporters, however, celebrated the coup, parading through the city blasting patriotic music. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Griffin Hotchkiss, an American expat who has lived in Myanmar for about six years, said he saw a ""caravan of pro-military civilians blasting loud music and 'celebrating' - while people (whom I know to be NLD supporters) on my street were visibly angry"". Some were surprised that the immediate fallout was not more extreme. On a trip into Yangon, Mr Hotchkiss said that ""besides some army vehicles in the City Hall compound nothing looked out of the ordinary"". Supporters of Myanmar's military drove through Yangon in celebration Later in the day, Mr Hotchkiss noticed that while there were ""far fewer people"", many shops appeared to be open and doing business. Michael Ghilezan, who lives in Yangon with his Burmese wife, said he had ""expected to see people marching down the streets in protests, and military vehicles stationed around the city.

Thousands of jobs at risk after Asos Arcadia deal,"The deal does not include the brands' stores Thousands of jobs remain at risk after online fashion retailer Asos struck a Â£295m deal to buy four brands from failed retail group Arcadia. Asos is buying the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands, but not the shops. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group fell into administration in November last year, casting doubt over the future of its brands and 13,000 jobs. Asos is paying Â£265m for the brands and a further Â£30m for the stock. About 300 people currently employed by the brands in design, buying and retail partnerships will transfer to Asos, but a question mark hangs over thousands more jobs. About 70 stores with 2,500 employees are expected to close. Within the past few weeks 50 stores have already closed, with the loss of about 2,000 jobs. One Topshop worker who wanted to remain anonymous said he had found out about the Asos deal from a Tweet by the fashion retailer on Monday. ""I woke up this morning, and just went on my phone, and it was the first thing that I saw on Twitter,"" he said. ""That was the first word we had, we didn't hear anything properly from the Arcadia side of things for a good hour and a bit afterwards."" He said that it was a part-time job for him while studying and ""I feel worse for the people who work there full-time for their careers."" ""There's lots of people who've been there for many years, and obviously, when [Asos] is just taking the digital side of it, there's so many people that work in the stores. It's really sad for company."" He said that while coronavirus ""hasn't helped"" the closure of physical stores would ""leave a big gap"". ""People still want to shop in person. It is good doing online shopping, but what then replaces the High Street? There's going to be nothing left, eventually, if all these companies keep buying up [brands]."" Asos chief executive Nick Beighton said: ""The acquisition of these iconic British brands is a hugely exciting moment for Asos and our customers and will help accelerate our multi-brand platform strategy. ""We have been central to driving their recent growth online and, under our ownership, we will develop them further, using our design, marketing, technology and logistics expertise, and working closely with key strategic retail partners in the UK and around the world."" Mr Beighton told journalists on a conference call that acquiring the brands would accelerate Asos's mission to become ""the number one destination for fashion-loving 20-somethings throughout the world"". ""This deal makes perfect sense for us on every level,"" he added. In a separate BBC interview, he said: ""There was a lot of competition and we're really pleased we eventually came through and won the brands. ""We think we're the natural owners for these brands. We know these customers and we know this market. We have the best designers in London and really I think these brands sit naturally on the Asos platform."" Administrators Deliotte said the deal was expected to complete on 4 February. However, neither Asos nor the administrators made any mention of the people who worked in the brands' store networks. Asos said it had acquired ""strong consumer-facing brands"" and saw ""a significant opportunity"" to drive further growth for them globally. It added that the brands would benefit from ""investment into customer engagement and brand positioning in line with our existing model"". Asos has seen strong sales in the pandemic and is already one of the biggest wholesalers for the brands that it has acquired. Asos' purchase of the four main Arcadia brands leaves the thousands of staff employed in the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT shops facing a desperately uncertain future. They are unlikely to keep their jobs. It is hard to see a buyer emerging at the right time to keep them employed. There are also 10,000 members of the Arcadia pension scheme who face a possible hit to their retirement benefits. The scheme has an estimated deficit of Â£350m and is being assessed by the Pension Protection Fund, the government-backed lifeboat scheme for orphan pension plans. Council leaders all over the country will also be fretting at the rapid exodus from the High Street. Topshop once had 300 shops - only 70-odd are still operating - and Debenhams' 124 High Street stores are expected to close from next month. This is a double blow to town centres, which will now look much emptier when pandemic trading restrictions are lifted. Landlords will be wondering who might be their new tenants. As one retail observer has noted, there is only so much street food and crazy golf that a single postcode can take. Many councils will hope a conversion of empty premises into flats will make the difference. However, the British Property Federation is warning that new government plans to fast-track the re-purposing of retail premises risk making matters worse. Another of Sir Philip Green's brands, Evans, was bought by Australia's City Chic in December for Â£23m. Other brands in the Arcadia stable that have not yet been sold are Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton. It emerged last week thatonline fashion retailer Boohoo was in ""exclusive"" talksto snap up those brands. Also last week,Boohoo sealed a deal to buy the Debenhams brandand website for Â£55m. However, the price tag did not include any of the retailer's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce, resulting in up to 12,000 job losses. On Monday retailer Aldi said that workers affected by the collapse of Arcadia and Debenhams should apply for one of the 4,000 jobs it aims to create in the UK this year. Supermarkets have seen high demand for groceries since March 2020 as restaurants and pubs have been hit by lockdowns and coronavirus restrictions. Aldi is currently opening one store per week ""as we continue to try to meet the huge demand"", said Aldi UK recruitment director Kelly Stokes. ""That means finding around 4,000 new Aldi colleagues this year and, if we can do that while also helping those who have recently lost out due to closures elsewhere, we will do,"" she said. Sir Philip Green is under pressure to use his own money to plug an estimated Â£350m hole in Arcadia's pension fund, which has about 10,000 members. Last year, the retail tycoon had an estimated fortune of Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Prof John Colley, associate dean of Warwick Business School, described the Asos deal as ""another nail in the High Street's coffin"", ""Meanwhile. landlords will have to try to re-let the properties and there will be few takers in the current climate,"" he said. ""With retail values collapsing, it is likely that many of these properties have to be converted for other uses. In that sense, we can see Covid-19 accelerating and crystallising trends which have been developing for many years.""

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Breakfast in Rome Gobbling through a takeaway
sandwich at the office desk is normal for the Brits. But for the Italians?
Mamma mia, itâs as foreign a concept here as a cappuccino after midday. So the
relaxing of restrictions in most of Italy today â all but five areas of the
country moving from orange to yellow zones â means this nationâs sacred rituals
can resume: a morning espresso inside a cafe; fresh pasta for lunch at the
local trattoria; an Aperol spritz in the bar for the early-evening aperitivo on
the way home from work. Venues must still stop table service at 6pm â itâs only
takeaway after that â but the newfound freedom, with museums reopening during
weekdays and movement allowed within oneâs region, will lift the mood here. So much so that people crowded
into city centres in anticipation over the weekend, almost counting down the
hours until the measures were eased. That has prompted concern that complacency
will be costly. Itâs what led a busy summer to be followed by a deadly autumn. Reopening is risky â the first
country in the West to be slammed by Covid knows that. But for now, this nation
of foodies will savour the moment. There were protests in Cape Town calling for beaches to reopen There will be
relief in South Africa after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced an easing
of lockdown restrictions. He said public
places such as parks, beaches and swimming pools will reopen and restrictions eased on
the sale of alcohol. Faith-based
gatherings will be permitted but social gatherings must not exceed 50 people for
indoor venues and 100 people outdoors. Ramaphosa said
the changes had been made possible because there had been a significant reduction
of patients with Covid admitted to hospital since early December, reducing the pressure on beds and
medical staff. As we mentioned in
an earlier post, public patience with the lockdown restrictions has been
fraying. Scores of people
protested at beaches in Cape Town at the weekend calling for them to be
reopened, and two church associations were threatening to sue the president over
the closure of churches. This video can not be played Mumbai: One of world's largest train networks resumes services In India, trains in Mumbai are running public services again and yes, there are social-distancing rules on board. Among the busiest in the world, the trains carry nearly eight million people every day. But they were shut down to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Now they have reopened to the public with certain Covid-19 restrictions, including compulsory masks and temperature checks for commuters. Mumbai was one of the worst-hit cities in India but coronavirus numbers have begun to fall there, as they have elsewhere in country. BBC Radio 5 Live Alison with her mum Margaret Today, 5 Liveâs Your Call asked listeners if they were celebrating at news that every care home resident in England has been offered a Covid vaccine. Alison, in Colchester, said it was âvery hardâ to listen to the good news because her mum died in a care home last month after contracting coronavirus. âI just feel very sad. It was too late for her,â she said. Alison said she had been told that vaccinations could not always be administered in care homes where positive tests had been recorded. ""How do we protect those vulnerable people until they are vaccinated?â she said. Debs, in Eccles, said her parents required 24-hour care but lived at home with her.  Because they could not leave the home, they were unable to attend vaccination appointments. She wanted to highlight the ""forgotten group of people - the elderly that are at home and housebound"" who had not yet received their vaccination. ""Weâre a little bit in the dark,â she said. ""The vaccination programme is fantastic but housebound people donât seem to be getting mentioned anywhere."" Listen back to Your Call on the free BBC Sounds app. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This development sounds alarmingâ after all just a handful of
cases has prompted a massive effort to get tens of thousands of people tested. But as always context is needed. This variant is â like the UK one â more contagious. But there is no evidence that it causes more serious
illness. And data suggests the vaccines will work against it,
although maybe not quite as well as they do against the original one. So the logic of public health officials is to stop or at
least slow the spread. We are at a crucial point with the vaccine being rolled out
quickly and immunity being built up by significant numbers of vulnerable
people. Anything that interferes with that will slow our escape from
lockdown and, ultimately, the pandemic as well as increasing risk to the population. So the aim is to hit it hard and early. The fact the UK is the world leader in sequencing means
officials have been able to identify the early signs of community transmission,
giving the country a fighting chance of stamping down hard on this variant. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that
âthe contact tracing system now finds 95%, around 95%, of those contacts [of
people whoâve tested positive], so it has built up to this very effective
levelâ. When someone tests positive for
coronavirus in England they should be contacted by the Test and Trace system. They are then asked how many close contacts
theyâve had in the run-up to testing positive. Of these contacts, the tracing teams
successfully reached 93.2% - and told them to self-isolate - in the week ending 20 January. So the health secretary is broadly
right. But it is worth noting that in the same
week, of the 275,000 people who tested positive, only 85% were actually reached
in the first place and had their details passed to the contact tracing system. You can read more about how NHS Test and Trace workshere. While there's good news on vaccination in the UK and Israel, in New York vaccination centres have temporarily closed and
appointments re-arranged as the US city braces itself for a major snowstorm. As much as 60cm (20in) of snow is expected to fall along the US east
coast, with wind gusts of up to 80km/h (50mph) creating blizzard-like conditions. New York has declared a state of emergency, cancelling flights
and restricting non-essential travel. Mayor Bill de Blasio admitted the storm had disrupted the âvaccination
effortâ because âwe donât want folks, especially seniors, going out in unsafe
conditions to get vaccinatedâ. But he promised a fast restart after the danger has passed
because âwe can take the supply we have and distribute it very quickly in the
days to come and make sure everyone gets the appointmentsâ. Snow began falling in parts of Pennsylvania, New York state and New England late on Sunday night and the heaviest snowfalls were expected during Monday. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Around 20% of Israel's population has now been fully vaccinated As we mentioned
earlier, Israel's coronavirus
vaccination programme is showing signs of working to drive down infections and illness in the over-60s. Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) figures show 531 over-60s, out of almost 750,000 fully vaccinated, tested positive for coronavirus (0.07%). And far fewer fell ill, with 38 becoming needing hospital treatment with moderate, severe or critical disease. There were three deaths in vaccinated over-60s - although it is possible they contracted the infection earlier, before their immunity had time to build. Before the vaccine had time to take effect, more than 7,000 infections were recorded, just under 700 cases of moderate to critical illness and 307 deaths. The MoH data suggests infections and illnesses fell consistently from 14 days after receiving the first jab onwards. You can read Rachelâs report here. The number of new coronavirus cases being recorded in the UK is continuing to fall, with 18,607 reported today. However, the number of deaths remain high, with 406 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. Meanwhile, more than nine million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, with an average of 389,000 people getting their first jab every day over the past seven days. It means the government is on track to meet its target of offering the vaccine to about 15 million people in priority groups by mid-February. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock doesnât rule out
further restrictions in those postcodes where thereâs concern about the South
African variant. However, it doesnât sound like the governmentâs on the
verge of imposing extra measures with the health secretary pointing out that
the countryâs already in lockdown. Itâs clear the government hopes to get on
top of the issue via, in part, so-called âsurgeâ testing. People in those areas
are also being urged to, in particular, heed that stay at home advice. But questions may well continue over whether more should or could be done
to contain this variant. Yes, public health officials insist thereâs no evidence
it causes a more severe disease but Dr Susan Hopkins did also just repeat the
concern that vaccines may have a âdiminishedâ â albeit still âvery goodâ â
effect against the variant. Finally the scientists are asked about the South African variant and whether it is more likely to cause serious illness. Dr Hopkins says it has ""similar transmissibility"" to the variant that was first found in Kent but there is not evidence it is causing more severe disease than other variants circulating in the UK. However, she adds that it has slightly
more mutations in the spike protein which is perhaps causing vaccines to have ""diminished effectiveness"" although they still work very well. She says the government wants to prevent viruses with mutations acquiring more mutations which is why breaking the chains of transmission for the South African variant is essential. Hancock adds that the UK's flu vaccination programme is upgraded every year to make sure it is as effective as possible against new variants. He says he hopes the government will be able to get the coronavirus jab to the same place and it will become ""something people have as standard"". Jonathan Walker from the Birmingham Mail and Newcastle Chronicle asks whether areas in the North of England that are rolling out the vaccine faster could have supplies cut to give more doses to other areas that have been slower. Hancock says the government is making sure the vaccine goes to all parts of the country ""on a fair basis according to need"" and insists every area is getting its fair share. He adds that there is a ""bumpy supply schedule for the whole country"" and if some days there are more vaccines given than others this is because of the supply available nationally. Jane Merrick from the i newspaper asks if the geographical spread of the South African variant suggests it is endemic and whether those who have already been jabbed will need a booster with a tweaked vaccine? She also wants to know if school playgrounds can be reopened sooner than 8 March given the health benefits to children. Hancock says the government has taken action regarding schools with a ""very heavy heart"" and these are the first measures ministers want to lift. But he says the virus is still widespread and there's a lot of work to do to get it under control"". Dr Hopkins says it's unlikely those who have already been jabbed will need to start again, even if the vaccine has to be tweaked in light of the South African variant. She says it's most likely a booster would be given. She stresses that cases of this strain found in the UK are not linked and that she's confident that measures in place will close down and eliminate transmission. Emily Morgan from ITV asks how confident the government is that it can contain the new variant. Hancock says the enhanced testing is aimed at stopping the spread of the variant altogether. ""But it is not straightforward - there may be further cases we don't know about yet,"" he warns. He says it is therefore ""vital people in those areas minimise all social contact and get a test when the opportunity arises"". Tom Magner from Carers' World asks what assurances the health secretary can give that unpaid carers will always be at the heart of the government's policy making, saying many don't feel truly recognised because they are only in band six of the vaccine prioritisation list. Hancock says he knows from his own family just how important unpaid carers
are and the government has ""looked very closely"" at where they are on the prioritisation list, which is drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advisory group. Prof Powis agrees that ""in the NHS we absolutely recognise the huge value that
unpaid carers bring to our patientsâ. He says the NHS is working its way through the vaccination programme according to the priority list set by the JCVI but as soon as the top four priority groups have had their jab it will immediately move âvery rapidly, as quickly as we can"" through the groups next on the list. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Ministers have, over the past few days, begun to
hint at sharing the UKâs vaccine supply with other countries in the future â
including both the EU and the developing world. Matt Hancock just repeated that
pledge, saying that the UK will play its part to ensure vaccines are available
around the globe. But there have been no specifics yet from ministers on the
questions that inevitably follow. Which countries, when and on what terms? The
government may argue itâs really still too soon to say. But if supplies do
continue to grow, as expected, and the country moves away from a just-in-time
supply chain here at home, the pressure to answer these questions will also
increase. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Military coup in Myanmar as Suu Kyi detained,"This video can not be played Myanmar coup: What's happened so far? Myanmar's military has seized power after detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratically elected leaders. Troops are patrolling the streets and a night-time curfew is in force, with a one-year state of emergency declared. US President Joe Biden raised the threat of new sanctions, with the UN and UK also condemning the coup. The army alleges the recent landslide election win by Ms Suu Kyi's party was marred by fraud. She urged supporters to ""protest against the coup"". In a letter written in preparation for her impending detention, she said the military's actions would put the country back under a dictatorship. The military has already announced replacements for a number of ministers. Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? How the military disrupted the internet Who is the general behind the coup? On the streets of the main city, Yangon (Rangoon), people said they felt their hard-fought battle for democracy had been lost. One 25-year-old resident, who asked not to be named, told the BBC: ""Waking up to learn your world has been completely turned upside down overnight was not a new feeling, but a feeling that I thought that we had moved on from, and one that I never thought we'd be forced to feel again."" Myanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces from 1962 until 2011, when a new government began ushering in a return to civilian rule. Aung San Suu Kyi, seen here at a coronavirus vaccination clinic in January, is Myanmar's de facto leader She spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010. She was internationally hailed as a beacon of democracy and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi But her international reputation suffered severely following an army crackdown on the mostly Muslim Rohingya minority. Former supporters accused her of refusing to condemn the military or acknowledge accounts of atrocities. In the early hours of Monday, the army's TV station said power had been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Ms Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) were arrested in a series of raids. It is not clear where they are being held. No major violence has been reported. Soldiers blocked roads in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, and the main city, Yangon. International and domestic TV channels, including the state broadcaster, went off air.Internet and phone serviceswere disrupted. Banks said they had been forced to close. Later, the military announced that 24 ministers and deputies had been removed, and 11 replacements had been named, including in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs. A curfew is now reportedly in effect from 20:00 local time to 06:00 (13:30-23:30 GMT). Queues formed at ATMs in Yangon and other cities The military takeover follows weeks of tensions between the armed forces and the government followingparliamentary elections lost by the army-backed opposition. The opposition had demanded a re-run of the election, raising allegations of widespread fraud that were not backed by the electoral commission. So it is official. The armed forces in Myanmar have confirmed that they have carried out a coup d'etat, their first against a civilian government since 1962, and in apparent violation of the constitution which the military promised to honour as recently as last Saturday. The grievances which have been driving tension between the military and the government are well enough known. The military-backed party, the USDP, performed poorly in last November's general election, whereas the NLD did even better than in 2015. The timing of this coup is also easily explained. This week the first session of parliament since the election was due to start, which would have enshrined the election result by approving the next government. That will no longer happen. But the military's longer game plan is hard to fathom. What do they plan to do in the year they have given themselves to run the country? There will be public anger over a coup so soon after an election in which 70% of voters defied the Covid-19 pandemic to vote so overwhelmingly for Aung San Suu Kyi. Famously stubborn, she is unlikely to co-operate with a gun held to her head. Her ally, President Win Myint, is the only person authorised under the constitution to enact a state of emergency. He has been detained with her. For the moment the military's action appears reckless, and puts Myanmar on a perilous path. Michael Ghilezan, a partner of a US law firm who lives in Yangon, told the BBC he had expected military vehicles and protests in the city, but there was instead an eerie calm. ""The most common reaction from my Burmese friends has been anger. They feel deeply betrayed by the military and the USDP."" This was reflected in other comments from the streets, although there have been some supporters of the army out waving flags in Yangon. Theinny Oo, a development consultant, told Reuters: ""We had a lawful election. People voted for the one they preferred. We have no protection under the law now."" Many people feared giving their names. One 64-year-old resident of Hlaing township told AFP: ""I don't want the coup. I have seen many transitions in this country and I was looking forward to a better future."" Author and historian Thant Myint-U tweeted that a door had opened to a ""very different future"", and he feared for the millions who had been descending into poverty. Allow Twitter content?

Joe Biden released a statement saying,external""force should never seek to overrule the will of the people or attempt to erase the outcome of a credible election"". He said the removal of sanctions over the past decade as Myanmar progressed to democracy would be immediately reviewed, adding: ""The United States will stand up for democracy wherever it is under attack.""

European Union leaders have issued similar condemnations. China, which has previously opposed international intervention in Myanmar, urged all sides in the country to ""resolve differences"", while some regional powers, including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, said it was an ""internal matter"". Military chief Min Aung Hlaing is now in power Aung San Suu Kyi, 75, is the daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, Gen Aung San who was assassinated just before the country gained independence from British colonial rule in 1948. She remained popular with the public despite spending years under house arrest. She was released in 2010, and in November 2015 she led the NLD to a landslide victory in Myanmar's first openly contested election for 25 years and became de facto leader.

GameStop market battle moves on to silver,"Silver prices have hit an a eight-year high after calls to buy the metal on social media sparked a trading frenzy. It comes a week after amateur investors piled into shares in the games retailer GameStop, causing them to jump 700%. On Monday silver rose by as much as 11% to $30 an ounce, while shares in some mining firms were up as much as 60%. Small time traders swapping tips on Reddit are thought to be behind the trend, as they seek to drive prices up. However, some users of the site dispute this, alleging the ""Silver Squeeze"" is secretly being coordinated by big Wall Street firms. It is the latest example of apparently small-time traders taking on big Wall Street hedge funds that hope to profit when the price of an asset or stock falls, but could lose heavily if it rises. Tips posted on social media sites like Reddit say these so called ""short sellers"" are manipulating the markets. And so the amateurs buy up the stocks or assets, driving up the price and inflicting losses on the big players. UK trading platform IG stops new GameStop trades GameStop: Who is winning the market battle? Global watchdogs on alert as GameStop frenzy grows It began in January when amateurs piled into loss-making retailer GameStop and other companies such as AMC and Blackberry. GameStop shares, which were trading at less than $20 (Â£14.61) each at the start of January, shot to nearly $350 last week. They fell 30% on Monday to $225. Now the battle appears to have moved on to silver - a far bigger market. The price of silver slid from its early highs on Monday. But the metal is up by almost 20% since Wednesday, when messages began circulating on Reddit forums, encouraging users to buy the metal. Coin-selling websites say they are now seeing unprecedented demand and delays in delivering silver. Reflecting the attitude of many of those swapping tips on the site, one user called RocketBoomGo urged fellow traders to ""think about the Gainz"" in a widely circulated post. ""If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP Morgan you'd be destroying along the way,"" they added. Amateur investors caused shares in GameStop to surge more than 700% last week However, some on Reddit expressed scepticism, with one saying they had analysed comments and posts on the thread Wall Street Silver and found that 80% ""came from accounts mostly created in the last 2 days. Pretty suspect.. who do these people really work for?!"" GameStop - a political fable Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said that amateur investors would find it much harder to influence the price of silver than they did with GameStop. For one thing, the total value of silver being traded is about $1.4-$1.6 trillion, he said, which is 1,000 times the total value of GameStop's share capital before it became the target of speculation. A large proportion of the silver market also exists ""off-exchange"", meaning it can't be bought and sold as easily online. The army of small investors will have enlisted for different reasons. Some will hope to profit from getting in early and starting a wave of others doing the same, ride it for a bit before getting off the wave and letting it crash after they've taken their profits. Others will see something going up and think the sky's the limit to this - still plenty of time for me to profit too. And others will think - I don't really care if I lose a few bucks, sticking it to the man is the name of the game. The first group will have made money and indeed may be being infiltrated right now by the very professionals they hoped to beat. The second group will end up poorer and unhappy about it. The third may end up poorer but don't care - they have made a telling political point. Read more here. This video can not be played WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop? ""Retail traders who are just following the herd and join the party late may accumulate huge losses and need to be more rational in their decisions,"" Mr Sayed added. GameStop investors have already got a taste of those risks. Shares in the company have fallen since last week, when the frenzy caught regulatory attention and trading platforms imposed restrictions on shares in GameStop and some other companies. That decision sparked anger among amateur traders, who say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. Several prominent US politicians and the billionaire Elon Musk have voiced their support. The moves also convinced some online traders to dig in their heels, like Paul Grainger of Liverpool, a project manager at a telecommunications firm. He added shares in GameStop to his investments after seeing online hype that persuaded him the price would rise. Now he's holding on, partly to send a message to the hedge fund giants. ""At first, I was in it like probably most people were were at the beginning, just to try to make a little bit of money on it,"" he said. ""But now... I'm out of principle holding the stock. ""I think it's wrong what they're doing and the fact that they've changed the rules of the game now that the little man's getting an advantage."" Mr Grainger said he's ready to risk his holdings, which are a small part of his portfolio, and hopeful that if many people act similarly, those betting against the company will be the ones hit with losses. But he said he's not expecting there to be too many similar opportunities - in silver or elsewhere - in the future. ""Now that we've taken advantage of it, I don't think that the market will allow this to happen again,"" he said. ""I think this is kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity and I'm hoping it will make those big companies change the way they operate so this kind of thing can't happen again."" Despite what some retail traders hoped, some of the biggest profiteers from last week's market action were said to be Wall Street giants such as asset manager BlackRock and the private equity firm Silver Lake. However, other big investors have been hammered by the trading frenzy. Hedge fund Melvin Capital - which bet heavily that shares in GameStop would fall - lost 53% of its value towards the end of January, according to media reports. The firm has since received commitments for fresh cash from investors, leaving it with around $8bn (Â£5.8bn) in assets, but that is still down from $12.5bn at the beginning of 2021, according to Reuters.

The little-known heroes of the Manchester attack,"When a bomb went off at Manchester Arena, a number of ordinary people made the decision not to run away from the horror, but to stay to help the injured and dying. Survivors say the contribution of these people was crucial, yet feel their role has so far been almost entirely overlooked in the official version of events. As the inquiry begins to hear evidence about the emergency response, we spoke to some of those people. Here are their extraordinary stories. During lockdown, like everyone else, Kim Dick and Freya Lewis have had to make do with online video calls to stay in touch. But they're still determined to catch up when they can. Their chats are full of fun - gossip about the soaps, music, and their pets. It's clear they share a special bond. You'd never know that Kim and Freya, 18, were strangers until a few years ago, brought together at the worst time of their lives. Their worlds collided on 22 May 2017 when a bomb exploded at Manchester Arena. Kim, 57, and her husband Phil were in the arena foyer to collect their daughter and granddaughter from an Ariana Grande concert when the blast blew Kim off her feet. As she steadied herself and tried to focus through the smoke and debris, a small girl staggered towards her, and collapsed in her arms. It was Freya. Kim didn't know the then-14-year-old, and didn't have time to think. ""This little girl just appeared,"" Kim recalls. ""There was blood coming out of her mouth, and I thought 'oh my God I've got to look after her. I've got to get her out of here'."" Kim managed to drag Freya towards the door of the foyer and lean her up against a wall. She knew she had to keep her upright to prevent her from choking on the blood which was still pouring out of her mouth. Freya kept sliding down and closing her eyes as Kim strained to hold her up, talking to her non-stop to keep her conscious. ""I said 'OK darling, you're going to be OK'. Just repeating and repeating it the whole time. That's what I thought, after watching (medical dramas) on TV. You've got to keep them awake, keep them alert. Don't let them go to sleep."" As Kim tried to keep the teenager upright, Phil used his car keys to try to cut away plastic from Freya's merchandise bag which had melted into her hair and skin. Freya was left with 29 separate injuries including two broken legs, a broken arm, severe burns, and a shattered mouth. And she was not the only one who needed Kim and Phil's help. A second young girl, Aliya, appeared, in pain and crying, with awful injuries to her leg. All Kim could do was tell her to sit down with them and try to keep both children awake and talking. ""At the time I felt really helpless,"" Kim says. ""These girls were bleedingâ¦ and we needed the help. We needed the paramedics then."" Kim remembers the sounds of the foyer. The loudspeaker was blaring. She could hear sirens outside, and assumed help would come quickly. But they waited and waited. ""There was screaming, then crying and as time went on the screaming got less and less. The crying was less and less and then it was just total silence. And you knew that people had died."" Kim believes she sat propping Freya up for more than an hour, becoming increasingly desperate for help. ""I was shouting out 'Help! We need help!â¦ And I was shouting out to nobody."" With no stretcher available, they had to lift Freya onto a table from one of the merchandise stands, and carry her down the stairs to the station concourse. Throughout this time, Freya's dad Nick was frantically searching for her. Kim and Phil managed to get Freya's home phone number from her, and spoke to her mum who was desperately waiting for news. Nick then called the couple and with the help of two police officers, was guided through the security cordon. As father and daughter were reunited, Kim and Phil slipped away. Kim says she still feels guilty for leaving. ""There were people on the floor everywhere,"" she says. It was after 1am when the two girls were taken to hospital, Freya by ambulance, Aliya in a minibus driven by someone who volunteered to help. Freya was put into an induced coma and underwent many hours of surgery. When she came round, she asked her parents about Kim and Phil. ""I remembered them straight away,"" she says. ""I wanted to know how they were."" Two weeks later she got her answer when they visited the hospital and the two families forged a bond they still share. ""Kim and Phil saved my life,"" Freya says. ""On that night, nobody else seemed to help me. And I just saw Kim, with her arms wide open, and she took care of me straight away. Without thinking I basically collapsed onto her. And she and Phil looked after me and kept me alive. ""She kept my eyes open. She kept me breathing. She kept me as calm as I possibly could be."" After multiple operations and a long rehabilitation, Freya has made an amazing recovery, and is now applying to drama school, with dreams of becoming an actress. ""They acted as my parents when my parents couldn't,"" she adds. ""And for the rest of my life, I'll always be eternally grateful to them. They're just amazing."" Daren Buckley is a changed man after what happened at the arena. Physically, the difference is shocking; he's lost nearly four stone in weight and the stress has led him to grind most of his teeth away. The night terrors and flashbacks have stayed with him. In the weeks after the attack he would wake up covered in sweat, having dreamt of people dying in front of him. He has struggled to come to terms with the lack of official recognition for people who helped, and says he feels completely forgotten. ""How can you run into a bomb and get told you don't matter?"" he says, angrily. ""I feel like anybody on the professional side of things has been acknowledged, even the police sniffer dog got an award. To me it is all wrong, the system and how it has worked."" Daren was at the concert with his disabled son Lewis, the pair just about to walk through the doors to the foyer when the bomb went off. He says he knew immediately it was a suicide bombing and remembers running towards the blast pulling Ariana Grande t-shirts off the merchandise stand and throwing them to people to use as bandages. ""We had t-shirts to save lives. We had nothing else."" At one point he asked someone if he could get into a first aid room for extra gloves and bandages, but says he was told all the doors had been locked. As time ticked on and no more help was coming, Daren helped to carry the injured out of the foyer and down into Victoria Station, where the medical teams were waiting. Manchester attack: Who were the victims? The families searching for answers Youngest victim 'could have survived with better first aid' Daren has struggled with PTSD ever since the attack. ""It's like it's stamped on my brain and I'm thinking how can I get it out?"" he says. ""In my dreams I've seen myself dead. I've seen things moving on the floor that shouldn't be. Nobody can see the injuries on me because physically I don't have them, but mentally, I've got hundreds. How do you move forward when you're in that rut of thinking is it going to happen again?"" For Daren, there have been some very low points. But he says the support from the community of survivors has been life-saving for him, as well as the Manchester Survivors Choir. ""All I've ever wanted to do was sing,"" he says. ""I'd be lost without music, it keeps you going."" Rob Grew was in a shop when he heard a loud boom and screams coming from the station. Thinking a train had crashed, he started to run towards the noise, never expecting what would happen over the next six hours. He reached the foyer within five minutes of the bomb going off. ""It took me a minute or two to decide what to do,"" he says. ""Whether to run back out for my own safety, or go in."" But the sight of a mother and child on the floor screaming for help stopped him from leaving. ""That thought went out of my head and I went straight to them, to comfort them."" The girl had multiple shrapnel wounds to her legs, while the mum had a bolt that had gone through her cheek. ""She asked me if I could go and look for her sister in the centre of the foyer which I didâ¦ It was just chaos. There were people everywhere on the floor."" He pauses before recalling: ""You look at those who are just lying there, bleeding out, and you have no idea what to do at all. So many injuries you've no idea where to start."" Rob did have some first aid training, and as an adventure sports photographer, had some experience of having to stay calm in dangerous situations. But it was nowhere near the level needed to deal with the scale of what he was faced with. ""It was just autopilot really,"" he says. ""Where do you start with someone who has multiple holes in their torso and legs? I think the only thing I remembered was compression - try and stop the bleeding - and CPR. There were that many people screaming out for help, you've just got to try and cover as many people as you can."" As the minutes ticked by, and despite the reassurances he was giving to the injured, it dawned on Rob and others inside the foyer that no more help was coming in. The focus shifted from tourniquets and bandaging, to getting people out on makeshift stretchers made out of dismantled tables and T-shirt stands. ""I kept trying to reassure people 'don't worry they'll be a few minutes, there's people just outside'. And I kept on saying that for 40 minutes."" He says he could see the flashing lights of ambulances down by the railway station but no-one coming up the steps to help, which meant carrying people down three flights of stairs. Rob still doesn't know what happened to some of the people he tried to help - whether they lived or died. But there are some who stick out: a woman who passed away next to him as he attended to someone else; two elderly sisters with severe injuries who told him 'don't worry, we're two quite gritty individuals' as he apologised for leaving them and moving on to someone else; and a trainee nurse in a stripy dress who came back after taking her children to safety, and who he says definitely saved lives. The judgements he made on the night have stayed with him. ""I think I put pressure on myself wishing I could have done more to help."" There are some who Rob has since been able to identify, like Robby Potter, who he helped carry out of the arena and down to the station. ""I found Robby on his back on the bridge to the foyer and he was pretty much unconscious. ""There was a member of the train staff there, knelt beside him, I came back every so often, to see if he was still with us. ""We went and got a table from the T-shirt stand and lifted Robby onto it, with maybe four of us. Robby's a big guy so we struggled to carry him down. That's all I heard of him for a good six weeks or more; I didn't know whether he was alive or dead."" Rob says there was never enough medical help inside the foyer. His focus was on getting people out, and getting them to where help was waiting. A number of times he was mistaken for a doctor, and had to say that he was not qualified to give morphine injections. After the last injured person had been loaded into an ambulance, Rob finally left and walked home covered in blood and still wearing a pair of medical gloves. ""I just walked back to my apartment, got a shower, put all my clothes in a big bag because I wasn't sure if the police would need them. I just chucked them away in the end, they never asked for them."" He says he remembers thinking ""how the hell have I walked out of such a crazy thing and just been left? I wasn't spoken to by the police until something like the September"". Rob has never had counselling. Adventure sports became his therapy. He went abroad shortly afterwards, then spent some time climbing mountains in Wales, trying to come to terms with what had happened. For a good period of time he says, he replayed the night over and over again in his head, trying to figure out what he could have done better. He re-took his first aid course and, while doing CPR training, kept seeing the faces of the injured and dying. Overall, he has tried to take something positive from it. ""Because you've experienced such shock now you can probably deal with situations better so I like to think next time I'll be one of those people who can help a bit betterâ¦ I wish I could have done more still."" Sean Gardner didn't think he'd be at Manchester Arena for long. He was late to pick up his daughter Hannah from the concert, and thought he'd try to park as close as possible. He screeched into a space in the underground car park, and told his other daughter Charlotte to wait while he ran upstairs to collect her sister. Before Sean could reach the foyer, the bomb went off. ""It was pretty obvious to me what had happened. And then of course, people just came running. And I guess I had a choice at that point."" Instead of turning around, Sean ran against the flow of the crowd. He'd arranged to meet Hannah in the foyer, and he charged towards it, terrified she'd been hurt. But she wasn't there, and he hoped that meant she was safe. While racing back to his car to reassure his other daughter a woman pleaded with him to stop and help her. She was unharmed, but her friend Jane Tweddle was badly injured. ""They just needed help. It was as black and white as thatâ¦ I just felt obliged. It's just human nature."" Sean says he quickly realised Jane's injuries were far beyond anything he knew how to treat. ""It wasn't enough, but all I did was stay with her and comfort her. And that's all I could do. But it was in the expectation that somebody would be there within minutes."" He says he kept looking towards the doors, thinking he'd see people in uniforms coming through with stretchers. ""I held her hand, and she knew somebody was next to her I suppose. That was the main thing. I told her 'Just hang on in there. It won't be long, they'll be with us'."" He believes it was about 20 minutes before a British Transport Police officer came running past him and he begged her to help while he went to reassure daughter Charlotte about what was happening. Waiting in the car she'd become hysterical, not knowing what had happened. ""She tried to come upstairs and they wouldn't let her. Somebody told her that people were dead. She didn't know about me. She didn't know about her sisterâ¦ she thought we were injured at best."" Sean told Charlotte he thought Hannah was safe, although he hadn't found her. But he felt he needed to go back to continue looking after Jane. ""Charlotte was really brave. And I said, 'I will be back. But you have to stay here because you're safest here. And once we get Jane sorted out, we can go and find Hannah'."" He returned to Jane's side and waited until more police officers arrived. They made efforts to resuscitate the mother of three. But Jane didn't survive and died with her friend by her side. He spent the next two hours trying to reunite himself with both of his daughters. Hannah had ended up in a nearby hotel, while Charlotte had been brought out of the car park by a police officer as it was being cordoned off. Three years on, his family are still living with the haunting memories of the night. Sean has suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and says he's struggled with a range of emotions. ""It troubles me as to whether I could have done something different. Whether had [the emergency services] been there sooner, the outcome would have been better. ""It troubles me that my daughters had to wait such a long period of time, Charlotte, in particular, to know exactly what was going on. For her, that's so traumatic."" Asked if he feels like a hero, Shaun looks awkward. ""No. I don't like labels."" He says he stayed with Jane because he would ""hope somebody would do that for me in those circumstances"". ""I think it's just humanity to be honest with you. There's probably not enough of it, but I was always brought up that way. I know I'd never do anything different."" For survivor Martin Hibbert, the lack of official recognition for the ordinary people who chose to help has been a source of increasing frustration and anger. Not least because he feels their accounts are crucial to piecing together the facts about how the emergency response played out. Martin remembers little from the hours immediately after the bomb, and it's no wonder; he was hit by 22 separate pieces of shrapnel, including a bolt in his neck which severed an artery, and one in his back which has paralysed him from the waist down. His only thought was for his teenage daughter, who was also severely injured and lying next to him on the foyer floor. ""I knew that I probably wasn't going to make it,"" he says. ""I was striving to stay alive really to make sure she got out. When I saw her being carted off, that's when the curtains came down."" In the three years since, Martin has attempted to piece together the details of what happened to him and his now 18-year-old daughter, but he says it hasn't been easy. He feels that many details in the official reports into the aftermath of the bombing do not tally with the eyewitness accounts of those who were there. He and others have now formed a network of survivors who can speak with a common voice; but because their bid to play a formal role in the public inquiry has been denied and they don't have access to all the evidence, Martin says many gaps still remain. Only since the inquiry started has he discovered he arrived at Salford Royal hospital at 1:45am; more than three hours after the explosion, but only a 15 minute drive from the arena. The inquiry has been told all the injured had been moved out of the foyer by 11:40pm - an hour after the blast. ""So what happened to me for two hours after that?"" he says. He can only assume he was lying on the station concourse. When he did finally arrive at hospital, he was given 14 pints of blood. For Martin, proper recognition of the bravery of these members of the public is long overdue and he says, their voices need to be heard. ""As everybody ran out, they ran in. ""Police, fire and ambulance, they are trained for that, but people like Daren Buckley and Rob Grew aren't. For a member of the public to have that instinct, it takes a very special person to do that."" He says for the world not to know about what these people did ""just feels wrong"". ""They don't want a Queen's honour, or a medal, or a pin badge. They just want recognition for what they did, and recognition that they were there."" Dozens of awards recognising the bravery of police officers, medical staff and other emergency responders have been given out in the years since the Arena attack. A ceremony recognising the 'supreme courage' of British Transport Police officers and railway staff was held in January 2018, honouring the 'breathtaking bravery' of those who helped. In October 2018 police sniffer dog Mojo was awarded the animal equivalent of an OBE - the PDSA Order of Merit, for his bravery after spending the night searching for secondary explosives. Medics received a Pride of Britain award in 2017, while officers from Greater Manchester Police and charity workers were recognised in the Queens Honours in 2019 for their work in the aftermath of the attack.

Mamma mia, itâs as foreign a concept here as a cappuccino after midday. So the
relaxing of restrictions in most of Italy today â all but five areas of the
country moving from orange to yellow zones â means this nationâs sacred rituals
can resume: a morning espresso inside a cafe; fresh pasta for lunch at the
local trattoria; an Aperol spritz in the bar for the early-evening aperitivo on
the way home from work. Venues must still stop table service at 6pm â itâs only
takeaway after that â but the newfound freedom, with museums reopening during
weekdays and movement allowed within oneâs region, will lift the mood here. So much so that people crowded
into city centres in anticipation over the weekend, almost counting down the
hours until the measures were eased. That has prompted concern that complacency
will be costly. Itâs what led a busy summer to be followed by a deadly autumn. Reopening is risky â the first
country in the West to be slammed by Covid knows that. But for now, this nation
of foodies will savour the moment. There were protests in Cape Town calling for beaches to reopen There will be

of lockdown restrictions. He said public
places such as parks, beaches and swimming pools will reopen and restrictions eased on
the sale of alcohol. Faith-based
gatherings will be permitted but social gatherings must not exceed 50 people for
indoor venues and 100 people outdoors. Ramaphosa said
the changes had been made possible because there had been a significant reduction
of patients with Covid admitted to hospital since early December, reducing the pressure on beds and
medical staff. As we mentioned in
an earlier post, public patience with the lockdown restrictions has been
fraying. Scores of people
protested at beaches in Cape Town at the weekend calling for them to be
reopened, and two church associations were threatening to sue the president over
the closure of churches. This video can not be played Mumbai: One of world's largest train networks resumes services In India, trains in Mumbai are running public services again and yes, there are social-distancing rules on board. Among the busiest in the world, the trains carry nearly eight million people every day. But they were shut down to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Now they have reopened to the public with certain Covid-19 restrictions, including compulsory masks and temperature checks for commuters. Mumbai was one of the worst-hit cities in India but coronavirus numbers have begun to fall there, as they have elsewhere in country. BBC Radio 5 Live Alison with her mum Margaret Today, 5 Liveâs Your Call asked listeners if they were celebrating at news that every care home resident in England has been offered a Covid vaccine. Alison, in Colchester, said it was âvery hardâ to listen to the good news because her mum died in a care home last month after contracting coronavirus. âI just feel very sad. It was too late for her,â she said. Alison said she had been told that vaccinations could not always be administered in care homes where positive tests had been recorded. ""How do we protect those vulnerable people until they are vaccinated?â she said. Debs, in Eccles, said her parents required 24-hour care but lived at home with her.  Because they could not leave the home, they were unable to attend vaccination appointments. She wanted to highlight the ""forgotten group of people - the elderly that are at home and housebound"" who had not yet received their vaccination. ""Weâre a little bit in the dark,â she said. ""The vaccination programme is fantastic but housebound people donât seem to be getting mentioned anywhere."" Listen back to Your Call on the free BBC Sounds app. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This development sounds alarmingâ after all just a handful of
cases has prompted a massive effort to get tens of thousands of people tested. But as always context is needed. This variant is â like the UK one â more contagious. But there is no evidence that it causes more serious
illness. And data suggests the vaccines will work against it,
although maybe not quite as well as they do against the original one. So the logic of public health officials is to stop or at
least slow the spread. We are at a crucial point with the vaccine being rolled out
quickly and immunity being built up by significant numbers of vulnerable
people. Anything that interferes with that will slow our escape from
lockdown and, ultimately, the pandemic as well as increasing risk to the population. So the aim is to hit it hard and early. The fact the UK is the world leader in sequencing means
officials have been able to identify the early signs of community transmission,
giving the country a fighting chance of stamping down hard on this variant. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that
âthe contact tracing system now finds 95%, around 95%, of those contacts [of
people whoâve tested positive], so it has built up to this very effective
levelâ. When someone tests positive for
coronavirus in England they should be contacted by the Test and Trace system. They are then asked how many close contacts
theyâve had in the run-up to testing positive. Of these contacts, the tracing teams
successfully reached 93.2% - and told them to self-isolate - in the week ending 20 January. So the health secretary is broadly
right. But it is worth noting that in the same
week, of the 275,000 people who tested positive, only 85% were actually reached
in the first place and had their details passed to the contact tracing system. You can read more about how NHS Test and Trace workshere. While there's good news on vaccination in the UK and Israel, in New York vaccination centres have temporarily closed and
appointments re-arranged as the US city braces itself for a major snowstorm. As much as 60cm (20in) of snow is expected to fall along the US east
coast, with wind gusts of up to 80km/h (50mph) creating blizzard-like conditions. New York has declared a state of emergency, cancelling flights
and restricting non-essential travel. Mayor Bill de Blasio admitted the storm had disrupted the âvaccination
effortâ because âwe donât want folks, especially seniors, going out in unsafe
conditions to get vaccinatedâ. But he promised a fast restart after the danger has passed
because âwe can take the supply we have and distribute it very quickly in the
days to come and make sure everyone gets the appointmentsâ. Snow began falling in parts of Pennsylvania, New York state and New England late on Sunday night and the heaviest snowfalls were expected during Monday. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Around 20% of Israel's population has now been fully vaccinated As we mentioned
earlier, Israel's coronavirus
vaccination programme is showing signs of working to drive down infections and illness in the over-60s. Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) figures show 531 over-60s, out of almost 750,000 fully vaccinated, tested positive for coronavirus (0.07%). And far fewer fell ill, with 38 becoming needing hospital treatment with moderate, severe or critical disease. There were three deaths in vaccinated over-60s - although it is possible they contracted the infection earlier, before their immunity had time to build. Before the vaccine had time to take effect, more than 7,000 infections were recorded, just under 700 cases of moderate to critical illness and 307 deaths. The MoH data suggests infections and illnesses fell consistently from 14 days after receiving the first jab onwards. You can read Rachelâs report here. The number of new coronavirus cases being recorded in the UK is continuing to fall, with 18,607 reported today. However, the number of deaths remain high, with 406 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. Meanwhile, more than nine million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, with an average of 389,000 people getting their first jab every day over the past seven days. It means the government is on track to meet its target of offering the vaccine to about 15 million people in priority groups by mid-February. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock doesnât rule out
further restrictions in those postcodes where thereâs concern about the South
African variant. However, it doesnât sound like the governmentâs on the
verge of imposing extra measures with the health secretary pointing out that
the countryâs already in lockdown. Itâs clear the government hopes to get on
top of the issue via, in part, so-called âsurgeâ testing. People in those areas
are also being urged to, in particular, heed that stay at home advice. But questions may well continue over whether more should or could be done
to contain this variant. Yes, public health officials insist thereâs no evidence
it causes a more severe disease but Dr Susan Hopkins did also just repeat the
concern that vaccines may have a âdiminishedâ â albeit still âvery goodâ â
effect against the variant. Finally the scientists are asked about the South African variant and whether it is more likely to cause serious illness. Dr Hopkins says it has ""similar transmissibility"" to the variant that was first found in Kent but there is not evidence it is causing more severe disease than other variants circulating in the UK. However, she adds that it has slightly
more mutations in the spike protein which is perhaps causing vaccines to have ""diminished effectiveness"" although they still work very well. She says the government wants to prevent viruses with mutations acquiring more mutations which is why breaking the chains of transmission for the South African variant is essential. Hancock adds that the UK's flu vaccination programme is upgraded every year to make sure it is as effective as possible against new variants. He says he hopes the government will be able to get the coronavirus jab to the same place and it will become ""something people have as standard"". Jonathan Walker from the Birmingham Mail and Newcastle Chronicle asks whether areas in the North of England that are rolling out the vaccine faster could have supplies cut to give more doses to other areas that have been slower. Hancock says the government is making sure the vaccine goes to all parts of the country ""on a fair basis according to need"" and insists every area is getting its fair share. He adds that there is a ""bumpy supply schedule for the whole country"" and if some days there are more vaccines given than others this is because of the supply available nationally. Jane Merrick from the i newspaper asks if the geographical spread of the South African variant suggests it is endemic and whether those who have already been jabbed will need a booster with a tweaked vaccine? She also wants to know if school playgrounds can be reopened sooner than 8 March given the health benefits to children. Hancock says the government has taken action regarding schools with a ""very heavy heart"" and these are the first measures ministers want to lift. But he says the virus is still widespread and there's a lot of work to do to get it under control"". Dr Hopkins says it's unlikely those who have already been jabbed will need to start again, even if the vaccine has to be tweaked in light of the South African variant. She says it's most likely a booster would be given. She stresses that cases of this strain found in the UK are not linked and that she's confident that measures in place will close down and eliminate transmission. Emily Morgan from ITV asks how confident the government is that it can contain the new variant. Hancock says the enhanced testing is aimed at stopping the spread of the variant altogether. ""But it is not straightforward - there may be further cases we don't know about yet,"" he warns. He says it is therefore ""vital people in those areas minimise all social contact and get a test when the opportunity arises"". Tom Magner from Carers' World asks what assurances the health secretary can give that unpaid carers will always be at the heart of the government's policy making, saying many don't feel truly recognised because they are only in band six of the vaccine prioritisation list. Hancock says he knows from his own family just how important unpaid carers
are and the government has ""looked very closely"" at where they are on the prioritisation list, which is drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advisory group. Prof Powis agrees that ""in the NHS we absolutely recognise the huge value that
unpaid carers bring to our patientsâ. He says the NHS is working its way through the vaccination programme according to the priority list set by the JCVI but as soon as the top four priority groups have had their jab it will immediately move âvery rapidly, as quickly as we can"" through the groups next on the list. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Ministers have, over the past few days, begun to
hint at sharing the UKâs vaccine supply with other countries in the future â
including both the EU and the developing world. Matt Hancock just repeated that
pledge, saying that the UK will play its part to ensure vaccines are available
around the globe. But there have been no specifics yet from ministers on the
questions that inevitably follow. Which countries, when and on what terms? The
government may argue itâs really still too soon to say. But if supplies do
continue to grow, as expected, and the country moves away from a just-in-time
supply chain here at home, the pressure to answer these questions will also
increase. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

further restrictions in those postcodes where thereâs concern about the South
African variant. However, it doesnât sound like the governmentâs on the
verge of imposing extra measures with the health secretary pointing out that
the countryâs already in lockdown. Itâs clear the government hopes to get on
top of the issue via, in part, so-called âsurgeâ testing. People in those areas
are also being urged to, in particular, heed that stay at home advice. But questions may well continue over whether more should or could be done
to contain this variant. Yes, public health officials insist thereâs no evidence
it causes a more severe disease but Dr Susan Hopkins did also just repeat the
concern that vaccines may have a âdiminishedâ â albeit still âvery goodâ â
effect against the variant. Finally the scientists are asked about the South African variant and whether it is more likely to cause serious illness. Dr Hopkins says it has ""similar transmissibility"" to the variant that was first found in Kent but there is not evidence it is causing more severe disease than other variants circulating in the UK. However, she adds that it has slightly
more mutations in the spike protein which is perhaps causing vaccines to have ""diminished effectiveness"" although they still work very well. She says the government wants to prevent viruses with mutations acquiring more mutations which is why breaking the chains of transmission for the South African variant is essential. Hancock adds that the UK's flu vaccination programme is upgraded every year to make sure it is as effective as possible against new variants. He says he hopes the government will be able to get the coronavirus jab to the same place and it will become ""something people have as standard"". Jonathan Walker from the Birmingham Mail and Newcastle Chronicle asks whether areas in the North of England that are rolling out the vaccine faster could have supplies cut to give more doses to other areas that have been slower. Hancock says the government is making sure the vaccine goes to all parts of the country ""on a fair basis according to need"" and insists every area is getting its fair share. He adds that there is a ""bumpy supply schedule for the whole country"" and if some days there are more vaccines given than others this is because of the supply available nationally. Jane Merrick from the i newspaper asks if the geographical spread of the South African variant suggests it is endemic and whether those who have already been jabbed will need a booster with a tweaked vaccine? She also wants to know if school playgrounds can be reopened sooner than 8 March given the health benefits to children. Hancock says the government has taken action regarding schools with a ""very heavy heart"" and these are the first measures ministers want to lift. But he says the virus is still widespread and there's a lot of work to do to get it under control"". Dr Hopkins says it's unlikely those who have already been jabbed will need to start again, even if the vaccine has to be tweaked in light of the South African variant. She says it's most likely a booster would be given. She stresses that cases of this strain found in the UK are not linked and that she's confident that measures in place will close down and eliminate transmission. Emily Morgan from ITV asks how confident the government is that it can contain the new variant. Hancock says the enhanced testing is aimed at stopping the spread of the variant altogether. ""But it is not straightforward - there may be further cases we don't know about yet,"" he warns. He says it is therefore ""vital people in those areas minimise all social contact and get a test when the opportunity arises"". Tom Magner from Carers' World asks what assurances the health secretary can give that unpaid carers will always be at the heart of the government's policy making, saying many don't feel truly recognised because they are only in band six of the vaccine prioritisation list. Hancock says he knows from his own family just how important unpaid carers
are and the government has ""looked very closely"" at where they are on the prioritisation list, which is drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advisory group. Prof Powis agrees that ""in the NHS we absolutely recognise the huge value that
unpaid carers bring to our patientsâ. He says the NHS is working its way through the vaccination programme according to the priority list set by the JCVI but as soon as the top four priority groups have had their jab it will immediately move âvery rapidly, as quickly as we can"" through the groups next on the list. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Ministers have, over the past few days, begun to
hint at sharing the UKâs vaccine supply with other countries in the future â
including both the EU and the developing world. Matt Hancock just repeated that
pledge, saying that the UK will play its part to ensure vaccines are available
around the globe. But there have been no specifics yet from ministers on the
questions that inevitably follow. Which countries, when and on what terms? The
government may argue itâs really still too soon to say. But if supplies do
continue to grow, as expected, and the country moves away from a just-in-time
supply chain here at home, the pressure to answer these questions will also
increase. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Asos buys Topshop and Miss Selfridge brands,"The deal does not include the brands' stores Thousands of jobs remain at risk after online fashion retailer Asos struck a Â£295m deal to buy four brands from failed retail group Arcadia. Asos is buying the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands, but not the shops. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group fell into administration in November last year, casting doubt over the future of its brands and 13,000 jobs. Asos is paying Â£265m for the brands and a further Â£30m for the stock. About 300 people currently employed by the brands in design, buying and retail partnerships will transfer to Asos, but a question mark hangs over thousands more jobs. About 70 stores with 2,500 employees are expected to close. Within the past few weeks 50 stores have already closed, with the loss of about 2,000 jobs. One Topshop worker who wanted to remain anonymous said he had found out about the Asos deal from a Tweet by the fashion retailer on Monday. ""I woke up this morning, and just went on my phone, and it was the first thing that I saw on Twitter,"" he said. ""That was the first word we had, we didn't hear anything properly from the Arcadia side of things for a good hour and a bit afterwards."" He said that it was a part-time job for him while studying and ""I feel worse for the people who work there full-time for their careers."" ""There's lots of people who've been there for many years, and obviously, when [Asos] is just taking the digital side of it, there's so many people that work in the stores. It's really sad for company."" He said that while coronavirus ""hasn't helped"" the closure of physical stores would ""leave a big gap"". ""People still want to shop in person. It is good doing online shopping, but what then replaces the High Street? There's going to be nothing left, eventually, if all these companies keep buying up [brands]."" Asos chief executive Nick Beighton said: ""The acquisition of these iconic British brands is a hugely exciting moment for Asos and our customers and will help accelerate our multi-brand platform strategy. ""We have been central to driving their recent growth online and, under our ownership, we will develop them further, using our design, marketing, technology and logistics expertise, and working closely with key strategic retail partners in the UK and around the world."" Mr Beighton told journalists on a conference call that acquiring the brands would accelerate Asos's mission to become ""the number one destination for fashion-loving 20-somethings throughout the world"". ""This deal makes perfect sense for us on every level,"" he added. In a separate BBC interview, he said: ""There was a lot of competition and we're really pleased we eventually came through and won the brands. ""We think we're the natural owners for these brands. We know these customers and we know this market. We have the best designers in London and really I think these brands sit naturally on the Asos platform."" Administrators Deliotte said the deal was expected to complete on 4 February. However, neither Asos nor the administrators made any mention of the people who worked in the brands' store networks. Asos said it had acquired ""strong consumer-facing brands"" and saw ""a significant opportunity"" to drive further growth for them globally. It added that the brands would benefit from ""investment into customer engagement and brand positioning in line with our existing model"". Asos has seen strong sales in the pandemic and is already one of the biggest wholesalers for the brands that it has acquired. Asos' purchase of the four main Arcadia brands leaves the thousands of staff employed in the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT shops facing a desperately uncertain future. They are unlikely to keep their jobs. It is hard to see a buyer emerging at the right time to keep them employed. There are also 10,000 members of the Arcadia pension scheme who face a possible hit to their retirement benefits. The scheme has an estimated deficit of Â£350m and is being assessed by the Pension Protection Fund, the government-backed lifeboat scheme for orphan pension plans. Council leaders all over the country will also be fretting at the rapid exodus from the High Street. Topshop once had 300 shops - only 70-odd are still operating - and Debenhams' 124 High Street stores are expected to close from next month. This is a double blow to town centres, which will now look much emptier when pandemic trading restrictions are lifted. Landlords will be wondering who might be their new tenants. As one retail observer has noted, there is only so much street food and crazy golf that a single postcode can take. Many councils will hope a conversion of empty premises into flats will make the difference. However, the British Property Federation is warning that new government plans to fast-track the re-purposing of retail premises risk making matters worse. Another of Sir Philip Green's brands, Evans, was bought by Australia's City Chic in December for Â£23m. Other brands in the Arcadia stable that have not yet been sold are Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton. It emerged last week thatonline fashion retailer Boohoo was in ""exclusive"" talksto snap up those brands. Also last week,Boohoo sealed a deal to buy the Debenhams brandand website for Â£55m. However, the price tag did not include any of the retailer's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce, resulting in up to 12,000 job losses. On Monday retailer Aldi said that workers affected by the collapse of Arcadia and Debenhams should apply for one of the 4,000 jobs it aims to create in the UK this year. Supermarkets have seen high demand for groceries since March 2020 as restaurants and pubs have been hit by lockdowns and coronavirus restrictions. Aldi is currently opening one store per week ""as we continue to try to meet the huge demand"", said Aldi UK recruitment director Kelly Stokes. ""That means finding around 4,000 new Aldi colleagues this year and, if we can do that while also helping those who have recently lost out due to closures elsewhere, we will do,"" she said. Sir Philip Green is under pressure to use his own money to plug an estimated Â£350m hole in Arcadia's pension fund, which has about 10,000 members. Last year, the retail tycoon had an estimated fortune of Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Prof John Colley, associate dean of Warwick Business School, described the Asos deal as ""another nail in the High Street's coffin"", ""Meanwhile. landlords will have to try to re-let the properties and there will be few takers in the current climate,"" he said. ""With retail values collapsing, it is likely that many of these properties have to be converted for other uses. In that sense, we can see Covid-19 accelerating and crystallising trends which have been developing for many years.""

Police probe striker's lockdown haircut photo,"Joelinton shared a picture of himself with Tom Baxter on Friday from what is believed to be a garage A barber who cut a footballer's hair in breach of lockdown had been warned by a council before about possible breaches. Tom Baxter, who was pictured in his North Shields garage with NUFC striker Joelinton, has accepted a prohibition notice from North Tyneside Council. Newcastle City Council said it had issued him with a warning in November and a prohibition notice in January for his Newcastle salon. Mr Baxter said he was unaware of the Newcastle issues and will appeal. A Newcastle City Council spokesman said: ""Following complaints about Mr Baxter still operating his High Heaton barbershop a week after national lockdown measures began in November 2020, we wrote to advise that the premises were not permitted to open. ""The letter warned that if Mr Baxter did not cease trading and comply with Covid restrictions designed to protect public health, a prohibition notice would be served."" The council previously said a second warning was issued in December, but it has now said that was incorrect. Mr Baxter said his salon was closed throughout November and he had installed numerous Covid measures when it reopened under tier three rules in December. Tom Baxter said he spent Â£20,000 making his salon Covid secure After the picture of Mr Baxter and Joelinton was shared online last week, North Tyneside Council said it would issue a prohibition notice of its own as it had ""received complaints about an individual operating a barber service"" from a property in the borough ""in contravention of Covid regulations"". Northumbria Police previously said it would contact the celebrity stylist and Joelinton and ""consider further action"". Newcastle United said it wouldtake ""appropriate action"", while Mr Baxtersaid on Saturday he ""shouldn't have done it"". Hair salons and barbers in England are currently closed under lockdown regulations. A police spokesman said: ""We are aware of a social media post involving a 24-year-old man and a 35-year-old man who may be in breach of coronavirus restrictions. ""We will be speaking to those involved and consider any further action under the coronavirus legislation."" Joelinton was on the bench forNewcastle's 2-0 win at Evertonon Saturday.

UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine,"The UK has ordered an extra 40 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine from the French pharmaceutical company Valneva, that should become available later in the year and into 2022. The government says it will give flexibility should people need revaccinating next winter or beyond. The UK has secured 407 million doses of different coronavirus vaccines - more than enough for the entire population. Valneva's jab is still being tested in trials. Although those will take time to satisfy regulators before it can be rolled out, manufacturing at a site in West Lothian, Scotland, has already begun. The site is already supporting 100 new highly-skilled local jobs for scientists and technicians. The jab is expected to be given as two doses and contains a dead version of coronavirus that cannot cause disease, but should teach the body's immune system how to fight it. The government said it signed a deal to almost double its initial order for 60 million doses. When will I get the vaccine? What's happening to the EU vaccine scheme? Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""This latest deal is yet another weapon in our national arsenal against this terrible disease, and will ensure we have sufficient supplies to protect the British public in 2021 and beyond. ""Backed with major investment from the UK government, Valneva's site in Scotland will be a vaccine production powerhouse, working flat out to ensure we can quickly deploy jabs across the UK if their candidate is approved, while supporting top quality, local jobs."" Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said any surplus vaccine could be distributed globally. ""If approved, Valneva's vaccine will not only help tackle Covid-19 here in the UK, but aid our mission to ensure there is a fair supply of vaccines across the globe.

Nintendo Switch sales surge past those of the 3DS,"Nintendo has sold about four million more Switch consoles than those of its 3DS Sales of Nintendo's Switch gaming consoles have surpassed those of their predecessor - the 3DS - despite being available for a much shorter period. The firm said 79.87 million units had been sold since its March 2017 launch. The figures accompanied the Japanese firm's financial results,external, which saw it declare a record 377bn yen ($3.6bn) profit for the April-December period. Analysts attribute the Switch's success to the popularity of Animal Crossing, among other family-friendly exclusives. Super Mario 3D World - which goes on sale on 12 February - is expected to provide it with a further boost. Nintendo ended production ofits 3DS handheld in September 2020and says it sold 75.94 million units over its nine-and-a-half year lifetime. Up to four players can take part in the forthcoming Super Mario title The Switch first went on sale in 2017, and was joined by a lower-cost model - the Switch Lite - in 2019, which is also included in the tally. The firm saiddemand for the machines was 35.8% up on the same period,externalthe previous year, with a total of 24.1 million units sold over the last nine months of 2020. Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa said that the company had sufficient components to continue producing the devices - despite wider industry shortages - and it now expected to sell 26.5 million of the consoles over the financial year as a whole. That represents 10% more than its previous guidance. He added that there were no plans to launch a successor in the near term. However, there is continued speculation the company will unveil a ""pro"" version of the Switch before the end of 2021. ""The sales success of the Switch justifies Nintendo's decision to stick with its product strategy of combining unique and innovative dedicated games hardware with compelling first-party games,"" Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere Analysis told the BBC. ""Sometimes this approach misses the mark - see the Wii U for example - but when it works it tends to result in very successful products. ""Clearly the stand out hit is the 30-million-selling Animal Crossing: New Horizons, a gentle, sociable game that will be synonymous with lockdown for many people."" Animal Crossing: New Horizons has provided a distraction from the Covid pandemic for its millions of players Despite the Switch's success, it still has some way to go before overtaking sales of four of the firm's other consoles: Wii - 101.63 million units Nintendo DS - 154.02 million units Game Boy Advance - 81.51 million units Game Boy - 118.69 million units If ever it was needed, the Nintendo Switch is proof that you don't need the highest-resolution graphics or fastest processor to make great games. Sometimes people just want a cute, relaxing experience - and to be several thousand bells in debt to an entrepreneurial Japanese raccoon dog. Animal Crossing has always been a best-seller for Nintendo's consoles, but New Horizons has surpassed expectations, shifting about 31 million copies. Its blend of relaxing island life and home decoration have provided some much-needed escapism during the coronavirus pandemic. Its social features also helped friends connect, chat and visit one another's homes - at least virtually - during lockdown restrictions. Critics say New Horizons is not that dissimilar from previous games in the series. Indeed, some of the best-selling games for the Switch - such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - are pretty much re-releases from the flop Wii U console. But Nintendo seems to have found a winning formula with the Switch that shows no signs of slowing down.

"Fire-cladding costs 'are taking over our lives'Labour calls for extra help for homeowners hit by large bills, as ministers promise more action.UK Politics","Pippa Hamshaw says the costs and worry of fire-safety regulations have left her in tears Thousands of flat owners are facing large bills for fire-safety improvements demanded following the Grenfell disaster. Labour says they're not getting enough help, but the government insists it's taking appropriate action. ""The building should never have been signed off in the first place,"" says Pippa Hamshaw. ""The flats are all valued at nothing. Mortgage companies won't offer mortgages on any of them."" Pippa, 31, is also expecting a Â£70,000 bill for her share of renovations on her block of flats in Leeds. ""I go from being really angry with the situation to being in tears,"" she tells BBC 5 live's Naga Munchetty. ""It's taken over my life."" Cladding crisis: 'Delays could bankrupt us' New body to ban dangerous building materials No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Pippa is one of thousands of people facing large payments for safety renovations required following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, in west London, in which 72 people died when flames spread via combustible exterior cladding. Many fire-safety concerns have come up in inspections since then, but those not relating to cladding - such as missing fire breaks and flammable balconies - are not covered by the government's Building Safety Fund. And a report by MPs has said that the Â£1.6bn the government has allocated for removing dangerous cladding is insufficient - with the real cost nearer Â£15bn. This video can not be played Starmer: ""Three and a half years after Grenfell, most people would not believe this is the situation we are in"" Fixing safety faults has seen costs surge for leaseholders like Pippa, whose monthly service charge has risen from Â£240 to Â£630. ""I just feel totally let down by the whole system,"" she says. ""The government could do something right now... I feel like everyone's winning bar the leaseholder."" After Grenfell, round-the-clock fire patrols known as ""waking watches"" were put in place in hundreds of buildings, costing groups of leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds every month. ""I don't feel any safer,"" says Pippa. ""I don't see how they are going to be much use. They literally have to go and knock on every door of the flats to tell you that the building is on fire. We've got 10 floors in my property. Are they really going to be able to knock on every door?"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is accusing ministers of offering ""half-baked solutions"" to the problems exposed by Grenfell and has called for a national cladding taskforce, modelled on a similar body set up in Australia. He argues this would ""drive forward"" work on funding the removal of dangerous cladding, while pursuing ""those responsible for the cladding scandal"", protecting residents from costs and ensuring they can sell their properties. Builders remove cladding from a block in Greater Manchester Jenny Garrett, who bought her flat in Sheffield in 2019, says that, when the survey was carried out, ""absolutely nothing"" wrong was found. Only later did she find out the building's cladding was flammable. ""The whole situation is quite overwhelming because there's the issue of feeling unsafe,"" she says. ""On top of that, there's the issue about the financial pressure and worrying about what's coming down the road."" Residents have seen insurance costs on buildings with fire safety problems rocket. Flat owners in one Cheshire development had their combined premiums rise from Â£34,000 in 2018 to more than Â£500,000. Some are now paying almost Â£2,000 a year for building insurance. Meanwhile,data released last month shows,externalthat cladding removal and repair work has been completed on only 58% of social housing blocks and 30% of private sector buildings. The Association of British Insurers says the slow pace of getting buildings fixed means means high policy prices reflect risks accurately. ""For the last two or three years, a lot of our lives have been completely ruined,"" says Giles, a flat owner from Manchester. ""We're living in fear and limbo. All we've been told so far is the government wants us to pay sums running into the tens of thousands of pounds, simply to make our homes safe. ""It's all got even worse over the last year, because we're trapped in our homes for 23 hours a day during the pandemic. We almost feel safer outside than inside."" People attended a commemoration to mark the third anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire in 2020 ""We all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible... we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes,"" a Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman says. ""Leaseholders shouldn't have to worry about the unaffordable costs of fixing safety defects in high-rise buildings that they didn't cause - and should be protected from large-scale remediation costs wherever possible,"" he adds. ""The Building Safety Bill is the appropriate legislative mechanism for addressing these issues and will be brought forward in due course."" The House of Commons backed a Labour motion calling for further action on cladding on Monday by 263 votes to none. The Conservative leadership asked its MPs to abstain and the result is not binding on the government. LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Need some assistance with home-schooling?

Cladding crisis: 'Delays could bankrupt us' New body to ban dangerous building materials No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Pippa is one of thousands of people facing large payments for safety renovations required following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, in west London, in which 72 people died when flames spread via combustible exterior cladding. Many fire-safety concerns have come up in inspections since then, but those not relating to cladding - such as missing fire breaks and flammable balconies - are not covered by the government's Building Safety Fund. And a report by MPs has said that the Â£1.6bn the government has allocated for removing dangerous cladding is insufficient - with the real cost nearer Â£15bn. This video can not be played Starmer: ""Three and a half years after Grenfell, most people would not believe this is the situation we are in"" Fixing safety faults has seen costs surge for leaseholders like Pippa, whose monthly service charge has risen from Â£240 to Â£630. ""I just feel totally let down by the whole system,"" she says. ""The government could do something right now... I feel like everyone's winning bar the leaseholder."" After Grenfell, round-the-clock fire patrols known as ""waking watches"" were put in place in hundreds of buildings, costing groups of leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds every month. ""I don't feel any safer,"" says Pippa. ""I don't see how they are going to be much use. They literally have to go and knock on every door of the flats to tell you that the building is on fire. We've got 10 floors in my property. Are they really going to be able to knock on every door?"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is accusing ministers of offering ""half-baked solutions"" to the problems exposed by Grenfell and has called for a national cladding taskforce, modelled on a similar body set up in Australia. He argues this would ""drive forward"" work on funding the removal of dangerous cladding, while pursuing ""those responsible for the cladding scandal"", protecting residents from costs and ensuring they can sell their properties. Builders remove cladding from a block in Greater Manchester Jenny Garrett, who bought her flat in Sheffield in 2019, says that, when the survey was carried out, ""absolutely nothing"" wrong was found. Only later did she find out the building's cladding was flammable. ""The whole situation is quite overwhelming because there's the issue of feeling unsafe,"" she says. ""On top of that, there's the issue about the financial pressure and worrying about what's coming down the road."" Residents have seen insurance costs on buildings with fire safety problems rocket. Flat owners in one Cheshire development had their combined premiums rise from Â£34,000 in 2018 to more than Â£500,000. Some are now paying almost Â£2,000 a year for building insurance. Meanwhile,data released last month shows,externalthat cladding removal and repair work has been completed on only 58% of social housing blocks and 30% of private sector buildings. The Association of British Insurers says the slow pace of getting buildings fixed means means high policy prices reflect risks accurately. ""For the last two or three years, a lot of our lives have been completely ruined,"" says Giles, a flat owner from Manchester. ""We're living in fear and limbo. All we've been told so far is the government wants us to pay sums running into the tens of thousands of pounds, simply to make our homes safe. ""It's all got even worse over the last year, because we're trapped in our homes for 23 hours a day during the pandemic. We almost feel safer outside than inside."" People attended a commemoration to mark the third anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire in 2020 ""We all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible... we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes,"" a Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman says. ""Leaseholders shouldn't have to worry about the unaffordable costs of fixing safety defects in high-rise buildings that they didn't cause - and should be protected from large-scale remediation costs wherever possible,"" he adds. ""The Building Safety Bill is the appropriate legislative mechanism for addressing these issues and will be brought forward in due course."" The House of Commons backed a Labour motion calling for further action on cladding on Monday by 263 votes to none. The Conservative leadership asked its MPs to abstain and the result is not binding on the government. LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Need some assistance with home-schooling?

Myanmar's coup: Why now?,"The army detained civilian politicians hours before parliament was due to sit Myanmar's military has announced it has taken control of the country, a decade after agreeing to hand power to a civilian government. The coup has sent a shudder of fear through the country, which endured almost 50 years of rule under oppressive military regimes before the move towards democratic rule in 2011. The early morning arrests of Aung San Suu Kyi and other politicians were all too reminiscent of days many hoped they had left behind. For the past five years, Suu Kyi and her once-banned National League for Democracy (NLD) party led the country after being elected in 2015 in the freest and fairest vote seen in 25 years. On Monday morning, the party should have begun its second term in office. But behind the scenes, the military has kept a relatively tight grip on Myanmar (also known as Burma), thanks to a constitution which guarantees it a quarter of all seats in parliament and control of the country's most powerful ministries. Which raises the question why did it seize power now - and more to the point, what happens next? The exact timing is easily explained, as the BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head points out: Monday morning should have been the first session of parliament, which in turn would have enshrined the result. This now won't happen. Elections in November saw the NLD win more than 80% of the vote, remaining hugely popular even in the face of allegations of genocide against the country's Rohingya Muslims. The military-backed opposition immediately began making accusations of fraud after the vote. The allegation was repeated in a signed statement released by the newly-instated acting president to justify the imposition of the year-long state of emergency. ""The UEC [election commission] failed to solve huge voter list irregularities in the multi-party general election which was held on 8 November 2020,"" Myint Swe, a former general who had been vice-president, said. This video can not be played The early morning arrest of regional MP Pa Pa Han was live streamed on Facebook by her husband But there has been little evidence to support the allegation. ""Obviously Aung San Suu Kyi won a resounding election victory,"" Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Asia, tells the BBC. ""There have been allegations of electoral fraud. It is somewhat Trumpian - all these allegations of fraud with no evidence."" Even so, Mr Robertson describes the takeover as ""inexplicable"". ""Did [the vote] mean a loss of power? The answer is no."" November's vote may have seen the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) win a fraction of the vote, but the military still holds massive sway over the government thanks to a controversial 2008 constitution drawn up during junta rule. It not only gives the military a quarter of parliamentary seats automatically, but also hands it control of three key ministries - home affairs, defence and border affairs. So, as long as the constitution remains the same, the military retains some control. But could the NLD, with its majority, have amended the constitution? Unlikely, says Jonathan Head, as that requires the support of 75% of the parliament - an almost impossible task when the military controls at least 25%. Myanmar citizens in Japan have already taken to the streets to protest against the army Aye Min Thant, a former journalist, suggests there may be another reason for today's action: embarrassment on the part of the military. ""They weren't expecting to lose,"" the tech educator tells the BBC from Yangon (Rangoon). ""People whose families were in the military must have voted against them."" Of course, it is far more than that. Aung San Suu Kyi: Democracy icon who fell from grace What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis ""You need to understand how the army views its position in the country,"" Aye Min Thant adds. ""International media are quite used to referring to Aung San Suu Kyi as 'mother'. The army considers itself the 'father' of the nation."" As a result, it feels a sense of ""obligation and entitlement"" when it comes to ruling - and in recent years, as the country has become more open to international trade, it has not liked what it has seen. ""They view outsiders especially as a danger."" The pandemic and international concerns over the Rohingya being disenfranchised in the November vote may have emboldened the military to act now, Aye Min Thant suggests. All the same, it still raised surprise. Indeed, experts appear unsure of exactly why the military acted now, as there seems little to gain. ""It is worth remembering that the current system is tremendously beneficial for the army: it has complete command autonomy, sizeable international investment in its commercial interests and political cover from civilians for war crimes,"" Gerard McCarthy, a postdoctoral fellow at the National University of Singapore's Asia Research Institute, tells the BBC. ""Seizing power for a year as it has announced will isolate non-Chinese international partners, harm the military's commercial interests and provoke escalating resistance from millions of people who placed Suu Kyi and the NLD in power for in another term of government."" Soldiers have been spotted inside City Hall in Yangon Perhaps, he says, they hope to improve the USDP's standings in future elections, but the risks of such a move ""are significant"". HRW's Phil Robertson points out the move puts Myanmar in danger of becoming a ""pariah state"" once more, while angering the people at home. ""I do not think the people of Myanmar are going to take this lying down,"" he adds. ""They do not want to head back to a military future. They see Suu Kyi as a bulwark against a return to military power."" There are still hopes that this can be resolved through negotiation, he says, but adds: ""If we start seeing major protests beginning, then we are into a major crisis.""

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Breakfast in Rome Gobbling through a takeaway
sandwich at the office desk is normal for the Brits. But for the Italians?
Mamma mia, itâs as foreign a concept here as a cappuccino after midday. So the
relaxing of restrictions in most of Italy today â all but five areas of the
country moving from orange to yellow zones â means this nationâs sacred rituals
can resume: a morning espresso inside a cafe; fresh pasta for lunch at the
local trattoria; an Aperol spritz in the bar for the early-evening aperitivo on
the way home from work. Venues must still stop table service at 6pm â itâs only
takeaway after that â but the newfound freedom, with museums reopening during
weekdays and movement allowed within oneâs region, will lift the mood here. So much so that people crowded
into city centres in anticipation over the weekend, almost counting down the
hours until the measures were eased. That has prompted concern that complacency
will be costly. Itâs what led a busy summer to be followed by a deadly autumn. Reopening is risky â the first
country in the West to be slammed by Covid knows that. But for now, this nation
of foodies will savour the moment. There were protests in Cape Town calling for beaches to reopen There will be
relief in South Africa after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced an easing
of lockdown restrictions. He said public
places such as parks, beaches and swimming pools will reopen and restrictions eased on
the sale of alcohol. Faith-based
gatherings will be permitted but social gatherings must not exceed 50 people for
indoor venues and 100 people outdoors. Ramaphosa said
the changes had been made possible because there had been a significant reduction
of patients with Covid admitted to hospital since early December, reducing the pressure on beds and
medical staff. As we mentioned in
an earlier post, public patience with the lockdown restrictions has been
fraying. Scores of people
protested at beaches in Cape Town at the weekend calling for them to be
reopened, and two church associations were threatening to sue the president over
the closure of churches. This video can not be played Mumbai: One of world's largest train networks resumes services In India, trains in Mumbai are running public services again and yes, there are social-distancing rules on board. Among the busiest in the world, the trains carry nearly eight million people every day. But they were shut down to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Now they have reopened to the public with certain Covid-19 restrictions, including compulsory masks and temperature checks for commuters. Mumbai was one of the worst-hit cities in India but coronavirus numbers have begun to fall there, as they have elsewhere in country. BBC Radio 5 Live Alison with her mum Margaret Today, 5 Liveâs Your Call asked listeners if they were celebrating at news that every care home resident in England has been offered a Covid vaccine. Alison, in Colchester, said it was âvery hardâ to listen to the good news because her mum died in a care home last month after contracting coronavirus. âI just feel very sad. It was too late for her,â she said. Alison said she had been told that vaccinations could not always be administered in care homes where positive tests had been recorded. ""How do we protect those vulnerable people until they are vaccinated?â she said. Debs, in Eccles, said her parents required 24-hour care but lived at home with her.  Because they could not leave the home, they were unable to attend vaccination appointments. She wanted to highlight the ""forgotten group of people - the elderly that are at home and housebound"" who had not yet received their vaccination. ""Weâre a little bit in the dark,â she said. ""The vaccination programme is fantastic but housebound people donât seem to be getting mentioned anywhere."" Listen back to Your Call on the free BBC Sounds app. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This development sounds alarmingâ after all just a handful of
cases has prompted a massive effort to get tens of thousands of people tested. But as always context is needed. This variant is â like the UK one â more contagious. But there is no evidence that it causes more serious
illness. And data suggests the vaccines will work against it,
although maybe not quite as well as they do against the original one. So the logic of public health officials is to stop or at
least slow the spread. We are at a crucial point with the vaccine being rolled out
quickly and immunity being built up by significant numbers of vulnerable
people. Anything that interferes with that will slow our escape from
lockdown and, ultimately, the pandemic as well as increasing risk to the population. So the aim is to hit it hard and early. The fact the UK is the world leader in sequencing means
officials have been able to identify the early signs of community transmission,
giving the country a fighting chance of stamping down hard on this variant. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that
âthe contact tracing system now finds 95%, around 95%, of those contacts [of
people whoâve tested positive], so it has built up to this very effective
levelâ. When someone tests positive for
coronavirus in England they should be contacted by the Test and Trace system. They are then asked how many close contacts
theyâve had in the run-up to testing positive. Of these contacts, the tracing teams
successfully reached 93.2% - and told them to self-isolate - in the week ending 20 January. So the health secretary is broadly
right. But it is worth noting that in the same
week, of the 275,000 people who tested positive, only 85% were actually reached
in the first place and had their details passed to the contact tracing system. You can read more about how NHS Test and Trace workshere. While there's good news on vaccination in the UK and Israel, in New York vaccination centres have temporarily closed and
appointments re-arranged as the US city braces itself for a major snowstorm. As much as 60cm (20in) of snow is expected to fall along the US east
coast, with wind gusts of up to 80km/h (50mph) creating blizzard-like conditions. New York has declared a state of emergency, cancelling flights
and restricting non-essential travel. Mayor Bill de Blasio admitted the storm had disrupted the âvaccination
effortâ because âwe donât want folks, especially seniors, going out in unsafe
conditions to get vaccinatedâ. But he promised a fast restart after the danger has passed
because âwe can take the supply we have and distribute it very quickly in the
days to come and make sure everyone gets the appointmentsâ. Snow began falling in parts of Pennsylvania, New York state and New England late on Sunday night and the heaviest snowfalls were expected during Monday. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Around 20% of Israel's population has now been fully vaccinated As we mentioned
earlier, Israel's coronavirus
vaccination programme is showing signs of working to drive down infections and illness in the over-60s. Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) figures show 531 over-60s, out of almost 750,000 fully vaccinated, tested positive for coronavirus (0.07%). And far fewer fell ill, with 38 becoming needing hospital treatment with moderate, severe or critical disease. There were three deaths in vaccinated over-60s - although it is possible they contracted the infection earlier, before their immunity had time to build. Before the vaccine had time to take effect, more than 7,000 infections were recorded, just under 700 cases of moderate to critical illness and 307 deaths. The MoH data suggests infections and illnesses fell consistently from 14 days after receiving the first jab onwards. You can read Rachelâs report here. The number of new coronavirus cases being recorded in the UK is continuing to fall, with 18,607 reported today. However, the number of deaths remain high, with 406 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. Meanwhile, more than nine million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, with an average of 389,000 people getting their first jab every day over the past seven days. It means the government is on track to meet its target of offering the vaccine to about 15 million people in priority groups by mid-February. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock doesnât rule out
further restrictions in those postcodes where thereâs concern about the South
African variant. However, it doesnât sound like the governmentâs on the
verge of imposing extra measures with the health secretary pointing out that
the countryâs already in lockdown. Itâs clear the government hopes to get on
top of the issue via, in part, so-called âsurgeâ testing. People in those areas
are also being urged to, in particular, heed that stay at home advice. But questions may well continue over whether more should or could be done
to contain this variant. Yes, public health officials insist thereâs no evidence
it causes a more severe disease but Dr Susan Hopkins did also just repeat the
concern that vaccines may have a âdiminishedâ â albeit still âvery goodâ â
effect against the variant. Finally the scientists are asked about the South African variant and whether it is more likely to cause serious illness. Dr Hopkins says it has ""similar transmissibility"" to the variant that was first found in Kent but there is not evidence it is causing more severe disease than other variants circulating in the UK. However, she adds that it has slightly
more mutations in the spike protein which is perhaps causing vaccines to have ""diminished effectiveness"" although they still work very well. She says the government wants to prevent viruses with mutations acquiring more mutations which is why breaking the chains of transmission for the South African variant is essential. Hancock adds that the UK's flu vaccination programme is upgraded every year to make sure it is as effective as possible against new variants. He says he hopes the government will be able to get the coronavirus jab to the same place and it will become ""something people have as standard"". Jonathan Walker from the Birmingham Mail and Newcastle Chronicle asks whether areas in the North of England that are rolling out the vaccine faster could have supplies cut to give more doses to other areas that have been slower. Hancock says the government is making sure the vaccine goes to all parts of the country ""on a fair basis according to need"" and insists every area is getting its fair share. He adds that there is a ""bumpy supply schedule for the whole country"" and if some days there are more vaccines given than others this is because of the supply available nationally. Jane Merrick from the i newspaper asks if the geographical spread of the South African variant suggests it is endemic and whether those who have already been jabbed will need a booster with a tweaked vaccine? She also wants to know if school playgrounds can be reopened sooner than 8 March given the health benefits to children. Hancock says the government has taken action regarding schools with a ""very heavy heart"" and these are the first measures ministers want to lift. But he says the virus is still widespread and there's a lot of work to do to get it under control"". Dr Hopkins says it's unlikely those who have already been jabbed will need to start again, even if the vaccine has to be tweaked in light of the South African variant. She says it's most likely a booster would be given. She stresses that cases of this strain found in the UK are not linked and that she's confident that measures in place will close down and eliminate transmission. Emily Morgan from ITV asks how confident the government is that it can contain the new variant. Hancock says the enhanced testing is aimed at stopping the spread of the variant altogether. ""But it is not straightforward - there may be further cases we don't know about yet,"" he warns. He says it is therefore ""vital people in those areas minimise all social contact and get a test when the opportunity arises"". Tom Magner from Carers' World asks what assurances the health secretary can give that unpaid carers will always be at the heart of the government's policy making, saying many don't feel truly recognised because they are only in band six of the vaccine prioritisation list. Hancock says he knows from his own family just how important unpaid carers
are and the government has ""looked very closely"" at where they are on the prioritisation list, which is drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advisory group. Prof Powis agrees that ""in the NHS we absolutely recognise the huge value that
unpaid carers bring to our patientsâ. He says the NHS is working its way through the vaccination programme according to the priority list set by the JCVI but as soon as the top four priority groups have had their jab it will immediately move âvery rapidly, as quickly as we can"" through the groups next on the list. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Ministers have, over the past few days, begun to
hint at sharing the UKâs vaccine supply with other countries in the future â
including both the EU and the developing world. Matt Hancock just repeated that
pledge, saying that the UK will play its part to ensure vaccines are available
around the globe. But there have been no specifics yet from ministers on the
questions that inevitably follow. Which countries, when and on what terms? The
government may argue itâs really still too soon to say. But if supplies do
continue to grow, as expected, and the country moves away from a just-in-time
supply chain here at home, the pressure to answer these questions will also
increase. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

It was too late for her,â she said. Alison said she had been told that vaccinations could not always be administered in care homes where positive tests had been recorded. ""How do we protect those vulnerable people until they are vaccinated?â she said. Debs, in Eccles, said her parents required 24-hour care but lived at home with her.  Because they could not leave the home, they were unable to attend vaccination appointments. She wanted to highlight the ""forgotten group of people - the elderly that are at home and housebound"" who had not yet received their vaccination. ""Weâre a little bit in the dark,â she said. ""The vaccination programme is fantastic but housebound people donât seem to be getting mentioned anywhere."" Listen back to Your Call on the free BBC Sounds app. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This development sounds alarmingâ after all just a handful of
cases has prompted a massive effort to get tens of thousands of people tested. But as always context is needed. This variant is â like the UK one â more contagious. But there is no evidence that it causes more serious
illness. And data suggests the vaccines will work against it,
although maybe not quite as well as they do against the original one. So the logic of public health officials is to stop or at
least slow the spread. We are at a crucial point with the vaccine being rolled out
quickly and immunity being built up by significant numbers of vulnerable
people. Anything that interferes with that will slow our escape from
lockdown and, ultimately, the pandemic as well as increasing risk to the population. So the aim is to hit it hard and early. The fact the UK is the world leader in sequencing means
officials have been able to identify the early signs of community transmission,
giving the country a fighting chance of stamping down hard on this variant. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that
âthe contact tracing system now finds 95%, around 95%, of those contacts [of
people whoâve tested positive], so it has built up to this very effective
levelâ. When someone tests positive for
coronavirus in England they should be contacted by the Test and Trace system. They are then asked how many close contacts
theyâve had in the run-up to testing positive. Of these contacts, the tracing teams
successfully reached 93.2% - and told them to self-isolate - in the week ending 20 January. So the health secretary is broadly
right. But it is worth noting that in the same
week, of the 275,000 people who tested positive, only 85% were actually reached
in the first place and had their details passed to the contact tracing system. You can read more about how NHS Test and Trace workshere. While there's good news on vaccination in the UK and Israel, in New York vaccination centres have temporarily closed and
appointments re-arranged as the US city braces itself for a major snowstorm. As much as 60cm (20in) of snow is expected to fall along the US east
coast, with wind gusts of up to 80km/h (50mph) creating blizzard-like conditions. New York has declared a state of emergency, cancelling flights
and restricting non-essential travel. Mayor Bill de Blasio admitted the storm had disrupted the âvaccination
effortâ because âwe donât want folks, especially seniors, going out in unsafe
conditions to get vaccinatedâ. But he promised a fast restart after the danger has passed
because âwe can take the supply we have and distribute it very quickly in the
days to come and make sure everyone gets the appointmentsâ. Snow began falling in parts of Pennsylvania, New York state and New England late on Sunday night and the heaviest snowfalls were expected during Monday. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Around 20% of Israel's population has now been fully vaccinated As we mentioned
earlier, Israel's coronavirus
vaccination programme is showing signs of working to drive down infections and illness in the over-60s. Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) figures show 531 over-60s, out of almost 750,000 fully vaccinated, tested positive for coronavirus (0.07%). And far fewer fell ill, with 38 becoming needing hospital treatment with moderate, severe or critical disease. There were three deaths in vaccinated over-60s - although it is possible they contracted the infection earlier, before their immunity had time to build. Before the vaccine had time to take effect, more than 7,000 infections were recorded, just under 700 cases of moderate to critical illness and 307 deaths. The MoH data suggests infections and illnesses fell consistently from 14 days after receiving the first jab onwards. You can read Rachelâs report here. The number of new coronavirus cases being recorded in the UK is continuing to fall, with 18,607 reported today. However, the number of deaths remain high, with 406 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. Meanwhile, more than nine million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, with an average of 389,000 people getting their first jab every day over the past seven days. It means the government is on track to meet its target of offering the vaccine to about 15 million people in priority groups by mid-February. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock doesnât rule out
further restrictions in those postcodes where thereâs concern about the South
African variant. However, it doesnât sound like the governmentâs on the
verge of imposing extra measures with the health secretary pointing out that
the countryâs already in lockdown. Itâs clear the government hopes to get on
top of the issue via, in part, so-called âsurgeâ testing. People in those areas
are also being urged to, in particular, heed that stay at home advice. But questions may well continue over whether more should or could be done
to contain this variant. Yes, public health officials insist thereâs no evidence
it causes a more severe disease but Dr Susan Hopkins did also just repeat the
concern that vaccines may have a âdiminishedâ â albeit still âvery goodâ â
effect against the variant. Finally the scientists are asked about the South African variant and whether it is more likely to cause serious illness. Dr Hopkins says it has ""similar transmissibility"" to the variant that was first found in Kent but there is not evidence it is causing more severe disease than other variants circulating in the UK. However, she adds that it has slightly
more mutations in the spike protein which is perhaps causing vaccines to have ""diminished effectiveness"" although they still work very well. She says the government wants to prevent viruses with mutations acquiring more mutations which is why breaking the chains of transmission for the South African variant is essential. Hancock adds that the UK's flu vaccination programme is upgraded every year to make sure it is as effective as possible against new variants. He says he hopes the government will be able to get the coronavirus jab to the same place and it will become ""something people have as standard"". Jonathan Walker from the Birmingham Mail and Newcastle Chronicle asks whether areas in the North of England that are rolling out the vaccine faster could have supplies cut to give more doses to other areas that have been slower. Hancock says the government is making sure the vaccine goes to all parts of the country ""on a fair basis according to need"" and insists every area is getting its fair share. He adds that there is a ""bumpy supply schedule for the whole country"" and if some days there are more vaccines given than others this is because of the supply available nationally. Jane Merrick from the i newspaper asks if the geographical spread of the South African variant suggests it is endemic and whether those who have already been jabbed will need a booster with a tweaked vaccine? She also wants to know if school playgrounds can be reopened sooner than 8 March given the health benefits to children. Hancock says the government has taken action regarding schools with a ""very heavy heart"" and these are the first measures ministers want to lift. But he says the virus is still widespread and there's a lot of work to do to get it under control"". Dr Hopkins says it's unlikely those who have already been jabbed will need to start again, even if the vaccine has to be tweaked in light of the South African variant. She says it's most likely a booster would be given. She stresses that cases of this strain found in the UK are not linked and that she's confident that measures in place will close down and eliminate transmission. Emily Morgan from ITV asks how confident the government is that it can contain the new variant. Hancock says the enhanced testing is aimed at stopping the spread of the variant altogether. ""But it is not straightforward - there may be further cases we don't know about yet,"" he warns. He says it is therefore ""vital people in those areas minimise all social contact and get a test when the opportunity arises"". Tom Magner from Carers' World asks what assurances the health secretary can give that unpaid carers will always be at the heart of the government's policy making, saying many don't feel truly recognised because they are only in band six of the vaccine prioritisation list. Hancock says he knows from his own family just how important unpaid carers
are and the government has ""looked very closely"" at where they are on the prioritisation list, which is drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advisory group. Prof Powis agrees that ""in the NHS we absolutely recognise the huge value that
unpaid carers bring to our patientsâ. He says the NHS is working its way through the vaccination programme according to the priority list set by the JCVI but as soon as the top four priority groups have had their jab it will immediately move âvery rapidly, as quickly as we can"" through the groups next on the list. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Ministers have, over the past few days, begun to
hint at sharing the UKâs vaccine supply with other countries in the future â
including both the EU and the developing world. Matt Hancock just repeated that
pledge, saying that the UK will play its part to ensure vaccines are available
around the globe. But there have been no specifics yet from ministers on the
questions that inevitably follow. Which countries, when and on what terms? The
government may argue itâs really still too soon to say. But if supplies do
continue to grow, as expected, and the country moves away from a just-in-time
supply chain here at home, the pressure to answer these questions will also
increase. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Military coup in Myanmar as Suu Kyi detainedThe army has seized power after alleging election fraud in the democratic vote held in November.,"This video can not be played Myanmar coup: What's happened so far? Myanmar's military has seized power after detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratically elected leaders. Troops are patrolling the streets and a night-time curfew is in force, with a one-year state of emergency declared. US President Joe Biden raised the threat of new sanctions, with the UN and UK also condemning the coup. The army alleges the recent landslide election win by Ms Suu Kyi's party was marred by fraud. She urged supporters to ""protest against the coup"". In a letter written in preparation for her impending detention, she said the military's actions would put the country back under a dictatorship. The military has already announced replacements for a number of ministers. Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? How the military disrupted the internet Who is the general behind the coup? On the streets of the main city, Yangon (Rangoon), people said they felt their hard-fought battle for democracy had been lost. One 25-year-old resident, who asked not to be named, told the BBC: ""Waking up to learn your world has been completely turned upside down overnight was not a new feeling, but a feeling that I thought that we had moved on from, and one that I never thought we'd be forced to feel again."" Myanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces from 1962 until 2011, when a new government began ushering in a return to civilian rule. Aung San Suu Kyi, seen here at a coronavirus vaccination clinic in January, is Myanmar's de facto leader She spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010. She was internationally hailed as a beacon of democracy and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi But her international reputation suffered severely following an army crackdown on the mostly Muslim Rohingya minority. Former supporters accused her of refusing to condemn the military or acknowledge accounts of atrocities. In the early hours of Monday, the army's TV station said power had been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Ms Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) were arrested in a series of raids. It is not clear where they are being held. No major violence has been reported. Soldiers blocked roads in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, and the main city, Yangon. International and domestic TV channels, including the state broadcaster, went off air.Internet and phone serviceswere disrupted. Banks said they had been forced to close. Later, the military announced that 24 ministers and deputies had been removed, and 11 replacements had been named, including in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs. A curfew is now reportedly in effect from 20:00 local time to 06:00 (13:30-23:30 GMT). Queues formed at ATMs in Yangon and other cities The military takeover follows weeks of tensions between the armed forces and the government followingparliamentary elections lost by the army-backed opposition. The opposition had demanded a re-run of the election, raising allegations of widespread fraud that were not backed by the electoral commission. So it is official. The armed forces in Myanmar have confirmed that they have carried out a coup d'etat, their first against a civilian government since 1962, and in apparent violation of the constitution which the military promised to honour as recently as last Saturday. The grievances which have been driving tension between the military and the government are well enough known. The military-backed party, the USDP, performed poorly in last November's general election, whereas the NLD did even better than in 2015. The timing of this coup is also easily explained. This week the first session of parliament since the election was due to start, which would have enshrined the election result by approving the next government. That will no longer happen. But the military's longer game plan is hard to fathom. What do they plan to do in the year they have given themselves to run the country? There will be public anger over a coup so soon after an election in which 70% of voters defied the Covid-19 pandemic to vote so overwhelmingly for Aung San Suu Kyi. Famously stubborn, she is unlikely to co-operate with a gun held to her head. Her ally, President Win Myint, is the only person authorised under the constitution to enact a state of emergency. He has been detained with her. For the moment the military's action appears reckless, and puts Myanmar on a perilous path. Michael Ghilezan, a partner of a US law firm who lives in Yangon, told the BBC he had expected military vehicles and protests in the city, but there was instead an eerie calm. ""The most common reaction from my Burmese friends has been anger. They feel deeply betrayed by the military and the USDP."" This was reflected in other comments from the streets, although there have been some supporters of the army out waving flags in Yangon. Theinny Oo, a development consultant, told Reuters: ""We had a lawful election. People voted for the one they preferred. We have no protection under the law now."" Many people feared giving their names. One 64-year-old resident of Hlaing township told AFP: ""I don't want the coup. I have seen many transitions in this country and I was looking forward to a better future."" Author and historian Thant Myint-U tweeted that a door had opened to a ""very different future"", and he feared for the millions who had been descending into poverty. Allow Twitter content?

Police probe striker's lockdown haircut photoNewcastle United star Joelinton shared a picture of himself in Tom Baxter's hair salon on Friday.Tyne & Wear,"Joelinton shared a picture of himself with Tom Baxter on Friday from what is believed to be a garage A barber who cut a footballer's hair in breach of lockdown had been warned by a council before about possible breaches. Tom Baxter, who was pictured in his North Shields garage with NUFC striker Joelinton, has accepted a prohibition notice from North Tyneside Council. Newcastle City Council said it had issued him with a warning in November and a prohibition notice in January for his Newcastle salon. Mr Baxter said he was unaware of the Newcastle issues and will appeal. A Newcastle City Council spokesman said: ""Following complaints about Mr Baxter still operating his High Heaton barbershop a week after national lockdown measures began in November 2020, we wrote to advise that the premises were not permitted to open. ""The letter warned that if Mr Baxter did not cease trading and comply with Covid restrictions designed to protect public health, a prohibition notice would be served."" The council previously said a second warning was issued in December, but it has now said that was incorrect. Mr Baxter said his salon was closed throughout November and he had installed numerous Covid measures when it reopened under tier three rules in December. Tom Baxter said he spent Â£20,000 making his salon Covid secure After the picture of Mr Baxter and Joelinton was shared online last week, North Tyneside Council said it would issue a prohibition notice of its own as it had ""received complaints about an individual operating a barber service"" from a property in the borough ""in contravention of Covid regulations"". Northumbria Police previously said it would contact the celebrity stylist and Joelinton and ""consider further action"". Newcastle United said it wouldtake ""appropriate action"", while Mr Baxtersaid on Saturday he ""shouldn't have done it"". Hair salons and barbers in England are currently closed under lockdown regulations. A police spokesman said: ""We are aware of a social media post involving a 24-year-old man and a 35-year-old man who may be in breach of coronavirus restrictions.

Putting the relegation issue to one side, he gets to work with Ancelotti and look how he has improved Calvert Lewin. I'm sure that was a huge factor given his Norwegian national team aspirations.

Here's a reminder of what he brings. This video can not be played Everton-bound Joshua King scores twice in the FA Cup for Bournemouth Fulham Fulham have signed former Sunderland forward Josh Maja on loan from French side Bordeaux. I did put three tweets of signings for Middlesbrough, Luton and Derby through there but my laptop booted me out. Will do a recap shortly. Half past 11 has just signalled a flurry of late moves in the Championship... #bbcfootball or text us on 81111 (UK only) CTxCB:I think Joshua King made the wrong move. At Everton, he'll likely become a depth option and sporadically play, whereas at Fulham, he likely would've been starting every game, and become the centre of attention if he was to keep them up. Daniel Cheng:I'm concerned with the lack of cover for Tierney at left back for Arsenal. Cedric can do a job but he ain't a proper LB and I'm sure Saka wants to play further forward. If KT gets injured for a long period we're in trouble. King can play wide of course which will suit Everton when they play 4-3-3. This time last year he was close to joining Manchester United of course, but he has failed to score in the Championship this season. With 48 Premier League goals to his name - the same as Freddie Ljungberg or Ian Rush - he's no slouch. #bbcfootball or text us on 81111 (UK only) Surely the better choice for Josh King would've been Fulham, more game time for the lad. However, Everton doing better at the minute so could prove to be a good deal but just can't see him getting into that team. Toby Can't help thinking Saints missed a trick in not getting in Jon Joe Kenny. Decent player, Premier League experience, straight in to fill the void with Kyle Walker-Peters out injured. Celtic's gain I reckon, shrewd Lenny. Minamino? Sooner have Mane back please? Phil, Saints fan in Glasgow For a lot of clubs in the Football League especially, just staying in business is the name of the game this season. Ian DennisBBC Radio 5 Live senior football reporter Itâs been
the quietest window since 2012 â that was the last time you had under Â£100

has impacted in more ways than one, the
most obvious being the way that the clubs have been hit so hard financially. Shrewd move? Ian DennisBBC Radio 5 Live senior football reporter Josh King has opted for Everton ahead of Fulham.

Silver surges as speculators focus on commodities,"Silver prices have hit an a eight-year high after calls to buy the metal on social media sparked a trading frenzy. It comes a week after amateur investors piled into shares in the games retailer GameStop, causing them to jump 700%. On Monday silver rose by as much as 11% to $30 an ounce, while shares in some mining firms were up as much as 60%. Small time traders swapping tips on Reddit are thought to be behind the trend, as they seek to drive prices up. However, some users of the site dispute this, alleging the ""Silver Squeeze"" is secretly being coordinated by big Wall Street firms. It is the latest example of apparently small-time traders taking on big Wall Street hedge funds that hope to profit when the price of an asset or stock falls, but could lose heavily if it rises. Tips posted on social media sites like Reddit say these so called ""short sellers"" are manipulating the markets. And so the amateurs buy up the stocks or assets, driving up the price and inflicting losses on the big players. UK trading platform IG stops new GameStop trades GameStop: Who is winning the market battle? Global watchdogs on alert as GameStop frenzy grows It began in January when amateurs piled into loss-making retailer GameStop and other companies such as AMC and Blackberry. GameStop shares, which were trading at less than $20 (Â£14.61) each at the start of January, shot to nearly $350 last week. They fell 30% on Monday to $225. Now the battle appears to have moved on to silver - a far bigger market. The price of silver slid from its early highs on Monday. But the metal is up by almost 20% since Wednesday, when messages began circulating on Reddit forums, encouraging users to buy the metal. Coin-selling websites say they are now seeing unprecedented demand and delays in delivering silver. Reflecting the attitude of many of those swapping tips on the site, one user called RocketBoomGo urged fellow traders to ""think about the Gainz"" in a widely circulated post. ""If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP Morgan you'd be destroying along the way,"" they added. Amateur investors caused shares in GameStop to surge more than 700% last week However, some on Reddit expressed scepticism, with one saying they had analysed comments and posts on the thread Wall Street Silver and found that 80% ""came from accounts mostly created in the last 2 days. Pretty suspect.. who do these people really work for?!"" GameStop - a political fable Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said that amateur investors would find it much harder to influence the price of silver than they did with GameStop. For one thing, the total value of silver being traded is about $1.4-$1.6 trillion, he said, which is 1,000 times the total value of GameStop's share capital before it became the target of speculation. A large proportion of the silver market also exists ""off-exchange"", meaning it can't be bought and sold as easily online. The army of small investors will have enlisted for different reasons. Some will hope to profit from getting in early and starting a wave of others doing the same, ride it for a bit before getting off the wave and letting it crash after they've taken their profits. Others will see something going up and think the sky's the limit to this - still plenty of time for me to profit too. And others will think - I don't really care if I lose a few bucks, sticking it to the man is the name of the game. The first group will have made money and indeed may be being infiltrated right now by the very professionals they hoped to beat. The second group will end up poorer and unhappy about it. The third may end up poorer but don't care - they have made a telling political point. Read more here. This video can not be played WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop? ""Retail traders who are just following the herd and join the party late may accumulate huge losses and need to be more rational in their decisions,"" Mr Sayed added. GameStop investors have already got a taste of those risks. Shares in the company have fallen since last week, when the frenzy caught regulatory attention and trading platforms imposed restrictions on shares in GameStop and some other companies. That decision sparked anger among amateur traders, who say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. Several prominent US politicians and the billionaire Elon Musk have voiced their support. The moves also convinced some online traders to dig in their heels, like Paul Grainger of Liverpool, a project manager at a telecommunications firm. He added shares in GameStop to his investments after seeing online hype that persuaded him the price would rise. Now he's holding on, partly to send a message to the hedge fund giants. ""At first, I was in it like probably most people were were at the beginning, just to try to make a little bit of money on it,"" he said. ""But now... I'm out of principle holding the stock. ""I think it's wrong what they're doing and the fact that they've changed the rules of the game now that the little man's getting an advantage."" Mr Grainger said he's ready to risk his holdings, which are a small part of his portfolio, and hopeful that if many people act similarly, those betting against the company will be the ones hit with losses. But he said he's not expecting there to be too many similar opportunities - in silver or elsewhere - in the future. ""Now that we've taken advantage of it, I don't think that the market will allow this to happen again,"" he said. ""I think this is kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity and I'm hoping it will make those big companies change the way they operate so this kind of thing can't happen again."" Despite what some retail traders hoped, some of the biggest profiteers from last week's market action were said to be Wall Street giants such as asset manager BlackRock and the private equity firm Silver Lake. However, other big investors have been hammered by the trading frenzy. Hedge fund Melvin Capital - which bet heavily that shares in GameStop would fall - lost 53% of its value towards the end of January, according to media reports. The firm has since received commitments for fresh cash from investors, leaving it with around $8bn (Â£5.8bn) in assets, but that is still down from $12.5bn at the beginning of 2021, according to Reuters.

Nintendo Switch sales surge past those of the 3DSThe Japanese firm's latest console has sold about four million more units than its predecessor.Technology,"Nintendo has sold about four million more Switch consoles than those of its 3DS Sales of Nintendo's Switch gaming consoles have surpassed those of their predecessor - the 3DS - despite being available for a much shorter period. The firm said 79.87 million units had been sold since its March 2017 launch. The figures accompanied the Japanese firm's financial results,external, which saw it declare a record 377bn yen ($3.6bn) profit for the April-December period. Analysts attribute the Switch's success to the popularity of Animal Crossing, among other family-friendly exclusives. Super Mario 3D World - which goes on sale on 12 February - is expected to provide it with a further boost. Nintendo ended production ofits 3DS handheld in September 2020and says it sold 75.94 million units over its nine-and-a-half year lifetime. Up to four players can take part in the forthcoming Super Mario title The Switch first went on sale in 2017, and was joined by a lower-cost model - the Switch Lite - in 2019, which is also included in the tally. The firm saiddemand for the machines was 35.8% up on the same period,externalthe previous year, with a total of 24.1 million units sold over the last nine months of 2020. Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa said that the company had sufficient components to continue producing the devices - despite wider industry shortages - and it now expected to sell 26.5 million of the consoles over the financial year as a whole. That represents 10% more than its previous guidance. He added that there were no plans to launch a successor in the near term. However, there is continued speculation the company will unveil a ""pro"" version of the Switch before the end of 2021. ""The sales success of the Switch justifies Nintendo's decision to stick with its product strategy of combining unique and innovative dedicated games hardware with compelling first-party games,"" Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere Analysis told the BBC. ""Sometimes this approach misses the mark - see the Wii U for example - but when it works it tends to result in very successful products. ""Clearly the stand out hit is the 30-million-selling Animal Crossing: New Horizons, a gentle, sociable game that will be synonymous with lockdown for many people."" Animal Crossing: New Horizons has provided a distraction from the Covid pandemic for its millions of players Despite the Switch's success, it still has some way to go before overtaking sales of four of the firm's other consoles: Wii - 101.63 million units Nintendo DS - 154.02 million units Game Boy Advance - 81.51 million units Game Boy - 118.69 million units If ever it was needed, the Nintendo Switch is proof that you don't need the highest-resolution graphics or fastest processor to make great games. Sometimes people just want a cute, relaxing experience - and to be several thousand bells in debt to an entrepreneurial Japanese raccoon dog. Animal Crossing has always been a best-seller for Nintendo's consoles, but New Horizons has surpassed expectations, shifting about 31 million copies. Its blend of relaxing island life and home decoration have provided some much-needed escapism during the coronavirus pandemic. Its social features also helped friends connect, chat and visit one another's homes - at least virtually - during lockdown restrictions. Critics say New Horizons is not that dissimilar from previous games in the series. Indeed, some of the best-selling games for the Switch - such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - are pretty much re-releases from the flop Wii U console. But Nintendo seems to have found a winning formula with the Switch that shows no signs of slowing down.

"Lost school time 'may cost pupils Â£40,000'Institute for Fiscal Studies warns the ""long-run costs"" of the pandemic will hit children disproportionately.Family & EducationComments","Pupils in the UK could stand to lose an average of Â£40,000 each in lifetime earnings from lost time in school because of Covid, a report suggests. Any effects are likely to be concentrated among children from disadvantaged backgrounds, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Parent groups say the four UK nations must ""do more... to avoid a generation of children being left behind"". The IFS says the Â£1.5bn invested so far in ""catch up"" services is not enough. The leading economic research group said ""there is much that is good"" with the plans to help pupils being put in place across the UK but the funding allocated to date was ""tiny in comparison with the scale of problem"". UK schools are currently closed to pupils other than children of key workers and those classified as vulnerable in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus. By mid-February, children will have lost half an academic year - as much as 5% of their school career - in learning time. The IFS says its report contains an ""illustration, rather than a precise prediction"" of what could happen. But it suggests that despite remote learning, some children may leave school with fewer or poorer qualifications. The IFS says the reduction in face-to-face teaching could potentially result in a total of Â£350bn in lost lifetime earnings for the UK's 8.7m schoolchildren, adding this would hit future tax revenues. The institute refers to findings by the World Bank that a year of schooling increases an individual's earnings by an average of 8% a year in an advanced economy such as the UK. For anyone earning the average yearly wage in the UK, the IFS estimates, this would translate to a potential Â£40,000 loss in income across a lifetime, leading it to warn that ""the long-run costs of the pandemic will fall disproportionately on today's children"". The IFS says even if ""much weaker assumptions"" are made, there could still be Â£90bn in lost lifetime earnings. When will schools reopen? English schools could return 8 March 'at the earliest' - PM Shut schools 'like systematic neglect' to disadvantaged pupils Schools in England and Northern Ireland will remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March. In Wales, some primary-school children may start to return after the half-term break, while the Scottish government has ruled out a mid-February reopening. The Department for Education haspledged an extra Â£300min the next financial year for catch-up services in England, in addition to its existing funding allocation of Â£1bn. A DfE spokesperson said ""the prime minister was clear last week that extended schools closures have had a huge impact on pupils learning, which will take more than a year to make up. ""The government will work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long term plan to make sure pupils have the chance to make up their learning over the course of this parliament."" The National Tutoring Programme helped almost 70,000 children in England during the autumn term and will benefit from a portion of the additional government funding to assist disadvantaged pupils. Comfort Oghenesuvwe, a single mother of two boys, who lives in Kent, told BBC News: ""If something is not done to help my boys catch up when things return to normal, I worry for their future."" Both of Ms Oghenesuvwe's children - Jason, 11, and Jeffrey, 10 - have learnt from home during England's first and third nationwide lockdowns. ""Jason has been particularly affected as he has additional learning needs and would normally require a teacher to come to his table to double-check he understands everything, but that's not possible over Zoom. ""Back in April, we only had one laptop before we bought an extra one and Jason's learning had to be prioritised, so Jeffrey had to sit and colour, or just read a book at times. ""I've definitely seen Jeffrey's momentum for wanting to learn and read, which he used to enjoy, drop off as a result."" Schools in all four home nations are currently closed to most pupils ""What's going to come out of this experience is an entire patchwork of new inequalities layered on old inequalities,"" said Luke Sibieta, the IFS researcher behind the report. Younger children from disadvantaged families, who may have not had access to the right equipment for remote learning, will feel the impact most, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""They were probably the furthest behind to begin with,"" he said. The government's plan for a ""catch-up"" service will ""cushion"" the impact, he said, ""however it just doesn't match up to the scale of the problem"". ""The scale of the policy response needs to be larger than it is at the moment."" The IFS estimates that half a year of schools spending is more than Â£30bn across the UK and says ""correcting a loss on this scale certainly requires a massive injection of resources"". John Jolly, chief executive of charity Parentkind, told BBC News: ""The government must do more and invest more to close the educational divide and to avoid a generation of children being left behind."" James Turner, chief executive of the Sutton Trust educational charity, echoed the IFS call for extra funding. He said: ""It is absolutely crucial that this is targeted towards disadvantaged pupils who have been the worst-hit by the pandemic. ""As a start, the pupil premium should be boosted this year to help schools catch up, through allocating an additional Â£400 to every low-income student."" The IFS report outlines options including extending the school year, lengthening the school day, mass repetition of entire school years, or summer schools to help children catch up. Ms Oghenesuvwe said she would be open to these options for her children but said she worried about burnout among teachers.

'Losing my dad to depression was so hard',"Terry Davies (left) took his own life in 2018 despite seeking help for his depression A man whose father took his own life is calling for more mental health support amid fears more people are struggling because of Covid restrictions. Dion Davies' father Terry took his own life in 2018. Suicide rates in England and Wales remain at a 20-year high with fears lockdowns are increasing known risk factors like loneliness. Official figures show more people have reported symptoms of depression since the pandemic began. Moderate to severe depressive symptoms are estimated to have almost tripled for 16 to 39 year olds. Mr Davies, 21, who lives in Aberystwyth and has raised money for mental health charities, has called for more help to be made available to those having suicidal thoughts. ""I think losing anyone you love is the hardest thing any person can go through,"" he said. ""Me and my dad were close and I considered him the person I loved the most. He was my everything. ""He was and is the person I look up to. He was so funny and inspiring to me and still is. ""The world was a better place with him in it."" Mr Davies said his father, who worked as a map conservationist at the National Library of Wales, had been getting help for his depression from mental health charities and his GP. Mr Davies said although there had been improvements to suicide prevention since his father's death, more was still needed. ""I don't think there will ever be enough done, there will always be people who fall through the cracks no matter how much of a support system you set up,"" he said. Experts fear suicide risk factors such as loneliness and depression will be made worse as the UK is plunged into continued lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic. How can I overcome my anxiety? Coronavirus: How to protect your mental health Can nature help improve our mood during lockdown? Prof Ann John, who advises the Welsh Government on its suicide prevention strategy, warned suicide risk factors were likely to be increased. ""Tackling known risk factors that are likely to be exacerbated by the pandemic is crucial,"" she said. ""These include depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, hopelessness, feelings of entrapment and burdensomeness, substance misuse, loneliness, domestic violence, child neglect or abuse, unemployment, and other financial insecurity."" In 2019, three-quarters of those who took their own lives in England and Wales - a total of 4,303 - were men. This was the highest figure since 1981 and highest rate - 17 per 100,000 - since 2000. Males made up for three-quarters of suicides in in England and Wales in 2019 Since the start of the pandemic, which has contributed to the deaths of more than two million people worldwide, measures have been implemented which have forced people to remain in their homes and limit social connections. In June 2020, nearly one in five adults was likely to be experiencing some form of depression during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The numbers of people reporting moderate to severe symptoms of depression has doubled since the start of the pandemic. Simon Jones, from mental health support charity Mind Cymru, said: ""These are challenging times for us all, especially when restrictions are put in place which might prevent us being able to do the things that normally help us stay well, like seeing loved ones. ""But there are self-care techniques which can help improve your wellbeing and even prevent mental health problems developing or worsening, alongside help and support that can be accessed through mental health services."" Mr Jones highlighted connecting with others electronically, through services like Zoom and Skype, as a good coping method along with the importance of getting enough sleep. ""Mental health and sleep are closely linked - having poor mental health can affect your sleep, and not sleeping well can affect your mental health. ""We also know that having sleep problems can affect your mental health by causing feelings of anxiety and depression or affecting your ability to concentrate, for example.""

Airbus staff vote on work-hours cut to save jobs,"The Broughton site employs about 6,000 people Airbus workers in Flintshire have voted to reduce their working week by up to 10% in a bid to save jobs. The proposal came after the firm announced last year it was looking toshed 1,435 postsat its Broughton plant. A ballot of up to 3,500 members of the Unite union was carried out at the site, which employs 6,000. Airbus said it was delighted members had supported the proposal which was ""rooted in helping save jobs"". The Unite union said voting in favour of the change had removed the possibility of compulsory redundancies. It is understood many workers have opted for schemes including voluntary redundancies, but between 350 and 400 posts are still under threat. Broughton head of plant Jerome Blandin said: ""The shorter working week increases our flexibility and will help us manage the downturn in demand we are facing. ""We look forward to continuing to work in partnership with the trade union on the implementation of the new working arrangements at the appropriate time."" Unite said members had voted ""overwhelmingly in favour"" of the plan. Regional secretary Peter Hughes said: ""Whilst it is not ideal that our members have had to commit to a shorter working week, this decision should be viewed against the background of an unprecedented crisis in global aviation. ""This solution to the crisis faced by Airbus is one that could be deployed to other manufacturing sites across Wales in order to avoid large scale redundancies. These unprecedented times require creative solutions."" The vote means workers will see a reduction in working hours of between 5% and 10% each week. Union sources previously said Airbus would make up a third of the shortfall in salaries, although workers would lose about 6.6% of their pay. The 12-month arrangement would be implemented when the UK government furlough scheme comes to an end. In April, 3,200 staff were placed on the furlough scheme. Daz Reynolds, Unite convenor at Airbus, said: ""Coronavirus has been devastating for the aerospace sector and the past year has been extremely difficult for the site. ""After losing almost 1,000 jobs through voluntary redundancy today's result is extremely welcome for all our members."" This is the first time in Wales we have seen employees from a large company vote to take a pay cut to save their jobs. The fact that the vote was overwhelming is a clear illustration of how anxious they are, not just about the immediate impact of the pandemic, but about the long-term future of the massive plant. It sends a very clear message to Airbus executives at the company's headquarters in France that its Welsh workforce will work with them to continue to make the wings factory a success. It also is evidence that the shop floor workers and the company are working together. The pandemic has hit a severe blow to the whole airline industry at a time when development was beginning into the company's next model. To work on the new design of plane, Broughton will have to fight off competition from other plants in other countries. More than 80% of the Unite members at the plant voted and 75% of them supported the pay cut. It means a 10% cut in working hours and a 6.6% cut in pay until Christmas and a 5% cut after that. This might not be the only Welsh workforce to vote for a pay cut in 2021.

"Shut schools 'may cost pupils Â£40,000 over career'A research group warns the ""long-run costs"" of the pandemic will hit children disproportionately.","Pupils in the UK could stand to lose an average of Â£40,000 each in lifetime earnings from lost time in school because of Covid, a report suggests. Any effects are likely to be concentrated among children from disadvantaged backgrounds, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Parent groups say the four UK nations must ""do more... to avoid a generation of children being left behind"". The IFS says the Â£1.5bn invested so far in ""catch up"" services is not enough. The leading economic research group said ""there is much that is good"" with the plans to help pupils being put in place across the UK but the funding allocated to date was ""tiny in comparison with the scale of problem"". UK schools are currently closed to pupils other than children of key workers and those classified as vulnerable in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus. By mid-February, children will have lost half an academic year - as much as 5% of their school career - in learning time. The IFS says its report contains an ""illustration, rather than a precise prediction"" of what could happen. But it suggests that despite remote learning, some children may leave school with fewer or poorer qualifications. The IFS says the reduction in face-to-face teaching could potentially result in a total of Â£350bn in lost lifetime earnings for the UK's 8.7m schoolchildren, adding this would hit future tax revenues. The institute refers to findings by the World Bank that a year of schooling increases an individual's earnings by an average of 8% a year in an advanced economy such as the UK. For anyone earning the average yearly wage in the UK, the IFS estimates, this would translate to a potential Â£40,000 loss in income across a lifetime, leading it to warn that ""the long-run costs of the pandemic will fall disproportionately on today's children"". The IFS says even if ""much weaker assumptions"" are made, there could still be Â£90bn in lost lifetime earnings. When will schools reopen? English schools could return 8 March 'at the earliest' - PM Shut schools 'like systematic neglect' to disadvantaged pupils Schools in England and Northern Ireland will remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March. In Wales, some primary-school children may start to return after the half-term break, while the Scottish government has ruled out a mid-February reopening. The Department for Education haspledged an extra Â£300min the next financial year for catch-up services in England, in addition to its existing funding allocation of Â£1bn. A DfE spokesperson said ""the prime minister was clear last week that extended schools closures have had a huge impact on pupils learning, which will take more than a year to make up. ""The government will work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long term plan to make sure pupils have the chance to make up their learning over the course of this parliament."" The National Tutoring Programme helped almost 70,000 children in England during the autumn term and will benefit from a portion of the additional government funding to assist disadvantaged pupils. Comfort Oghenesuvwe, a single mother of two boys, who lives in Kent, told BBC News: ""If something is not done to help my boys catch up when things return to normal, I worry for their future."" Both of Ms Oghenesuvwe's children - Jason, 11, and Jeffrey, 10 - have learnt from home during England's first and third nationwide lockdowns. ""Jason has been particularly affected as he has additional learning needs and would normally require a teacher to come to his table to double-check he understands everything, but that's not possible over Zoom. ""Back in April, we only had one laptop before we bought an extra one and Jason's learning had to be prioritised, so Jeffrey had to sit and colour, or just read a book at times. ""I've definitely seen Jeffrey's momentum for wanting to learn and read, which he used to enjoy, drop off as a result."" Schools in all four home nations are currently closed to most pupils ""What's going to come out of this experience is an entire patchwork of new inequalities layered on old inequalities,"" said Luke Sibieta, the IFS researcher behind the report. Younger children from disadvantaged families, who may have not had access to the right equipment for remote learning, will feel the impact most, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""They were probably the furthest behind to begin with,"" he said. The government's plan for a ""catch-up"" service will ""cushion"" the impact, he said, ""however it just doesn't match up to the scale of the problem"". ""The scale of the policy response needs to be larger than it is at the moment."" The IFS estimates that half a year of schools spending is more than Â£30bn across the UK and says ""correcting a loss on this scale certainly requires a massive injection of resources"". John Jolly, chief executive of charity Parentkind, told BBC News: ""The government must do more and invest more to close the educational divide and to avoid a generation of children being left behind."" James Turner, chief executive of the Sutton Trust educational charity, echoed the IFS call for extra funding. He said: ""It is absolutely crucial that this is targeted towards disadvantaged pupils who have been the worst-hit by the pandemic. ""As a start, the pupil premium should be boosted this year to help schools catch up, through allocating an additional Â£400 to every low-income student."" The IFS report outlines options including extending the school year, lengthening the school day, mass repetition of entire school years, or summer schools to help children catch up. Ms Oghenesuvwe said she would be open to these options for her children but said she worried about burnout among teachers.

Manchester attack: The ordinary people who helped save lives,"When a bomb went off at Manchester Arena, a number of ordinary people made the decision not to run away from the horror, but to stay to help the injured and dying. Survivors say the contribution of these people was crucial, yet feel their role has so far been almost entirely overlooked in the official version of events. As the inquiry begins to hear evidence about the emergency response, we spoke to some of those people. Here are their extraordinary stories. During lockdown, like everyone else, Kim Dick and Freya Lewis have had to make do with online video calls to stay in touch. But they're still determined to catch up when they can. Their chats are full of fun - gossip about the soaps, music, and their pets. It's clear they share a special bond. You'd never know that Kim and Freya, 18, were strangers until a few years ago, brought together at the worst time of their lives. Their worlds collided on 22 May 2017 when a bomb exploded at Manchester Arena. Kim, 57, and her husband Phil were in the arena foyer to collect their daughter and granddaughter from an Ariana Grande concert when the blast blew Kim off her feet. As she steadied herself and tried to focus through the smoke and debris, a small girl staggered towards her, and collapsed in her arms. It was Freya. Kim didn't know the then-14-year-old, and didn't have time to think. ""This little girl just appeared,"" Kim recalls. ""There was blood coming out of her mouth, and I thought 'oh my God I've got to look after her. I've got to get her out of here'."" Kim managed to drag Freya towards the door of the foyer and lean her up against a wall. She knew she had to keep her upright to prevent her from choking on the blood which was still pouring out of her mouth. Freya kept sliding down and closing her eyes as Kim strained to hold her up, talking to her non-stop to keep her conscious. ""I said 'OK darling, you're going to be OK'. Just repeating and repeating it the whole time. That's what I thought, after watching (medical dramas) on TV. You've got to keep them awake, keep them alert. Don't let them go to sleep."" As Kim tried to keep the teenager upright, Phil used his car keys to try to cut away plastic from Freya's merchandise bag which had melted into her hair and skin. Freya was left with 29 separate injuries including two broken legs, a broken arm, severe burns, and a shattered mouth. And she was not the only one who needed Kim and Phil's help. A second young girl, Aliya, appeared, in pain and crying, with awful injuries to her leg. All Kim could do was tell her to sit down with them and try to keep both children awake and talking. ""At the time I felt really helpless,"" Kim says. ""These girls were bleedingâ¦ and we needed the help. We needed the paramedics then."" Kim remembers the sounds of the foyer. The loudspeaker was blaring. She could hear sirens outside, and assumed help would come quickly. But they waited and waited. ""There was screaming, then crying and as time went on the screaming got less and less. The crying was less and less and then it was just total silence. And you knew that people had died."" Kim believes she sat propping Freya up for more than an hour, becoming increasingly desperate for help. ""I was shouting out 'Help! We need help!â¦ And I was shouting out to nobody."" With no stretcher available, they had to lift Freya onto a table from one of the merchandise stands, and carry her down the stairs to the station concourse. Throughout this time, Freya's dad Nick was frantically searching for her. Kim and Phil managed to get Freya's home phone number from her, and spoke to her mum who was desperately waiting for news. Nick then called the couple and with the help of two police officers, was guided through the security cordon. As father and daughter were reunited, Kim and Phil slipped away. Kim says she still feels guilty for leaving. ""There were people on the floor everywhere,"" she says. It was after 1am when the two girls were taken to hospital, Freya by ambulance, Aliya in a minibus driven by someone who volunteered to help. Freya was put into an induced coma and underwent many hours of surgery. When she came round, she asked her parents about Kim and Phil. ""I remembered them straight away,"" she says. ""I wanted to know how they were."" Two weeks later she got her answer when they visited the hospital and the two families forged a bond they still share. ""Kim and Phil saved my life,"" Freya says. ""On that night, nobody else seemed to help me. And I just saw Kim, with her arms wide open, and she took care of me straight away. Without thinking I basically collapsed onto her. And she and Phil looked after me and kept me alive. ""She kept my eyes open. She kept me breathing. She kept me as calm as I possibly could be."" After multiple operations and a long rehabilitation, Freya has made an amazing recovery, and is now applying to drama school, with dreams of becoming an actress. ""They acted as my parents when my parents couldn't,"" she adds. ""And for the rest of my life, I'll always be eternally grateful to them. They're just amazing."" Daren Buckley is a changed man after what happened at the arena. Physically, the difference is shocking; he's lost nearly four stone in weight and the stress has led him to grind most of his teeth away. The night terrors and flashbacks have stayed with him. In the weeks after the attack he would wake up covered in sweat, having dreamt of people dying in front of him. He has struggled to come to terms with the lack of official recognition for people who helped, and says he feels completely forgotten. ""How can you run into a bomb and get told you don't matter?"" he says, angrily. ""I feel like anybody on the professional side of things has been acknowledged, even the police sniffer dog got an award. To me it is all wrong, the system and how it has worked."" Daren was at the concert with his disabled son Lewis, the pair just about to walk through the doors to the foyer when the bomb went off. He says he knew immediately it was a suicide bombing and remembers running towards the blast pulling Ariana Grande t-shirts off the merchandise stand and throwing them to people to use as bandages. ""We had t-shirts to save lives. We had nothing else."" At one point he asked someone if he could get into a first aid room for extra gloves and bandages, but says he was told all the doors had been locked. As time ticked on and no more help was coming, Daren helped to carry the injured out of the foyer and down into Victoria Station, where the medical teams were waiting. Manchester attack: Who were the victims? The families searching for answers Youngest victim 'could have survived with better first aid' Daren has struggled with PTSD ever since the attack. ""It's like it's stamped on my brain and I'm thinking how can I get it out?"" he says. ""In my dreams I've seen myself dead. I've seen things moving on the floor that shouldn't be. Nobody can see the injuries on me because physically I don't have them, but mentally, I've got hundreds. How do you move forward when you're in that rut of thinking is it going to happen again?"" For Daren, there have been some very low points. But he says the support from the community of survivors has been life-saving for him, as well as the Manchester Survivors Choir. ""All I've ever wanted to do was sing,"" he says. ""I'd be lost without music, it keeps you going."" Rob Grew was in a shop when he heard a loud boom and screams coming from the station. Thinking a train had crashed, he started to run towards the noise, never expecting what would happen over the next six hours. He reached the foyer within five minutes of the bomb going off. ""It took me a minute or two to decide what to do,"" he says. ""Whether to run back out for my own safety, or go in."" But the sight of a mother and child on the floor screaming for help stopped him from leaving. ""That thought went out of my head and I went straight to them, to comfort them."" The girl had multiple shrapnel wounds to her legs, while the mum had a bolt that had gone through her cheek. ""She asked me if I could go and look for her sister in the centre of the foyer which I didâ¦ It was just chaos. There were people everywhere on the floor."" He pauses before recalling: ""You look at those who are just lying there, bleeding out, and you have no idea what to do at all. So many injuries you've no idea where to start."" Rob did have some first aid training, and as an adventure sports photographer, had some experience of having to stay calm in dangerous situations. But it was nowhere near the level needed to deal with the scale of what he was faced with. ""It was just autopilot really,"" he says. ""Where do you start with someone who has multiple holes in their torso and legs? I think the only thing I remembered was compression - try and stop the bleeding - and CPR. There were that many people screaming out for help, you've just got to try and cover as many people as you can."" As the minutes ticked by, and despite the reassurances he was giving to the injured, it dawned on Rob and others inside the foyer that no more help was coming in. The focus shifted from tourniquets and bandaging, to getting people out on makeshift stretchers made out of dismantled tables and T-shirt stands. ""I kept trying to reassure people 'don't worry they'll be a few minutes, there's people just outside'. And I kept on saying that for 40 minutes."" He says he could see the flashing lights of ambulances down by the railway station but no-one coming up the steps to help, which meant carrying people down three flights of stairs. Rob still doesn't know what happened to some of the people he tried to help - whether they lived or died. But there are some who stick out: a woman who passed away next to him as he attended to someone else; two elderly sisters with severe injuries who told him 'don't worry, we're two quite gritty individuals' as he apologised for leaving them and moving on to someone else; and a trainee nurse in a stripy dress who came back after taking her children to safety, and who he says definitely saved lives. The judgements he made on the night have stayed with him. ""I think I put pressure on myself wishing I could have done more to help."" There are some who Rob has since been able to identify, like Robby Potter, who he helped carry out of the arena and down to the station. ""I found Robby on his back on the bridge to the foyer and he was pretty much unconscious. ""There was a member of the train staff there, knelt beside him, I came back every so often, to see if he was still with us. ""We went and got a table from the T-shirt stand and lifted Robby onto it, with maybe four of us. Robby's a big guy so we struggled to carry him down. That's all I heard of him for a good six weeks or more; I didn't know whether he was alive or dead."" Rob says there was never enough medical help inside the foyer. His focus was on getting people out, and getting them to where help was waiting. A number of times he was mistaken for a doctor, and had to say that he was not qualified to give morphine injections. After the last injured person had been loaded into an ambulance, Rob finally left and walked home covered in blood and still wearing a pair of medical gloves. ""I just walked back to my apartment, got a shower, put all my clothes in a big bag because I wasn't sure if the police would need them. I just chucked them away in the end, they never asked for them."" He says he remembers thinking ""how the hell have I walked out of such a crazy thing and just been left? I wasn't spoken to by the police until something like the September"". Rob has never had counselling. Adventure sports became his therapy. He went abroad shortly afterwards, then spent some time climbing mountains in Wales, trying to come to terms with what had happened. For a good period of time he says, he replayed the night over and over again in his head, trying to figure out what he could have done better. He re-took his first aid course and, while doing CPR training, kept seeing the faces of the injured and dying. Overall, he has tried to take something positive from it. ""Because you've experienced such shock now you can probably deal with situations better so I like to think next time I'll be one of those people who can help a bit betterâ¦ I wish I could have done more still."" Sean Gardner didn't think he'd be at Manchester Arena for long. He was late to pick up his daughter Hannah from the concert, and thought he'd try to park as close as possible. He screeched into a space in the underground car park, and told his other daughter Charlotte to wait while he ran upstairs to collect her sister. Before Sean could reach the foyer, the bomb went off. ""It was pretty obvious to me what had happened. And then of course, people just came running. And I guess I had a choice at that point."" Instead of turning around, Sean ran against the flow of the crowd. He'd arranged to meet Hannah in the foyer, and he charged towards it, terrified she'd been hurt. But she wasn't there, and he hoped that meant she was safe. While racing back to his car to reassure his other daughter a woman pleaded with him to stop and help her. She was unharmed, but her friend Jane Tweddle was badly injured. ""They just needed help. It was as black and white as thatâ¦ I just felt obliged. It's just human nature."" Sean says he quickly realised Jane's injuries were far beyond anything he knew how to treat. ""It wasn't enough, but all I did was stay with her and comfort her. And that's all I could do. But it was in the expectation that somebody would be there within minutes."" He says he kept looking towards the doors, thinking he'd see people in uniforms coming through with stretchers. ""I held her hand, and she knew somebody was next to her I suppose. That was the main thing. I told her 'Just hang on in there. It won't be long, they'll be with us'."" He believes it was about 20 minutes before a British Transport Police officer came running past him and he begged her to help while he went to reassure daughter Charlotte about what was happening. Waiting in the car she'd become hysterical, not knowing what had happened. ""She tried to come upstairs and they wouldn't let her. Somebody told her that people were dead. She didn't know about me. She didn't know about her sisterâ¦ she thought we were injured at best."" Sean told Charlotte he thought Hannah was safe, although he hadn't found her. But he felt he needed to go back to continue looking after Jane. ""Charlotte was really brave. And I said, 'I will be back. But you have to stay here because you're safest here. And once we get Jane sorted out, we can go and find Hannah'."" He returned to Jane's side and waited until more police officers arrived. They made efforts to resuscitate the mother of three. But Jane didn't survive and died with her friend by her side. He spent the next two hours trying to reunite himself with both of his daughters. Hannah had ended up in a nearby hotel, while Charlotte had been brought out of the car park by a police officer as it was being cordoned off. Three years on, his family are still living with the haunting memories of the night. Sean has suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and says he's struggled with a range of emotions. ""It troubles me as to whether I could have done something different. Whether had [the emergency services] been there sooner, the outcome would have been better. ""It troubles me that my daughters had to wait such a long period of time, Charlotte, in particular, to know exactly what was going on. For her, that's so traumatic."" Asked if he feels like a hero, Shaun looks awkward. ""No. I don't like labels."" He says he stayed with Jane because he would ""hope somebody would do that for me in those circumstances"". ""I think it's just humanity to be honest with you. There's probably not enough of it, but I was always brought up that way. I know I'd never do anything different."" For survivor Martin Hibbert, the lack of official recognition for the ordinary people who chose to help has been a source of increasing frustration and anger. Not least because he feels their accounts are crucial to piecing together the facts about how the emergency response played out. Martin remembers little from the hours immediately after the bomb, and it's no wonder; he was hit by 22 separate pieces of shrapnel, including a bolt in his neck which severed an artery, and one in his back which has paralysed him from the waist down. His only thought was for his teenage daughter, who was also severely injured and lying next to him on the foyer floor. ""I knew that I probably wasn't going to make it,"" he says. ""I was striving to stay alive really to make sure she got out. When I saw her being carted off, that's when the curtains came down."" In the three years since, Martin has attempted to piece together the details of what happened to him and his now 18-year-old daughter, but he says it hasn't been easy. He feels that many details in the official reports into the aftermath of the bombing do not tally with the eyewitness accounts of those who were there. He and others have now formed a network of survivors who can speak with a common voice; but because their bid to play a formal role in the public inquiry has been denied and they don't have access to all the evidence, Martin says many gaps still remain. Only since the inquiry started has he discovered he arrived at Salford Royal hospital at 1:45am; more than three hours after the explosion, but only a 15 minute drive from the arena. The inquiry has been told all the injured had been moved out of the foyer by 11:40pm - an hour after the blast. ""So what happened to me for two hours after that?"" he says. He can only assume he was lying on the station concourse. When he did finally arrive at hospital, he was given 14 pints of blood. For Martin, proper recognition of the bravery of these members of the public is long overdue and he says, their voices need to be heard. ""As everybody ran out, they ran in. ""Police, fire and ambulance, they are trained for that, but people like Daren Buckley and Rob Grew aren't. For a member of the public to have that instinct, it takes a very special person to do that."" He says for the world not to know about what these people did ""just feels wrong"". ""They don't want a Queen's honour, or a medal, or a pin badge. They just want recognition for what they did, and recognition that they were there."" Dozens of awards recognising the bravery of police officers, medical staff and other emergency responders have been given out in the years since the Arena attack. A ceremony recognising the 'supreme courage' of British Transport Police officers and railway staff was held in January 2018, honouring the 'breathtaking bravery' of those who helped. In October 2018 police sniffer dog Mojo was awarded the animal equivalent of an OBE - the PDSA Order of Merit, for his bravery after spending the night searching for secondary explosives. Medics received a Pride of Britain award in 2017, while officers from Greater Manchester Police and charity workers were recognised in the Queens Honours in 2019 for their work in the aftermath of the attack.

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Breakfast in Rome Gobbling through a takeaway
sandwich at the office desk is normal for the Brits. But for the Italians?
Mamma mia, itâs as foreign a concept here as a cappuccino after midday. So the
relaxing of restrictions in most of Italy today â all but five areas of the
country moving from orange to yellow zones â means this nationâs sacred rituals
can resume: a morning espresso inside a cafe; fresh pasta for lunch at the
local trattoria; an Aperol spritz in the bar for the early-evening aperitivo on
the way home from work. Venues must still stop table service at 6pm â itâs only
takeaway after that â but the newfound freedom, with museums reopening during
weekdays and movement allowed within oneâs region, will lift the mood here. So much so that people crowded
into city centres in anticipation over the weekend, almost counting down the
hours until the measures were eased. That has prompted concern that complacency
will be costly. Itâs what led a busy summer to be followed by a deadly autumn. Reopening is risky â the first
country in the West to be slammed by Covid knows that. But for now, this nation
of foodies will savour the moment. There were protests in Cape Town calling for beaches to reopen There will be
relief in South Africa after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced an easing
of lockdown restrictions. He said public
places such as parks, beaches and swimming pools will reopen and restrictions eased on
the sale of alcohol. Faith-based
gatherings will be permitted but social gatherings must not exceed 50 people for
indoor venues and 100 people outdoors. Ramaphosa said
the changes had been made possible because there had been a significant reduction
of patients with Covid admitted to hospital since early December, reducing the pressure on beds and
medical staff. As we mentioned in
an earlier post, public patience with the lockdown restrictions has been
fraying. Scores of people
protested at beaches in Cape Town at the weekend calling for them to be
reopened, and two church associations were threatening to sue the president over
the closure of churches. This video can not be played Mumbai: One of world's largest train networks resumes services In India, trains in Mumbai are running public services again and yes, there are social-distancing rules on board. Among the busiest in the world, the trains carry nearly eight million people every day. But they were shut down to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Now they have reopened to the public with certain Covid-19 restrictions, including compulsory masks and temperature checks for commuters. Mumbai was one of the worst-hit cities in India but coronavirus numbers have begun to fall there, as they have elsewhere in country. BBC Radio 5 Live Alison with her mum Margaret Today, 5 Liveâs Your Call asked listeners if they were celebrating at news that every care home resident in England has been offered a Covid vaccine. Alison, in Colchester, said it was âvery hardâ to listen to the good news because her mum died in a care home last month after contracting coronavirus. âI just feel very sad. It was too late for her,â she said. Alison said she had been told that vaccinations could not always be administered in care homes where positive tests had been recorded. ""How do we protect those vulnerable people until they are vaccinated?â she said. Debs, in Eccles, said her parents required 24-hour care but lived at home with her.  Because they could not leave the home, they were unable to attend vaccination appointments. She wanted to highlight the ""forgotten group of people - the elderly that are at home and housebound"" who had not yet received their vaccination. ""Weâre a little bit in the dark,â she said. ""The vaccination programme is fantastic but housebound people donât seem to be getting mentioned anywhere."" Listen back to Your Call on the free BBC Sounds app. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This development sounds alarmingâ after all just a handful of
cases has prompted a massive effort to get tens of thousands of people tested. But as always context is needed. This variant is â like the UK one â more contagious. But there is no evidence that it causes more serious
illness. And data suggests the vaccines will work against it,
although maybe not quite as well as they do against the original one. So the logic of public health officials is to stop or at
least slow the spread. We are at a crucial point with the vaccine being rolled out
quickly and immunity being built up by significant numbers of vulnerable
people. Anything that interferes with that will slow our escape from
lockdown and, ultimately, the pandemic as well as increasing risk to the population. So the aim is to hit it hard and early. The fact the UK is the world leader in sequencing means
officials have been able to identify the early signs of community transmission,
giving the country a fighting chance of stamping down hard on this variant. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that
âthe contact tracing system now finds 95%, around 95%, of those contacts [of
people whoâve tested positive], so it has built up to this very effective
levelâ. When someone tests positive for
coronavirus in England they should be contacted by the Test and Trace system. They are then asked how many close contacts
theyâve had in the run-up to testing positive. Of these contacts, the tracing teams
successfully reached 93.2% - and told them to self-isolate - in the week ending 20 January. So the health secretary is broadly
right. But it is worth noting that in the same
week, of the 275,000 people who tested positive, only 85% were actually reached
in the first place and had their details passed to the contact tracing system. You can read more about how NHS Test and Trace workshere. While there's good news on vaccination in the UK and Israel, in New York vaccination centres have temporarily closed and
appointments re-arranged as the US city braces itself for a major snowstorm. As much as 60cm (20in) of snow is expected to fall along the US east
coast, with wind gusts of up to 80km/h (50mph) creating blizzard-like conditions. New York has declared a state of emergency, cancelling flights
and restricting non-essential travel. Mayor Bill de Blasio admitted the storm had disrupted the âvaccination
effortâ because âwe donât want folks, especially seniors, going out in unsafe
conditions to get vaccinatedâ. But he promised a fast restart after the danger has passed
because âwe can take the supply we have and distribute it very quickly in the
days to come and make sure everyone gets the appointmentsâ. Snow began falling in parts of Pennsylvania, New York state and New England late on Sunday night and the heaviest snowfalls were expected during Monday. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Around 20% of Israel's population has now been fully vaccinated As we mentioned
earlier, Israel's coronavirus
vaccination programme is showing signs of working to drive down infections and illness in the over-60s. Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) figures show 531 over-60s, out of almost 750,000 fully vaccinated, tested positive for coronavirus (0.07%). And far fewer fell ill, with 38 becoming needing hospital treatment with moderate, severe or critical disease. There were three deaths in vaccinated over-60s - although it is possible they contracted the infection earlier, before their immunity had time to build. Before the vaccine had time to take effect, more than 7,000 infections were recorded, just under 700 cases of moderate to critical illness and 307 deaths. The MoH data suggests infections and illnesses fell consistently from 14 days after receiving the first jab onwards. You can read Rachelâs report here. The number of new coronavirus cases being recorded in the UK is continuing to fall, with 18,607 reported today. However, the number of deaths remain high, with 406 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. Meanwhile, more than nine million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, with an average of 389,000 people getting their first jab every day over the past seven days. It means the government is on track to meet its target of offering the vaccine to about 15 million people in priority groups by mid-February. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock doesnât rule out
further restrictions in those postcodes where thereâs concern about the South
African variant. However, it doesnât sound like the governmentâs on the
verge of imposing extra measures with the health secretary pointing out that
the countryâs already in lockdown. Itâs clear the government hopes to get on
top of the issue via, in part, so-called âsurgeâ testing. People in those areas
are also being urged to, in particular, heed that stay at home advice. But questions may well continue over whether more should or could be done
to contain this variant. Yes, public health officials insist thereâs no evidence
it causes a more severe disease but Dr Susan Hopkins did also just repeat the
concern that vaccines may have a âdiminishedâ â albeit still âvery goodâ â
effect against the variant. Finally the scientists are asked about the South African variant and whether it is more likely to cause serious illness. Dr Hopkins says it has ""similar transmissibility"" to the variant that was first found in Kent but there is not evidence it is causing more severe disease than other variants circulating in the UK. However, she adds that it has slightly
more mutations in the spike protein which is perhaps causing vaccines to have ""diminished effectiveness"" although they still work very well. She says the government wants to prevent viruses with mutations acquiring more mutations which is why breaking the chains of transmission for the South African variant is essential. Hancock adds that the UK's flu vaccination programme is upgraded every year to make sure it is as effective as possible against new variants. He says he hopes the government will be able to get the coronavirus jab to the same place and it will become ""something people have as standard"". Jonathan Walker from the Birmingham Mail and Newcastle Chronicle asks whether areas in the North of England that are rolling out the vaccine faster could have supplies cut to give more doses to other areas that have been slower. Hancock says the government is making sure the vaccine goes to all parts of the country ""on a fair basis according to need"" and insists every area is getting its fair share. He adds that there is a ""bumpy supply schedule for the whole country"" and if some days there are more vaccines given than others this is because of the supply available nationally. Jane Merrick from the i newspaper asks if the geographical spread of the South African variant suggests it is endemic and whether those who have already been jabbed will need a booster with a tweaked vaccine? She also wants to know if school playgrounds can be reopened sooner than 8 March given the health benefits to children. Hancock says the government has taken action regarding schools with a ""very heavy heart"" and these are the first measures ministers want to lift. But he says the virus is still widespread and there's a lot of work to do to get it under control"". Dr Hopkins says it's unlikely those who have already been jabbed will need to start again, even if the vaccine has to be tweaked in light of the South African variant. She says it's most likely a booster would be given. She stresses that cases of this strain found in the UK are not linked and that she's confident that measures in place will close down and eliminate transmission. Emily Morgan from ITV asks how confident the government is that it can contain the new variant. Hancock says the enhanced testing is aimed at stopping the spread of the variant altogether. ""But it is not straightforward - there may be further cases we don't know about yet,"" he warns. He says it is therefore ""vital people in those areas minimise all social contact and get a test when the opportunity arises"". Tom Magner from Carers' World asks what assurances the health secretary can give that unpaid carers will always be at the heart of the government's policy making, saying many don't feel truly recognised because they are only in band six of the vaccine prioritisation list. Hancock says he knows from his own family just how important unpaid carers
are and the government has ""looked very closely"" at where they are on the prioritisation list, which is drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advisory group. Prof Powis agrees that ""in the NHS we absolutely recognise the huge value that
unpaid carers bring to our patientsâ. He says the NHS is working its way through the vaccination programme according to the priority list set by the JCVI but as soon as the top four priority groups have had their jab it will immediately move âvery rapidly, as quickly as we can"" through the groups next on the list. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Ministers have, over the past few days, begun to
hint at sharing the UKâs vaccine supply with other countries in the future â
including both the EU and the developing world. Matt Hancock just repeated that
pledge, saying that the UK will play its part to ensure vaccines are available
around the globe. But there have been no specifics yet from ministers on the
questions that inevitably follow. Which countries, when and on what terms? The
government may argue itâs really still too soon to say. But if supplies do
continue to grow, as expected, and the country moves away from a just-in-time
supply chain here at home, the pressure to answer these questions will also
increase. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Silver surges as Reddit army turns to commodities,"Silver prices have hit an a eight-year high after calls to buy the metal on social media sparked a trading frenzy. It comes a week after amateur investors piled into shares in the games retailer GameStop, causing them to jump 700%. On Monday silver rose by as much as 11% to $30 an ounce, while shares in some mining firms were up as much as 60%. Small time traders swapping tips on Reddit are thought to be behind the trend, as they seek to drive prices up. However, some users of the site dispute this, alleging the ""Silver Squeeze"" is secretly being coordinated by big Wall Street firms. It is the latest example of apparently small-time traders taking on big Wall Street hedge funds that hope to profit when the price of an asset or stock falls, but could lose heavily if it rises. Tips posted on social media sites like Reddit say these so called ""short sellers"" are manipulating the markets. And so the amateurs buy up the stocks or assets, driving up the price and inflicting losses on the big players. UK trading platform IG stops new GameStop trades GameStop: Who is winning the market battle? Global watchdogs on alert as GameStop frenzy grows It began in January when amateurs piled into loss-making retailer GameStop and other companies such as AMC and Blackberry. GameStop shares, which were trading at less than $20 (Â£14.61) each at the start of January, shot to nearly $350 last week. They fell 30% on Monday to $225. Now the battle appears to have moved on to silver - a far bigger market. The price of silver slid from its early highs on Monday. But the metal is up by almost 20% since Wednesday, when messages began circulating on Reddit forums, encouraging users to buy the metal. Coin-selling websites say they are now seeing unprecedented demand and delays in delivering silver. Reflecting the attitude of many of those swapping tips on the site, one user called RocketBoomGo urged fellow traders to ""think about the Gainz"" in a widely circulated post. ""If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP Morgan you'd be destroying along the way,"" they added. Amateur investors caused shares in GameStop to surge more than 700% last week However, some on Reddit expressed scepticism, with one saying they had analysed comments and posts on the thread Wall Street Silver and found that 80% ""came from accounts mostly created in the last 2 days. Pretty suspect.. who do these people really work for?!"" GameStop - a political fable Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said that amateur investors would find it much harder to influence the price of silver than they did with GameStop. For one thing, the total value of silver being traded is about $1.4-$1.6 trillion, he said, which is 1,000 times the total value of GameStop's share capital before it became the target of speculation. A large proportion of the silver market also exists ""off-exchange"", meaning it can't be bought and sold as easily online. The army of small investors will have enlisted for different reasons. Some will hope to profit from getting in early and starting a wave of others doing the same, ride it for a bit before getting off the wave and letting it crash after they've taken their profits. Others will see something going up and think the sky's the limit to this - still plenty of time for me to profit too. And others will think - I don't really care if I lose a few bucks, sticking it to the man is the name of the game. The first group will have made money and indeed may be being infiltrated right now by the very professionals they hoped to beat. The second group will end up poorer and unhappy about it. The third may end up poorer but don't care - they have made a telling political point. Read more here. This video can not be played WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop? ""Retail traders who are just following the herd and join the party late may accumulate huge losses and need to be more rational in their decisions,"" Mr Sayed added. GameStop investors have already got a taste of those risks. Shares in the company have fallen since last week, when the frenzy caught regulatory attention and trading platforms imposed restrictions on shares in GameStop and some other companies. That decision sparked anger among amateur traders, who say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. Several prominent US politicians and the billionaire Elon Musk have voiced their support. The moves also convinced some online traders to dig in their heels, like Paul Grainger of Liverpool, a project manager at a telecommunications firm. He added shares in GameStop to his investments after seeing online hype that persuaded him the price would rise. Now he's holding on, partly to send a message to the hedge fund giants. ""At first, I was in it like probably most people were were at the beginning, just to try to make a little bit of money on it,"" he said. ""But now... I'm out of principle holding the stock. ""I think it's wrong what they're doing and the fact that they've changed the rules of the game now that the little man's getting an advantage."" Mr Grainger said he's ready to risk his holdings, which are a small part of his portfolio, and hopeful that if many people act similarly, those betting against the company will be the ones hit with losses. But he said he's not expecting there to be too many similar opportunities - in silver or elsewhere - in the future. ""Now that we've taken advantage of it, I don't think that the market will allow this to happen again,"" he said. ""I think this is kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity and I'm hoping it will make those big companies change the way they operate so this kind of thing can't happen again."" Despite what some retail traders hoped, some of the biggest profiteers from last week's market action were said to be Wall Street giants such as asset manager BlackRock and the private equity firm Silver Lake. However, other big investors have been hammered by the trading frenzy. Hedge fund Melvin Capital - which bet heavily that shares in GameStop would fall - lost 53% of its value towards the end of January, according to media reports. The firm has since received commitments for fresh cash from investors, leaving it with around $8bn (Â£5.8bn) in assets, but that is still down from $12.5bn at the beginning of 2021, according to Reuters.

"Shut schools 'may cost pupils Â£40,000 over career'","Pupils in the UK could stand to lose an average of Â£40,000 each in lifetime earnings from lost time in school because of Covid, a report suggests. Any effects are likely to be concentrated among children from disadvantaged backgrounds, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Parent groups say the four UK nations must ""do more... to avoid a generation of children being left behind"". The IFS says the Â£1.5bn invested so far in ""catch up"" services is not enough. The leading economic research group said ""there is much that is good"" with the plans to help pupils being put in place across the UK but the funding allocated to date was ""tiny in comparison with the scale of problem"". UK schools are currently closed to pupils other than children of key workers and those classified as vulnerable in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus. By mid-February, children will have lost half an academic year - as much as 5% of their school career - in learning time. The IFS says its report contains an ""illustration, rather than a precise prediction"" of what could happen. But it suggests that despite remote learning, some children may leave school with fewer or poorer qualifications. The IFS says the reduction in face-to-face teaching could potentially result in a total of Â£350bn in lost lifetime earnings for the UK's 8.7m schoolchildren, adding this would hit future tax revenues. The institute refers to findings by the World Bank that a year of schooling increases an individual's earnings by an average of 8% a year in an advanced economy such as the UK. For anyone earning the average yearly wage in the UK, the IFS estimates, this would translate to a potential Â£40,000 loss in income across a lifetime, leading it to warn that ""the long-run costs of the pandemic will fall disproportionately on today's children"". The IFS says even if ""much weaker assumptions"" are made, there could still be Â£90bn in lost lifetime earnings. When will schools reopen? English schools could return 8 March 'at the earliest' - PM Shut schools 'like systematic neglect' to disadvantaged pupils Schools in England and Northern Ireland will remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March. In Wales, some primary-school children may start to return after the half-term break, while the Scottish government has ruled out a mid-February reopening. The Department for Education haspledged an extra Â£300min the next financial year for catch-up services in England, in addition to its existing funding allocation of Â£1bn. A DfE spokesperson said ""the prime minister was clear last week that extended schools closures have had a huge impact on pupils learning, which will take more than a year to make up. ""The government will work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long term plan to make sure pupils have the chance to make up their learning over the course of this parliament."" The National Tutoring Programme helped almost 70,000 children in England during the autumn term and will benefit from a portion of the additional government funding to assist disadvantaged pupils. Comfort Oghenesuvwe, a single mother of two boys, who lives in Kent, told BBC News: ""If something is not done to help my boys catch up when things return to normal, I worry for their future."" Both of Ms Oghenesuvwe's children - Jason, 11, and Jeffrey, 10 - have learnt from home during England's first and third nationwide lockdowns. ""Jason has been particularly affected as he has additional learning needs and would normally require a teacher to come to his table to double-check he understands everything, but that's not possible over Zoom. ""Back in April, we only had one laptop before we bought an extra one and Jason's learning had to be prioritised, so Jeffrey had to sit and colour, or just read a book at times. ""I've definitely seen Jeffrey's momentum for wanting to learn and read, which he used to enjoy, drop off as a result."" Schools in all four home nations are currently closed to most pupils ""What's going to come out of this experience is an entire patchwork of new inequalities layered on old inequalities,"" said Luke Sibieta, the IFS researcher behind the report. Younger children from disadvantaged families, who may have not had access to the right equipment for remote learning, will feel the impact most, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""They were probably the furthest behind to begin with,"" he said. The government's plan for a ""catch-up"" service will ""cushion"" the impact, he said, ""however it just doesn't match up to the scale of the problem"". ""The scale of the policy response needs to be larger than it is at the moment."" The IFS estimates that half a year of schools spending is more than Â£30bn across the UK and says ""correcting a loss on this scale certainly requires a massive injection of resources"". John Jolly, chief executive of charity Parentkind, told BBC News: ""The government must do more and invest more to close the educational divide and to avoid a generation of children being left behind."" James Turner, chief executive of the Sutton Trust educational charity, echoed the IFS call for extra funding. He said: ""It is absolutely crucial that this is targeted towards disadvantaged pupils who have been the worst-hit by the pandemic. ""As a start, the pupil premium should be boosted this year to help schools catch up, through allocating an additional Â£400 to every low-income student."" The IFS report outlines options including extending the school year, lengthening the school day, mass repetition of entire school years, or summer schools to help children catch up. Ms Oghenesuvwe said she would be open to these options for her children but said she worried about burnout among teachers.

Some will hope to profit from getting in early and starting a wave of others doing the same, ride it for a bit before getting off the wave and letting it crash after they've taken their profits. Others will see something going up and think the sky's the limit to this - still plenty of time for me to profit too. And others will think - I don't really care if I lose a few bucks, sticking it to the man is the name of the game. The first group will have made money and indeed may be being infiltrated right now by the very professionals they hoped to beat. The second group will end up poorer and unhappy about it. The third may end up poorer but don't care - they have made a telling political point. Read more here. This video can not be played WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop? ""Retail traders who are just following the herd and join the party late may accumulate huge losses and need to be more rational in their decisions,"" Mr Sayed added. GameStop investors have already got a taste of those risks. Shares in the company have fallen since last week, when the frenzy caught regulatory attention and trading platforms imposed restrictions on shares in GameStop and some other companies. That decision sparked anger among amateur traders, who say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. Several prominent US politicians and the billionaire Elon Musk have voiced their support. The moves also convinced some online traders to dig in their heels, like Paul Grainger of Liverpool, a project manager at a telecommunications firm. He added shares in GameStop to his investments after seeing online hype that persuaded him the price would rise. Now he's holding on, partly to send a message to the hedge fund giants. ""At first, I was in it like probably most people were were at the beginning, just to try to make a little bit of money on it,"" he said. ""But now... I'm out of principle holding the stock. ""I think it's wrong what they're doing and the fact that they've changed the rules of the game now that the little man's getting an advantage."" Mr Grainger said he's ready to risk his holdings, which are a small part of his portfolio, and hopeful that if many people act similarly, those betting against the company will be the ones hit with losses. But he said he's not expecting there to be too many similar opportunities - in silver or elsewhere - in the future. ""Now that we've taken advantage of it, I don't think that the market will allow this to happen again,"" he said. ""I think this is kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity and I'm hoping it will make those big companies change the way they operate so this kind of thing can't happen again."" Despite what some retail traders hoped, some of the biggest profiteers from last week's market action were said to be Wall Street giants such as asset manager BlackRock and the private equity firm Silver Lake. However, other big investors have been hammered by the trading frenzy. Hedge fund Melvin Capital - which bet heavily that shares in GameStop would fall - lost 53% of its value towards the end of January, according to media reports. The firm has since received commitments for fresh cash from investors, leaving it with around $8bn (Â£5.8bn) in assets, but that is still down from $12.5bn at the beginning of 2021, according to Reuters.

"AstraZeneca 'agrees to boost EU vaccine supplies'The Commission chief announces a ""step forward"" after criticism over EU handling of vaccine plans.Europe","AstraZeneca was first approved in the UK, and only in the EU last Friday The EU says UK-Swedish drug firm AstraZeneca will now supply an additional nine million Covid vaccine doses by March, after days of criticism of the bloc's vaccination programme. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was a ""step forward"". But the 40m doses now expected are still only about half of what had been hoped, amid continuing supply problems. The Commission has been involved in a much-criticised row with both the UK and AstraZeneca this week. In particular it was condemned over its threat to put checks on the Northern Ireland border to prevent vaccines produced in the EU from reaching the UK. The border was one of the most difficult problems to overcome in the recently agreed Brexit deal, following the UK's departure from the EU. The EU was angry that Britain was getting its UK-made contracted supplies from AstraZeneca while it suffered a shortfall. So the bloc announced it was introducing export controls on coronavirus vaccines made inside the EU to try to protect its supplies. The Brexit deal ensures there are no obstacles to trade between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland . How effective is the Oxford vaccine? Why is EUâs vaccine rollout so slow? Is it OK to get a leftover Covid-19 vaccine? In a tweet, Ms von der Leyen said AstraZeneca would ""deliver 9 million additional doses in the first quarter (40 million in total) compared to last week's offer & will start deliveries one week earlier than scheduled"". She said this represented a 30% increase on the previous amount. Irish broadcaster RTE is reporting that the country will get another 100,000 doses as a result. The EU signed a deal in August for 300 million AstraZeneca doses, with an option for 100 million more. Ursula von der Leyen has faced mounting criticism over the vaccine programme It was hoped 80 million would be delivered in the first quarter of 2021 - although other sources had put the figure at 100 million - but AstraZeneca said there were production problems at its Dutch and Belgian plants. Media reported this would mean a 60% cut in supplies to the end of March. There followed a terse exchange between the two parties on contractual obligations, the EU arguing it was binding and the drug firm saying it had only to provide its ""best reasonable efforts"". The contract between the two was partly published as both tried to win the argument. The Commission pointed out it could be supplied from UK-based plants, but the UK staunchly defended its supply contracts with AstraZeneca. The UK was the first country to approve the vaccine, on 30 December - the EU only did so on Friday. The EU, also on Friday, announced its so-called transparency mechanism, which gives countries in the bloc powers to deny authorisation for vaccine exports if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. The EU's attempt to apply measures to the Irish border was widely condemned, and the heads of the UK- and Europe-wide industry bodies warned against export bans. The EU stepped back and, in a call with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Ursula Von Der Leyen said that ""there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU"". In addition to her announcement on the doses, Ms Von Der Leyen said she had had a video-conference with vaccine manufacturers. In an earlier tweet she spoke of ""our new initiative to strengthen bio-defence preparedness"", adding: ""We're discussing how to address Covid-19 variants & scale up manufacturing, be better prepared for future pandemics."" This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? There was no reference to the talk earlier in the week of legal action and ""hijacking"" of supplies. The BBC's Kevin Connolly says this was a curiously flat and bland conclusion to a week of stormy rhetoric. The additional doses announcement will be greeted with relief in Brussels, our correspondent says, but it still leaves the European Commission facing awkward questions about how its signing of supply contracts and approval processes have lagged behind those of other wealthy nations. Even Ms Von Der Leyen's reference to AstraZeneca expanding its production in Europe and the earlier supply date were partly signalled by the firm last week. But she said on Sunday that the EU was maintaining its ""target of vaccinating 70% of adults by the end of summer"". ""Our opponent is the virus and the pharmaceutical industry is part of the solution,"" Ms Von Der Leyen told German public broadcaster ZDF. Remember just how long and difficult the Brexit negotiations were in reaching an agreement on Northern Ireland? Think about how often the EU lectured the UK government about the importance of respecting the detail of the arrangement; how peace in Northern Ireland was at stake. Yet the impression the European Commission gave on Friday - however incorrect or unintended, which is what it insists - is that those concerns could be thrown aside in a heartbeat. The European Commission back-tracked late on Friday (although it has reserved the right to revisit the issue, it says, if it sees EU-manufactured vaccines entering the rest of the UK via Northern Ireland). The U-turn was publicly welcomed by Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin. But take a look at political and press reaction in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and you'll see a lot of damage had already been done.

"Plan now for recovery roadmap, say business bosses","Business leaders have called on the government to work with them on a roadmap out of lockdown to unlock investment for a post-Covid recovery. In a letter to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, the Confederation of British Industry says the time to plan for re-opening the economy in England is now. Firms are ""in the dark"" about planning for the months ahead, the employers' group said. A government spokesperson said lockdown would be lifted as soon as possible. But the CBI, which speaks on behalf of about 190,000 businesses, said there is an opportunity to ""use time wisely"" to prepare for a safe re-opening of the economy. In a letter to Mr Kwarteng, CBI director-general Tony Danker, writes: ""With health teams rightly in crisis management mode, we in business along with the economic ministries can use this time to plan for a successful re-opening of the economy when the moment is right to do so. ""Businesses are currently completely in the dark when planning for the weeks and months ahead and this is hindering investment. We can provide more clarity and do the prep work now to enable them to plan for reopening and growth."" CBI calls for more business support before Budget Firms urge fresh financial aid to survive lockdown Mr Danker will also be writing to the devolved nations' governments next week. The CBI calls for clarification on what will be considered low, medium or high-risk economic activity, so that businesses can understand what will open sooner or later. Mr Danker also wants to know whether or not there will be a return to tiering, as part of a gradual re-opening. He also wants the creation of bespoke, detailed plans for the harder-to-open sectors of the economy, such as testing regimes for international travel, or the conditions for activities such as hospitality and live events to return. The CBI wrote to Mr Kwarteng on Monday, and will write to to the devolved nations' governments next week. Mr Danker says in the letter: ""The Prime Minister has set out the initial parameters for reopening as a country, which was a big help for businesses. Clearly, the precise dates will be determined by data, so let's use this time wisely to get the roadmap right together for when lockdown ends. ""A common framework with devolved administrations must also be possible and help to minimise differences in approach."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak is working on a recovery plan, expected to be published ahead of next month's Budget. That plan will, according to reports, focus on jobs and investment. A government spokesperson said: ""As the prime minister has made clear, we will lift restrictions as soon as we can, but by lifting them too soon we run the risk of placing our NHS under even greater pressure and having to re-impose restrictions at a later date."" The spokesperson pointed out that the government had invested more than Â£280bn during the pandemic to protect jobs and businesses, adding: ""By mid-February we will be in a better position to lay out the next steps for the economy without risking renewed pressure on our NHS.""

"Manchester attack: The ordinary people who helped save livesAs the inquiry hears about the emergency response, we spoke to ordinary people who helped that night.","When a bomb went off at Manchester Arena, a number of ordinary people made the decision not to run away from the horror, but to stay to help the injured and dying. Survivors say the contribution of these people was crucial, yet feel their role has so far been almost entirely overlooked in the official version of events. As the inquiry begins to hear evidence about the emergency response, we spoke to some of those people. Here are their extraordinary stories. During lockdown, like everyone else, Kim Dick and Freya Lewis have had to make do with online video calls to stay in touch. But they're still determined to catch up when they can. Their chats are full of fun - gossip about the soaps, music, and their pets. It's clear they share a special bond. You'd never know that Kim and Freya, 18, were strangers until a few years ago, brought together at the worst time of their lives. Their worlds collided on 22 May 2017 when a bomb exploded at Manchester Arena. Kim, 57, and her husband Phil were in the arena foyer to collect their daughter and granddaughter from an Ariana Grande concert when the blast blew Kim off her feet. As she steadied herself and tried to focus through the smoke and debris, a small girl staggered towards her, and collapsed in her arms. It was Freya. Kim didn't know the then-14-year-old, and didn't have time to think. ""This little girl just appeared,"" Kim recalls. ""There was blood coming out of her mouth, and I thought 'oh my God I've got to look after her. I've got to get her out of here'."" Kim managed to drag Freya towards the door of the foyer and lean her up against a wall. She knew she had to keep her upright to prevent her from choking on the blood which was still pouring out of her mouth. Freya kept sliding down and closing her eyes as Kim strained to hold her up, talking to her non-stop to keep her conscious. ""I said 'OK darling, you're going to be OK'. Just repeating and repeating it the whole time. That's what I thought, after watching (medical dramas) on TV. You've got to keep them awake, keep them alert. Don't let them go to sleep."" As Kim tried to keep the teenager upright, Phil used his car keys to try to cut away plastic from Freya's merchandise bag which had melted into her hair and skin. Freya was left with 29 separate injuries including two broken legs, a broken arm, severe burns, and a shattered mouth. And she was not the only one who needed Kim and Phil's help. A second young girl, Aliya, appeared, in pain and crying, with awful injuries to her leg. All Kim could do was tell her to sit down with them and try to keep both children awake and talking. ""At the time I felt really helpless,"" Kim says. ""These girls were bleedingâ¦ and we needed the help. We needed the paramedics then."" Kim remembers the sounds of the foyer. The loudspeaker was blaring. She could hear sirens outside, and assumed help would come quickly. But they waited and waited. ""There was screaming, then crying and as time went on the screaming got less and less. The crying was less and less and then it was just total silence. And you knew that people had died."" Kim believes she sat propping Freya up for more than an hour, becoming increasingly desperate for help. ""I was shouting out 'Help! We need help!â¦ And I was shouting out to nobody."" With no stretcher available, they had to lift Freya onto a table from one of the merchandise stands, and carry her down the stairs to the station concourse. Throughout this time, Freya's dad Nick was frantically searching for her. Kim and Phil managed to get Freya's home phone number from her, and spoke to her mum who was desperately waiting for news. Nick then called the couple and with the help of two police officers, was guided through the security cordon. As father and daughter were reunited, Kim and Phil slipped away. Kim says she still feels guilty for leaving. ""There were people on the floor everywhere,"" she says. It was after 1am when the two girls were taken to hospital, Freya by ambulance, Aliya in a minibus driven by someone who volunteered to help. Freya was put into an induced coma and underwent many hours of surgery. When she came round, she asked her parents about Kim and Phil. ""I remembered them straight away,"" she says. ""I wanted to know how they were."" Two weeks later she got her answer when they visited the hospital and the two families forged a bond they still share. ""Kim and Phil saved my life,"" Freya says. ""On that night, nobody else seemed to help me. And I just saw Kim, with her arms wide open, and she took care of me straight away. Without thinking I basically collapsed onto her. And she and Phil looked after me and kept me alive. ""She kept my eyes open. She kept me breathing. She kept me as calm as I possibly could be."" After multiple operations and a long rehabilitation, Freya has made an amazing recovery, and is now applying to drama school, with dreams of becoming an actress. ""They acted as my parents when my parents couldn't,"" she adds. ""And for the rest of my life, I'll always be eternally grateful to them. They're just amazing."" Daren Buckley is a changed man after what happened at the arena. Physically, the difference is shocking; he's lost nearly four stone in weight and the stress has led him to grind most of his teeth away. The night terrors and flashbacks have stayed with him. In the weeks after the attack he would wake up covered in sweat, having dreamt of people dying in front of him. He has struggled to come to terms with the lack of official recognition for people who helped, and says he feels completely forgotten. ""How can you run into a bomb and get told you don't matter?"" he says, angrily. ""I feel like anybody on the professional side of things has been acknowledged, even the police sniffer dog got an award. To me it is all wrong, the system and how it has worked."" Daren was at the concert with his disabled son Lewis, the pair just about to walk through the doors to the foyer when the bomb went off. He says he knew immediately it was a suicide bombing and remembers running towards the blast pulling Ariana Grande t-shirts off the merchandise stand and throwing them to people to use as bandages. ""We had t-shirts to save lives. We had nothing else."" At one point he asked someone if he could get into a first aid room for extra gloves and bandages, but says he was told all the doors had been locked. As time ticked on and no more help was coming, Daren helped to carry the injured out of the foyer and down into Victoria Station, where the medical teams were waiting. Manchester attack: Who were the victims? The families searching for answers Youngest victim 'could have survived with better first aid' Daren has struggled with PTSD ever since the attack. ""It's like it's stamped on my brain and I'm thinking how can I get it out?"" he says. ""In my dreams I've seen myself dead. I've seen things moving on the floor that shouldn't be. Nobody can see the injuries on me because physically I don't have them, but mentally, I've got hundreds. How do you move forward when you're in that rut of thinking is it going to happen again?"" For Daren, there have been some very low points. But he says the support from the community of survivors has been life-saving for him, as well as the Manchester Survivors Choir. ""All I've ever wanted to do was sing,"" he says. ""I'd be lost without music, it keeps you going."" Rob Grew was in a shop when he heard a loud boom and screams coming from the station. Thinking a train had crashed, he started to run towards the noise, never expecting what would happen over the next six hours. He reached the foyer within five minutes of the bomb going off. ""It took me a minute or two to decide what to do,"" he says. ""Whether to run back out for my own safety, or go in."" But the sight of a mother and child on the floor screaming for help stopped him from leaving. ""That thought went out of my head and I went straight to them, to comfort them."" The girl had multiple shrapnel wounds to her legs, while the mum had a bolt that had gone through her cheek. ""She asked me if I could go and look for her sister in the centre of the foyer which I didâ¦ It was just chaos. There were people everywhere on the floor."" He pauses before recalling: ""You look at those who are just lying there, bleeding out, and you have no idea what to do at all. So many injuries you've no idea where to start."" Rob did have some first aid training, and as an adventure sports photographer, had some experience of having to stay calm in dangerous situations. But it was nowhere near the level needed to deal with the scale of what he was faced with. ""It was just autopilot really,"" he says. ""Where do you start with someone who has multiple holes in their torso and legs? I think the only thing I remembered was compression - try and stop the bleeding - and CPR. There were that many people screaming out for help, you've just got to try and cover as many people as you can."" As the minutes ticked by, and despite the reassurances he was giving to the injured, it dawned on Rob and others inside the foyer that no more help was coming in. The focus shifted from tourniquets and bandaging, to getting people out on makeshift stretchers made out of dismantled tables and T-shirt stands. ""I kept trying to reassure people 'don't worry they'll be a few minutes, there's people just outside'. And I kept on saying that for 40 minutes."" He says he could see the flashing lights of ambulances down by the railway station but no-one coming up the steps to help, which meant carrying people down three flights of stairs. Rob still doesn't know what happened to some of the people he tried to help - whether they lived or died. But there are some who stick out: a woman who passed away next to him as he attended to someone else; two elderly sisters with severe injuries who told him 'don't worry, we're two quite gritty individuals' as he apologised for leaving them and moving on to someone else; and a trainee nurse in a stripy dress who came back after taking her children to safety, and who he says definitely saved lives. The judgements he made on the night have stayed with him. ""I think I put pressure on myself wishing I could have done more to help."" There are some who Rob has since been able to identify, like Robby Potter, who he helped carry out of the arena and down to the station. ""I found Robby on his back on the bridge to the foyer and he was pretty much unconscious. ""There was a member of the train staff there, knelt beside him, I came back every so often, to see if he was still with us. ""We went and got a table from the T-shirt stand and lifted Robby onto it, with maybe four of us. Robby's a big guy so we struggled to carry him down. That's all I heard of him for a good six weeks or more; I didn't know whether he was alive or dead."" Rob says there was never enough medical help inside the foyer. His focus was on getting people out, and getting them to where help was waiting. A number of times he was mistaken for a doctor, and had to say that he was not qualified to give morphine injections. After the last injured person had been loaded into an ambulance, Rob finally left and walked home covered in blood and still wearing a pair of medical gloves. ""I just walked back to my apartment, got a shower, put all my clothes in a big bag because I wasn't sure if the police would need them. I just chucked them away in the end, they never asked for them."" He says he remembers thinking ""how the hell have I walked out of such a crazy thing and just been left? I wasn't spoken to by the police until something like the September"". Rob has never had counselling. Adventure sports became his therapy. He went abroad shortly afterwards, then spent some time climbing mountains in Wales, trying to come to terms with what had happened. For a good period of time he says, he replayed the night over and over again in his head, trying to figure out what he could have done better. He re-took his first aid course and, while doing CPR training, kept seeing the faces of the injured and dying. Overall, he has tried to take something positive from it. ""Because you've experienced such shock now you can probably deal with situations better so I like to think next time I'll be one of those people who can help a bit betterâ¦ I wish I could have done more still."" Sean Gardner didn't think he'd be at Manchester Arena for long. He was late to pick up his daughter Hannah from the concert, and thought he'd try to park as close as possible. He screeched into a space in the underground car park, and told his other daughter Charlotte to wait while he ran upstairs to collect her sister. Before Sean could reach the foyer, the bomb went off. ""It was pretty obvious to me what had happened. And then of course, people just came running. And I guess I had a choice at that point."" Instead of turning around, Sean ran against the flow of the crowd. He'd arranged to meet Hannah in the foyer, and he charged towards it, terrified she'd been hurt. But she wasn't there, and he hoped that meant she was safe. While racing back to his car to reassure his other daughter a woman pleaded with him to stop and help her. She was unharmed, but her friend Jane Tweddle was badly injured. ""They just needed help. It was as black and white as thatâ¦ I just felt obliged. It's just human nature."" Sean says he quickly realised Jane's injuries were far beyond anything he knew how to treat. ""It wasn't enough, but all I did was stay with her and comfort her. And that's all I could do. But it was in the expectation that somebody would be there within minutes."" He says he kept looking towards the doors, thinking he'd see people in uniforms coming through with stretchers. ""I held her hand, and she knew somebody was next to her I suppose. That was the main thing. I told her 'Just hang on in there. It won't be long, they'll be with us'."" He believes it was about 20 minutes before a British Transport Police officer came running past him and he begged her to help while he went to reassure daughter Charlotte about what was happening. Waiting in the car she'd become hysterical, not knowing what had happened. ""She tried to come upstairs and they wouldn't let her. Somebody told her that people were dead. She didn't know about me. She didn't know about her sisterâ¦ she thought we were injured at best."" Sean told Charlotte he thought Hannah was safe, although he hadn't found her. But he felt he needed to go back to continue looking after Jane. ""Charlotte was really brave. And I said, 'I will be back. But you have to stay here because you're safest here. And once we get Jane sorted out, we can go and find Hannah'."" He returned to Jane's side and waited until more police officers arrived. They made efforts to resuscitate the mother of three. But Jane didn't survive and died with her friend by her side. He spent the next two hours trying to reunite himself with both of his daughters. Hannah had ended up in a nearby hotel, while Charlotte had been brought out of the car park by a police officer as it was being cordoned off. Three years on, his family are still living with the haunting memories of the night. Sean has suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and says he's struggled with a range of emotions. ""It troubles me as to whether I could have done something different. Whether had [the emergency services] been there sooner, the outcome would have been better. ""It troubles me that my daughters had to wait such a long period of time, Charlotte, in particular, to know exactly what was going on. For her, that's so traumatic."" Asked if he feels like a hero, Shaun looks awkward. ""No. I don't like labels."" He says he stayed with Jane because he would ""hope somebody would do that for me in those circumstances"". ""I think it's just humanity to be honest with you. There's probably not enough of it, but I was always brought up that way. I know I'd never do anything different."" For survivor Martin Hibbert, the lack of official recognition for the ordinary people who chose to help has been a source of increasing frustration and anger. Not least because he feels their accounts are crucial to piecing together the facts about how the emergency response played out. Martin remembers little from the hours immediately after the bomb, and it's no wonder; he was hit by 22 separate pieces of shrapnel, including a bolt in his neck which severed an artery, and one in his back which has paralysed him from the waist down. His only thought was for his teenage daughter, who was also severely injured and lying next to him on the foyer floor. ""I knew that I probably wasn't going to make it,"" he says. ""I was striving to stay alive really to make sure she got out. When I saw her being carted off, that's when the curtains came down."" In the three years since, Martin has attempted to piece together the details of what happened to him and his now 18-year-old daughter, but he says it hasn't been easy. He feels that many details in the official reports into the aftermath of the bombing do not tally with the eyewitness accounts of those who were there. He and others have now formed a network of survivors who can speak with a common voice; but because their bid to play a formal role in the public inquiry has been denied and they don't have access to all the evidence, Martin says many gaps still remain. Only since the inquiry started has he discovered he arrived at Salford Royal hospital at 1:45am; more than three hours after the explosion, but only a 15 minute drive from the arena. The inquiry has been told all the injured had been moved out of the foyer by 11:40pm - an hour after the blast. ""So what happened to me for two hours after that?"" he says. He can only assume he was lying on the station concourse. When he did finally arrive at hospital, he was given 14 pints of blood. For Martin, proper recognition of the bravery of these members of the public is long overdue and he says, their voices need to be heard. ""As everybody ran out, they ran in. ""Police, fire and ambulance, they are trained for that, but people like Daren Buckley and Rob Grew aren't. For a member of the public to have that instinct, it takes a very special person to do that."" He says for the world not to know about what these people did ""just feels wrong"". ""They don't want a Queen's honour, or a medal, or a pin badge. They just want recognition for what they did, and recognition that they were there."" Dozens of awards recognising the bravery of police officers, medical staff and other emergency responders have been given out in the years since the Arena attack. A ceremony recognising the 'supreme courage' of British Transport Police officers and railway staff was held in January 2018, honouring the 'breathtaking bravery' of those who helped. In October 2018 police sniffer dog Mojo was awarded the animal equivalent of an OBE - the PDSA Order of Merit, for his bravery after spending the night searching for secondary explosives. Medics received a Pride of Britain award in 2017, while officers from Greater Manchester Police and charity workers were recognised in the Queens Honours in 2019 for their work in the aftermath of the attack.

"Manchester attack: The ordinary people who helped save livesAs the inquiry hears about the emergency response, we spoke to ordinary people who helped that night.Manchester attack: The ordinary people who helped save livesAs the inquiry hears about the emergency response, we spoke to ordinary people who helped that night.","When a bomb went off at Manchester Arena, a number of ordinary people made the decision not to run away from the horror, but to stay to help the injured and dying. Survivors say the contribution of these people was crucial, yet feel their role has so far been almost entirely overlooked in the official version of events. As the inquiry begins to hear evidence about the emergency response, we spoke to some of those people. Here are their extraordinary stories. During lockdown, like everyone else, Kim Dick and Freya Lewis have had to make do with online video calls to stay in touch. But they're still determined to catch up when they can. Their chats are full of fun - gossip about the soaps, music, and their pets. It's clear they share a special bond. You'd never know that Kim and Freya, 18, were strangers until a few years ago, brought together at the worst time of their lives. Their worlds collided on 22 May 2017 when a bomb exploded at Manchester Arena. Kim, 57, and her husband Phil were in the arena foyer to collect their daughter and granddaughter from an Ariana Grande concert when the blast blew Kim off her feet. As she steadied herself and tried to focus through the smoke and debris, a small girl staggered towards her, and collapsed in her arms. It was Freya. Kim didn't know the then-14-year-old, and didn't have time to think. ""This little girl just appeared,"" Kim recalls. ""There was blood coming out of her mouth, and I thought 'oh my God I've got to look after her. I've got to get her out of here'."" Kim managed to drag Freya towards the door of the foyer and lean her up against a wall. She knew she had to keep her upright to prevent her from choking on the blood which was still pouring out of her mouth. Freya kept sliding down and closing her eyes as Kim strained to hold her up, talking to her non-stop to keep her conscious. ""I said 'OK darling, you're going to be OK'. Just repeating and repeating it the whole time. That's what I thought, after watching (medical dramas) on TV. You've got to keep them awake, keep them alert. Don't let them go to sleep."" As Kim tried to keep the teenager upright, Phil used his car keys to try to cut away plastic from Freya's merchandise bag which had melted into her hair and skin. Freya was left with 29 separate injuries including two broken legs, a broken arm, severe burns, and a shattered mouth. And she was not the only one who needed Kim and Phil's help. A second young girl, Aliya, appeared, in pain and crying, with awful injuries to her leg. All Kim could do was tell her to sit down with them and try to keep both children awake and talking. ""At the time I felt really helpless,"" Kim says. ""These girls were bleedingâ¦ and we needed the help. We needed the paramedics then."" Kim remembers the sounds of the foyer. The loudspeaker was blaring. She could hear sirens outside, and assumed help would come quickly. But they waited and waited. ""There was screaming, then crying and as time went on the screaming got less and less. The crying was less and less and then it was just total silence. And you knew that people had died."" Kim believes she sat propping Freya up for more than an hour, becoming increasingly desperate for help. ""I was shouting out 'Help! We need help!â¦ And I was shouting out to nobody."" With no stretcher available, they had to lift Freya onto a table from one of the merchandise stands, and carry her down the stairs to the station concourse. Throughout this time, Freya's dad Nick was frantically searching for her. Kim and Phil managed to get Freya's home phone number from her, and spoke to her mum who was desperately waiting for news. Nick then called the couple and with the help of two police officers, was guided through the security cordon. As father and daughter were reunited, Kim and Phil slipped away. Kim says she still feels guilty for leaving. ""There were people on the floor everywhere,"" she says. It was after 1am when the two girls were taken to hospital, Freya by ambulance, Aliya in a minibus driven by someone who volunteered to help. Freya was put into an induced coma and underwent many hours of surgery. When she came round, she asked her parents about Kim and Phil. ""I remembered them straight away,"" she says. ""I wanted to know how they were."" Two weeks later she got her answer when they visited the hospital and the two families forged a bond they still share. ""Kim and Phil saved my life,"" Freya says. ""On that night, nobody else seemed to help me. And I just saw Kim, with her arms wide open, and she took care of me straight away. Without thinking I basically collapsed onto her. And she and Phil looked after me and kept me alive. ""She kept my eyes open. She kept me breathing. She kept me as calm as I possibly could be."" After multiple operations and a long rehabilitation, Freya has made an amazing recovery, and is now applying to drama school, with dreams of becoming an actress. ""They acted as my parents when my parents couldn't,"" she adds. ""And for the rest of my life, I'll always be eternally grateful to them. They're just amazing."" Daren Buckley is a changed man after what happened at the arena. Physically, the difference is shocking; he's lost nearly four stone in weight and the stress has led him to grind most of his teeth away. The night terrors and flashbacks have stayed with him. In the weeks after the attack he would wake up covered in sweat, having dreamt of people dying in front of him. He has struggled to come to terms with the lack of official recognition for people who helped, and says he feels completely forgotten. ""How can you run into a bomb and get told you don't matter?"" he says, angrily. ""I feel like anybody on the professional side of things has been acknowledged, even the police sniffer dog got an award. To me it is all wrong, the system and how it has worked."" Daren was at the concert with his disabled son Lewis, the pair just about to walk through the doors to the foyer when the bomb went off. He says he knew immediately it was a suicide bombing and remembers running towards the blast pulling Ariana Grande t-shirts off the merchandise stand and throwing them to people to use as bandages. ""We had t-shirts to save lives. We had nothing else."" At one point he asked someone if he could get into a first aid room for extra gloves and bandages, but says he was told all the doors had been locked. As time ticked on and no more help was coming, Daren helped to carry the injured out of the foyer and down into Victoria Station, where the medical teams were waiting. Manchester attack: Who were the victims? The families searching for answers Youngest victim 'could have survived with better first aid' Daren has struggled with PTSD ever since the attack. ""It's like it's stamped on my brain and I'm thinking how can I get it out?"" he says. ""In my dreams I've seen myself dead. I've seen things moving on the floor that shouldn't be. Nobody can see the injuries on me because physically I don't have them, but mentally, I've got hundreds. How do you move forward when you're in that rut of thinking is it going to happen again?"" For Daren, there have been some very low points. But he says the support from the community of survivors has been life-saving for him, as well as the Manchester Survivors Choir. ""All I've ever wanted to do was sing,"" he says. ""I'd be lost without music, it keeps you going."" Rob Grew was in a shop when he heard a loud boom and screams coming from the station. Thinking a train had crashed, he started to run towards the noise, never expecting what would happen over the next six hours. He reached the foyer within five minutes of the bomb going off. ""It took me a minute or two to decide what to do,"" he says. ""Whether to run back out for my own safety, or go in."" But the sight of a mother and child on the floor screaming for help stopped him from leaving. ""That thought went out of my head and I went straight to them, to comfort them."" The girl had multiple shrapnel wounds to her legs, while the mum had a bolt that had gone through her cheek. ""She asked me if I could go and look for her sister in the centre of the foyer which I didâ¦ It was just chaos. There were people everywhere on the floor."" He pauses before recalling: ""You look at those who are just lying there, bleeding out, and you have no idea what to do at all. So many injuries you've no idea where to start."" Rob did have some first aid training, and as an adventure sports photographer, had some experience of having to stay calm in dangerous situations. But it was nowhere near the level needed to deal with the scale of what he was faced with. ""It was just autopilot really,"" he says. ""Where do you start with someone who has multiple holes in their torso and legs? I think the only thing I remembered was compression - try and stop the bleeding - and CPR. There were that many people screaming out for help, you've just got to try and cover as many people as you can."" As the minutes ticked by, and despite the reassurances he was giving to the injured, it dawned on Rob and others inside the foyer that no more help was coming in. The focus shifted from tourniquets and bandaging, to getting people out on makeshift stretchers made out of dismantled tables and T-shirt stands. ""I kept trying to reassure people 'don't worry they'll be a few minutes, there's people just outside'. And I kept on saying that for 40 minutes."" He says he could see the flashing lights of ambulances down by the railway station but no-one coming up the steps to help, which meant carrying people down three flights of stairs. Rob still doesn't know what happened to some of the people he tried to help - whether they lived or died. But there are some who stick out: a woman who passed away next to him as he attended to someone else; two elderly sisters with severe injuries who told him 'don't worry, we're two quite gritty individuals' as he apologised for leaving them and moving on to someone else; and a trainee nurse in a stripy dress who came back after taking her children to safety, and who he says definitely saved lives. The judgements he made on the night have stayed with him. ""I think I put pressure on myself wishing I could have done more to help."" There are some who Rob has since been able to identify, like Robby Potter, who he helped carry out of the arena and down to the station. ""I found Robby on his back on the bridge to the foyer and he was pretty much unconscious. ""There was a member of the train staff there, knelt beside him, I came back every so often, to see if he was still with us. ""We went and got a table from the T-shirt stand and lifted Robby onto it, with maybe four of us. Robby's a big guy so we struggled to carry him down. That's all I heard of him for a good six weeks or more; I didn't know whether he was alive or dead."" Rob says there was never enough medical help inside the foyer. His focus was on getting people out, and getting them to where help was waiting. A number of times he was mistaken for a doctor, and had to say that he was not qualified to give morphine injections. After the last injured person had been loaded into an ambulance, Rob finally left and walked home covered in blood and still wearing a pair of medical gloves. ""I just walked back to my apartment, got a shower, put all my clothes in a big bag because I wasn't sure if the police would need them. I just chucked them away in the end, they never asked for them."" He says he remembers thinking ""how the hell have I walked out of such a crazy thing and just been left? I wasn't spoken to by the police until something like the September"". Rob has never had counselling. Adventure sports became his therapy. He went abroad shortly afterwards, then spent some time climbing mountains in Wales, trying to come to terms with what had happened. For a good period of time he says, he replayed the night over and over again in his head, trying to figure out what he could have done better. He re-took his first aid course and, while doing CPR training, kept seeing the faces of the injured and dying. Overall, he has tried to take something positive from it. ""Because you've experienced such shock now you can probably deal with situations better so I like to think next time I'll be one of those people who can help a bit betterâ¦ I wish I could have done more still."" Sean Gardner didn't think he'd be at Manchester Arena for long. He was late to pick up his daughter Hannah from the concert, and thought he'd try to park as close as possible. He screeched into a space in the underground car park, and told his other daughter Charlotte to wait while he ran upstairs to collect her sister. Before Sean could reach the foyer, the bomb went off. ""It was pretty obvious to me what had happened. And then of course, people just came running. And I guess I had a choice at that point."" Instead of turning around, Sean ran against the flow of the crowd. He'd arranged to meet Hannah in the foyer, and he charged towards it, terrified she'd been hurt. But she wasn't there, and he hoped that meant she was safe. While racing back to his car to reassure his other daughter a woman pleaded with him to stop and help her. She was unharmed, but her friend Jane Tweddle was badly injured. ""They just needed help. It was as black and white as thatâ¦ I just felt obliged. It's just human nature."" Sean says he quickly realised Jane's injuries were far beyond anything he knew how to treat. ""It wasn't enough, but all I did was stay with her and comfort her. And that's all I could do. But it was in the expectation that somebody would be there within minutes."" He says he kept looking towards the doors, thinking he'd see people in uniforms coming through with stretchers. ""I held her hand, and she knew somebody was next to her I suppose. That was the main thing. I told her 'Just hang on in there. It won't be long, they'll be with us'."" He believes it was about 20 minutes before a British Transport Police officer came running past him and he begged her to help while he went to reassure daughter Charlotte about what was happening. Waiting in the car she'd become hysterical, not knowing what had happened. ""She tried to come upstairs and they wouldn't let her. Somebody told her that people were dead. She didn't know about me. She didn't know about her sisterâ¦ she thought we were injured at best."" Sean told Charlotte he thought Hannah was safe, although he hadn't found her. But he felt he needed to go back to continue looking after Jane. ""Charlotte was really brave. And I said, 'I will be back. But you have to stay here because you're safest here. And once we get Jane sorted out, we can go and find Hannah'."" He returned to Jane's side and waited until more police officers arrived. They made efforts to resuscitate the mother of three. But Jane didn't survive and died with her friend by her side. He spent the next two hours trying to reunite himself with both of his daughters. Hannah had ended up in a nearby hotel, while Charlotte had been brought out of the car park by a police officer as it was being cordoned off. Three years on, his family are still living with the haunting memories of the night. Sean has suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and says he's struggled with a range of emotions. ""It troubles me as to whether I could have done something different. Whether had [the emergency services] been there sooner, the outcome would have been better. ""It troubles me that my daughters had to wait such a long period of time, Charlotte, in particular, to know exactly what was going on. For her, that's so traumatic."" Asked if he feels like a hero, Shaun looks awkward. ""No. I don't like labels."" He says he stayed with Jane because he would ""hope somebody would do that for me in those circumstances"". ""I think it's just humanity to be honest with you. There's probably not enough of it, but I was always brought up that way. I know I'd never do anything different."" For survivor Martin Hibbert, the lack of official recognition for the ordinary people who chose to help has been a source of increasing frustration and anger. Not least because he feels their accounts are crucial to piecing together the facts about how the emergency response played out. Martin remembers little from the hours immediately after the bomb, and it's no wonder; he was hit by 22 separate pieces of shrapnel, including a bolt in his neck which severed an artery, and one in his back which has paralysed him from the waist down. His only thought was for his teenage daughter, who was also severely injured and lying next to him on the foyer floor. ""I knew that I probably wasn't going to make it,"" he says. ""I was striving to stay alive really to make sure she got out. When I saw her being carted off, that's when the curtains came down."" In the three years since, Martin has attempted to piece together the details of what happened to him and his now 18-year-old daughter, but he says it hasn't been easy. He feels that many details in the official reports into the aftermath of the bombing do not tally with the eyewitness accounts of those who were there. He and others have now formed a network of survivors who can speak with a common voice; but because their bid to play a formal role in the public inquiry has been denied and they don't have access to all the evidence, Martin says many gaps still remain. Only since the inquiry started has he discovered he arrived at Salford Royal hospital at 1:45am; more than three hours after the explosion, but only a 15 minute drive from the arena. The inquiry has been told all the injured had been moved out of the foyer by 11:40pm - an hour after the blast. ""So what happened to me for two hours after that?"" he says. He can only assume he was lying on the station concourse. When he did finally arrive at hospital, he was given 14 pints of blood. For Martin, proper recognition of the bravery of these members of the public is long overdue and he says, their voices need to be heard. ""As everybody ran out, they ran in. ""Police, fire and ambulance, they are trained for that, but people like Daren Buckley and Rob Grew aren't. For a member of the public to have that instinct, it takes a very special person to do that."" He says for the world not to know about what these people did ""just feels wrong"". ""They don't want a Queen's honour, or a medal, or a pin badge. They just want recognition for what they did, and recognition that they were there."" Dozens of awards recognising the bravery of police officers, medical staff and other emergency responders have been given out in the years since the Arena attack. A ceremony recognising the 'supreme courage' of British Transport Police officers and railway staff was held in January 2018, honouring the 'breathtaking bravery' of those who helped. In October 2018 police sniffer dog Mojo was awarded the animal equivalent of an OBE - the PDSA Order of Merit, for his bravery after spending the night searching for secondary explosives. Medics received a Pride of Britain award in 2017, while officers from Greater Manchester Police and charity workers were recognised in the Queens Honours in 2019 for their work in the aftermath of the attack.

What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis,"In August 2017, a deadly crackdown by Myanmar's army on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing across the border into Bangladesh. They risked everything to escape by sea or on foot a military offensive which the United Nations later described as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". In January 2020, the UN's top court ordered the Buddhist-majority country to take measures to protect members of its Rohingya community from genocide. But the army in Myanmar (formerly Burma) has said it was fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians. The country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi, once a human rights icon, has repeatedly denied allegations of genocide. Described by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as ""one of, if not the, most discriminated people in the world"", the Rohingya are one of Myanmar's many ethnic minorities. The Rohingya, who numbered around one million in Myanmar at the start of 2017, are one of the many ethnic minorities in the country. Rohingya Muslims represent the largest percentage of Muslims in Myanmar, with the majority living in Rakhine state. They have their own language and culture and say they are descendants of Arab traders and other groups who have been in the region for generations. The country where Facebook posts whipped up hate But the government of Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country, denies the Rohingya citizenship and even excluded them from the 2014 census, refusing to recognise them as a people. It sees them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Since the 1970s, Rohingya have migrated across the region in significant numbers. Estimates of their numbers are often much higher than official figures. In the last few years, before the latest crisis, thousands of Rohingya made perilous journeys out of Myanmar to escape communal violence or alleged abuses by the security forces. The exodus began on 25 August 2017 after Rohingya Arsa militants launched deadly attacks on more than 30 police posts. Rohingyas arriving in Bangladesh said they fled after troops, backed by local Buddhist mobs, responded by burning their villages and attacking and killing civilians. At least 6,700 Rohingya, including at least 730 children under the age of five, were killed in the month after the violence broke out, according to medical charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF). Amnesty International says the Myanmar military also raped and abused Rohingya women and girls. This video can not be played The BBC saw the remains of burned villages on a tightly controlled government trip to Rakhine state The government, which puts the number of dead at 400, claims that ""clearance operations"" against the militants ended on 5 September, butBBC correspondents have seen evidencethat they continued after that date. At least 288 villages were partially or totally destroyed by fire in northern Rakhine state after August 2017, according to analysis of satellite imagery by Human Rights Watch. The imagery shows many areas where Rohingya villages were reduced to smouldering rubble, while nearby ethnic Rakhine villages were left intact. Human Rights Watch say most damage occurred in Maungdaw Township, between 25 August and 25 September 2017 - with many villages destroyed after 5 September, when Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said security force operations had ended. A report published by UN investigators in August 2018 accused Myanmar's military of carrying out mass killings and rapes with ""genocidal intent"". The ICJ case, lodged by the small Muslim-majority nation of The Gambia, in West Africa, on behalf of dozens of other Muslim countries, called for emergency measures to be taken against the Myanmar military, known as Tatmadaw, until a fuller investigation could be launched. Aung San Suu Kyi rejected allegations of genocide when she appeared at the court in December 2019. This video can not be played How did this peace icon end up at a genocide trial? But in January 2020, the court's initial ruling ordered Myanmar to take emergency measures to protect the Rohingya from being persecuted and killed. While the ICJ only rules on disputes between states, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has the authority to try individuals accused of war crimes or crimes against humanity. The body approved a full investigation into the case of the Rohingya in Myanmar in November. Although Myanmar itself is not a member of the court, the ICC ruled it had jurisdiction in the case because Bangladesh, where victims fled to, is a member. Will Omar get justice for his murdered family? Myanmar has long denied carrying out genocide and says it is carrying out its own investigations into the events of 2017. The country's Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) admitted that members of the security forces may have carried out ""war crimes, serious human rights violations, and violations of domestic law"", but claimed there was no evidence of genocide. Its full report has not yet been released, but questions have been raised. With more than half a million Rohingya believed to still be living in Myanmar's northern Rakhine province, UN investigators have warned there is a ""serious risk that genocidal actions may occur or recur"". The situation that led to ""killings, rapes and gang rapes, torture, forced displacement and other grave rights violations"" in 2017 remained unchanged, the investigators said in September, blaming a lack of accountability and Myanmar's failure to fully investigate allegations or criminalise genocide. Rakhine province itself is the site of an ongoing conflict between the army and rebels from the Buddhist-majority Rakhine ethnic group. The massive numbers of refugees who fled to Bangladesh in 2017 joined hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who had fled Myanmar in previous years. Kutupalong, the largest refugee settlement in the world according to UNHCR, is home to more than 600,000 refugees alone. But in March 2019,Bangladesh announced it would no longer accept Rohingyafleeing Myanmar. While an agreement for the return of refugees was reached in early 2018, none returned. They said they would not consider going back to Myanmar unless they were given guarantees they would be given citizenship. What awaits any Rohingya refugees who return to Myanmar? And as a BBC investigation showed, even those considering returning in the future may not be able to, withvillages destroyed to make way for government facilities.
