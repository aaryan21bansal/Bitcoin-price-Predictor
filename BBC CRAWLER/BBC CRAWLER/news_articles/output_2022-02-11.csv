Swedish hitman guilty of doorstep murder,"Flamur Beqiri is the brother of Misse Beqiri, who appeared in Real Housewives Of Cheshire A Swedish hitman has been found guilty of murdering a man in front of his family in a tit-for-tat gang war. Flamur Beqiri, 36, was shot in the back of the head on the doorstep of his home in Battersea, south-west London, in front of his wife and toddler on Christmas Eve 2019. The gunman, 24-year-old kickboxer Anis Hemissi, was convicted following a two-week trial at Southwark Crown Court. Fellow Swede Estevan Pino-Munizaga, 35, was found guilty of manslaughter. Tobias Andersson, 32, and Bawer Karaer, 23, also from Sweden, were acquitted of both charges. Esteven-Alexis Pino-Munizaga (l) was found guilty of manslaughter, while Anis Fouad Hemissi (r) was convicted of murder The court heard that Mr Beqiri was a kingpin in an international drugs gang and had been targeted as part of a feud with a rival organised crime group. He was shot a number of times in a killing that had been six months in the planning. The killers came to London from Sweden before returning. A local team - Clifford Rollox, 31, from Islington, north London, and Dutch national Claude Isaac Castor, 31, from Sint Maarten in the Caribbean, who were hired to ""tidy up"" the aftermath, were found guilty of perverting the course of justice. Clifford Rollox (l) and Claude Isaac (r) were both found guilty of perverting the course of justice Hemissi was caught on CCTV wearing a latex mask as he opened fire 10 times with a pistol, hitting Mr Beqiri with eight bullets from behind. He had earlier disguised himself as a litter picker to carry out reconnaissance. Hemissi, wearing a latex mask, posed as a street cleaner in the days before the shooting, Southwark Crown Court heard The following day he was filmed wearing a different mask The jury was not told that he had previously been a suspect in the murder of a man shot dead in Malmo, but had never been charged. Louise Attrill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the ""international assassination"", was ""a shocking, cold-blooded and brutal murder of a man in front of his young family on Christmas Eve. ""The intention was clear - to kill."" She added that ""multiple shots"" had been ""fired at close range"", and the murder had been ""deliberately carried out in a way that would cause maximum terror and trauma given the date, place and circumstances"". Flowers were left in Battersea Church Road after the shooting Mr Beqiri, who had joint Swedish and Albanian nationality, claimed to be in the music business but had been involved in the international drugs trade since 2007. He was the brother of The Real Housewives Of Cheshire reality television participant, Misse Beqiri. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said she would sentence those found guilty over his killing on 18 February.

Low-income families 'let down' by payment scheme,"Charities say the UK and Scottish governments have let down low income families Charities have claimed the Scottish government's cost-of-living payment scheme will let down low-income families. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes announced on Thursday thata Â£150-per-household payment will be givenin a bid to offset rising prices. Anti-poverty campaigners have accused her of spreading support too thinly. Ms Forbes insisted the package was the ""quickest way"" to get cash where it was needed. The Poverty Alliance said it was ""deeply disappointing"" that the Scottish scheme mirrored UK government plans to funnel support through the council tax system. They said the measures failed to properly target support at people on the lowest incomes and that it was ""a missed opportunity to protect people living in poverty from the waves of hardship that threaten to overwhelm them"". Chris Birt, from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said she had let people down. He said: ""This isn't just about energy bills, although that's the worst of it. Food prices, travel prices, etc are all piling up for families. ""Governments can make different choices to support low-income families and both the chancellor and Kate Forbes have let them down by spreading this support far too thin."" Ms Forbes told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programmesaid she was ""very conscious"" of the foundation's position, and also criticism from Age Scotland and the Poverty and Inequality Commission. She said: ""I said very clearly that I didn't think this was a perfect scheme and it had to be seen in the context of other, more targeted support. ""Ultimately this is a question of how we deliver support to families who needed it yesterday. We could design a perfect scheme that could take a number of months to deliver, but my priority is to try to get that money out of the door quickly."" Why are energy bills going up? Why are prices rising so quickly? She added that what she announced was just part of a range of funding which could help struggling families, including the Â£10m fuel insecurity fund, Â£41m winter support fund,  Â£41m from the Scottish welfare fund, and Â£80m in discretionary housing payments. She also highlighted a doubling of the carers allowance supplement and the Â£40 Scottish child payment for under sixes. But she said: ""I am open and honest that we need to go further, that it is about food costs and energy costs and both governments need to work together because many of those levers, particularly around energy regulation, are with the UK. The Â£150 payment will go to households in council tax bands A to D and all of those eligible for council tax reduction. It means some 1.85 million households - 73% of the total - will receive Â£150 of support when those elements are combined. The cash is in addition to Â£120m allocated to local government in a bid to hold down council tax increases in the coming year. The National Union of Students in Scotland said they ""absolutely stunned"" that students will not be eligible for the Â£150 payment because they do not pay council tax. NUS Scotland President Matt Crilly said he wants a meeting with ministers to resolve the issue, adding: ""Students face the same energy bill hikes as everyone else, but our support doesn't increase by the cost-of-living and many of us receive no support whatsoever during the summer."" Students in halls of residence are exempt from council tax The finance secretary said cash would go to households in council tax bands A to D and all of those eligible for council tax reduction. People who get a reduction are generally single-person households, disabled people, some students and some households with children. Those who won't get the payment because they are exempt from paying council tax are: young people leaving care students who live alone or share the rent with other students students living in halls of residence households with someone who is severely mentally impaired. Ms Forbes said her plans would ensure the money would get to households as early as possible in the next financial year, potentially by April. She said that by using the council tax reduction scheme, the government could identify the families most in need. The finance secretary added: ""I accept this will reach some households that may not need it, but it is the only route we have to make sure we reach those for whom it will make a  difference quickly and simply and I have deemed that to be the priority here."" She said for those who are exempt from paying council tax, the Scottish government would look at other ways to provide support. Ms Forbes also urged the UK government to work together with Scotland's administration to do more to counteract the growing crisis. She said: ""On a household level, we are looking at estimates that could suggest about 874,000 fuel-poor households, that is an increase of 43% on the most recent 2019 published statistics. That is a significant increase."" The debate continues around the best way to target financial help for those Scots struggling to pay their gas and electricity bills. Some believe it's pointless giving cash to everyone in council tax bands A-D because even though everyone is feeling the squeeze, there are around 600,000 people in extreme fuel poverty who are facing a tsunami of uncontrollable and unaffordable household bills. Amid the noise, it's worth pointing out the average council tax debt is around Â£3,500. Campaigners have told me taking Â£150 off a council tax bill will not make a major difference. Citizens Advice believe the best way to assist people at the sharp end of this crisis would be making direct payments as that would go some way to alleviating day-to-day household pressures rather than paying down existing debt. Government officials agree to an extent but are aware of the time sensitivities in helping families now. They feel it's better to rush out money quicker than going down the time-consuming route of creating a brand new system.

Cost of pasta and tomatoes jump as shop prices rise,"The price of pasta, tinned tomatoes and strawberry jam jumped last year as the cost of supermarket staples rose, new figures for the BBC suggest. Overall, the price of a basket filled with 15 standard food items rose by Â£1.32, or 8%, in just one year. Changes in the average cost of the food items at Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco were tracked by retail research firm Assosia. Some items fell in price, with carrots and mild cheddar seeing small declines. The same basket of food made up of items from the cheaper ""value"" ranges at the supermarkets recorded an overall fall in price, down 45p, or 4%. But within that, items such as pasta and vanilla ice cream saw rises of more than 6%. Other items the firm tracked in the new research for BBC News included tortilla chips, fish fingers, honey, blueberries, carrots and lemons. Although official figures suggest that the overall cost of living increased by 5.4% in the year to December, this number - known as the inflation rate - can mask some steep rises seen at the tills, especially on everyday items. There are many factors that can make it difficult to track how prices are changing for households, such as promotions at supermarkets or a lack of availability of certain products. Asda, for example, recentlypledged to stock its budget ranges in all of its 581 supermarketsand online after complaints from anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. ""Looking at food prices is a bit of a minefield"", says Kay Staniland, director at Assosia.  Her company selected a snapshot of popular products that were comparable across the value and standard ranges. ""I think the figures show that retailers are trying to avoid the biggest increases to value lines as much as possible. But these value lines do make up a small part of total ranges. The standard mid-tier range is where the largest volume of sales come from,"" she says. Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer magazine, also tracks a weekly basket of goods and how prices differ across the supermarket aisles.  He says ""we're now in a 'once in a generation' moment for food inflation in the UK"". ""We've not seen anything like this since the financial crash in 2008. And this is just the start. It's going to go on for two or two and a half years, probably as various costs and problems filter through into the system."" Inflation is everywhere in the food supply chain, he says, from rising energy and labour costs to raw materials and packaging. Marmite maker set to raise prices as costs soar âHow can we afford anything with bills this high?â Why are prices rising so quickly? The supermarkets are now grappling with how much of these costs to pass on. ""The food market is incredibly competitive and if you put your prices up ahead of the competition, the shopper will notice.  Right now, more than ever, price is the major focus for the shopper. And they will vote with their feet,"" he says. Shoppers such as Fernanda Almeida have already been feeling the pinch, though. Fernanda Almeida says she now cooks meals from scratch to save money She lives with her partner in Worcester and the pair used to purchase ready-meals, or pots of instant porridge, which he could take along to his military barracks where cooking space is limited. But after the shopping bill went up by about Â£20 a week, they introduced some changes. ""Our shopping has changed completely... we're definitely cooking from scratch a lot more now because it just works out cheaper,"" Fernanda says. She says she feels ""worried"". ""I've gone from someone who has a budget per month but goes to the shop without a list, picks up things that I fancy eating, to planning each meal, checking items off against the list."" She's noticed that tinned items in particular have gone up in price and it can often be cheaper to buy individual items for recipes in larger supermarkets, even in comparison with discount stores like Aldi or Lidl. Vimbai Gwata-St John in Bexley has seen her food shop go up by about Â£20 a week, too. Vimbai Gwata-St John: ""The one thing you can't compromise on is food"" As a mum to an 18-week-old baby with food intolerances she has had to chop and change what they are buying from week to week. She says she used to follow a budget strictly until she became ill during her pregnancy. ""Because of that, we didn't have time or ability to track our expenses, we just bought what we needed out of desperation because of the other problems at that point in our lives."" Now she is trying to get the budget back on track and is looking at couponing or starting to buy items such as toilet paper or nappies in bulk. Although prices are going up across the board, she says: ""The one thing you can't compromise on is food."" How supermarkets manage their own inflationary pressures will have consequences for millions of households. And the least well-off, which spend a bigger share of income on essentials such as food and energy, are less able to absorb soaring prices in the aisles. The big four supermarket chains have learned from the mistakes they made in 2008, when they put prices up. Aldi and Lidl swooped, stealing customers and market share. Their businesses have since doubled in size and are still opening new stores. ""It's a real dog-eat-dog situation,"" says Adam Leyland. ""The battleground is value. And they are determined to stop them (the discounters) making further grounds. For instance, Tesco and Sainsbury's are price-matching Aldi. Cost cutting, shrinkflation - reducing the size of a product but not the price - and cutting back on expensive ingredients are just some of the tactics that retailers are using to mitigate the rising cost of groceries. But the trend is clear. Assosia recorded more than 17,000 price increases across the main supermarkets last month, more than double the number in the same month last year, and across every category. ""Inflation is everywhere"" says Mr Leyland. And he agrees withthe recent warning from John Allan, the chairman of Tesco, that the worst is yet to come.

'Illegal' protest spurs Ontario state of emergency,"Ontario has declared a state of emergency in response to two weeks of protests against Covid restrictions. The order came as protests continue to restrict traffic on a border bridge that is vital for US-Canada trade. Blocking crucial infrastructure would be made ""illegal"" under the order, punishable by up to a year in jail and C$100,000 ($79,000; Â£58,000) in fines. On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with US President Joe Biden about the border blockades. The pair discussed their ""shared challenges at the border"", Mr Trudeau said, with the prime minister promising quick action to resume trade. Addressing Canadians on Friday, Mr Trudeau applauded Ontario's measure and said that ""everything is on the table"" to ensure the demonstrations are brought to an end. Trucker protests force Canada car plant shutdowns US urges Canada to end blockade by truckers Arrests as Ottawa warned of 'volatile' protesters ""It is it is time to go home,"" he said. ""The consequences are becoming more and more severe."" Mr Trudeau insisted that the ""unlawful activity"" would end, but said military intervention has not yet been seriously considered. By Robin Levinson-King, BBC News, Windsor About 100 vehicles - pickup trucks, SUVs and articulated lorries - were parked along the road leading up to the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, festooned with Canadian Flags and signs proclaiming ""Freedom"". The atmosphere was noticeably more subdued on Friday than previous evenings, protesters told the BBC. If the Ottawa protest has made national headlines for its noise and bluster, then the Windsor bridge blockade has left its mark by making millions of dollars of daily trade come to a halt. The area was mostly quiet, save for the occasional honking horn and the stereo sound of Bruce Springsteen's ""Dancing in the Dark."" Speaking to the BBC, former cross-border truck driver Hank, who did not want to give his last name, said he was there to support his friends who've lost their jobs. ""We want our freedoms back, we want mandates lifted,"" he said. ""We want life to go back to the old normal not the new normal."" With a judge considering an injunction, and a state of emergency declared, most protesters are waiting to see if police make their move. Hank says he thinks their time in Windsor is running out: ""We can't fight behind bars. We have to keep it peaceful,"" he said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the province's emergency order would apply to anyone impeding the movement of goods, people and services along international border crossings, airports, ports and major highways. The Canadian province will also provide additional authority so that the personal and commercial licences of protesters who do not comply may be cancelled. ""Your right to make a political statement does not outweigh the right of hundreds of thousands of workers to earn their living,"" Mr Ford said. The country-wide protests against Covid-19 vaccine mandates are poised to enter their third weekend. A ""Freedom Convoy"" was organised last month in response to the introduction of a new rule that all truckers must be vaccinated to cross the US-Canada border, or quarantine upon their return. The protest has since grown into a broader challenge to all Covid health restrictions. The vast majority of Canadian truckers are vaccinated and trucking associations have distanced themselves from the protests, noting most drivers are still working. Thousands of demonstrators have congregated in central Ottawa, others have blocked the Ambassador Bridge - which links Windsor, Ontario, with Detroit, Michigan - and a handful of other border crossings. Authorities have warned members of the public to avoid Emerson, a small border town in Manitoba, where trucks and farm equipment are currently clogging the US border. The trade disruption has been estimated to cost some C$380m ($300m; Â£221m) each day. Smaller protests have been held in Toronto and Quebec City, as well as near provincial legislatures in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British Columbia. The mayors of Ontario's biggest cities issued a joint statement on Monday, condemning the ""irresponsible and damaging"" actions of the protesters, calling for all governments to bring the demonstrations to a peaceful end. On Friday afternoon, Canada's capital city filed an injunction with Ontario's Superior Court against people continuing to violate Ottawa's bylaws, aimed at those making noise, idling, fireworks, and encroachments on highways. Also on Friday, the Superior Court justice delayed hearing an application for another injunction that would stop protesters blocking Canada-bound traffic at the Ambassador Bridge. US officials have urged Canada's government to use its federal powers to end the blockade - especially of the Ambassador Bridge - which has already hit the automobile industry either side of the border. The White House said this week that US officials had been engaged with their Canadian counterparts to help resume trade along the border. Premier Ford's Friday announcement marks the first state of emergency in the province since April, when Ontario implemented its third emergency order over Covid-19 transmission. In recent days Mr Ford had faced criticism for not doing more to stop the convoy blockade in Ottawa. And while he repeatedly denounced the weeks-long demonstration on Friday, he also indicated the province would be moving to lift existing Covid-19 restrictions, including the vaccine ""passport"" system which requires proof of vaccination to enter indoor public settings like gyms and restaurants.

Record high deforestation of Amazon in January,"Deforestation usually slows down in January because the rainy season prevents loggers accessing the forest The number of trees cut down in the Brazilian Amazon in January far exceeded deforestation for the same month last year, according to government satellite data. The area destroyed was five times larger than 2021, the highest January total since records began in 2015. Environmentalists accuse Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro of allowing deforestation to accelerate. Protecting the Amazon is essential if we are to tackle climate change. Trees are felled for their wood as well as to clear spaces to plant crops to supply global food companies. At the climate change summit COP26 in Glasgow last year, more than 100 governments promised to stop and reverse deforestation by 2030. The latest satellite data from Brazil's space agency Inpe again calls into question the Brazilian government's commitment to protecting its huge rainforest, say environmentalists. ""The new data yet again exposes how the government's actions contradict its greenwashing campaigns,"" explains Cristiane Mazzetti of Greenpeace Brazil. Greenpeace are calling on supermarkets in the UK and elsewhere to drop suppliers who are involved in deforestation from their meat and dairy supply chains suppliers. Deforestation totalled 430 square kilometres (166 square miles) in January - an area more than seven times the size of Manhattan, New York. Which countries are cutting down trees? The illegal Brazilian gold you may be wearing An indigenous leader trying to protect the Amazon Felling large numbers of trees at the start of the year is unusual because the rainy season usually stops loggers from accessing dense forest. Brazil's vast rainforest absorbs huge amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, acting as what's known as a carbon sink. But the more trees cut down, the less the forest can soak up emissions. This video can not be played A logger, an environmental policeman, a cattle rancher and an environmentalist share their views on the Amazon's future But the area is also home to communities who say they need to use the forest for mining and commercial farming in order to make a living. At the same time, indigenous communities living in the Amazon fight to protect the rainforest and their ways of life. Mr Bolsonaro has weakened environmental protections for the region and argued that the government should exploit the area to reduce poverty. There are a number of factors driving this level of deforestation. Strong global demand for agricultural commodities such as beef and soya beans is fuelling some of these illegal clearances - Another is the expectation that a new law will soon be passed in Brazil to legitimise and forgive land grabbing. The Brazilian government argues that in the period between August last year and January 2022, overall deforestation was lower compared to the same period twelve months ago. Environmentalists say that they are not surprised by the record January felling, given that President Bolsonaro has significantly weakened legal protections since he took office in 2019. At the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year, Mr Bolsonaro was one of the world leaders who promised to halt and reverse deforestation by the end of this decade. Political observers argue that despite this change in tone, the policies on the ground remain the same.

Spain relaxes Covid restrictions for UK teenagers,"Unvaccinated British teenagers will be allowed into Spain from Monday with a negative PCR test, Spanish tourism minister Fernando ValdÃ©s has told the BBC. At the moment everyone over 12 has to be double-jabbed to enter the country. Some families had already cancelled half term holidays to Spain and the Canary Islands because their children had not yet had their second jab. People aged 18 and over must still be vaccinated to get into the country. What Covid tests do I still need to travel abroad? Mr ValdÃ©s said that 12-to-17 year-olds who have not been vaccinated against Covid will be allowed into the country from Monday 14 February, if they present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival to Spain. The restrictions will be lifted from 23:00 GMT on 13 February. ""Great Britain is our main market,"" said Mr ValdÃ©s. ""We've been always very keen in easing the restrictions between both countries."" Spanish tourism minister Fernando ValdÃ©s All other UK travellers, excluding children under 12, will need to present a Covid certificate showing proof of being fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arrival in Spain. If more than 270 days have passed since vaccination, proof of a booster jab is also required. Prior to travelling, air passengers have to show a QR code, which they get by filling in aSpanish health control form,external. The announcement comes after many UK familiescancelled half-term tripsto mainland Spain and the Canary Islands due to the jab restrictions. Hoteliers in the islands said the restrictions had lost them millions of pounds' worth of trade. However, hundreds of thousands of people are embarking on half-term winter sun and ski trips,according to industry body Abta,external. Have you been affected by Spain's rule change? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy The UK scrapped coronavirus testing for fully vaccinated travellers from 04:00 GMT on Friday. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps described this as ""good news"" for families. ""The UK has eased international travel measures for Covid-19 and now has one of the most free-flowing borders in the world - sending a clear message that we are open for business,"" he said. The Canary Islands, Egypt, Portugal and Turkey are popular destinations for British holidaymakers, Abta said, as are the Caribbean, Dubai, Florida and Mexico. Bookings to ski resorts in France, Italy and Switzerland have also picked up, it said. The easing of restrictions on Friday came as Gatwick Airport announced that it wouldreopen its south terminal on 27 March,external. The terminal has been mothballed since 15 June 2020 as the airport tried to contain costs during the slump in international travel caused by the Covid pandemic. Gatwick's south terminal will reopen in March Now the terminal is reopening as airlines are starting to increase the number of flights they are operating. British Airways is to restart short-haul flights from Gatwick from 29 March and sister airline Vueling will add five new short-haul routes from the airport. Easyjet and Hungarian carrier Wizz Air have also added more slots. Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate said: ""After an incredibly challenging two years for the airport, our partners, local communities and the entire aviation industry, we are delighted to be reopening our south terminal next month. The airport has been ""recruiting for some time"", it said, and is still looking for 2,000 staff in roles including security officers, IT specialists, engineers, shop and restaurant workers, ground and cargo handlers and cabin crew. Despite signs of recovery in the travel industry, Heathrow Airport gave a downbeat assessment of passenger confidence on Friday. It said that demand for travel had been weaker than expected in January - 56% down on pre-pandemic levels -  ""as the hangover from Omicron continued to suppress passenger confidence"". ""While bookings for outbound tourism are recovering, inbound tourism and business travel remain weak due to Covid-19 levels in the UK and other countries, international testing requirements and the risk of new border closures in the event of a new variant of concern,"" it said. Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the removal of restrictions for vaccinated passengers in and out of the UK ""offers a ray of hope, but the Omicron hangover proves demand remains fragile"". But some travel firms are more optimistic. This week Tui chief executive Fritz Joussen said the firm expected ""a strong summer"", adding that ""demand for travel is high across all markets"". New bookings for the summer were above pre-Covid crisis levels Tui and the group expects summer bookings as a whole to be close to pre-pandemic levels. Jet2 boss Steve Heapy predicted the Spanish government's relaxation of restrictions would lead to an increase in bookings from the UK. ""The removal of the requirement for 12-17 year olds to be double-vaccinated tells families that travelling to Spain is returning to normal, and after two years of missing out we know how much everyone wants to experience that famous Spanish sunshine again,"" Mr Heapy said. The chair of Hays Travel, Dame Irene Hays, told the Today programme this week that the independent travel agent had seen a spike in bookings. ""In the last week of January we were back to the same levels of bookings as we were in January 2020,"" she said. How are travel rules being relaxed?

Wales' mask and isolation laws could end in March,"Face masks will still be required until at least the end of March Wales' remaining Covid laws - including on face coverings and self-isolation - could be scrapped by the end of March. The Welsh government says falling case rates mean it can begin to ease its remaining rules, with domesticCovid passrules axed from 18 February. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said self-isolation rules could change from being law to guidance next month. But the law will remain for now, despite UK government proposals to ease the restriction in Englandin February. Mr Gething said the prime minister's move is not based on scientific advice. Meanwhile rules on masks will be eased from 28 February so they are only required in shops, salons, hairdressers, public transport and health and social care. They will no longer be mandatory in other venues such as museums or cinemas. Pupils will not have to wear masks in class from the same date - schools can then decide their rules. Secondary pupils, visitors and staff will still need to wear masks in indoor physical areas where physical distancing is not possible. As it happened: Plans to ease Wales' Covid restrictions outlined What are Wales' Covid rules now? Wales' first minister tests positive for Covid From next Friday Covid passes will no longer be legally required at cinemas, theatres, clubs and large events, although businesses can still use them if they want to. They will still apply for another week, including for Wales v Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday. This video can not be played Mr Gething said the latest moves provided a pathway to seeing Covid ""properly in the rear view mirror"". Although there is no precise timetable, it is the first time the Welsh government has said how it may completely lift its pandemic regulations. The Welsh Conservatives called for a date for the removal of all Covid laws, while Plaid Cymru said Labour ministers should spell out what criteria must be met for the restrictions to be scrapped. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Mr Gething announced that officials were keeping a close eye on a new transmissible version of the Omicron variant, called BA.2. He said there had been reports that the variant was behind a surge of cases in Northern Ireland. There are 246 cases in Wales. The economy minister told BBC News the remaining restrictions in Wales may be removed at the end of March. ""At that point we may move to self-isolation being guidance rather than mandatory but at this point we think it is still important to have that as a protective measure in law,"" he said. He said that the move will depend on the evidence of government advisers at the time. A further Covid review is due by 3 March. Separately, from 11 February guidance will be updated to clarify that adults can remove their face coverings when interacting with babies and small children at baby and toddler groups. Guidance will remain recommending that people wear face coverings where they can when indoors, or in large crowds of people, Mr Gething said. In England Boris Johnson said that self-isolation rules could end by 21 February. Mr Gething said this was a""highly unusual"" move by the prime ministerwhich had not been discussed between the Welsh government's and the UK government's chief medical officers. He was asked what would happen to someone who had Covid who lived in England but came to work in Wales without self-isolating, Mr Gething said that person would be ""in breach of the law"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said his government was ""confident that coronavirus rates are falling and we can look forward to brighter times ahead"". But he said he would not remove all measures at once ""because the pandemic is not over yet"". Leandra Craine is concerned too many restrictions are being lifted at once Leandra Craine, 23, who works for Disability Wales, said she was worried too many restrictions were being eased at once. ""I especially think of friends and family members who are immuno-supressed and have been having to shield for two years,"" she added. ""I don't think we should go back to normal as was, as I don't think it was working too well... I think there should be a new normal."" Phillip Francis questioned how well the passes had worked Covid passes, which show evidence of vaccination as well as whether someone has tested negative for Covid in the last 48 hours, have been required to entering nightclubs and other entertainment venues. Phillip Francis, who works at Mocka Lounge nightclub in Cardiff, questioned how effectively the system had worked. ""A lot of people who I asked for Covid passes, all they did was take snapshots of their friend's Covid passes, and were showing me their friend's pass,"" he said. Claire Vaughan, cinema programme manager for Chapter in Cardiff, was happy to see Covid passes go. She said older people ""can get confused with Covid passes, they may be uncomfortable with digital and wonder if they are still valid and just not come"". Dafydd Rhys, director of Aberystwyth Arts Centre, said it was good news Covid passes will no longer be required. Customers will need to continue to wear masks in shops until at least sometime in March. Caitlin Jones, manager of Dylan's Den Crystal shop, in Aberystwyth, said: ""As a business we don't mind that the requirement to wear masks in shops stays as long as staff are protected and we can keep trading."" Dafydd Rhys, director, Aberystwyth Arts Centre, praised the lifting of Covid passes. He said: ""It is great news for venues across Wales - there is no doubt about that as it did add to our costs in terms of human resource as more staff were needed to check the passes, and it slowed down the whole process for people coming to the theatre or the auditorium."" Mr Gething led Friday's press conference on the latest Welsh government review because Mr Drakeford was self-isolating after hetested positive for Covid. The economy minister said Welsh Labour leader was ""fine all things being considered"", and was able to work ""through most of yesterday"". Denmarkis already there, as isSweden, and earlier this week Boris Johnson indicated the remaining Covid restrictions inEnglandcould end later this month. Wales, it seems, could be in a similar position come the end of March. Reaching that point would mark an incredibly significant milestone in the history of this pandemic - a full shift from government rules to personal responsibility. Long overdue, some will say. After all, the state doesn't legally instruct you how to deal with other illnesses. Others will question how such a move would square with Welsh ministers' narrative of a steady as she goes, cautious approach when there are still relatively high levels of transmission. All decisions, Vaughan Gething stressed today, will be ""supported by the latest public health advice"". We've long been told that we need to learn to live with Covid. Next month we'll get the government's plan as to how they intend to make that a reality. The most reliable measure now of infections is the weekly swab survey from the Office for National Statistics. It estimates that one in 25 people - around 4% of the population - had Covid in the week ending 5 February, a decrease. Covid case rates, based on positive test results, are more complicated to interpret, as they no longer include thousands of people who test positive with lateral flow tests. But even if we roughly calculate case numbers to include those ""missing"" lateral flow positive tests, the figures would still be more than 60% down on the peak in January. Numbers of patients in hospital with Covid have levelled out in the last week but remain much lower than last winter. There was a rolling average of 522 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on Thursday, down slightly (7%) on a week ago, while Covid patients in critical care and admissions have also flattened out. Nearly 70% of patients with a positive test for Covid in the last week were being treated primarily for other conditions. However, there are hundreds of former Covid patients now ""recovering"" and still waiting to be discharged, while acute bed occupancy is at record levels. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Covid passes have been required for large events such as football matches since last year Opposition politicians called for the Welsh government to spell out the way forward. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""The trend of infections, hospitalisations and deaths is downwards, a positive progression that shows the diminishing threat of the pandemic. ""Given these positive developments and the success of the vaccination campaign, this must mean that our freedoms in Wales are returned in full without delay."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth urged the Welsh government to ""keep things steady in the very real hope that we won't need to take a step back to any further restrictions in the future"". ""In the meantime, the Welsh government must set out the steps for what criteria must be met for all restrictions to be lifted in Wales."" Laws requiring the wearing of masks in indoor spaces were introduced in Wales in September 2020. The UK government lifted mask requirements in England last summer, before briefly reintroducing them for the Omicron wave at the end of 2021.

"I'm sorry and ashamed, says Plymouth gunman's dad","This video can not be played Mark Davison has spoken to the BBC six months after his son shot and killed five people The father of a man who shot dead five people has said he is ""sorry"" and ""ashamed"" of his son's actions. Jake Davison, 22, killed hismother at her home and then four other people, including a three-year-old girl, outside in Keyham, Plymouth, in August. His father, Mark Davison, said he told police in 2017 he did not think his son should be allowed a shotgun. Devon and Cornwall Police said an independent investigation was ongoing into its firearms licensing procedures. Mr Davison, who was divorced from his son's mother, Maxine Davison, said he had seen his son when he could. He said his Christian faith had helped him turn his own life around after spending time in prison. ""I don't know what was going on with him,"" he added. ""If I could say sorry any better than I can, if I could change it I really would. I am sorry and I am ashamed."" The killings happened just weeks after Jake Davison's shotgun and licence were returned to him by Devon and Cornwall Police. Mr Davison said: ""That three-year-old little girl, and the other victims. People just going about their lives, going to the park or going to the shop, taking the dog or whatever they were doing. ""Whatever Jake's mitigation was it's still no form of defence. He shouldn't have done that. He shouldn't have had a gun in the first place."" Clockwise from top left: Maxine Davison, Lee and Sophie Martyn, Stephen Washington and Katherine Shepherd -Maxine Davison, 51 The mother of Jake Davison was the first person killed. The former trawler woman was shot dead at her home in Biddick Drive, Keyham, Plymouth, shortly after 18:00 BST on 12 August 2021. -Lee Martyn, 43 The married carpenter, was killed alongside his daughter, Sophie. Relatives said he ""had the kindest heart, would do anything for anybody"" and that ""you only had to take one look at him to see how much he loved and adored his family"". -Sophie Martyn, three She was killed as she walked the family dog with her father in Biddick Drive. Relatives said the family had been ""truly blessed"" to have ""seen you grow into such a beautiful, funny and clever girl"" over the three years of her life. -Stephen Washington, 59 He was shot and killed by Davison in a park close to Biddick Drive as he walked the family dog. In a tribute, his family said their world ""has been turned upside down in the blink of an eye"" with the death of a ""loving husband, father, grandfather and best friend"". -Katherine Shepherd, 66 Mrs Shepherd, known as Kate, was shot outside a hair salon on Henderson Place and later died from her injuries at Derriford Hospital. She was married and friends described her as a ""very talented artist"". Davison injured two other people before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life. The shotgun and licence had been seized in 2020 after Davison assaulted two teenagers in a park. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating how the force approved his application and then later gave him back the weapon. In the wake of the shooting, the Home Office announced police would have to checksomeone's medical history before they issued a gun licence. Five people were killed and two people were injured in the mass shooting in Keyham, Plymouth Mr Davison said he called the police in 2017, and had concerns about his son's mental health. ""I told them. I said I don't want him to have a shotgun,"" he said. ""I said I remember him asking me for an air rifle when he was younger. I said 'I'm not buying you a point 22 air rifle son... without me there to supervise that'. ""Why did he even need one in the first place? He lived in the city. ""If he was a farmer or whatever it was ... then yes maybe then, but he shouldn't have had the gun in the first place."" The community of Keyham has received additional support since the shootings Devon and Cornwall Police said it was co-operating with the IOPC investigation and providing all information required. A spokesman said: ""Individual contacts with Jake Davison by members of his family, members of the public or agencies that are known to us, or exist within our systems, form part of that investigation. ""The outcome of that investigation will be shared by the IOPC with the families, coroner and ourselves at a later date. ""As a result, Devon and Cornwall Police is unable to comment further on any matters that are subject to independent investigation and review."" As well as the coroner and IOPC's investigations, the National Police Chiefs' Council is also leading an inquiry, in conjunction with the local police and crime commissioner, into the force's firearms policies and procedures. The force spokesman added: ""In addition, there is currently an ongoing peer review of Devon and Cornwall Police's firearms licensing procedures. ""This was a review commissioned by the force following events in August 2021. ""The review is not an investigation of any potential fault by an individual or the organisation. ""It focuses on the processes within the Firearms Licensing Unit, compliance with Home Office guidelines and most importantly ensuring we have the national best practice available to us as we move forward."" The IOPC said it was still working on its report and would publish its findings as soon as possible. A spokesman for the IOPC added: ""We can confirm we have spoken to Mr Davison and his statement that he made a call to Devon and Cornwall Police has been considered and reported on as part of our independent investigation.""

Macron refused to take Russian Covid testA source says the health procedure was unacceptable amid reports France was protecting Mr Macron's DNA.Europe,"The four-metre table between Mr Putin and Mr Macron was widely commented upon French President Emmanuel Macron refused a Russian Covid test ahead of his meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin has confirmed. The test required a health protocol that was unacceptable and did not fit with the French leader's schedule, a French source told the BBC. It follows reports that Mr Macron refused the PCR test over fears the Russians would get hold of his DNA. The leaders subsequently held a socially-distanced meeting on Monday. They did not shake hands and sat with a four-metre-long table between them, with observers wondering whether Mr Putin was using it to send a diplomatic message. But French diplomatic sources told Reuters that Mr Macron had been told to choose between accepting a Russian PCR test to get closer to Putin or abide by strict social distancing rules. ""We knew very well that meant no handshake and that long table. But we could not accept that they get their hands on the president's DNA,"" one of the sources told Reuters. The source did not elaborate on how the Russian intelligence services could exploit Mr Macron's DNA. A source at the ElysÃ©e Palace told the BBC: ""The conditions imposed for the meeting to take place with no social distancing required a health protocol which were according to us unacceptable and incompatible with the president's schedule."" The Kremlin confirmed that Mr Macron had been kept at a distance from the Russian leader because he had declined to take a Russian test. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia understood the French position and it had not affected the talks. Mr Macron had carried out a PCR test before leaving France and his doctor carried out an antigen test once they were in Moscow, another French diplomatic source told Reuters. ""The Russians told us Putin needed to be kept in a strict health bubble,"" the second source told Reuters. For decades, spies have profiled foreign leaders - trying to understand their personality, how they might react to situations and how long they might last in office. Part of that is understanding their health. That used to be hard. But advances in science mean that one sample of DNA can now unlock powerful insights into someone's past, present and even future - is a foreign leader hiding an illness or particular condition or are they susceptible to one in the future? The US security community has recently claimed that China has been gathering large amounts of health data about a wide range of people. It has issued warnings for people to be careful what they share, arguing DNA is ""the most valuable thing you own"" and saying that unlike losing a credit card, you cannot replace your DNA once someone else has the details. More than a decade ago, the US itself was accused of trying to get hold of biometric data, including DNA, belonging to foreign diplomats. All of this is a sign that biometric intelligence is now a key part of security. Cheers from a distance! President Putin (right) and Hungarian PM Orban (left) drink champagne at a Kremlin reception Mr Macron is not the only leader to have been subjected to the Kremlin's ""long-table"" diplomacy - earlier this year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi were also seen sitting at a distance from Mr Putin during their visits to Moscow. The Kremlin has taken extra precautionary measures to protect Mr Putin, who later this year turns 70 and who has been given Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, from getting infected. However, only three days after meeting Mr Macron, Mr Putin hosted Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. The pair shook hands and sat with a small coffee table between them. The table between Mr Putin and Mr Tokayev was much smaller During their meeting Mr Macron and Mr Putin spoke for five hours about the tensions over Ukraine.

UK economy rebounds with fastest growth since WW2,"The UK economy rebounded last year with growth of 7.5% despite falling back in December due to Omicron restrictions, official figures show. It was the fastest pace of growth since 1941, although it came after a dramatic 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut. In December, the economy shrank 0.2% as Omicron restrictions hit the hospitality and retail sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the economy had been ""remarkably resilient"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures,externalshowed that in the last three months of 2021 growth was 1%, which ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said was ""pretty healthy"" given Omicron's spread and the introduction of some restrictions. The figures were stronger than expected, and Mr Morgan told the BBC the expansion in 2021 showed the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of nations. However, he urged caution about making strict comparisons. ""The growth in 2021 comes from a low base in 2020, when the economy fell sharply,"" Mr Morgan said. ""And if you look at where the UK economy is now, compared to its pre-pandemic level... the UK is middle of the pack, compared with the G7."" He said using this comparison, the US, Canadian and French economies were above the UK's, while the UK was above Italy, Germany and Japan. The worst of the overall pandemic economic hit is now behind us but the aftershocks remain. Downing Street is unlikely to avoid the opportunity to boast about 2021. During its hosting of the G7, the UK is now confirmed as the fastest growing economy of these major nations. But that comparison needs a great dollop of context. The 7.5% growth the UK economy recorded in 2021 is the highest of the G7 major economies and that does indicate a strong bounceback. This, as the ONS points to, should be seen alongside the sharpest fall of 9.4% for the UK compared to those same economies in 2020. On the internationally comparable basis, the economy is still slightly smaller than it was at the end of December 2019, unlike the US, France and Canada. On the slightly more timely basis, using monthly data not available in other countries, the UK economy is larger than it was in February 2020. The UK economy grew by 1% in the final quarter of 2021, a little lower than expectations, as the spread of the Omicron variant weighed on the economy in December. But as ever during these extraordinary times, this already looks like a rear view mirror on events. Looking forward, the extraordinary cost of living squeeze, with energy and other prices leading to falls in average living standards, is the significant iceberg for the economy in 2022. The ONS said that despite the fall in December, on a monthly basis GDP was in line with its pre-coronavirus level in February 2020. However, GDP in the October-to-December quarter remains 0.4% below its pre-Covid levels in the final three months of 2019. What is GDP and how does it affect me? Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Mr Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that despite Omicron the economy was remarkably resilient. We were the fastest growing economy in the G7 last year and are forecast to continue being the fastest growing economy this year. ""But I know that people are worried about rising prices, particularly energy bills... and that's why last week we announced a significant package of support to help millions of families meet the cost of bills."" Last year's growth was the strongest since ONS records began in 1948 and the fastest since 1941, during World War Two, using data collected by the Bank of England. The slump of 9.4% in 2020 was the biggest drop since 1919 when there was demobilisation after World War One. After 18 months of uncertainty, Ollie Vaulkhard's coffee shop and restaurant chain in north east England was seeing a strong end to 2021. He told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme that October and November were great months for the Vaulkhard Group as the economy opened up, but then things started to slow when Omicron hit. ""We lost customers, we lost staff to isolation and we had people being cautious because they had plans for Christmas."" He doesn't regard December as a disaster, more a loss of momentum. ""We lost the fizz off the top of a glass of champagne,"" he said. A better December would have been a good launch into 2022, when Mr Vaulkhard expects some tough times. ""We have wage cost rises, we have supply cost rises, we've had some brewery costs going up by 7% - they are all large,"" he said. The pandemic and lockdown kept a lid on costs for two years, but suddenly it's changing. ""I would prefer not to have them [price rises], but given the challenges we had this seems like another bridge to cross that we'll have to find a way over."" The economy is expected to face headwinds in 2022. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates, cut its economic growth forecast from 5% to 3.75% for this year and predicted that households were about to suffer the sharpest fall in living standards since records began three decades ago. This, said Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, would mean the economy will ""crawl"" this year and see the slowest growth of any G7 country. ""The reality is the way the government runs our economy is trapping us in a high tax, low growth cycle,"" he said. Inflation is forecast to hit 7% in April, the same month workers and firms will start to see a rise in their National Insurance (NI) contributions. Mr Sunak has been under pressure to scrap the NI increase, but vowed this month that it would go ahead. Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said he expected output lost during December and January to be regained in February and March, ""meaning that Omicron should not have had a lasting impact on the economy"". But he warned that consumer spending power would take a big hit in 2002. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, said that ""crippling"" inflation, tax rises in April, and higher energy bills means ""the UK economy is facing a materially weaker 2022"".

The test required a health protocol that was unacceptable and did not fit with the French leader's schedule, a French source told the BBC. It follows reports that Mr Macron refused the PCR test over fears the Russians would get hold of his DNA. The leaders subsequently held a socially-distanced meeting on Monday. They did not shake hands and sat with a four-metre-long table between them, with observers wondering whether Mr Putin was using it to send a diplomatic message. But French diplomatic sources told Reuters that Mr Macron had been told to choose between accepting a Russian PCR test to get closer to Putin or abide by strict social distancing rules. ""We knew very well that meant no handshake and that long table. But we could not accept that they get their hands on the president's DNA,"" one of the sources told Reuters. The source did not elaborate on how the Russian intelligence services could exploit Mr Macron's DNA. A source at the ElysÃ©e Palace told the BBC: ""The conditions imposed for the meeting to take place with no social distancing required a health protocol which were according to us unacceptable and incompatible with the president's schedule."" The Kremlin confirmed that Mr Macron had been kept at a distance from the Russian leader because he had declined to take a Russian test. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia understood the French position and it had not affected the talks. Mr Macron had carried out a PCR test before leaving France and his doctor carried out an antigen test once they were in Moscow, another French diplomatic source told Reuters. ""The Russians told us Putin needed to be kept in a strict health bubble,"" the second source told Reuters. For decades, spies have profiled foreign leaders - trying to understand their personality, how they might react to situations and how long they might last in office. Part of that is understanding their health. That used to be hard. But advances in science mean that one sample of DNA can now unlock powerful insights into someone's past, present and even future - is a foreign leader hiding an illness or particular condition or are they susceptible to one in the future? The US security community has recently claimed that China has been gathering large amounts of health data about a wide range of people. It has issued warnings for people to be careful what they share, arguing DNA is ""the most valuable thing you own"" and saying that unlike losing a credit card, you cannot replace your DNA once someone else has the details. More than a decade ago, the US itself was accused of trying to get hold of biometric data, including DNA, belonging to foreign diplomats. All of this is a sign that biometric intelligence is now a key part of security. Cheers from a distance! President Putin (right) and Hungarian PM Orban (left) drink champagne at a Kremlin reception Mr Macron is not the only leader to have been subjected to the Kremlin's ""long-table"" diplomacy - earlier this year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi were also seen sitting at a distance from Mr Putin during their visits to Moscow. The Kremlin has taken extra precautionary measures to protect Mr Putin, who later this year turns 70 and who has been given Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, from getting infected. However, only three days after meeting Mr Macron, Mr Putin hosted Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. The pair shook hands and sat with a small coffee table between them. The table between Mr Putin and Mr Tokayev was much smaller During their meeting Mr Macron and Mr Putin spoke for five hours about the tensions over Ukraine.

Russian figure skater's failed drug test confirmed,"Valieva has continued to practise ahead of her individual event Kamila Valieva, the 15-year-old Russian figure skating star who helped her team win Winter Olympic gold in Beijing, failed a drugs test in December. Valieva, who was the first female skater to land a quadruple jump at an Olympics as her team won last Monday, had a sample collected on 25 December at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St Petersburg. But the positive result was only reported on Tuesday - the day after she helped to win team gold, but before the medal ceremony had taken place. Valieva case puts Russia & doping back in spotlight Valieva tested positive for trimetazidine, which is used in the prevention of angina attacks, but is on the banned list because it is classed as a cardiac metabolic modulator and has been proven to improve physical efficiency. A series of appeals means this case will now be taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to make a final ruling - with International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams saying he wanted a resolution ""as quickly as possible"". The medals for the team event - in which the United States finished second, Japan third and Canada fourth - will not be awarded until the outcome of the Cas hearing. A spokesman for the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it will ""take comprehensive measures in order to protect the rights and interests of the members of the ROC team and to preserve the honestly won Olympic gold medal"". Rusada - the Russian anti-doping agency - said on Friday that it is investigating Valieva's support team to ""identify all the circumstances of a possible anti-doping rule violation"". Cas will now hear the case before Valieva's scheduled appearance in the individual women's figure skating event, which starts next Tuesday, 15 February. The International Testing Agency (ITA) said Valieva had a sample collected on25 Decemberat the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St Petersburg. The sample was sent to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)-accredited laboratory in Stockholm, Sweden. Valieva competed in the European Figure Skating Championships in Tallinn, Estonia, inJanuary- which was between the positive test and the Winter Olympics - and won the women's singles, with Russian claiming a clean sweep of the gold medals. The ROC pointed out that Valieva's samples taken at the Europeans and before the Beijing Winter Olympics were both negative, adding: ""Taking into account that the positive doping sample of the athlete was not collected during the Olympic Games, the results of the athlete and the results of the team event during the Olympic Games are not automatically subject to review."" The adverse finding was reported on7 Februaryand Valieva was notified of the positive result on8 February. Valieva was provisionally suspended but she challenged the decision and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) agreed to lift it on9 February -enabling her to continue at the Beijing Games. Because of her age, Valieva was not confirmed as the athlete at the centre of ""legal issues"" delaying the medal ceremony, until it was widely reported in the media on10 February. The ITAconfirmed those reports,externalon11 Februarybecause of ""heightened public interest"". The International Olympic Committee, Wada and the International Skating Union (ISU) have all now appealed against Rusada's lifting of the provisional ban, with the ISU calling on the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to reinstate it. The ITA said the ""reasoned decision, including the grounds for which the provisional suspension was lifted, will be issued shortly to all concerned parties"". Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdnyakov told the Tass News Agency that the long gap between the 25 December test and the 8 February result looked suspicious and that he had ""serious questions about the process"". Rusada, the Russian anti-doping agency, claimed that the delay in processing Valieva's sample was due to Covid-19 cases at the Swedish laboratory that was analysing them. This video can not be played Kamila Valieva lands historic quadruple jump Valieva, who is favourite for the women's singles, has been seen training at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing. Eric Myles, chief sport officer of the Canadian Olympic Committee, said: ""We have the same questions as everyone else about the team figure skating case. ""It's important that a fair process unfolds and the integrity of sport is protected. Our hope is that this is resolved quickly and the medallists get the medal moment they've earned here in Beijing."" Russian athletes are competing under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee because Russia received a two-year ban from Wada in 2019 for its state-sponsored doping programme. Between 17 December 2020 and 17 December 2022, no athlete can represent Russia at the Olympics, Paralympics or World Championships. The ban was originally for four years but was reduced to two by Cas. Germany's Katarina Witt, a two-time Olympic figure skating champion, said: ""What they knowingly did to her, if true, cannot be surpassed in inhumanity and makes my athlete's heart cry infinitely. ""Kamila Valieva is a young girl and child prodigy, whose highly difficult performances and grace enchanted the whole world at only 15, a minor, depending on adults and she is not to blame here."" United States Anti-Doping Agency head Travis Tygart said: ""It is a catastrophic failure of the system to allow the star of the Games to have her sample not reported back close to five weeks, and then it gets reported the day after they won the team event."" BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott in Beijing After days of intense media speculation, the ITA have confirmed that the 15-year-old prodigy Kamila Valieva from Russia tested positive for a banned substance. Valieva is the favourite for gold in the women's singles figure skating event which begins on Tuesday (15 February) which means this whole process needs to be expedited. At the heart of this is a 15-year-old athlete. There are concerns over her welfare and the potential involvement of others in this. But viewers would be forgiven for feeling a sense of depressing deja vu that once again we are at an Olympics, there is a doping controversy and it involves Russia. Russia is still serving sanctions, but for many people they are Russia in all but name. Many people will be questioning whether they should have been allowed to compete at all, given the country's past with doping issues.

Biden says US citizens should leave Ukraine now,"Ukrainian forces have been carrying out exercises amid concerns of a Russian invasion US President Joe Biden has called on all American citizens remaining in Ukraine to leave the country immediately, citing increased threats of Russian military action. Mr Biden said he would not send troops to rescue Americans if Moscow invades Ukraine. Several other countries, including the UK, also urged their citizens to leave. Russia has repeatedly denied any plans to invade Ukraine despite massing more than 100,000 troops near the border. But it has just begunmassive military drillswith neighbouring Belarus, and Ukraine has accused Russia ofblocking its access to the sea. The Kremlin says it wants to enforce ""red lines"" to make sure that its former Soviet neighbour does not join Nato. Five ways out of Ukraine conflict Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up? ""American citizens should leave now,"" Mr Bidentold NBC News,external. ""We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly."" Asked whether there was a scenario that could prompt him to send troops to rescue fleeing Americans, Mr Biden replied: ""There's not. That's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another. We're in a very different world than we've ever been."" A host of other countries, including the Netherlands, Japan and South Korea have also told their citizens to leave Ukraine. In its warning Latvia cited ""a serious threat to security posed by Russia"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on a visit to Australia, said on Friday that ""an invasion could begin at any time, and to be clear, that includes during the Olympics"". The Winter Olympics in China are scheduled to end on 20 February. This video can not be played Iâm staying in Ukraine, for now: Watch US citizen and English teacher Juan Tec explain why Diplomatic efforts are under way to defuse the current crisis over Ukraine. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned his counterpart in Moscow that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would have ""tragic consequences"" for both countries. But Sergei Shogiu said growing military tensions in Europe were ""not our fault"". The current tensions come eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula. Since then, Ukraine's military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in eastern areas near Russia's borders. Meanwhile, Ukraine accused Russia of blocking its access to the sea as Russia prepared for naval exercises. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the Sea of Azov had been completely blocked and the Black Sea almost fully cut off by Russian forces. Russia's naval exercises were due to take place next week in the two seas to the south of Ukraine, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. However, Ukraine's Border Guard Service said on Friday that Russia had told them it had cancelled its drill in the Sea of Azov, an internal sea bordered by both Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine's port authority later said restrictions there had been lifted. Russian naval drills were already taking place in Crimea on Friday, while 10 days of military exercises continued in Belarus, to the north of Ukraine. There are fears that if Russia tries to invade Ukraine, the exercises put the Russian military close to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, making an attack on the city easier. Russia says its troops will return to their permanent bases after the drills end. Ukraine has launched its own 10-day military exercises, though officials have given few details. Moscow says it cannot accept that Ukraine - a former Soviet republic with deep social and cultural ties with Russia - could one day join the Western defence alliance Nato and has demanded that this be ruled out. Russia has been backing a bloody armed rebellion in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region since 2014. Some 14,000 people - including many civilians - have died in fighting since then. There is some suggestion that a renewed focus on the so-called Minsk agreements - which sought to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine - could be used as a basis to defuse the current crisis. Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany backed the accords in 2014-2015. Are you in Ukraine and affected by what's happening? Are you a US citizen in Ukraine?

LiveLiveSpain relaxes jab rules as half-term getaway begins1 minute ago,"Unvaccinated 12-17-year-olds will be able to travel from the UK to Spain with a negative test from Monday Previously people aged over 12 could only visit Spain if they were double-vaccinated It comes as rules change in the UK too - people travelling here no longer need to take any tests if fully vaccinated Travel association Abta describes the easing of Covid restrictions as a ""new chapter"" Hundreds of thousands of people are heading away as the half-term holidays start in many parts of the UK Covid passes will no longer be required in Wales from next Friday as cases there fall The Downing Street lockdown parties probe will not be affected by Met Police chief Cressida Dick's departure, a London Assembly member says Edited by James Clarke That's all from us today. Our Friday updates of coronavirus news have been brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Jo Couzens, Jeremy Gahagan, Matt Murphy, Nathan Williams, Chris Clayton and James Clarke. We'll be back with more Covid coverage next week. We'll shortly be closing our live coverage of the day's events, as Covid restrictions continue to be eased and the half-term getaway begins. Here's a quick roundup of today's developments: As theWelsh government announces the relaxing of further coronavirus restrictions, we've heard some doubts as to the effectiveness of Covid passes from a security guard who works at a bar and nightclub in Cardiff. Phillip Francis says when he's asked customers for their passes, all many of them did was take snapshots of their friendâs certificates and show him the duplicates. He says he's never been sure how well the pass system has worked in terms of making the venue Covid secure. Havingembarrassed French President Emmanuel Macronearlier this week with some furniture-based diplomacy, Vladimir Putin has yet again used a table to illustrate a political message. The Russian leader received Kazakh
President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev at the Kremlin on Thursday. The two men shook hands and
sat close to each other, divided only by a small coffee table. The scene contrasted strongly with Macron's visit on Monday, where the pair were separated by a four-metre long table after the French president refused to take a PCR test. Sources at the ElysÃ©e Palace told Reuters that Macron had refused to take the test over fears the Russians would get hold of his DNA. The French president is not the only leader to have been subjected to the Kremlin's ""long-table"" diplomacy. Earlier this year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi were also seen sitting at a distance from Mr Putin during their visits to Moscow. The Kremlin has taken extra precautionary measures to protect Mr Putin, who turns 70 later this year and has been vaccinated with Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. By Richard Daniel & Rachael McMenemy At Stansted airport, as the UK lifts travel restrictions for the vaccinated, queues are forming once again at the check-in desks and there is a hint of holiday fever in the air. Londoner Ruth Reynolds, 27, is travelling to Tenerife with a friend - her first holiday since lockdown in March 2020. ""We both just wanted to get away. It's been a long two years - I have not left the country since before the last lockdown, so it's just a chance to relax and be warm,"" she says. The easing of restrictions ""made a big difference"" to her decision to travel now, she says, because she feels more confident about the travel landscape. And not having to pay for PCR tests was a huge financial relief and made travelling ""a lot less complicated"". ""I'm really happy to be travelling - it's a lot easier than before,"" she tells the BBC. So how are her fellow passengers feeling?Do they share her excitement? Earlier on we learned that Spain is lifting some of its Covid rules for travellers. That change in guidance, has come as welcome news for one family who feared they wouldn't be able to travel to the Canaries later this month. Leanne Ronksley, from South Yorkshire, was worried that her holiday would be cancelled due to Spain's current rule that everyone over 12 has to be double-jabbed to enter the country. From Monday, unvaccinated British teenagers will be able to present a negative PCR test instead. Leanne says she is ""absolutely relieved"" with the development and can now focus ""on just going on holiday"". She can't wait to tell her daughter the news when she returns from school and the family can finally get ""excited about going away"". Buen viaje Leanne! Airline Jet2 says bookings for February half-term have taken off since
travel rules were relaxed - up by 30% over the last four weeks compared to the same period in 2020. It has been driven by strong demand
for holidays to theCanary Islands, Spain and Portugal- as well as ski flights toGeneva, Grenoble, Lyon, Chambery, Lyon, Innsbruck,
SalzburgandBarcelona[for Andorra], says the airline. It tells the BBC it is also seeing strong demand for holiday bookings this summer, withSpain, the Canary Islands, Balearic
Islands, PortugalandItalyall looking set for a busy summer. Greece, TurkeyandCyprusare also proving popular choices for British holidaymakers in the summer months, it adds. And while the UK's rules may have changed, travellers will still have to abide by local regulations at their destination You can read about what the rules are for British visitorsin some popular international holiday spots here. Hundreds of thousands of Covid cases could be missed from the UK's official figures each week, new analysis shows - despite the recent move to start including reinfections. An average of just over 100,000 people
tested positive each day from 16 to 22 January, according to the government's
coronavirus dashboard. But the true number of cases each day
was likely to be nearer 280,000, according to estimates by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS). It means more than 1.2
million cases will not have been included in the official count during the week
to 22 January. The difference in figures reflects the fact the dashboard only counts people who have reported themselves testing positive. In contrast, the ONS figures are based on analysis of swabs taken from a representative sample of more than 150,000 people. The same people are tested every week, irrespective of whether they have had symptoms or not, and the ONS uses those results to estimate the likely prevalence of cases across the whole population. Meanwhile in the US, we've learned that roughly 3,000 teachers,
firefighters and other New York City workersface losing their jobs after failing to meet the city's deadline to get jabbed. Despite days of protests against the vaccine mandate, New York
City Mayor Eric Adams says he will not change the rules that were announced by
his predecessor Bill de Blasio last year. More than 95% of staff have complied with the rule, but opponents
say the requirement violates their freedom, with one former teacher telling the
BBC: ""You don't force people to do this."" Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News A decision on whether all five to 11-year-old children should be
offered a Covid vaccine was expected this to be announced this afternoon, but
has now been pushed back to early next week. The UKâs vaccine advisory body, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), has clearly made a
decision â although itâs not clear what it is. However, the timing of it is in
the hands of ministers. So what might they have considered? Only children in this age group with underlying conditions, which put them at
high risk from Covid, are currently eligible for a vaccine - two low-dose
injections of Pfizer. With most healthy children at very low risk from the virus,
including Omicron, and around 70% of primary school age having already been
infected, vaccine experts have a tough call to make on the health benefits. When 12-15-year-olds were recommended to have the vaccine in
September, they said it was a finely-balanced health decision. Other factors,
such as keeping children in school, tipped the balance in favour of
vaccinating. In younger age groups, some experts say vaccines will come too late
to make a difference to the risk of children being infected or reduce absences
in schools â particularly with the more contagious Omicron. Others say vaccines could help protect children against long
Covid. Many countries, such as the US, Israel and Denmark, have
vaccinated millions of over-fives. Others have gone further. Cuba, for example, is vaccinating
toddlers as young as two, while China is jabbing three-year-olds. Unison says the health of vulnerable people and colleagues must
not be left to individual choice â if self-isolation requirements come to an
end later this month, as outlined by the PM on Wednesday. Any changes to official guidance could lead to some employers
insisting that staff work despite virus risks or face penalties for choosing
not to come in, the union says. ""Ditching Covid rules while the virus rages suggests public
health is less important to the prime minister than saving his job,"" says
Unison general secretary Christina McAnea. ""Putting a match to sensible safety measures, without
providing guidance to employers, is reckless and will cause confusion and
alarm. ""People will take the virus into work â and school, risking
the health of colleagues and commuters. Anyone vulnerable will rightly feel
they've been flung under the bus.""
She called on ministers to ""provide clarity to employers and workers""
across all sectors of the economy, backed up by ""a proper sick pay system
that rewards people properly for doing the right thing"". Spain's relaxing of rules for children entering the country is ""another positive step towards the full resumption of travel"", says Tui. The travel company says: ""Spain has always been one of the most sought after family
hotspots. ""We hope that with these changes, along with the relaxation of
testing coming back into the UK, more families will now feel reassured of a
holiday in their favourite destination this summer."" Another 34,203 people in the UK have their booster or
third dose of a coronavirus vaccine, government figures show. In total, 65.5% of the population over the age of 12 has now had three jabs. A further 58,899 coronavirus
cases have been reported in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures,external. There have
also been another 193 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. A look at the figures for the past week shows the recent trend of falling cases and deaths continues - cases over the past seven days are down 28.7% on the week before and deaths down 22.5%. Stephen McDonellBBC News, China correspondent Despite pursuing a tough ""dynamic-zero"" policy to contain coronavirus
- and unlike Japan during last summer's games - China has found a way to put
some spectators in the stands during the Winter Olympics. Through a complicated configuration dividing arenas into sections,
authorities have been able to invite fans to events and avoid them coming into
contact with those in the two bubble zones - the teams competing and the
locked-in sports media. To be chosen as a spectator for these Olympic events, you are most
likely to be from a Communist Party organisation, a state company, or a student
group. There are also local government officials with tickets to the Games,
sponsors, and a smattering of diplomats. The planners have decided that such groups can be easily counted on to
do what needs to be done (especially when compared to the general public). Then there is another category of people, of which I am one, who are
being allowed in to see these supreme athletes compete: foreign correspondents. We have to do a Covid test 96-hours prior to any event, then a second
test 24 hours before. According to the rules, this is then followed up with a
third test three days after and a fourth test a week later. Read more about how China is managing the games here. Spain's easing of travel ruleshas come as positive news for those longing for winter sun this half-term, but for one family we spoke to it's come too late. Chris Place arrived in Tenerife today with his 22-year-old son for a week's holiday with extended family. However, his wife and 14-year-old daughter remain back in the UK. He says it was a ""flick of a coin"" to decide who stayed behind to look after his daughter, who is yet to receive her second vaccination and therefore can't currently travel. From Monday, unvaccinated British teenagers will be allowed into Spain if they present a negative PCR test. Chris is frustrated that Spain's announcement has ""come too late to help many families"". Returning briefly to the Welsh governmentâs coronavirus briefing
earlier, it looks possible that all Covid restrictions in Wales could be lifted
by the end of March. Asked if keeping rules in place for longer than England is about
playing politics, Welsh economy minister Vaughan Gething said: ""The
measures we are taking are on the back of expert scientific advice and public
health advice from our chief medical officer. ""And we'll continue to take that advice as we do look
forward to a time when there can be no restrictions in place. ""It is possible that will come at the end of March, if the
public health position remains positive."" He also responded to a question about reports the UK government
is considering defunding universal lateral flow tests, saying it would be
""a really significant mistake"". ""Coronavirus is still in circulation, so it doesn't feel
like a sensible thing to be doing it at this point."" Strict coronavirus restrictions have seen celebrations for the anniversary of the Iranian revolution scaled back for the second year running. Prior to the event, authorities had decreed that there was to be ""no gathering or marching"" to mark the day. Instead, thousands of Iranians celebrated the 43rd anniversary of the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi by driving through the capital, Tehran, chanting slogans including ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"". Despite the restrictions and chilly temperatures, celebrants converged on the capital's iconic Azadi Square on bikes and motorcycles, while others had painted their cars in the red, white and green colours of the Iranian flag. The country has been heavily hit by Covid. More than 133,000 people have died from the virus, and another 6.5 million have been infected since the pandemic began. Gripped by the Omicron variant, Iran has recently seen new coronavirus cases spiral past more than 30,000 a day. Nearly 65% of the country's 88 million strong population have received at least two doses of a vaccine. London Luton Airport chief says it's been ""a very difficult
couple of years"" â but with the easing of some of travel rules, at least
in the UK, things are looking up. ""I get the impression we're starting to see the light at
the end of the tunnel and there are lots of reasons to be optimistic,""
says Alberto Martin. All testing requirements were removed for fully-vaccinated

Swedish hitman guilty of doorstep murderAnis Hemissi flew from Denmark as a professional hitman to kill father-of-two Flamur Beqiri.,"Flamur Beqiri is the brother of Misse Beqiri, who appeared in Real Housewives Of Cheshire A Swedish hitman has been found guilty of murdering a man in front of his family in a tit-for-tat gang war. Flamur Beqiri, 36, was shot in the back of the head on the doorstep of his home in Battersea, south-west London, in front of his wife and toddler on Christmas Eve 2019. The gunman, 24-year-old kickboxer Anis Hemissi, was convicted following a two-week trial at Southwark Crown Court. Fellow Swede Estevan Pino-Munizaga, 35, was found guilty of manslaughter. Tobias Andersson, 32, and Bawer Karaer, 23, also from Sweden, were acquitted of both charges. Esteven-Alexis Pino-Munizaga (l) was found guilty of manslaughter, while Anis Fouad Hemissi (r) was convicted of murder The court heard that Mr Beqiri was a kingpin in an international drugs gang and had been targeted as part of a feud with a rival organised crime group. He was shot a number of times in a killing that had been six months in the planning. The killers came to London from Sweden before returning. A local team - Clifford Rollox, 31, from Islington, north London, and Dutch national Claude Isaac Castor, 31, from Sint Maarten in the Caribbean, who were hired to ""tidy up"" the aftermath, were found guilty of perverting the course of justice. Clifford Rollox (l) and Claude Isaac (r) were both found guilty of perverting the course of justice Hemissi was caught on CCTV wearing a latex mask as he opened fire 10 times with a pistol, hitting Mr Beqiri with eight bullets from behind. He had earlier disguised himself as a litter picker to carry out reconnaissance. Hemissi, wearing a latex mask, posed as a street cleaner in the days before the shooting, Southwark Crown Court heard The following day he was filmed wearing a different mask The jury was not told that he had previously been a suspect in the murder of a man shot dead in Malmo, but had never been charged. Louise Attrill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the ""international assassination"", was ""a shocking, cold-blooded and brutal murder of a man in front of his young family on Christmas Eve. ""The intention was clear - to kill."" She added that ""multiple shots"" had been ""fired at close range"", and the murder had been ""deliberately carried out in a way that would cause maximum terror and trauma given the date, place and circumstances"". Flowers were left in Battersea Church Road after the shooting Mr Beqiri, who had joint Swedish and Albanian nationality, claimed to be in the music business but had been involved in the international drugs trade since 2007. He was the brother of The Real Housewives Of Cheshire reality television participant, Misse Beqiri. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said she would sentence those found guilty over his killing on 18 February.

LiveLiveSpain relaxes jab rules as half-term getaway beginsLess than a minute ago,"Unvaccinated 12-17-year-olds will be able to travel from the UK to Spain with a negative test from Monday Previously people aged over 12 could only visit Spain if they were double-vaccinated It comes as rules change in the UK too - people travelling here no longer need to take any tests if fully vaccinated Travel association Abta describes the easing of Covid restrictions as a ""new chapter"" Hundreds of thousands of people are heading away as the half-term holidays start in many parts of the UK Covid passes will no longer be required in Wales from next Friday as cases there fall The Downing Street lockdown parties probe will not be affected by Met Police chief Cressida Dick's departure, a London Assembly member says Edited by James Clarke That's all from us today. Our Friday updates of coronavirus news have been brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Jo Couzens, Jeremy Gahagan, Matt Murphy, Nathan Williams, Chris Clayton and James Clarke. We'll be back with more Covid coverage next week. We'll shortly be closing our live coverage of the day's events, as Covid restrictions continue to be eased and the half-term getaway begins. Here's a quick roundup of today's developments: As theWelsh government announces the relaxing of further coronavirus restrictions, we've heard some doubts as to the effectiveness of Covid passes from a security guard who works at a bar and nightclub in Cardiff. Phillip Francis says when he's asked customers for their passes, all many of them did was take snapshots of their friendâs certificates and show him the duplicates. He says he's never been sure how well the pass system has worked in terms of making the venue Covid secure. Havingembarrassed French President Emmanuel Macronearlier this week with some furniture-based diplomacy, Vladimir Putin has yet again used a table to illustrate a political message. The Russian leader received Kazakh
President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev at the Kremlin on Thursday. The two men shook hands and
sat close to each other, divided only by a small coffee table. The scene contrasted strongly with Macron's visit on Monday, where the pair were separated by a four-metre long table after the French president refused to take a PCR test. Sources at the ElysÃ©e Palace told Reuters that Macron had refused to take the test over fears the Russians would get hold of his DNA. The French president is not the only leader to have been subjected to the Kremlin's ""long-table"" diplomacy. Earlier this year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi were also seen sitting at a distance from Mr Putin during their visits to Moscow. The Kremlin has taken extra precautionary measures to protect Mr Putin, who turns 70 later this year and has been vaccinated with Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. By Richard Daniel & Rachael McMenemy At Stansted airport, as the UK lifts travel restrictions for the vaccinated, queues are forming once again at the check-in desks and there is a hint of holiday fever in the air. Londoner Ruth Reynolds, 27, is travelling to Tenerife with a friend - her first holiday since lockdown in March 2020. ""We both just wanted to get away. It's been a long two years - I have not left the country since before the last lockdown, so it's just a chance to relax and be warm,"" she says. The easing of restrictions ""made a big difference"" to her decision to travel now, she says, because she feels more confident about the travel landscape. And not having to pay for PCR tests was a huge financial relief and made travelling ""a lot less complicated"". ""I'm really happy to be travelling - it's a lot easier than before,"" she tells the BBC. So how are her fellow passengers feeling?Do they share her excitement? Earlier on we learned that Spain is lifting some of its Covid rules for travellers. That change in guidance, has come as welcome news for one family who feared they wouldn't be able to travel to the Canaries later this month. Leanne Ronksley, from South Yorkshire, was worried that her holiday would be cancelled due to Spain's current rule that everyone over 12 has to be double-jabbed to enter the country. From Monday, unvaccinated British teenagers will be able to present a negative PCR test instead. Leanne says she is ""absolutely relieved"" with the development and can now focus ""on just going on holiday"". She can't wait to tell her daughter the news when she returns from school and the family can finally get ""excited about going away"". Buen viaje Leanne! Airline Jet2 says bookings for February half-term have taken off since
travel rules were relaxed - up by 30% over the last four weeks compared to the same period in 2020. It has been driven by strong demand
for holidays to theCanary Islands, Spain and Portugal- as well as ski flights toGeneva, Grenoble, Lyon, Chambery, Lyon, Innsbruck,
SalzburgandBarcelona[for Andorra], says the airline. It tells the BBC it is also seeing strong demand for holiday bookings this summer, withSpain, the Canary Islands, Balearic
Islands, PortugalandItalyall looking set for a busy summer. Greece, TurkeyandCyprusare also proving popular choices for British holidaymakers in the summer months, it adds. And while the UK's rules may have changed, travellers will still have to abide by local regulations at their destination You can read about what the rules are for British visitorsin some popular international holiday spots here. Hundreds of thousands of Covid cases could be missed from the UK's official figures each week, new analysis shows - despite the recent move to start including reinfections. An average of just over 100,000 people
tested positive each day from 16 to 22 January, according to the government's
coronavirus dashboard. But the true number of cases each day
was likely to be nearer 280,000, according to estimates by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS). It means more than 1.2
million cases will not have been included in the official count during the week
to 22 January. The difference in figures reflects the fact the dashboard only counts people who have reported themselves testing positive. In contrast, the ONS figures are based on analysis of swabs taken from a representative sample of more than 150,000 people. The same people are tested every week, irrespective of whether they have had symptoms or not, and the ONS uses those results to estimate the likely prevalence of cases across the whole population. Meanwhile in the US, we've learned that roughly 3,000 teachers,
firefighters and other New York City workersface losing their jobs after failing to meet the city's deadline to get jabbed. Despite days of protests against the vaccine mandate, New York
City Mayor Eric Adams says he will not change the rules that were announced by
his predecessor Bill de Blasio last year. More than 95% of staff have complied with the rule, but opponents
say the requirement violates their freedom, with one former teacher telling the
BBC: ""You don't force people to do this."" Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News A decision on whether all five to 11-year-old children should be
offered a Covid vaccine was expected this to be announced this afternoon, but
has now been pushed back to early next week. The UKâs vaccine advisory body, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), has clearly made a
decision â although itâs not clear what it is. However, the timing of it is in
the hands of ministers. So what might they have considered? Only children in this age group with underlying conditions, which put them at
high risk from Covid, are currently eligible for a vaccine - two low-dose
injections of Pfizer. With most healthy children at very low risk from the virus,
including Omicron, and around 70% of primary school age having already been
infected, vaccine experts have a tough call to make on the health benefits. When 12-15-year-olds were recommended to have the vaccine in
September, they said it was a finely-balanced health decision. Other factors,
such as keeping children in school, tipped the balance in favour of
vaccinating. In younger age groups, some experts say vaccines will come too late
to make a difference to the risk of children being infected or reduce absences
in schools â particularly with the more contagious Omicron. Others say vaccines could help protect children against long
Covid. Many countries, such as the US, Israel and Denmark, have
vaccinated millions of over-fives. Others have gone further. Cuba, for example, is vaccinating
toddlers as young as two, while China is jabbing three-year-olds. Unison says the health of vulnerable people and colleagues must
not be left to individual choice â if self-isolation requirements come to an
end later this month, as outlined by the PM on Wednesday. Any changes to official guidance could lead to some employers
insisting that staff work despite virus risks or face penalties for choosing
not to come in, the union says. ""Ditching Covid rules while the virus rages suggests public
health is less important to the prime minister than saving his job,"" says
Unison general secretary Christina McAnea. ""Putting a match to sensible safety measures, without
providing guidance to employers, is reckless and will cause confusion and
alarm. ""People will take the virus into work â and school, risking
the health of colleagues and commuters. Anyone vulnerable will rightly feel
they've been flung under the bus.""
She called on ministers to ""provide clarity to employers and workers""
across all sectors of the economy, backed up by ""a proper sick pay system
that rewards people properly for doing the right thing"". Spain's relaxing of rules for children entering the country is ""another positive step towards the full resumption of travel"", says Tui. The travel company says: ""Spain has always been one of the most sought after family
hotspots. ""We hope that with these changes, along with the relaxation of
testing coming back into the UK, more families will now feel reassured of a
holiday in their favourite destination this summer."" Another 34,203 people in the UK have their booster or
third dose of a coronavirus vaccine, government figures show. In total, 65.5% of the population over the age of 12 has now had three jabs. A further 58,899 coronavirus
cases have been reported in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures,external. There have
also been another 193 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. A look at the figures for the past week shows the recent trend of falling cases and deaths continues - cases over the past seven days are down 28.7% on the week before and deaths down 22.5%. Stephen McDonellBBC News, China correspondent Despite pursuing a tough ""dynamic-zero"" policy to contain coronavirus
- and unlike Japan during last summer's games - China has found a way to put
some spectators in the stands during the Winter Olympics. Through a complicated configuration dividing arenas into sections,
authorities have been able to invite fans to events and avoid them coming into
contact with those in the two bubble zones - the teams competing and the
locked-in sports media. To be chosen as a spectator for these Olympic events, you are most
likely to be from a Communist Party organisation, a state company, or a student
group. There are also local government officials with tickets to the Games,
sponsors, and a smattering of diplomats. The planners have decided that such groups can be easily counted on to
do what needs to be done (especially when compared to the general public). Then there is another category of people, of which I am one, who are
being allowed in to see these supreme athletes compete: foreign correspondents. We have to do a Covid test 96-hours prior to any event, then a second
test 24 hours before. According to the rules, this is then followed up with a
third test three days after and a fourth test a week later. Read more about how China is managing the games here. Spain's easing of travel ruleshas come as positive news for those longing for winter sun this half-term, but for one family we spoke to it's come too late. Chris Place arrived in Tenerife today with his 22-year-old son for a week's holiday with extended family. However, his wife and 14-year-old daughter remain back in the UK. He says it was a ""flick of a coin"" to decide who stayed behind to look after his daughter, who is yet to receive her second vaccination and therefore can't currently travel. From Monday, unvaccinated British teenagers will be allowed into Spain if they present a negative PCR test. Chris is frustrated that Spain's announcement has ""come too late to help many families"". Returning briefly to the Welsh governmentâs coronavirus briefing
earlier, it looks possible that all Covid restrictions in Wales could be lifted
by the end of March. Asked if keeping rules in place for longer than England is about
playing politics, Welsh economy minister Vaughan Gething said: ""The
measures we are taking are on the back of expert scientific advice and public
health advice from our chief medical officer. ""And we'll continue to take that advice as we do look
forward to a time when there can be no restrictions in place. ""It is possible that will come at the end of March, if the
public health position remains positive."" He also responded to a question about reports the UK government
is considering defunding universal lateral flow tests, saying it would be
""a really significant mistake"". ""Coronavirus is still in circulation, so it doesn't feel
like a sensible thing to be doing it at this point."" Strict coronavirus restrictions have seen celebrations for the anniversary of the Iranian revolution scaled back for the second year running. Prior to the event, authorities had decreed that there was to be ""no gathering or marching"" to mark the day. Instead, thousands of Iranians celebrated the 43rd anniversary of the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi by driving through the capital, Tehran, chanting slogans including ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"". Despite the restrictions and chilly temperatures, celebrants converged on the capital's iconic Azadi Square on bikes and motorcycles, while others had painted their cars in the red, white and green colours of the Iranian flag. The country has been heavily hit by Covid. More than 133,000 people have died from the virus, and another 6.5 million have been infected since the pandemic began. Gripped by the Omicron variant, Iran has recently seen new coronavirus cases spiral past more than 30,000 a day. Nearly 65% of the country's 88 million strong population have received at least two doses of a vaccine. London Luton Airport chief says it's been ""a very difficult
couple of years"" â but with the easing of some of travel rules, at least
in the UK, things are looking up. ""I get the impression we're starting to see the light at
the end of the tunnel and there are lots of reasons to be optimistic,""
says Alberto Martin. All testing requirements were removed for fully-vaccinated
arrivals on Friday morning, with only a Passenger Locator Form required. ""The airlines are telling us that sales are looking really
good for half-term and the fact that the travel restrictions are being eased,
this is going to make it as easy as it's always been [to travel],"" he
adds. Read more. ""Travel to Spain is returning to normal,"" says Steve Heapy The boss of Jet2 has welcomed this morning's announcement that Spain will allow in unvaccinated UK teenagers from Monday, if they present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival.

"I'm sorry and ashamed, says Plymouth gunman's dadJake Davison shot dead five people, including a three-year-old girl, in Plymouth, in August.Devon","This video can not be played Mark Davison has spoken to the BBC six months after his son shot and killed five people The father of a man who shot dead five people has said he is ""sorry"" and ""ashamed"" of his son's actions. Jake Davison, 22, killed hismother at her home and then four other people, including a three-year-old girl, outside in Keyham, Plymouth, in August. His father, Mark Davison, said he told police in 2017 he did not think his son should be allowed a shotgun. Devon and Cornwall Police said an independent investigation was ongoing into its firearms licensing procedures. Mr Davison, who was divorced from his son's mother, Maxine Davison, said he had seen his son when he could. He said his Christian faith had helped him turn his own life around after spending time in prison. ""I don't know what was going on with him,"" he added. ""If I could say sorry any better than I can, if I could change it I really would. I am sorry and I am ashamed."" The killings happened just weeks after Jake Davison's shotgun and licence were returned to him by Devon and Cornwall Police. Mr Davison said: ""That three-year-old little girl, and the other victims. People just going about their lives, going to the park or going to the shop, taking the dog or whatever they were doing. ""Whatever Jake's mitigation was it's still no form of defence. He shouldn't have done that. He shouldn't have had a gun in the first place."" Clockwise from top left: Maxine Davison, Lee and Sophie Martyn, Stephen Washington and Katherine Shepherd -Maxine Davison, 51 The mother of Jake Davison was the first person killed. The former trawler woman was shot dead at her home in Biddick Drive, Keyham, Plymouth, shortly after 18:00 BST on 12 August 2021. -Lee Martyn, 43 The married carpenter, was killed alongside his daughter, Sophie. Relatives said he ""had the kindest heart, would do anything for anybody"" and that ""you only had to take one look at him to see how much he loved and adored his family"". -Sophie Martyn, three She was killed as she walked the family dog with her father in Biddick Drive. Relatives said the family had been ""truly blessed"" to have ""seen you grow into such a beautiful, funny and clever girl"" over the three years of her life. -Stephen Washington, 59 He was shot and killed by Davison in a park close to Biddick Drive as he walked the family dog. In a tribute, his family said their world ""has been turned upside down in the blink of an eye"" with the death of a ""loving husband, father, grandfather and best friend"". -Katherine Shepherd, 66 Mrs Shepherd, known as Kate, was shot outside a hair salon on Henderson Place and later died from her injuries at Derriford Hospital. She was married and friends described her as a ""very talented artist"". Davison injured two other people before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life. The shotgun and licence had been seized in 2020 after Davison assaulted two teenagers in a park. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating how the force approved his application and then later gave him back the weapon. In the wake of the shooting, the Home Office announced police would have to checksomeone's medical history before they issued a gun licence. Five people were killed and two people were injured in the mass shooting in Keyham, Plymouth Mr Davison said he called the police in 2017, and had concerns about his son's mental health. ""I told them. I said I don't want him to have a shotgun,"" he said. ""I said I remember him asking me for an air rifle when he was younger. I said 'I'm not buying you a point 22 air rifle son... without me there to supervise that'. ""Why did he even need one in the first place? He lived in the city. ""If he was a farmer or whatever it was ... then yes maybe then, but he shouldn't have had the gun in the first place."" The community of Keyham has received additional support since the shootings Devon and Cornwall Police said it was co-operating with the IOPC investigation and providing all information required. A spokesman said: ""Individual contacts with Jake Davison by members of his family, members of the public or agencies that are known to us, or exist within our systems, form part of that investigation. ""The outcome of that investigation will be shared by the IOPC with the families, coroner and ourselves at a later date. ""As a result, Devon and Cornwall Police is unable to comment further on any matters that are subject to independent investigation and review."" As well as the coroner and IOPC's investigations, the National Police Chiefs' Council is also leading an inquiry, in conjunction with the local police and crime commissioner, into the force's firearms policies and procedures. The force spokesman added: ""In addition, there is currently an ongoing peer review of Devon and Cornwall Police's firearms licensing procedures. ""This was a review commissioned by the force following events in August 2021. ""The review is not an investigation of any potential fault by an individual or the organisation. ""It focuses on the processes within the Firearms Licensing Unit, compliance with Home Office guidelines and most importantly ensuring we have the national best practice available to us as we move forward."" The IOPC said it was still working on its report and would publish its findings as soon as possible. A spokesman for the IOPC added: ""We can confirm we have spoken to Mr Davison and his statement that he made a call to Devon and Cornwall Police has been considered and reported on as part of our independent investigation.""

"Adele promises Vegas shows will happen this year""I've got plans for next year,"" she says. ""Imagine if I have to cancel because I am having a baby!""","Adele won three prizes at this week's Brit Awards Adele has said the Las Vegas residency she recently postponed will ""absolutely 100%"" happen later this year. Last month, the singer posted a tearful video the day before her first show, saying it wasn't ready. She has now told TV host Graham Norton she and her team are working extremely hard to prepare and confirm new dates. ""It has to happen this year because I've got plans for next year,"" she told him. ""Imagine if I have to cancel because I am having a baby!"" Adele, who has a nine-year-old son Angelo with ex-husband Simon Konecki, told Norton's BBC One chat show she would like to have more children. But she declined to say whether a diamond ring she wore at the Brit Awards earlier this week meant she was engaged to boyfriend Rich Paul. ""If I was, would I ever tell anyone if I was or wasn't?"" she said. The singer showed off a diamond ring on the red carpet The singer won best song, best album and best artist at the ceremony, and performed her single I Drink Wine. ""I am very happy, really chuffed,"" she said of her Brits success. ""In my speech I wanted to acknowledge other people and my son, who is old enough now.

In the interview, which will be broadcast later on Friday. she said: ""I tried my hardest and really thought I would be able to pull something together in time. ""I regret that I kept going until that late in the day. It would have been a really half-arsed show and I can't do that. People will see straight through me up on the stage and know I didn't want to be doing it. I've never done anything like that in my life and I'm not going to start now. ""We are now working our arses off, but I don't want to announce a new set of dates until I know everything will definitely be ready. The sooner I can announce the better, but I just can't in case we are not ready in time. It is absolutely 100% happening this year.""

Swedish hitman guilty of doorstep murderAnis Hemissi flew from Denmark as a professional hitman to kill father-of-two Flamur Beqiri.London,"Flamur Beqiri is the brother of Misse Beqiri, who appeared in Real Housewives Of Cheshire A Swedish hitman has been found guilty of murdering a man in front of his family in a tit-for-tat gang war. Flamur Beqiri, 36, was shot in the back of the head on the doorstep of his home in Battersea, south-west London, in front of his wife and toddler on Christmas Eve 2019. The gunman, 24-year-old kickboxer Anis Hemissi, was convicted following a two-week trial at Southwark Crown Court. Fellow Swede Estevan Pino-Munizaga, 35, was found guilty of manslaughter. Tobias Andersson, 32, and Bawer Karaer, 23, also from Sweden, were acquitted of both charges. Esteven-Alexis Pino-Munizaga (l) was found guilty of manslaughter, while Anis Fouad Hemissi (r) was convicted of murder The court heard that Mr Beqiri was a kingpin in an international drugs gang and had been targeted as part of a feud with a rival organised crime group. He was shot a number of times in a killing that had been six months in the planning. The killers came to London from Sweden before returning. A local team - Clifford Rollox, 31, from Islington, north London, and Dutch national Claude Isaac Castor, 31, from Sint Maarten in the Caribbean, who were hired to ""tidy up"" the aftermath, were found guilty of perverting the course of justice. Clifford Rollox (l) and Claude Isaac (r) were both found guilty of perverting the course of justice Hemissi was caught on CCTV wearing a latex mask as he opened fire 10 times with a pistol, hitting Mr Beqiri with eight bullets from behind. He had earlier disguised himself as a litter picker to carry out reconnaissance. Hemissi, wearing a latex mask, posed as a street cleaner in the days before the shooting, Southwark Crown Court heard The following day he was filmed wearing a different mask The jury was not told that he had previously been a suspect in the murder of a man shot dead in Malmo, but had never been charged. Louise Attrill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the ""international assassination"", was ""a shocking, cold-blooded and brutal murder of a man in front of his young family on Christmas Eve. ""The intention was clear - to kill."" She added that ""multiple shots"" had been ""fired at close range"", and the murder had been ""deliberately carried out in a way that would cause maximum terror and trauma given the date, place and circumstances"". Flowers were left in Battersea Church Road after the shooting Mr Beqiri, who had joint Swedish and Albanian nationality, claimed to be in the music business but had been involved in the international drugs trade since 2007. He was the brother of The Real Housewives Of Cheshire reality television participant, Misse Beqiri. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said she would sentence those found guilty over his killing on 18 February.

'Illegal' protest spurs Ontario state of emergencyOntario Premier Doug Ford called on protesters to 'go home' and end the 'illegal occupation'.US & Canada,"Ontario has declared a state of emergency in response to two weeks of protests against Covid restrictions. The order came as protests continue to restrict traffic on a border bridge that is vital for US-Canada trade. Blocking crucial infrastructure would be made ""illegal"" under the order, punishable by up to a year in jail and C$100,000 ($79,000; Â£58,000) in fines. On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with US President Joe Biden about the border blockades. The pair discussed their ""shared challenges at the border"", Mr Trudeau said, with the prime minister promising quick action to resume trade. Addressing Canadians on Friday, Mr Trudeau applauded Ontario's measure and said that ""everything is on the table"" to ensure the demonstrations are brought to an end. Trucker protests force Canada car plant shutdowns US urges Canada to end blockade by truckers Arrests as Ottawa warned of 'volatile' protesters ""It is it is time to go home,"" he said. ""The consequences are becoming more and more severe."" Mr Trudeau insisted that the ""unlawful activity"" would end, but said military intervention has not yet been seriously considered. By Robin Levinson-King, BBC News, Windsor About 100 vehicles - pickup trucks, SUVs and articulated lorries - were parked along the road leading up to the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, festooned with Canadian Flags and signs proclaiming ""Freedom"". The atmosphere was noticeably more subdued on Friday than previous evenings, protesters told the BBC. If the Ottawa protest has made national headlines for its noise and bluster, then the Windsor bridge blockade has left its mark by making millions of dollars of daily trade come to a halt. The area was mostly quiet, save for the occasional honking horn and the stereo sound of Bruce Springsteen's ""Dancing in the Dark."" Speaking to the BBC, former cross-border truck driver Hank, who did not want to give his last name, said he was there to support his friends who've lost their jobs. ""We want our freedoms back, we want mandates lifted,"" he said. ""We want life to go back to the old normal not the new normal."" With a judge considering an injunction, and a state of emergency declared, most protesters are waiting to see if police make their move. Hank says he thinks their time in Windsor is running out: ""We can't fight behind bars. We have to keep it peaceful,"" he said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the province's emergency order would apply to anyone impeding the movement of goods, people and services along international border crossings, airports, ports and major highways. The Canadian province will also provide additional authority so that the personal and commercial licences of protesters who do not comply may be cancelled. ""Your right to make a political statement does not outweigh the right of hundreds of thousands of workers to earn their living,"" Mr Ford said. The country-wide protests against Covid-19 vaccine mandates are poised to enter their third weekend. A ""Freedom Convoy"" was organised last month in response to the introduction of a new rule that all truckers must be vaccinated to cross the US-Canada border, or quarantine upon their return. The protest has since grown into a broader challenge to all Covid health restrictions. The vast majority of Canadian truckers are vaccinated and trucking associations have distanced themselves from the protests, noting most drivers are still working. Thousands of demonstrators have congregated in central Ottawa, others have blocked the Ambassador Bridge - which links Windsor, Ontario, with Detroit, Michigan - and a handful of other border crossings. Authorities have warned members of the public to avoid Emerson, a small border town in Manitoba, where trucks and farm equipment are currently clogging the US border. The trade disruption has been estimated to cost some C$380m ($300m; Â£221m) each day. Smaller protests have been held in Toronto and Quebec City, as well as near provincial legislatures in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British Columbia. The mayors of Ontario's biggest cities issued a joint statement on Monday, condemning the ""irresponsible and damaging"" actions of the protesters, calling for all governments to bring the demonstrations to a peaceful end. On Friday afternoon, Canada's capital city filed an injunction with Ontario's Superior Court against people continuing to violate Ottawa's bylaws, aimed at those making noise, idling, fireworks, and encroachments on highways. Also on Friday, the Superior Court justice delayed hearing an application for another injunction that would stop protesters blocking Canada-bound traffic at the Ambassador Bridge. US officials have urged Canada's government to use its federal powers to end the blockade - especially of the Ambassador Bridge - which has already hit the automobile industry either side of the border. The White House said this week that US officials had been engaged with their Canadian counterparts to help resume trade along the border. Premier Ford's Friday announcement marks the first state of emergency in the province since April, when Ontario implemented its third emergency order over Covid-19 transmission. In recent days Mr Ford had faced criticism for not doing more to stop the convoy blockade in Ottawa. And while he repeatedly denounced the weeks-long demonstration on Friday, he also indicated the province would be moving to lift existing Covid-19 restrictions, including the vaccine ""passport"" system which requires proof of vaccination to enter indoor public settings like gyms and restaurants.

Adele promises Vegas shows will happen this year,"Adele won three prizes at this week's Brit Awards Adele has said the Las Vegas residency she recently postponed will ""absolutely 100%"" happen later this year. Last month, the singer posted a tearful video the day before her first show, saying it wasn't ready. She has now told TV host Graham Norton she and her team are working extremely hard to prepare and confirm new dates. ""It has to happen this year because I've got plans for next year,"" she told him. ""Imagine if I have to cancel because I am having a baby!"" Adele, who has a nine-year-old son Angelo with ex-husband Simon Konecki, told Norton's BBC One chat show she would like to have more children. But she declined to say whether a diamond ring she wore at the Brit Awards earlier this week meant she was engaged to boyfriend Rich Paul. ""If I was, would I ever tell anyone if I was or wasn't?"" she said. The singer showed off a diamond ring on the red carpet The singer won best song, best album and best artist at the ceremony, and performed her single I Drink Wine. ""I am very happy, really chuffed,"" she said of her Brits success. ""In my speech I wanted to acknowledge other people and my son, who is old enough now. ""I don't share too much of him, but they are my little soulmates - Angelo and Simon.  Our family is separated but we're nailing it and doing a really, really good job."" Ballads over bangers as Adele wins three Brits The unstoppable Adele and other Brits highlights Tearful Adele postpones entire Las Vegas residency In January, she told fans she was ""gutted"" to have to postpone the 12-week Las Vegas run because of Covid cases in her team and delivery delays. Many fans had already travelled for the first night and were left out of pocket. There has been speculation about when the shows will now take place, and even whether they will happen at all. In the interview, which will be broadcast later on Friday. she said: ""I tried my hardest and really thought I would be able to pull something together in time. ""I regret that I kept going until that late in the day. It would have been a really half-arsed show and I can't do that. People will see straight through me up on the stage and know I didn't want to be doing it. I've never done anything like that in my life and I'm not going to start now. ""We are now working our arses off, but I don't want to announce a new set of dates until I know everything will definitely be ready. The sooner I can announce the better, but I just can't in case we are not ready in time. It is absolutely 100% happening this year."" The interview was recorded on Thursday, and later that night the singer was seen at the G-A-Y event at Heaven nightclub in London, where she judged a contest on stage before performing an impromptu pole dance.

Rights group 'should lose status' over trans row,"Britain's human rights watchdog faces a legal challenge to its status over a row about transgender rights. In documents shared exclusively with the BBC, campaigners say they want the Equality and Human Rights Commission's status as an independent group revoked. It comes after the EHRC was criticised forasking Scotland to pause its plansto make it easier for people to change their sex on their birth certificate. The EHRC said critics were ""aiming at the wrong target"". LGBT charity Stonewall, backed by the Good Law Project, has drawn up a submission to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions, calling for the EHRC to lose its ""A rating"". This would prevent it from being able to make representations at the UN Human Rights Council, or its committees on human rights. The dividing lines over Scotland's gender laws Women's group bids to block census gender changes Finding love as a trans woman The 19-page submission accuses the EHRC of being ""excessively"" influenced by the UK government in the appointments of the chair and board members. The EHRC told the BBC it takes all decisions impartially and ""based on evidence in the UK and internationally"". ""All appointments to our non-executive and executive roles are made through a fair, open and transparent recruitment process. ""The way the commission is governed and commissioners appointed is set out in the Equality Act, and has not changed since the commission was established."" The EHRC is funded by the Government Equalities Office, but says it operates independently of ministerial control. Jolyon Maugham, of The Good Law Project, told BBC News: ""The EHRC is subject to a level of oversight and micro-management from the department which is just not consistent with being a UN Human Rights Institution."" The submission accuses Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is also the women and equalities minister, of making ""politically motivated"" appointments to the EHRC. Since Ms Truss's appointments took up their posts, the submission letter alleges there has been a marked change in the EHRC's stance on Scotland'splanned changes to the Gender Recognition Act. A spokesperson for the government's Equality Hub insisted the EHRC remains an independent public body, adding that the government is ""fully committed to advancing LGBT rights"". ""In recent years we have taken great strides, including reducing the cost of applying for a Gender Recognition Certification."" There has been controversy over the proposals, with campaign groups and some politicians questioning howthey could affect women-only services. Liz Truss is accused of politically-motivated appointments In a 2018 statement, still available on its website,external, the EHRC said it was its ""firm legal view"" that the reform of the Gender Recognition Act would not affect those services. This position was re-iterated in 2020,external, when the EHRC said there is ""no reason"" why making it simpler for people to legally change their gender would have an impact on protected spaces or services. However, in a statement published in January 2022, the EHRC called for the plans to be paused, and noted ""concerns"" around single-sex services, but did not elaborate on what those concerns were. In response to the legal challenge, the EHRC's chief executive told BBC News that campaign groups should be working with, rather than against them. ""The EHRC has the power to prosecute people and companies that discriminate against trans people - we have done so,"" said Marcial Boo. ""Instead of criticising the statutory regulator that exists to protect the rights of everyone in Britain, campaign groups should work with us to identify discrimination against LGBT people, so we can take action together to stop it."" Nancy Kelley, CEO of Stonewall, told the BBC she believed there was ""credible evidence"" that the EHRC no longer met the criteria of a national human rights institution. ""The politicisation of the UK's human rights body has placed trans people in the firing line, but this attempt to create a hierarchy of human rights in the UK is a very real threat to everyone, particularly those of us protected by the Equality Act.""

UK economy rebounds with fastest growth since WW2Growth of 7.5% last year was ahead of forecasts despite a setback in December due to Omicron.BusinessComments,"The UK economy rebounded last year with growth of 7.5% despite falling back in December due to Omicron restrictions, official figures show. It was the fastest pace of growth since 1941, although it came after a dramatic 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut. In December, the economy shrank 0.2% as Omicron restrictions hit the hospitality and retail sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the economy had been ""remarkably resilient"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures,externalshowed that in the last three months of 2021 growth was 1%, which ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said was ""pretty healthy"" given Omicron's spread and the introduction of some restrictions. The figures were stronger than expected, and Mr Morgan told the BBC the expansion in 2021 showed the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of nations. However, he urged caution about making strict comparisons. ""The growth in 2021 comes from a low base in 2020, when the economy fell sharply,"" Mr Morgan said. ""And if you look at where the UK economy is now, compared to its pre-pandemic level... the UK is middle of the pack, compared with the G7."" He said using this comparison, the US, Canadian and French economies were above the UK's, while the UK was above Italy, Germany and Japan. The worst of the overall pandemic economic hit is now behind us but the aftershocks remain. Downing Street is unlikely to avoid the opportunity to boast about 2021. During its hosting of the G7, the UK is now confirmed as the fastest growing economy of these major nations. But that comparison needs a great dollop of context. The 7.5% growth the UK economy recorded in 2021 is the highest of the G7 major economies and that does indicate a strong bounceback. This, as the ONS points to, should be seen alongside the sharpest fall of 9.4% for the UK compared to those same economies in 2020. On the internationally comparable basis, the economy is still slightly smaller than it was at the end of December 2019, unlike the US, France and Canada. On the slightly more timely basis, using monthly data not available in other countries, the UK economy is larger than it was in February 2020. The UK economy grew by 1% in the final quarter of 2021, a little lower than expectations, as the spread of the Omicron variant weighed on the economy in December. But as ever during these extraordinary times, this already looks like a rear view mirror on events. Looking forward, the extraordinary cost of living squeeze, with energy and other prices leading to falls in average living standards, is the significant iceberg for the economy in 2022. The ONS said that despite the fall in December, on a monthly basis GDP was in line with its pre-coronavirus level in February 2020. However, GDP in the October-to-December quarter remains 0.4% below its pre-Covid levels in the final three months of 2019. What is GDP and how does it affect me? Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Mr Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that despite Omicron the economy was remarkably resilient. We were the fastest growing economy in the G7 last year and are forecast to continue being the fastest growing economy this year. ""But I know that people are worried about rising prices, particularly energy bills... and that's why last week we announced a significant package of support to help millions of families meet the cost of bills."" Last year's growth was the strongest since ONS records began in 1948 and the fastest since 1941, during World War Two, using data collected by the Bank of England. The slump of 9.4% in 2020 was the biggest drop since 1919 when there was demobilisation after World War One. After 18 months of uncertainty, Ollie Vaulkhard's coffee shop and restaurant chain in north east England was seeing a strong end to 2021. He told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme that October and November were great months for the Vaulkhard Group as the economy opened up, but then things started to slow when Omicron hit. ""We lost customers, we lost staff to isolation and we had people being cautious because they had plans for Christmas."" He doesn't regard December as a disaster, more a loss of momentum. ""We lost the fizz off the top of a glass of champagne,"" he said. A better December would have been a good launch into 2022, when Mr Vaulkhard expects some tough times. ""We have wage cost rises, we have supply cost rises, we've had some brewery costs going up by 7% - they are all large,"" he said. The pandemic and lockdown kept a lid on costs for two years, but suddenly it's changing. ""I would prefer not to have them [price rises], but given the challenges we had this seems like another bridge to cross that we'll have to find a way over."" The economy is expected to face headwinds in 2022. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates, cut its economic growth forecast from 5% to 3.75% for this year and predicted that households were about to suffer the sharpest fall in living standards since records began three decades ago. This, said Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, would mean the economy will ""crawl"" this year and see the slowest growth of any G7 country. ""The reality is the way the government runs our economy is trapping us in a high tax, low growth cycle,"" he said. Inflation is forecast to hit 7% in April, the same month workers and firms will start to see a rise in their National Insurance (NI) contributions. Mr Sunak has been under pressure to scrap the NI increase, but vowed this month that it would go ahead. Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said he expected output lost during December and January to be regained in February and March, ""meaning that Omicron should not have had a lasting impact on the economy"". But he warned that consumer spending power would take a big hit in 2002. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, said that ""crippling"" inflation, tax rises in April, and higher energy bills means ""the UK economy is facing a materially weaker 2022"".

Low-income families 'let down' by payment schemeCharities accuse the finance secretary of spreading cost-of-living support too thinly.Scotland politics,"Charities say the UK and Scottish governments have let down low income families Charities have claimed the Scottish government's cost-of-living payment scheme will let down low-income families. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes announced on Thursday thata Â£150-per-household payment will be givenin a bid to offset rising prices. Anti-poverty campaigners have accused her of spreading support too thinly. Ms Forbes insisted the package was the ""quickest way"" to get cash where it was needed. The Poverty Alliance said it was ""deeply disappointing"" that the Scottish scheme mirrored UK government plans to funnel support through the council tax system. They said the measures failed to properly target support at people on the lowest incomes and that it was ""a missed opportunity to protect people living in poverty from the waves of hardship that threaten to overwhelm them"". Chris Birt, from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said she had let people down. He said: ""This isn't just about energy bills, although that's the worst of it. Food prices, travel prices, etc are all piling up for families. ""Governments can make different choices to support low-income families and both the chancellor and Kate Forbes have let them down by spreading this support far too thin."" Ms Forbes told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programmesaid she was ""very conscious"" of the foundation's position, and also criticism from Age Scotland and the Poverty and Inequality Commission. She said: ""I said very clearly that I didn't think this was a perfect scheme and it had to be seen in the context of other, more targeted support. ""Ultimately this is a question of how we deliver support to families who needed it yesterday. We could design a perfect scheme that could take a number of months to deliver, but my priority is to try to get that money out of the door quickly."" Why are energy bills going up? Why are prices rising so quickly? She added that what she announced was just part of a range of funding which could help struggling families, including the Â£10m fuel insecurity fund, Â£41m winter support fund,  Â£41m from the Scottish welfare fund, and Â£80m in discretionary housing payments. She also highlighted a doubling of the carers allowance supplement and the Â£40 Scottish child payment for under sixes. But she said: ""I am open and honest that we need to go further, that it is about food costs and energy costs and both governments need to work together because many of those levers, particularly around energy regulation, are with the UK. The Â£150 payment will go to households in council tax bands A to D and all of those eligible for council tax reduction. It means some 1.85 million households - 73% of the total - will receive Â£150 of support when those elements are combined. The cash is in addition to Â£120m allocated to local government in a bid to hold down council tax increases in the coming year. The National Union of Students in Scotland said they ""absolutely stunned"" that students will not be eligible for the Â£150 payment because they do not pay council tax. NUS Scotland President Matt Crilly said he wants a meeting with ministers to resolve the issue, adding: ""Students face the same energy bill hikes as everyone else, but our support doesn't increase by the cost-of-living and many of us receive no support whatsoever during the summer."" Students in halls of residence are exempt from council tax The finance secretary said cash would go to households in council tax bands A to D and all of those eligible for council tax reduction. People who get a reduction are generally single-person households, disabled people, some students and some households with children. Those who won't get the payment because they are exempt from paying council tax are: young people leaving care students who live alone or share the rent with other students students living in halls of residence households with someone who is severely mentally impaired. Ms Forbes said her plans would ensure the money would get to households as early as possible in the next financial year, potentially by April. She said that by using the council tax reduction scheme, the government could identify the families most in need. The finance secretary added: ""I accept this will reach some households that may not need it, but it is the only route we have to make sure we reach those for whom it will make a  difference quickly and simply and I have deemed that to be the priority here."" She said for those who are exempt from paying council tax, the Scottish government would look at other ways to provide support. Ms Forbes also urged the UK government to work together with Scotland's administration to do more to counteract the growing crisis. She said: ""On a household level, we are looking at estimates that could suggest about 874,000 fuel-poor households, that is an increase of 43% on the most recent 2019 published statistics. That is a significant increase."" The debate continues around the best way to target financial help for those Scots struggling to pay their gas and electricity bills. Some believe it's pointless giving cash to everyone in council tax bands A-D because even though everyone is feeling the squeeze, there are around 600,000 people in extreme fuel poverty who are facing a tsunami of uncontrollable and unaffordable household bills. Amid the noise, it's worth pointing out the average council tax debt is around Â£3,500. Campaigners have told me taking Â£150 off a council tax bill will not make a major difference. Citizens Advice believe the best way to assist people at the sharp end of this crisis would be making direct payments as that would go some way to alleviating day-to-day household pressures rather than paying down existing debt. Government officials agree to an extent but are aware of the time sensitivities in helping families now. They feel it's better to rush out money quicker than going down the time-consuming route of creating a brand new system.

LiveLiveWales eases Covid restrictions further20 minutes ago20 minutes ago GoodbyeGoodbye33 minutes ago So what are Wales' new Covid rules?So what are Wales' new Covid rules?39 minutes ago 'Covid passes added to our costs''Covid passes added to our costs',"Economy minister Vaughan Gething has been updating Wales on the latest Covid rules First Minister Mark Drakeford is isolating after testing positive for the virus Covid passes will end on 18 February Face masks rules for museums and cinemas change on 28 February Wales' remaining Covid laws could now be scrapped by the end of March James McCarthy and Gareth Rees That's it from Wales' live page today, thankyou for joining us. Here are the main points from the day so far:  Rules on face masks are being relaxed and Covid passes will no longer be needed. Wales remains atalert level zero,external, the lowest level of Covid rules. Rules limiting socialising in pubs, bars and restaurants have already been removed and nightclubs are able to open, as social distancing rules were scrapped. From 18 February, Covid passes for entertainment venues, nightclubs and large events will no longer be needed. And from 28 February, pupils will not have to wear face masks in class. Also from 28 February, the law requiring face coverings in most public places will be relaxed. However, they will still be needed in shops, public transport, hairdressers, salons and health and social care. A theatre boss said checking passes slowed down the process of getting audiences inside. Aberystwyth Arts Centre director Dafydd Rhys said: ""It
is good news that the pandemic is under such control and that the Welsh government feel confident that the Covid passes will no longer be required
after February 18th. ""It
is great news for venues across Wales, there is no doubt about that, as it did
add to our costs in terms of human resources, as more staff were needed to check
the passes et cetera. ""And it slowed down the whole process for people coming to the
theatre or the auditorium.â The number of patients in hospital with Covid has levelled out in the last week in Wales. There was a rolling average of 522 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on Thursday, down slightly (7%) on a week ago - suggesting patient numbers have flattened out. When we include patients with suspected Covid and those recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,116 patients. They make up 12.8% of all hospital patients. The devolved nations were ""ambushed"" by the UK government's announcement on ending rules early according to the Welsh government. Wales economy minister, Vaughan Gething, said: ""The prime minister didn't speak to the first minister before going into the preamble for prime minister's questions and announcing a move that took many people by surprise.""

Plaid Cymru's Llyr Gruffydd said it was ""good to see there is this trajectory playing out in front of us"" on the easing of Covid restrictions. ""It's something that we've always advocated, in terms of a steady as she goes approach,"" the Senedd member said. ""The last thing we should do really is dip for the finishing line too soon,"" Mr Gruffydd warned. ""It is tempting, isn't it? Because we feel as if we're getting there. But we mustn't just fall flat on our faces and regret any mistakes. ""I think we owe it to the doctors and the nurses and the carers, who sacrificed so much, not to throw away the gains that we made in recent months."" Crystal shop owner Caitlin Jones is OK with the requirement for masks remaining. Ms Jones, who runs Dylanâs Den, in Aberystwyth, said: âItâs
a personal preference to wear a mask and as long as people are still being
careful and wary. ""As a business we donât mind that the requirement to wear
masks in shops stays as long as staff are protected and we can keep trading.â Holiday giant Tui said the outlook for summer and the renewed appetite for package travel continues to look ""extremely positive"". It said demand for Greece and Turkey and long haul favourites the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico, are now back to pre-Covid levels. ""Many of our customers, including families, are preferring to book destinations where the entry requirements are currently less strict,"" a spokesman told the BBC. Hairdresser Kim
Greenhouse was looking to the easing of Covid restrictions. She said: âItâs
incredibly exciting that we could be possibly seeing the end of the pandemic
coming towards us. ""Itâs been really hard as it gets really hot and stuffy in
the salon and it will be nice if we can finally take off the masks, but
obviously we are more than happy to carry on as we are if it keeps the safety
of our customers and staff together and we all come out of this safely. ""It is
all that matters to us.â The Welsh Conservatives' Sam Rowlands said it was âgood to see restrictions starting to be removedâ. The north Wales Senedd member said his party would have liked to have seen these removed quicker. âWe absolutely welcomed the removal of Covid passes but they shouldnât have been there in the first place,"" he said. Mr Rowlands said heâd like more detail from the Welsh government on what was going to be happening with potentially removing further restrictions at the end of March. âIâm not sure how solid it is,"" he said. ""It would be nice to get firm commitment from the ministerâ. Wales' economy minister Vaughan Gething has said he will keep wearing a face mask because ""it's the right thing to do."" The requirement to wear them in indoor public places apart from shops, public transport and health and care settings will be removed from 28 February. Allow Twitter content?

The UK economy improved last year with growth of 7.5% despite falling back in December due to Omicron restrictions, official figures show. It was the fastest pace of growth since 1941, although it came after a dramatic 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut. In December, the economy shrank 0.2% as Omicron restrictions hit the hospitality and retail sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the economy had been ""remarkably resilient"". Ending free Lateral Flow Tests would be a ""really significant mistake"", Vaughan Gething warned. There have been reports the UK government is considering such a move. The economy minister said any such decision should be ""on the back of discussion between the governments [of the UK] but also properly informed public health advice"". That advice should be made available to the public ""so they know this isn't simply being driven by a penny-pinching chancellor and it's actually all about doing the right thing at that stage"", he said. The final Covid restrictions could be lifted by the end of March if supported by science and public health experts, economy minister Vaughan Gething said. A decision on scrapping rules on wearing masks in shops and on buses or trains could come in three weeksâ time. âThat of course depends on the evidence at the time and on the expert public health advice that we get,â he said. âWe will only take that step if itâs a proportionate thing to do, and if we have public health advice to support doing so. âThatâs the approach we have always taken and that stands in contrast to other approaches that are available in different parts of the UK.â Allow Twitter content?

Rugby fans still need a Covid pass to watch Wales v Scotland on Saturday. Economy minister Vaughan Gething said: ""Make sure you have downloaded or printed your pass before going to the Principality Stadium."" Mr Gething said he will be among the crowd. Economy minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh government was ""being honest about the fact that this really is supported by the latest public health advice"". Mr Gething said he thinks ""lots of people"" will continue to wear face coverings when they are no longer legally required to do so. ""We know from the polling evidence that not only is the gradual approach of the Welsh government supported by people in Wales in overwhelming numbers, but a majority of people in England prefer the Welsh approach too,"" he said. ""If anything  people are more concerned that we're moving too quickly. ""So this is about moving in time, with the advice we get, taking the public with us."" The Welsh government has ""carefully considered the rules around self-isolation,"" according to economy minister Vaughan Gething. ""These will remain in place in Wales,"" he said. ""Self-isolation is an important way of breaking the chain of transmission of the virus and preventing more people from becoming infected."" Currently people have to self-isolate for five days if they test positive. 

In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he's considering ending the five-day isolation rule later this month. Face masks will no longer have to be âroutinelyâ worn in classrooms after half-term. Economy minister Vaughan Gething said schools âshould plan to return to operating in line with the local decisions framework immediately after half-term. âFace coverings will no longer be routinely required in classrooms but they should continue to be worn in communal areas in secondary schoolsâ. Changes to the rules on face masks have been outlined. âFrom 28 February, we will remove the requirement for face coverings to be worn in indoor public places, apart from in retail, on public transport and in health and care settings. âWe have also updated our guidance to make it clear that adults can remove their face coverings when they are interacting with babies and small children at baby and toddler groups. âIf the public health situation continues to improve, we hope to be able to remove the requirement to wear face coverings by the end of Marchâ. Economy minister Vaughan Gething confirmed Covid passes will be required for Saturdayâs Six Nations rugby match in Cardiff. âPeople - like me - who are going to tomorrowâs Wales v Scotland game will still need to show a Covid pass,â he said. âPlease make sure youâve downloaded or printed your pass before going to the Principality Stadium.â He added covid passes would continue to be used for international travel. âPlease check the entry requirements for the country youâre travelling to before booking your travel arrangements,â he said.

"Spain relaxes Covid restrictions for UK teenagersFrom Monday, unvaccinated British 12-to-17 year-olds will be allowed into Spain with a negative test.BusinessComments","Unvaccinated British teenagers will be allowed into Spain from Monday with a negative PCR test, Spanish tourism minister Fernando ValdÃ©s has told the BBC. At the moment everyone over 12 has to be double-jabbed to enter the country. Some families had already cancelled half term holidays to Spain and the Canary Islands because their children had not yet had their second jab. People aged 18 and over must still be vaccinated to get into the country. What Covid tests do I still need to travel abroad? Mr ValdÃ©s said that 12-to-17 year-olds who have not been vaccinated against Covid will be allowed into the country from Monday 14 February, if they present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival to Spain. The restrictions will be lifted from 23:00 GMT on 13 February. ""Great Britain is our main market,"" said Mr ValdÃ©s. ""We've been always very keen in easing the restrictions between both countries."" Spanish tourism minister Fernando ValdÃ©s All other UK travellers, excluding children under 12, will need to present a Covid certificate showing proof of being fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arrival in Spain. If more than 270 days have passed since vaccination, proof of a booster jab is also required. Prior to travelling, air passengers have to show a QR code, which they get by filling in aSpanish health control form,external. The announcement comes after many UK familiescancelled half-term tripsto mainland Spain and the Canary Islands due to the jab restrictions. Hoteliers in the islands said the restrictions had lost them millions of pounds' worth of trade. However, hundreds of thousands of people are embarking on half-term winter sun and ski trips,according to industry body Abta,external. Have you been affected by Spain's rule change? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy The UK scrapped coronavirus testing for fully vaccinated travellers from 04:00 GMT on Friday. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps described this as ""good news"" for families. ""The UK has eased international travel measures for Covid-19 and now has one of the most free-flowing borders in the world - sending a clear message that we are open for business,"" he said. The Canary Islands, Egypt, Portugal and Turkey are popular destinations for British holidaymakers, Abta said, as are the Caribbean, Dubai, Florida and Mexico. Bookings to ski resorts in France, Italy and Switzerland have also picked up, it said. The easing of restrictions on Friday came as Gatwick Airport announced that it wouldreopen its south terminal on 27 March,external. The terminal has been mothballed since 15 June 2020 as the airport tried to contain costs during the slump in international travel caused by the Covid pandemic. Gatwick's south terminal will reopen in March Now the terminal is reopening as airlines are starting to increase the number of flights they are operating. British Airways is to restart short-haul flights from Gatwick from 29 March and sister airline Vueling will add five new short-haul routes from the airport. Easyjet and Hungarian carrier Wizz Air have also added more slots. Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate said: ""After an incredibly challenging two years for the airport, our partners, local communities and the entire aviation industry, we are delighted to be reopening our south terminal next month. The airport has been ""recruiting for some time"", it said, and is still looking for 2,000 staff in roles including security officers, IT specialists, engineers, shop and restaurant workers, ground and cargo handlers and cabin crew. Despite signs of recovery in the travel industry, Heathrow Airport gave a downbeat assessment of passenger confidence on Friday. It said that demand for travel had been weaker than expected in January - 56% down on pre-pandemic levels -  ""as the hangover from Omicron continued to suppress passenger confidence"". ""While bookings for outbound tourism are recovering, inbound tourism and business travel remain weak due to Covid-19 levels in the UK and other countries, international testing requirements and the risk of new border closures in the event of a new variant of concern,"" it said. Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the removal of restrictions for vaccinated passengers in and out of the UK ""offers a ray of hope, but the Omicron hangover proves demand remains fragile"". But some travel firms are more optimistic. This week Tui chief executive Fritz Joussen said the firm expected ""a strong summer"", adding that ""demand for travel is high across all markets"". New bookings for the summer were above pre-Covid crisis levels Tui and the group expects summer bookings as a whole to be close to pre-pandemic levels. Jet2 boss Steve Heapy predicted the Spanish government's relaxation of restrictions would lead to an increase in bookings from the UK. ""The removal of the requirement for 12-17 year olds to be double-vaccinated tells families that travelling to Spain is returning to normal, and after two years of missing out we know how much everyone wants to experience that famous Spanish sunshine again,"" Mr Heapy said. The chair of Hays Travel, Dame Irene Hays, told the Today programme this week that the independent travel agent had seen a spike in bookings. ""In the last week of January we were back to the same levels of bookings as we were in January 2020,"" she said. How are travel rules being relaxed?

Russian figure skater's failed drug test confirmedTeenager Kamila Valieva had helped win team gold for the Russian Olympic Committee.BBC Sport,"Valieva has continued to practise ahead of her individual event Kamila Valieva, the 15-year-old Russian figure skating star who helped her team win Winter Olympic gold in Beijing, failed a drugs test in December. Valieva, who was the first female skater to land a quadruple jump at an Olympics as her team won last Monday, had a sample collected on 25 December at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St Petersburg. But the positive result was only reported on Tuesday - the day after she helped to win team gold, but before the medal ceremony had taken place. Valieva case puts Russia & doping back in spotlight Valieva tested positive for trimetazidine, which is used in the prevention of angina attacks, but is on the banned list because it is classed as a cardiac metabolic modulator and has been proven to improve physical efficiency. A series of appeals means this case will now be taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to make a final ruling - with International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams saying he wanted a resolution ""as quickly as possible"". The medals for the team event - in which the United States finished second, Japan third and Canada fourth - will not be awarded until the outcome of the Cas hearing. A spokesman for the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it will ""take comprehensive measures in order to protect the rights and interests of the members of the ROC team and to preserve the honestly won Olympic gold medal"". Rusada - the Russian anti-doping agency - said on Friday that it is investigating Valieva's support team to ""identify all the circumstances of a possible anti-doping rule violation"". Cas will now hear the case before Valieva's scheduled appearance in the individual women's figure skating event, which starts next Tuesday, 15 February. The International Testing Agency (ITA) said Valieva had a sample collected on25 Decemberat the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St Petersburg. The sample was sent to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)-accredited laboratory in Stockholm, Sweden. Valieva competed in the European Figure Skating Championships in Tallinn, Estonia, inJanuary- which was between the positive test and the Winter Olympics - and won the women's singles, with Russian claiming a clean sweep of the gold medals. The ROC pointed out that Valieva's samples taken at the Europeans and before the Beijing Winter Olympics were both negative, adding: ""Taking into account that the positive doping sample of the athlete was not collected during the Olympic Games, the results of the athlete and the results of the team event during the Olympic Games are not automatically subject to review."" The adverse finding was reported on7 Februaryand Valieva was notified of the positive result on8 February. Valieva was provisionally suspended but she challenged the decision and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) agreed to lift it on9 February -enabling her to continue at the Beijing Games. Because of her age, Valieva was not confirmed as the athlete at the centre of ""legal issues"" delaying the medal ceremony, until it was widely reported in the media on10 February. The ITAconfirmed those reports,externalon11 Februarybecause of ""heightened public interest"". The International Olympic Committee, Wada and the International Skating Union (ISU) have all now appealed against Rusada's lifting of the provisional ban, with the ISU calling on the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to reinstate it. The ITA said the ""reasoned decision, including the grounds for which the provisional suspension was lifted, will be issued shortly to all concerned parties"". Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdnyakov told the Tass News Agency that the long gap between the 25 December test and the 8 February result looked suspicious and that he had ""serious questions about the process"". Rusada, the Russian anti-doping agency, claimed that the delay in processing Valieva's sample was due to Covid-19 cases at the Swedish laboratory that was analysing them. This video can not be played Kamila Valieva lands historic quadruple jump Valieva, who is favourite for the women's singles, has been seen training at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing. Eric Myles, chief sport officer of the Canadian Olympic Committee, said: ""We have the same questions as everyone else about the team figure skating case. ""It's important that a fair process unfolds and the integrity of sport is protected. Our hope is that this is resolved quickly and the medallists get the medal moment they've earned here in Beijing."" Russian athletes are competing under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee because Russia received a two-year ban from Wada in 2019 for its state-sponsored doping programme. Between 17 December 2020 and 17 December 2022, no athlete can represent Russia at the Olympics, Paralympics or World Championships. The ban was originally for four years but was reduced to two by Cas. Germany's Katarina Witt, a two-time Olympic figure skating champion, said: ""What they knowingly did to her, if true, cannot be surpassed in inhumanity and makes my athlete's heart cry infinitely. ""Kamila Valieva is a young girl and child prodigy, whose highly difficult performances and grace enchanted the whole world at only 15, a minor, depending on adults and she is not to blame here."" United States Anti-Doping Agency head Travis Tygart said: ""It is a catastrophic failure of the system to allow the star of the Games to have her sample not reported back close to five weeks, and then it gets reported the day after they won the team event."" BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott in Beijing After days of intense media speculation, the ITA have confirmed that the 15-year-old prodigy Kamila Valieva from Russia tested positive for a banned substance. Valieva is the favourite for gold in the women's singles figure skating event which begins on Tuesday (15 February) which means this whole process needs to be expedited. At the heart of this is a 15-year-old athlete. There are concerns over her welfare and the potential involvement of others in this. But viewers would be forgiven for feeling a sense of depressing deja vu that once again we are at an Olympics, there is a doping controversy and it involves Russia. Russia is still serving sanctions, but for many people they are Russia in all but name. Many people will be questioning whether they should have been allowed to compete at all, given the country's past with doping issues.

"Rights group 'should lose status' over trans rowBritain's human rights watchdog shouldn't be considered an independent group, charities tell the BBC.","Britain's human rights watchdog faces a legal challenge to its status over a row about transgender rights. In documents shared exclusively with the BBC, campaigners say they want the Equality and Human Rights Commission's status as an independent group revoked. It comes after the EHRC was criticised forasking Scotland to pause its plansto make it easier for people to change their sex on their birth certificate. The EHRC said critics were ""aiming at the wrong target"". LGBT charity Stonewall, backed by the Good Law Project, has drawn up a submission to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions, calling for the EHRC to lose its ""A rating"". This would prevent it from being able to make representations at the UN Human Rights Council, or its committees on human rights. The dividing lines over Scotland's gender laws Women's group bids to block census gender changes Finding love as a trans woman The 19-page submission accuses the EHRC of being ""excessively"" influenced by the UK government in the appointments of the chair and board members. The EHRC told the BBC it takes all decisions impartially and ""based on evidence in the UK and internationally"". ""All appointments to our non-executive and executive roles are made through a fair, open and transparent recruitment process. ""The way the commission is governed and commissioners appointed is set out in the Equality Act, and has not changed since the commission was established."" The EHRC is funded by the Government Equalities Office, but says it operates independently of ministerial control. Jolyon Maugham, of The Good Law Project, told BBC News: ""The EHRC is subject to a level of oversight and micro-management from the department which is just not consistent with being a UN Human Rights Institution."" The submission accuses Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is also the women and equalities minister, of making ""politically motivated"" appointments to the EHRC. Since Ms Truss's appointments took up their posts, the submission letter alleges there has been a marked change in the EHRC's stance on Scotland'splanned changes to the Gender Recognition Act. A spokesperson for the government's Equality Hub insisted the EHRC remains an independent public body, adding that the government is ""fully committed to advancing LGBT rights"". ""In recent years we have taken great strides, including reducing the cost of applying for a Gender Recognition Certification."" There has been controversy over the proposals, with campaign groups and some politicians questioning howthey could affect women-only services. Liz Truss is accused of politically-motivated appointments In a 2018 statement, still available on its website,external, the EHRC said it was its ""firm legal view"" that the reform of the Gender Recognition Act would not affect those services. This position was re-iterated in 2020,external, when the EHRC said there is ""no reason"" why making it simpler for people to legally change their gender would have an impact on protected spaces or services. However, in a statement published in January 2022, the EHRC called for the plans to be paused, and noted ""concerns"" around single-sex services, but did not elaborate on what those concerns were. In response to the legal challenge, the EHRC's chief executive told BBC News that campaign groups should be working with, rather than against them. ""The EHRC has the power to prosecute people and companies that discriminate against trans people - we have done so,"" said Marcial Boo. ""Instead of criticising the statutory regulator that exists to protect the rights of everyone in Britain, campaign groups should work with us to identify discrimination against LGBT people, so we can take action together to stop it."" Nancy Kelley, CEO of Stonewall, told the BBC she believed there was ""credible evidence"" that the EHRC no longer met the criteria of a national human rights institution. ""The politicisation of the UK's human rights body has placed trans people in the firing line, but this attempt to create a hierarchy of human rights in the UK is a very real threat to everyone, particularly those of us protected by the Equality Act.""

Wales' mask and isolation laws could end in MarchSelf-isolation rules could become guidance rather than a legal requirement next month.Wales politics,"Face masks will still be required until at least the end of March Wales' remaining Covid laws - including on face coverings and self-isolation - could be scrapped by the end of March. The Welsh government says falling case rates mean it can begin to ease its remaining rules, with domesticCovid passrules axed from 18 February. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said self-isolation rules could change from being law to guidance next month. But the law will remain for now, despite UK government proposals to ease the restriction in Englandin February. Mr Gething said the prime minister's move is not based on scientific advice. Meanwhile rules on masks will be eased from 28 February so they are only required in shops, salons, hairdressers, public transport and health and social care. They will no longer be mandatory in other venues such as museums or cinemas. Pupils will not have to wear masks in class from the same date - schools can then decide their rules. Secondary pupils, visitors and staff will still need to wear masks in indoor physical areas where physical distancing is not possible. As it happened: Plans to ease Wales' Covid restrictions outlined What are Wales' Covid rules now? Wales' first minister tests positive for Covid From next Friday Covid passes will no longer be legally required at cinemas, theatres, clubs and large events, although businesses can still use them if they want to. They will still apply for another week, including for Wales v Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday. This video can not be played Mr Gething said the latest moves provided a pathway to seeing Covid ""properly in the rear view mirror"". Although there is no precise timetable, it is the first time the Welsh government has said how it may completely lift its pandemic regulations. The Welsh Conservatives called for a date for the removal of all Covid laws, while Plaid Cymru said Labour ministers should spell out what criteria must be met for the restrictions to be scrapped. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Mr Gething announced that officials were keeping a close eye on a new transmissible version of the Omicron variant, called BA.2. He said there had been reports that the variant was behind a surge of cases in Northern Ireland. There are 246 cases in Wales. The economy minister told BBC News the remaining restrictions in Wales may be removed at the end of March. ""At that point we may move to self-isolation being guidance rather than mandatory but at this point we think it is still important to have that as a protective measure in law,"" he said. He said that the move will depend on the evidence of government advisers at the time. A further Covid review is due by 3 March. Separately, from 11 February guidance will be updated to clarify that adults can remove their face coverings when interacting with babies and small children at baby and toddler groups. Guidance will remain recommending that people wear face coverings where they can when indoors, or in large crowds of people, Mr Gething said. In England Boris Johnson said that self-isolation rules could end by 21 February. Mr Gething said this was a""highly unusual"" move by the prime ministerwhich had not been discussed between the Welsh government's and the UK government's chief medical officers. He was asked what would happen to someone who had Covid who lived in England but came to work in Wales without self-isolating, Mr Gething said that person would be ""in breach of the law"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said his government was ""confident that coronavirus rates are falling and we can look forward to brighter times ahead"". But he said he would not remove all measures at once ""because the pandemic is not over yet"". Leandra Craine is concerned too many restrictions are being lifted at once Leandra Craine, 23, who works for Disability Wales, said she was worried too many restrictions were being eased at once. ""I especially think of friends and family members who are immuno-supressed and have been having to shield for two years,"" she added. ""I don't think we should go back to normal as was, as I don't think it was working too well... I think there should be a new normal."" Phillip Francis questioned how well the passes had worked Covid passes, which show evidence of vaccination as well as whether someone has tested negative for Covid in the last 48 hours, have been required to entering nightclubs and other entertainment venues. Phillip Francis, who works at Mocka Lounge nightclub in Cardiff, questioned how effectively the system had worked. ""A lot of people who I asked for Covid passes, all they did was take snapshots of their friend's Covid passes, and were showing me their friend's pass,"" he said. Claire Vaughan, cinema programme manager for Chapter in Cardiff, was happy to see Covid passes go. She said older people ""can get confused with Covid passes, they may be uncomfortable with digital and wonder if they are still valid and just not come"". Dafydd Rhys, director of Aberystwyth Arts Centre, said it was good news Covid passes will no longer be required. Customers will need to continue to wear masks in shops until at least sometime in March. Caitlin Jones, manager of Dylan's Den Crystal shop, in Aberystwyth, said: ""As a business we don't mind that the requirement to wear masks in shops stays as long as staff are protected and we can keep trading."" Dafydd Rhys, director, Aberystwyth Arts Centre, praised the lifting of Covid passes. He said: ""It is great news for venues across Wales - there is no doubt about that as it did add to our costs in terms of human resource as more staff were needed to check the passes, and it slowed down the whole process for people coming to the theatre or the auditorium."" Mr Gething led Friday's press conference on the latest Welsh government review because Mr Drakeford was self-isolating after hetested positive for Covid. The economy minister said Welsh Labour leader was ""fine all things being considered"", and was able to work ""through most of yesterday"". Denmarkis already there, as isSweden, and earlier this week Boris Johnson indicated the remaining Covid restrictions inEnglandcould end later this month. Wales, it seems, could be in a similar position come the end of March. Reaching that point would mark an incredibly significant milestone in the history of this pandemic - a full shift from government rules to personal responsibility. Long overdue, some will say. After all, the state doesn't legally instruct you how to deal with other illnesses. Others will question how such a move would square with Welsh ministers' narrative of a steady as she goes, cautious approach when there are still relatively high levels of transmission. All decisions, Vaughan Gething stressed today, will be ""supported by the latest public health advice"". We've long been told that we need to learn to live with Covid. Next month we'll get the government's plan as to how they intend to make that a reality. The most reliable measure now of infections is the weekly swab survey from the Office for National Statistics. It estimates that one in 25 people - around 4% of the population - had Covid in the week ending 5 February, a decrease. Covid case rates, based on positive test results, are more complicated to interpret, as they no longer include thousands of people who test positive with lateral flow tests. But even if we roughly calculate case numbers to include those ""missing"" lateral flow positive tests, the figures would still be more than 60% down on the peak in January. Numbers of patients in hospital with Covid have levelled out in the last week but remain much lower than last winter. There was a rolling average of 522 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on Thursday, down slightly (7%) on a week ago, while Covid patients in critical care and admissions have also flattened out. Nearly 70% of patients with a positive test for Covid in the last week were being treated primarily for other conditions. However, there are hundreds of former Covid patients now ""recovering"" and still waiting to be discharged, while acute bed occupancy is at record levels. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Covid passes have been required for large events such as football matches since last year Opposition politicians called for the Welsh government to spell out the way forward. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""The trend of infections, hospitalisations and deaths is downwards, a positive progression that shows the diminishing threat of the pandemic. ""Given these positive developments and the success of the vaccination campaign, this must mean that our freedoms in Wales are returned in full without delay."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth urged the Welsh government to ""keep things steady in the very real hope that we won't need to take a step back to any further restrictions in the future"". ""In the meantime, the Welsh government must set out the steps for what criteria must be met for all restrictions to be lifted in Wales."" Laws requiring the wearing of masks in indoor spaces were introduced in Wales in September 2020. The UK government lifted mask requirements in England last summer, before briefly reintroducing them for the Omicron wave at the end of 2021.

Here are the main points from the day so far:  Rules on face masks are being relaxed and Covid passes will no longer be needed. Wales remains atalert level zero,external, the lowest level of Covid rules. Rules limiting socialising in pubs, bars and restaurants have already been removed and nightclubs are able to open, as social distancing rules were scrapped. From 18 February, Covid passes for entertainment venues, nightclubs and large events will no longer be needed. And from 28 February, pupils will not have to wear face masks in class. Also from 28 February, the law requiring face coverings in most public places will be relaxed. However, they will still be needed in shops, public transport, hairdressers, salons and health and social care. A theatre boss said checking passes slowed down the process of getting audiences inside. Aberystwyth Arts Centre director Dafydd Rhys said: ""It
is good news that the pandemic is under such control and that the Welsh government feel confident that the Covid passes will no longer be required
after February 18th. ""It
is great news for venues across Wales, there is no doubt about that, as it did
add to our costs in terms of human resources, as more staff were needed to check
the passes et cetera. ""And it slowed down the whole process for people coming to the
theatre or the auditorium.â The number of patients in hospital with Covid has levelled out in the last week in Wales. There was a rolling average of 522 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on Thursday, down slightly (7%) on a week ago - suggesting patient numbers have flattened out. When we include patients with suspected Covid and those recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,116 patients. They make up 12.8% of all hospital patients. The devolved nations were ""ambushed"" by the UK government's announcement on ending rules early according to the Welsh government. Wales economy minister, Vaughan Gething, said: ""The prime minister didn't speak to the first minister before going into the preamble for prime minister's questions and announcing a move that took many people by surprise.""

Plaid Cymru's Llyr Gruffydd said it was ""good to see there is this trajectory playing out in front of us"" on the easing of Covid restrictions. ""It's something that we've always advocated, in terms of a steady as she goes approach,"" the Senedd member said. ""The last thing we should do really is dip for the finishing line too soon,"" Mr Gruffydd warned. ""It is tempting, isn't it? Because we feel as if we're getting there. But we mustn't just fall flat on our faces and regret any mistakes. ""I think we owe it to the doctors and the nurses and the carers, who sacrificed so much, not to throw away the gains that we made in recent months."" Crystal shop owner Caitlin Jones is OK with the requirement for masks remaining. Ms Jones, who runs Dylanâs Den, in Aberystwyth, said: âItâs
a personal preference to wear a mask and as long as people are still being
careful and wary. ""As a business we donât mind that the requirement to wear
masks in shops stays as long as staff are protected and we can keep trading.â Holiday giant Tui said the outlook for summer and the renewed appetite for package travel continues to look ""extremely positive"". It said demand for Greece and Turkey and long haul favourites the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico, are now back to pre-Covid levels. ""Many of our customers, including families, are preferring to book destinations where the entry requirements are currently less strict,"" a spokesman told the BBC. Hairdresser Kim
Greenhouse was looking to the easing of Covid restrictions. She said: âItâs
incredibly exciting that we could be possibly seeing the end of the pandemic
coming towards us. ""Itâs been really hard as it gets really hot and stuffy in
the salon and it will be nice if we can finally take off the masks, but
obviously we are more than happy to carry on as we are if it keeps the safety
of our customers and staff together and we all come out of this safely. ""It is
all that matters to us.â The Welsh Conservatives' Sam Rowlands said it was âgood to see restrictions starting to be removedâ. The north Wales Senedd member said his party would have liked to have seen these removed quicker. âWe absolutely welcomed the removal of Covid passes but they shouldnât have been there in the first place,"" he said. Mr Rowlands said heâd like more detail from the Welsh government on what was going to be happening with potentially removing further restrictions at the end of March. âIâm not sure how solid it is,"" he said. ""It would be nice to get firm commitment from the ministerâ. Wales' economy minister Vaughan Gething has said he will keep wearing a face mask because ""it's the right thing to do."" The requirement to wear them in indoor public places apart from shops, public transport and health and care settings will be removed from 28 February. Allow Twitter content?

The UK economy improved last year with growth of 7.5% despite falling back in December due to Omicron restrictions, official figures show. It was the fastest pace of growth since 1941, although it came after a dramatic 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut. In December, the economy shrank 0.2% as Omicron restrictions hit the hospitality and retail sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the economy had been ""remarkably resilient"". Ending free Lateral Flow Tests would be a ""really significant mistake"", Vaughan Gething warned. There have been reports the UK government is considering such a move. The economy minister said any such decision should be ""on the back of discussion between the governments [of the UK] but also properly informed public health advice"". That advice should be made available to the public ""so they know this isn't simply being driven by a penny-pinching chancellor and it's actually all about doing the right thing at that stage"", he said. The final Covid restrictions could be lifted by the end of March if supported by science and public health experts, economy minister Vaughan Gething said. A decision on scrapping rules on wearing masks in shops and on buses or trains could come in three weeksâ time. âThat of course depends on the evidence at the time and on the expert public health advice that we get,â he said. âWe will only take that step if itâs a proportionate thing to do, and if we have public health advice to support doing so. âThatâs the approach we have always taken and that stands in contrast to other approaches that are available in different parts of the UK.â Allow Twitter content?

Rugby fans still need a Covid pass to watch Wales v Scotland on Saturday. Economy minister Vaughan Gething said: ""Make sure you have downloaded or printed your pass before going to the Principality Stadium."" Mr Gething said he will be among the crowd. Economy minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh government was ""being honest about the fact that this really is supported by the latest public health advice"". Mr Gething said he thinks ""lots of people"" will continue to wear face coverings when they are no longer legally required to do so. ""We know from the polling evidence that not only is the gradual approach of the Welsh government supported by people in Wales in overwhelming numbers, but a majority of people in England prefer the Welsh approach too,"" he said. ""If anything  people are more concerned that we're moving too quickly. ""So this is about moving in time, with the advice we get, taking the public with us."" The Welsh government has ""carefully considered the rules around self-isolation,"" according to economy minister Vaughan Gething. ""These will remain in place in Wales,"" he said. ""Self-isolation is an important way of breaking the chain of transmission of the virus and preventing more people from becoming infected."" Currently people have to self-isolate for five days if they test positive. 

In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he's considering ending the five-day isolation rule later this month. Face masks will no longer have to be âroutinelyâ worn in classrooms after half-term. Economy minister Vaughan Gething said schools âshould plan to return to operating in line with the local decisions framework immediately after half-term. âFace coverings will no longer be routinely required in classrooms but they should continue to be worn in communal areas in secondary schoolsâ. Changes to the rules on face masks have been outlined. âFrom 28 February, we will remove the requirement for face coverings to be worn in indoor public places, apart from in retail, on public transport and in health and care settings. âWe have also updated our guidance to make it clear that adults can remove their face coverings when they are interacting with babies and small children at baby and toddler groups. âIf the public health situation continues to improve, we hope to be able to remove the requirement to wear face coverings by the end of Marchâ. Economy minister Vaughan Gething confirmed Covid passes will be required for Saturdayâs Six Nations rugby match in Cardiff. âPeople - like me - who are going to tomorrowâs Wales v Scotland game will still need to show a Covid pass,â he said. âPlease make sure youâve downloaded or printed your pass before going to the Principality Stadium.â He added covid passes would continue to be used for international travel. âPlease check the entry requirements for the country youâre travelling to before booking your travel arrangements,â he said.

Wales' mask and isolation laws could end in MarchCovid passes rules will be axed from 18 February under plans to ease Wales' remaining restrictions.,"Face masks will still be required until at least the end of March Wales' remaining Covid laws - including on face coverings and self-isolation - could be scrapped by the end of March. The Welsh government says falling case rates mean it can begin to ease its remaining rules, with domesticCovid passrules axed from 18 February. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said self-isolation rules could change from being law to guidance next month. But the law will remain for now, despite UK government proposals to ease the restriction in Englandin February. Mr Gething said the prime minister's move is not based on scientific advice. Meanwhile rules on masks will be eased from 28 February so they are only required in shops, salons, hairdressers, public transport and health and social care. They will no longer be mandatory in other venues such as museums or cinemas. Pupils will not have to wear masks in class from the same date - schools can then decide their rules. Secondary pupils, visitors and staff will still need to wear masks in indoor physical areas where physical distancing is not possible. As it happened: Plans to ease Wales' Covid restrictions outlined What are Wales' Covid rules now? Wales' first minister tests positive for Covid From next Friday Covid passes will no longer be legally required at cinemas, theatres, clubs and large events, although businesses can still use them if they want to. They will still apply for another week, including for Wales v Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday. This video can not be played Mr Gething said the latest moves provided a pathway to seeing Covid ""properly in the rear view mirror"". Although there is no precise timetable, it is the first time the Welsh government has said how it may completely lift its pandemic regulations. The Welsh Conservatives called for a date for the removal of all Covid laws, while Plaid Cymru said Labour ministers should spell out what criteria must be met for the restrictions to be scrapped. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Mr Gething announced that officials were keeping a close eye on a new transmissible version of the Omicron variant, called BA.2. He said there had been reports that the variant was behind a surge of cases in Northern Ireland. There are 246 cases in Wales. The economy minister told BBC News the remaining restrictions in Wales may be removed at the end of March. ""At that point we may move to self-isolation being guidance rather than mandatory but at this point we think it is still important to have that as a protective measure in law,"" he said. He said that the move will depend on the evidence of government advisers at the time. A further Covid review is due by 3 March. Separately, from 11 February guidance will be updated to clarify that adults can remove their face coverings when interacting with babies and small children at baby and toddler groups. Guidance will remain recommending that people wear face coverings where they can when indoors, or in large crowds of people, Mr Gething said. In England Boris Johnson said that self-isolation rules could end by 21 February. Mr Gething said this was a""highly unusual"" move by the prime ministerwhich had not been discussed between the Welsh government's and the UK government's chief medical officers. He was asked what would happen to someone who had Covid who lived in England but came to work in Wales without self-isolating, Mr Gething said that person would be ""in breach of the law"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said his government was ""confident that coronavirus rates are falling and we can look forward to brighter times ahead"". But he said he would not remove all measures at once ""because the pandemic is not over yet"". Leandra Craine is concerned too many restrictions are being lifted at once Leandra Craine, 23, who works for Disability Wales, said she was worried too many restrictions were being eased at once. ""I especially think of friends and family members who are immuno-supressed and have been having to shield for two years,"" she added. ""I don't think we should go back to normal as was, as I don't think it was working too well... I think there should be a new normal."" Phillip Francis questioned how well the passes had worked Covid passes, which show evidence of vaccination as well as whether someone has tested negative for Covid in the last 48 hours, have been required to entering nightclubs and other entertainment venues. Phillip Francis, who works at Mocka Lounge nightclub in Cardiff, questioned how effectively the system had worked. ""A lot of people who I asked for Covid passes, all they did was take snapshots of their friend's Covid passes, and were showing me their friend's pass,"" he said. Claire Vaughan, cinema programme manager for Chapter in Cardiff, was happy to see Covid passes go. She said older people ""can get confused with Covid passes, they may be uncomfortable with digital and wonder if they are still valid and just not come"". Dafydd Rhys, director of Aberystwyth Arts Centre, said it was good news Covid passes will no longer be required. Customers will need to continue to wear masks in shops until at least sometime in March. Caitlin Jones, manager of Dylan's Den Crystal shop, in Aberystwyth, said: ""As a business we don't mind that the requirement to wear masks in shops stays as long as staff are protected and we can keep trading."" Dafydd Rhys, director, Aberystwyth Arts Centre, praised the lifting of Covid passes. He said: ""It is great news for venues across Wales - there is no doubt about that as it did add to our costs in terms of human resource as more staff were needed to check the passes, and it slowed down the whole process for people coming to the theatre or the auditorium."" Mr Gething led Friday's press conference on the latest Welsh government review because Mr Drakeford was self-isolating after hetested positive for Covid. The economy minister said Welsh Labour leader was ""fine all things being considered"", and was able to work ""through most of yesterday"". Denmarkis already there, as isSweden, and earlier this week Boris Johnson indicated the remaining Covid restrictions inEnglandcould end later this month. Wales, it seems, could be in a similar position come the end of March. Reaching that point would mark an incredibly significant milestone in the history of this pandemic - a full shift from government rules to personal responsibility. Long overdue, some will say. After all, the state doesn't legally instruct you how to deal with other illnesses. Others will question how such a move would square with Welsh ministers' narrative of a steady as she goes, cautious approach when there are still relatively high levels of transmission. All decisions, Vaughan Gething stressed today, will be ""supported by the latest public health advice"". We've long been told that we need to learn to live with Covid. Next month we'll get the government's plan as to how they intend to make that a reality. The most reliable measure now of infections is the weekly swab survey from the Office for National Statistics. It estimates that one in 25 people - around 4% of the population - had Covid in the week ending 5 February, a decrease. Covid case rates, based on positive test results, are more complicated to interpret, as they no longer include thousands of people who test positive with lateral flow tests. But even if we roughly calculate case numbers to include those ""missing"" lateral flow positive tests, the figures would still be more than 60% down on the peak in January. Numbers of patients in hospital with Covid have levelled out in the last week but remain much lower than last winter. There was a rolling average of 522 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on Thursday, down slightly (7%) on a week ago, while Covid patients in critical care and admissions have also flattened out. Nearly 70% of patients with a positive test for Covid in the last week were being treated primarily for other conditions. However, there are hundreds of former Covid patients now ""recovering"" and still waiting to be discharged, while acute bed occupancy is at record levels. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Covid passes have been required for large events such as football matches since last year Opposition politicians called for the Welsh government to spell out the way forward. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""The trend of infections, hospitalisations and deaths is downwards, a positive progression that shows the diminishing threat of the pandemic. ""Given these positive developments and the success of the vaccination campaign, this must mean that our freedoms in Wales are returned in full without delay."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth urged the Welsh government to ""keep things steady in the very real hope that we won't need to take a step back to any further restrictions in the future"". ""In the meantime, the Welsh government must set out the steps for what criteria must be met for all restrictions to be lifted in Wales."" Laws requiring the wearing of masks in indoor spaces were introduced in Wales in September 2020. The UK government lifted mask requirements in England last summer, before briefly reintroducing them for the Omicron wave at the end of 2021.

"Spain relaxes Covid restrictions for UK teenagersFrom Monday, unvaccinated British 12-to-17 year-olds will be allowed into Spain with a negative test.Business","Unvaccinated British teenagers will be allowed into Spain from Monday with a negative PCR test, Spanish tourism minister Fernando ValdÃ©s has told the BBC. At the moment everyone over 12 has to be double-jabbed to enter the country. Some families had already cancelled half term holidays to Spain and the Canary Islands because their children had not yet had their second jab. People aged 18 and over must still be vaccinated to get into the country. What Covid tests do I still need to travel abroad? Mr ValdÃ©s said that 12-to-17 year-olds who have not been vaccinated against Covid will be allowed into the country from Monday 14 February, if they present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival to Spain. The restrictions will be lifted from 23:00 GMT on 13 February. ""Great Britain is our main market,"" said Mr ValdÃ©s. ""We've been always very keen in easing the restrictions between both countries."" Spanish tourism minister Fernando ValdÃ©s All other UK travellers, excluding children under 12, will need to present a Covid certificate showing proof of being fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arrival in Spain. If more than 270 days have passed since vaccination, proof of a booster jab is also required. Prior to travelling, air passengers have to show a QR code, which they get by filling in aSpanish health control form,external. The announcement comes after many UK familiescancelled half-term tripsto mainland Spain and the Canary Islands due to the jab restrictions. Hoteliers in the islands said the restrictions had lost them millions of pounds' worth of trade. However, hundreds of thousands of people are embarking on half-term winter sun and ski trips,according to industry body Abta,external. Have you been affected by Spain's rule change? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy The UK scrapped coronavirus testing for fully vaccinated travellers from 04:00 GMT on Friday. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps described this as ""good news"" for families. ""The UK has eased international travel measures for Covid-19 and now has one of the most free-flowing borders in the world - sending a clear message that we are open for business,"" he said. The Canary Islands, Egypt, Portugal and Turkey are popular destinations for British holidaymakers, Abta said, as are the Caribbean, Dubai, Florida and Mexico. Bookings to ski resorts in France, Italy and Switzerland have also picked up, it said. The easing of restrictions on Friday came as Gatwick Airport announced that it wouldreopen its south terminal on 27 March,external. The terminal has been mothballed since 15 June 2020 as the airport tried to contain costs during the slump in international travel caused by the Covid pandemic. Gatwick's south terminal will reopen in March Now the terminal is reopening as airlines are starting to increase the number of flights they are operating. British Airways is to restart short-haul flights from Gatwick from 29 March and sister airline Vueling will add five new short-haul routes from the airport. Easyjet and Hungarian carrier Wizz Air have also added more slots. Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate said: ""After an incredibly challenging two years for the airport, our partners, local communities and the entire aviation industry, we are delighted to be reopening our south terminal next month. The airport has been ""recruiting for some time"", it said, and is still looking for 2,000 staff in roles including security officers, IT specialists, engineers, shop and restaurant workers, ground and cargo handlers and cabin crew. Despite signs of recovery in the travel industry, Heathrow Airport gave a downbeat assessment of passenger confidence on Friday. It said that demand for travel had been weaker than expected in January - 56% down on pre-pandemic levels -  ""as the hangover from Omicron continued to suppress passenger confidence"". ""While bookings for outbound tourism are recovering, inbound tourism and business travel remain weak due to Covid-19 levels in the UK and other countries, international testing requirements and the risk of new border closures in the event of a new variant of concern,"" it said. Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the removal of restrictions for vaccinated passengers in and out of the UK ""offers a ray of hope, but the Omicron hangover proves demand remains fragile"". But some travel firms are more optimistic. This week Tui chief executive Fritz Joussen said the firm expected ""a strong summer"", adding that ""demand for travel is high across all markets"". New bookings for the summer were above pre-Covid crisis levels Tui and the group expects summer bookings as a whole to be close to pre-pandemic levels. Jet2 boss Steve Heapy predicted the Spanish government's relaxation of restrictions would lead to an increase in bookings from the UK. ""The removal of the requirement for 12-17 year olds to be double-vaccinated tells families that travelling to Spain is returning to normal, and after two years of missing out we know how much everyone wants to experience that famous Spanish sunshine again,"" Mr Heapy said. The chair of Hays Travel, Dame Irene Hays, told the Today programme this week that the independent travel agent had seen a spike in bookings. ""In the last week of January we were back to the same levels of bookings as we were in January 2020,"" she said. How are travel rules being relaxed?

UK economy rebounds with 7.5% growth last year,"The UK economy rebounded last year with growth of 7.5% despite falling back in December due to Omicron restrictions, official figures show. It was the fastest pace of growth since 1941, although it came after a dramatic 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut. In December, the economy shrank 0.2% as Omicron restrictions hit the hospitality and retail sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the economy had been ""remarkably resilient"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures,externalshowed that in the last three months of 2021 growth was 1%, which ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said was ""pretty healthy"" given Omicron's spread and the introduction of some restrictions. The figures were stronger than expected, and Mr Morgan told the BBC the expansion in 2021 showed the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of nations. However, he urged caution about making strict comparisons. ""The growth in 2021 comes from a low base in 2020, when the economy fell sharply,"" Mr Morgan said. ""And if you look at where the UK economy is now, compared to its pre-pandemic level... the UK is middle of the pack, compared with the G7."" He said using this comparison, the US, Canadian and French economies were above the UK's, while the UK was above Italy, Germany and Japan. The worst of the overall pandemic economic hit is now behind us but the aftershocks remain. Downing Street is unlikely to avoid the opportunity to boast about 2021. During its hosting of the G7, the UK is now confirmed as the fastest growing economy of these major nations. But that comparison needs a great dollop of context. The 7.5% growth the UK economy recorded in 2021 is the highest of the G7 major economies and that does indicate a strong bounceback. This, as the ONS points to, should be seen alongside the sharpest fall of 9.4% for the UK compared to those same economies in 2020. On the internationally comparable basis, the economy is still slightly smaller than it was at the end of December 2019, unlike the US, France and Canada. On the slightly more timely basis, using monthly data not available in other countries, the UK economy is larger than it was in February 2020. The UK economy grew by 1% in the final quarter of 2021, a little lower than expectations, as the spread of the Omicron variant weighed on the economy in December. But as ever during these extraordinary times, this already looks like a rear view mirror on events. Looking forward, the extraordinary cost of living squeeze, with energy and other prices leading to falls in average living standards, is the significant iceberg for the economy in 2022. The ONS said that despite the fall in December, on a monthly basis GDP was in line with its pre-coronavirus level in February 2020. However, GDP in the October-to-December quarter remains 0.4% below its pre-Covid levels in the final three months of 2019. What is GDP and how does it affect me? Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Mr Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that despite Omicron the economy was remarkably resilient. We were the fastest growing economy in the G7 last year and are forecast to continue being the fastest growing economy this year. ""But I know that people are worried about rising prices, particularly energy bills... and that's why last week we announced a significant package of support to help millions of families meet the cost of bills."" Last year's growth was the strongest since ONS records began in 1948 and the fastest since 1941, during World War Two, using data collected by the Bank of England. The slump of 9.4% in 2020 was the biggest drop since 1919 when there was demobilisation after World War One. After 18 months of uncertainty, Ollie Vaulkhard's coffee shop and restaurant chain in north east England was seeing a strong end to 2021. He told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme that October and November were great months for the Vaulkhard Group as the economy opened up, but then things started to slow when Omicron hit. ""We lost customers, we lost staff to isolation and we had people being cautious because they had plans for Christmas."" He doesn't regard December as a disaster, more a loss of momentum. ""We lost the fizz off the top of a glass of champagne,"" he said. A better December would have been a good launch into 2022, when Mr Vaulkhard expects some tough times. ""We have wage cost rises, we have supply cost rises, we've had some brewery costs going up by 7% - they are all large,"" he said. The pandemic and lockdown kept a lid on costs for two years, but suddenly it's changing. ""I would prefer not to have them [price rises], but given the challenges we had this seems like another bridge to cross that we'll have to find a way over."" The economy is expected to face headwinds in 2022. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates, cut its economic growth forecast from 5% to 3.75% for this year and predicted that households were about to suffer the sharpest fall in living standards since records began three decades ago. This, said Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, would mean the economy will ""crawl"" this year and see the slowest growth of any G7 country. ""The reality is the way the government runs our economy is trapping us in a high tax, low growth cycle,"" he said. Inflation is forecast to hit 7% in April, the same month workers and firms will start to see a rise in their National Insurance (NI) contributions. Mr Sunak has been under pressure to scrap the NI increase, but vowed this month that it would go ahead. Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said he expected output lost during December and January to be regained in February and March, ""meaning that Omicron should not have had a lasting impact on the economy"". But he warned that consumer spending power would take a big hit in 2002. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, said that ""crippling"" inflation, tax rises in April, and higher energy bills means ""the UK economy is facing a materially weaker 2022"".

Unionist parties 'must commit to executive return',"Brandon Lewis said he was ""disappointed"" by the current crisis Unionist parties should commit to returning to power-sharing if Sinn FÃ©in is returned as the largest party after the election, Brandon Lewis has said. The Northern Ireland secretary said he was ""disappointed"" by the current crisis, sparked bythe resignation of First Minister Paul Givan. The move means the Northern Ireland Executive can no longer meet. Mr Lewis said he hoped the executive could be reinstated after the election on 5 May. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to say whether it would nominate for deputy first minister, if Sinn FÃ©in wins the most seats, entitling it to the first minister role for the first time. Under Stormont's power-sharing arrangements, the first and deputy first ministers are chosen by each of the largest unionist and nationalist parties - most recently the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. Both ministers have equal powers, and one cannot be in office without the other. How is the assembly still able to pass laws? A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Mr Lewis was asked about the scenario by Radio 4's Today programme. Speaking from Washington, he said: ""I would like to see parties - both nationalist and unionist parties - whatever the result in May, that they will nominate. ""The right thing for Northern Ireland is to have the devolved authority of the executive and assembly back as soon as possible after 5 May."" Northern Ireland's assembly election is due to be held on 5 May Mr Givan resigned in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. This is an element of the UK government's Brexit deal with the European Union (EU), keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods as a means of retaining an open Irish border. However, it has resulted in some additional checks for goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, prompting unionist criticism. As Mr Givan's resignation meant Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill was also removed from her role as deputy first minister, the Stormont executive can no longer meet. New lawsto allow the assembly to continue without a functioning executivewere passed by MPs on Monday night. Earlier this week,Mr Lewis ruled out calling an early assembly election at Stormont. He said ""it is right"" that the election date remains 5 May.

What is GDP and how does it affect me?,"The UK's economy had zero growth in the third quarter of 2024, according to the latest official figures. The strength of the economy affects things like pay increases for workers and the amount of tax the government can raise to pay for services. GDP stands for gross domestic product, and is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments and people in a country. In the UK, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) publishesnew GDP figures every month,external. However, quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more important. Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily. That's because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises. When GDP is falling, it means the economy is shrinking - which can be bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known asa recession, which can lead to pay freezes and job losses. The UK briefly fell into recession at the end of 2023, when the economy shrank in the last two quarters of the year. It rebounded in the first half of 2024, when GDP increased 0.7% between January and March, and0.5% between April and June,external. However, the economy had zero growth betweenJuly and September. The latest monthly figures show that GDPshrank by 0.1% in October. Analysts said the unexpected fall was linked to measures announcedin that month's Budget, including a rise in employernational insurance contributions (NICs)and ahigher minimum wage. In early December, the influential think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut its growth forecast for the UK for 2024. It now expects the UK economy to grow by 0.9% across the year as a whole, down from its previous prediction of 1.1%. That would make it the fourth best performer in the G7 group of rich nations,according to the OECD,external, behind the US, Canada and France, but ahead of Italy, Germany and Japan. However, economic forecasts are not always accurate. If GDP is going up steadily, people pay more in tax because they're earning and spending more. This means more money for the government, which it can choose to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Governments tend to get less money in tax, which means they may decide to freeze or cut public spending, or put taxes up. In 2020, the Covid pandemic caused the most severe UK recession for more than 300 years, which forced the government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy. How much money does the UK government raise and spend each year? Where does the government borrow billions from? GDP can be measured in three ways: Output: The total value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, construction, the service sector and government Expenditure:The value of goods and services bought by households and by government, investment in machinery and buildings - this also includes the value of exports, minus imports Income: The value of the income generated, mostly in terms of profits and wages In the UK, the ONS publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. But early estimates mainly use the output measure, using data collected from thousands of companies. The UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question. At that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in. The ONS publishes more information about thison its website,external. GDPdoesn't tell the whole story: the hidden economy:unpaid work such as caring for children or elderly relatives isn't captured inequality:it also doesn't show how income is split across a population - rising GDP could result from the richest getting richer, rather than everyone becoming better off, and some people could be worse off To try and address this, the ONS also publishes a figure for GDP per capita - or head of population - which can tell a different story. In fact, when you strip out inflation and population growth, the latest quarterly figures show thatGDP per capita actually fell by 0.1% between July and September 2024,external. Official GDP figures don't take into account unpaid work like looking after children Some critics also argue that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable,or the environmental damage it might do. Alternative measures have been developed which try to capture this. Since 2010,the ONS has also measured well-being,externalalongside economic growth. This assesses health, relationships, education and skills, as well as people's personal finances and the environment. But despite its limitations, GDP is still the most widely-used measure for most government decisions and international comparisons.

UK economy rebounds with 7.5% growth last yearThe expansion was ahead of forecasts despite a setback in December due to Omicron restrictions.Business,"The UK economy rebounded last year with growth of 7.5% despite falling back in December due to Omicron restrictions, official figures show. It was the fastest pace of growth since 1941, although it came after a dramatic 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut. In December, the economy shrank 0.2% as Omicron restrictions hit the hospitality and retail sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the economy had been ""remarkably resilient"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures,externalshowed that in the last three months of 2021 growth was 1%, which ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said was ""pretty healthy"" given Omicron's spread and the introduction of some restrictions. The figures were stronger than expected, and Mr Morgan told the BBC the expansion in 2021 showed the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of nations. However, he urged caution about making strict comparisons. ""The growth in 2021 comes from a low base in 2020, when the economy fell sharply,"" Mr Morgan said. ""And if you look at where the UK economy is now, compared to its pre-pandemic level... the UK is middle of the pack, compared with the G7."" He said using this comparison, the US, Canadian and French economies were above the UK's, while the UK was above Italy, Germany and Japan. The worst of the overall pandemic economic hit is now behind us but the aftershocks remain. Downing Street is unlikely to avoid the opportunity to boast about 2021. During its hosting of the G7, the UK is now confirmed as the fastest growing economy of these major nations. But that comparison needs a great dollop of context. The 7.5% growth the UK economy recorded in 2021 is the highest of the G7 major economies and that does indicate a strong bounceback. This, as the ONS points to, should be seen alongside the sharpest fall of 9.4% for the UK compared to those same economies in 2020. On the internationally comparable basis, the economy is still slightly smaller than it was at the end of December 2019, unlike the US, France and Canada. On the slightly more timely basis, using monthly data not available in other countries, the UK economy is larger than it was in February 2020. The UK economy grew by 1% in the final quarter of 2021, a little lower than expectations, as the spread of the Omicron variant weighed on the economy in December. But as ever during these extraordinary times, this already looks like a rear view mirror on events. Looking forward, the extraordinary cost of living squeeze, with energy and other prices leading to falls in average living standards, is the significant iceberg for the economy in 2022. The ONS said that despite the fall in December, on a monthly basis GDP was in line with its pre-coronavirus level in February 2020. However, GDP in the October-to-December quarter remains 0.4% below its pre-Covid levels in the final three months of 2019. What is GDP and how does it affect me? Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Mr Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that despite Omicron the economy was remarkably resilient. We were the fastest growing economy in the G7 last year and are forecast to continue being the fastest growing economy this year. ""But I know that people are worried about rising prices, particularly energy bills... and that's why last week we announced a significant package of support to help millions of families meet the cost of bills."" Last year's growth was the strongest since ONS records began in 1948 and the fastest since 1941, during World War Two, using data collected by the Bank of England. The slump of 9.4% in 2020 was the biggest drop since 1919 when there was demobilisation after World War One. After 18 months of uncertainty, Ollie Vaulkhard's coffee shop and restaurant chain in north east England was seeing a strong end to 2021. He told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme that October and November were great months for the Vaulkhard Group as the economy opened up, but then things started to slow when Omicron hit. ""We lost customers, we lost staff to isolation and we had people being cautious because they had plans for Christmas."" He doesn't regard December as a disaster, more a loss of momentum. ""We lost the fizz off the top of a glass of champagne,"" he said. A better December would have been a good launch into 2022, when Mr Vaulkhard expects some tough times. ""We have wage cost rises, we have supply cost rises, we've had some brewery costs going up by 7% - they are all large,"" he said. The pandemic and lockdown kept a lid on costs for two years, but suddenly it's changing. ""I would prefer not to have them [price rises], but given the challenges we had this seems like another bridge to cross that we'll have to find a way over."" The economy is expected to face headwinds in 2022. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates, cut its economic growth forecast from 5% to 3.75% for this year and predicted that households were about to suffer the sharpest fall in living standards since records began three decades ago. This, said Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, would mean the economy will ""crawl"" this year and see the slowest growth of any G7 country. ""The reality is the way the government runs our economy is trapping us in a high tax, low growth cycle,"" he said. Inflation is forecast to hit 7% in April, the same month workers and firms will start to see a rise in their National Insurance (NI) contributions. Mr Sunak has been under pressure to scrap the NI increase, but vowed this month that it would go ahead. Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said he expected output lost during December and January to be regained in February and March, ""meaning that Omicron should not have had a lasting impact on the economy"". But he warned that consumer spending power would take a big hit in 2002. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, said that ""crippling"" inflation, tax rises in April, and higher energy bills means ""the UK economy is facing a materially weaker 2022"".

"UK economy expanded 7.5% last yearGrowth was ahead of forecasts despite a setback in December due to Omicron restrictions.BusinessSwann alone cannot lift Covid rules, lawyers sayRobin Swann is advised that without an executive, he cannot act alone to amend or revoke regulations.Northern Ireland","The UK economy rebounded last year with growth of 7.5% despite falling back in December due to Omicron restrictions, official figures show. It was the fastest pace of growth since 1941, although it came after a dramatic 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut. In December, the economy shrank 0.2% as Omicron restrictions hit the hospitality and retail sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the economy had been ""remarkably resilient"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures,externalshowed that in the last three months of 2021 growth was 1%, which ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said was ""pretty healthy"" given Omicron's spread and the introduction of some restrictions. The figures were stronger than expected, and Mr Morgan told the BBC the expansion in 2021 showed the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of nations. However, he urged caution about making strict comparisons. ""The growth in 2021 comes from a low base in 2020, when the economy fell sharply,"" Mr Morgan said. ""And if you look at where the UK economy is now, compared to its pre-pandemic level... the UK is middle of the pack, compared with the G7."" He said using this comparison, the US, Canadian and French economies were above the UK's, while the UK was above Italy, Germany and Japan. The worst of the overall pandemic economic hit is now behind us but the aftershocks remain. Downing Street is unlikely to avoid the opportunity to boast about 2021. During its hosting of the G7, the UK is now confirmed as the fastest growing economy of these major nations. But that comparison needs a great dollop of context. The 7.5% growth the UK economy recorded in 2021 is the highest of the G7 major economies and that does indicate a strong bounceback. This, as the ONS points to, should be seen alongside the sharpest fall of 9.4% for the UK compared to those same economies in 2020. On the internationally comparable basis, the economy is still slightly smaller than it was at the end of December 2019, unlike the US, France and Canada. On the slightly more timely basis, using monthly data not available in other countries, the UK economy is larger than it was in February 2020. The UK economy grew by 1% in the final quarter of 2021, a little lower than expectations, as the spread of the Omicron variant weighed on the economy in December. But as ever during these extraordinary times, this already looks like a rear view mirror on events. Looking forward, the extraordinary cost of living squeeze, with energy and other prices leading to falls in average living standards, is the significant iceberg for the economy in 2022. The ONS said that despite the fall in December, on a monthly basis GDP was in line with its pre-coronavirus level in February 2020. However, GDP in the October-to-December quarter remains 0.4% below its pre-Covid levels in the final three months of 2019. What is GDP and how does it affect me? Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Mr Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that despite Omicron the economy was remarkably resilient. We were the fastest growing economy in the G7 last year and are forecast to continue being the fastest growing economy this year. ""But I know that people are worried about rising prices, particularly energy bills... and that's why last week we announced a significant package of support to help millions of families meet the cost of bills."" Last year's growth was the strongest since ONS records began in 1948 and the fastest since 1941, during World War Two, using data collected by the Bank of England. The slump of 9.4% in 2020 was the biggest drop since 1919 when there was demobilisation after World War One. After 18 months of uncertainty, Ollie Vaulkhard's coffee shop and restaurant chain in north east England was seeing a strong end to 2021. He told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme that October and November were great months for the Vaulkhard Group as the economy opened up, but then things started to slow when Omicron hit. ""We lost customers, we lost staff to isolation and we had people being cautious because they had plans for Christmas."" He doesn't regard December as a disaster, more a loss of momentum. ""We lost the fizz off the top of a glass of champagne,"" he said. A better December would have been a good launch into 2022, when Mr Vaulkhard expects some tough times. ""We have wage cost rises, we have supply cost rises, we've had some brewery costs going up by 7% - they are all large,"" he said. The pandemic and lockdown kept a lid on costs for two years, but suddenly it's changing. ""I would prefer not to have them [price rises], but given the challenges we had this seems like another bridge to cross that we'll have to find a way over."" The economy is expected to face headwinds in 2022. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates, cut its economic growth forecast from 5% to 3.75% for this year and predicted that households were about to suffer the sharpest fall in living standards since records began three decades ago. This, said Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, would mean the economy will ""crawl"" this year and see the slowest growth of any G7 country. ""The reality is the way the government runs our economy is trapping us in a high tax, low growth cycle,"" he said. Inflation is forecast to hit 7% in April, the same month workers and firms will start to see a rise in their National Insurance (NI) contributions. Mr Sunak has been under pressure to scrap the NI increase, but vowed this month that it would go ahead. Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said he expected output lost during December and January to be regained in February and March, ""meaning that Omicron should not have had a lasting impact on the economy"". But he warned that consumer spending power would take a big hit in 2002. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, said that ""crippling"" inflation, tax rises in April, and higher energy bills means ""the UK economy is facing a materially weaker 2022"".

Russian figure skater's failed drug test confirmedTeenager Kamila Valieva had helped win team gold for the Russian Olympic Committee.,"Valieva has continued to practise ahead of her individual event Kamila Valieva, the 15-year-old Russian figure skating star who helped her team win Winter Olympic gold in Beijing, failed a drugs test in December. Valieva, who was the first female skater to land a quadruple jump at an Olympics as her team won last Monday, had a sample collected on 25 December at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St Petersburg. But the positive result was only reported on Tuesday - the day after she helped to win team gold, but before the medal ceremony had taken place. Valieva case puts Russia & doping back in spotlight Valieva tested positive for trimetazidine, which is used in the prevention of angina attacks, but is on the banned list because it is classed as a cardiac metabolic modulator and has been proven to improve physical efficiency. A series of appeals means this case will now be taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to make a final ruling - with International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams saying he wanted a resolution ""as quickly as possible"". The medals for the team event - in which the United States finished second, Japan third and Canada fourth - will not be awarded until the outcome of the Cas hearing. A spokesman for the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it will ""take comprehensive measures in order to protect the rights and interests of the members of the ROC team and to preserve the honestly won Olympic gold medal"". Rusada - the Russian anti-doping agency - said on Friday that it is investigating Valieva's support team to ""identify all the circumstances of a possible anti-doping rule violation"". Cas will now hear the case before Valieva's scheduled appearance in the individual women's figure skating event, which starts next Tuesday, 15 February. The International Testing Agency (ITA) said Valieva had a sample collected on25 Decemberat the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St Petersburg. The sample was sent to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)-accredited laboratory in Stockholm, Sweden. Valieva competed in the European Figure Skating Championships in Tallinn, Estonia, inJanuary- which was between the positive test and the Winter Olympics - and won the women's singles, with Russian claiming a clean sweep of the gold medals. The ROC pointed out that Valieva's samples taken at the Europeans and before the Beijing Winter Olympics were both negative, adding: ""Taking into account that the positive doping sample of the athlete was not collected during the Olympic Games, the results of the athlete and the results of the team event during the Olympic Games are not automatically subject to review."" The adverse finding was reported on7 Februaryand Valieva was notified of the positive result on8 February. Valieva was provisionally suspended but she challenged the decision and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) agreed to lift it on9 February -enabling her to continue at the Beijing Games. Because of her age, Valieva was not confirmed as the athlete at the centre of ""legal issues"" delaying the medal ceremony, until it was widely reported in the media on10 February. The ITAconfirmed those reports,externalon11 Februarybecause of ""heightened public interest"". The International Olympic Committee, Wada and the International Skating Union (ISU) have all now appealed against Rusada's lifting of the provisional ban, with the ISU calling on the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to reinstate it. The ITA said the ""reasoned decision, including the grounds for which the provisional suspension was lifted, will be issued shortly to all concerned parties"". Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdnyakov told the Tass News Agency that the long gap between the 25 December test and the 8 February result looked suspicious and that he had ""serious questions about the process"". Rusada, the Russian anti-doping agency, claimed that the delay in processing Valieva's sample was due to Covid-19 cases at the Swedish laboratory that was analysing them. This video can not be played Kamila Valieva lands historic quadruple jump Valieva, who is favourite for the women's singles, has been seen training at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing. Eric Myles, chief sport officer of the Canadian Olympic Committee, said: ""We have the same questions as everyone else about the team figure skating case. ""It's important that a fair process unfolds and the integrity of sport is protected. Our hope is that this is resolved quickly and the medallists get the medal moment they've earned here in Beijing."" Russian athletes are competing under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee because Russia received a two-year ban from Wada in 2019 for its state-sponsored doping programme. Between 17 December 2020 and 17 December 2022, no athlete can represent Russia at the Olympics, Paralympics or World Championships. The ban was originally for four years but was reduced to two by Cas. Germany's Katarina Witt, a two-time Olympic figure skating champion, said: ""What they knowingly did to her, if true, cannot be surpassed in inhumanity and makes my athlete's heart cry infinitely. ""Kamila Valieva is a young girl and child prodigy, whose highly difficult performances and grace enchanted the whole world at only 15, a minor, depending on adults and she is not to blame here."" United States Anti-Doping Agency head Travis Tygart said: ""It is a catastrophic failure of the system to allow the star of the Games to have her sample not reported back close to five weeks, and then it gets reported the day after they won the team event."" BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott in Beijing After days of intense media speculation, the ITA have confirmed that the 15-year-old prodigy Kamila Valieva from Russia tested positive for a banned substance. Valieva is the favourite for gold in the women's singles figure skating event which begins on Tuesday (15 February) which means this whole process needs to be expedited. At the heart of this is a 15-year-old athlete. There are concerns over her welfare and the potential involvement of others in this. But viewers would be forgiven for feeling a sense of depressing deja vu that once again we are at an Olympics, there is a doping controversy and it involves Russia. Russia is still serving sanctions, but for many people they are Russia in all but name. Many people will be questioning whether they should have been allowed to compete at all, given the country's past with doping issues.

Our Friday updates of coronavirus news have been brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Jo Couzens, Jeremy Gahagan, Matt Murphy, Nathan Williams, Chris Clayton and James Clarke. We'll be back with more Covid coverage next week. We'll shortly be closing our live coverage of the day's events, as Covid restrictions continue to be eased and the half-term getaway begins. Here's a quick roundup of today's developments: As theWelsh government announces the relaxing of further coronavirus restrictions, we've heard some doubts as to the effectiveness of Covid passes from a security guard who works at a bar and nightclub in Cardiff. Phillip Francis says when he's asked customers for their passes, all many of them did was take snapshots of their friendâs certificates and show him the duplicates. He says he's never been sure how well the pass system has worked in terms of making the venue Covid secure. Havingembarrassed French President Emmanuel Macronearlier this week with some furniture-based diplomacy, Vladimir Putin has yet again used a table to illustrate a political message. The Russian leader received Kazakh
President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev at the Kremlin on Thursday. The two men shook hands and
sat close to each other, divided only by a small coffee table. The scene contrasted strongly with Macron's visit on Monday, where the pair were separated by a four-metre long table after the French president refused to take a PCR test. Sources at the ElysÃ©e Palace told Reuters that Macron had refused to take the test over fears the Russians would get hold of his DNA. The French president is not the only leader to have been subjected to the Kremlin's ""long-table"" diplomacy. Earlier this year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi were also seen sitting at a distance from Mr Putin during their visits to Moscow. The Kremlin has taken extra precautionary measures to protect Mr Putin, who turns 70 later this year and has been vaccinated with Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. By Richard Daniel & Rachael McMenemy At Stansted airport, as the UK lifts travel restrictions for the vaccinated, queues are forming once again at the check-in desks and there is a hint of holiday fever in the air. Londoner Ruth Reynolds, 27, is travelling to Tenerife with a friend - her first holiday since lockdown in March 2020. ""We both just wanted to get away. It's been a long two years - I have not left the country since before the last lockdown, so it's just a chance to relax and be warm,"" she says. The easing of restrictions ""made a big difference"" to her decision to travel now, she says, because she feels more confident about the travel landscape. And not having to pay for PCR tests was a huge financial relief and made travelling ""a lot less complicated"". ""I'm really happy to be travelling - it's a lot easier than before,"" she tells the BBC. So how are her fellow passengers feeling?Do they share her excitement? Earlier on we learned that Spain is lifting some of its Covid rules for travellers. That change in guidance, has come as welcome news for one family who feared they wouldn't be able to travel to the Canaries later this month. Leanne Ronksley, from South Yorkshire, was worried that her holiday would be cancelled due to Spain's current rule that everyone over 12 has to be double-jabbed to enter the country. From Monday, unvaccinated British teenagers will be able to present a negative PCR test instead. Leanne says she is ""absolutely relieved"" with the development and can now focus ""on just going on holiday"". She can't wait to tell her daughter the news when she returns from school and the family can finally get ""excited about going away"". Buen viaje Leanne! Airline Jet2 says bookings for February half-term have taken off since
travel rules were relaxed - up by 30% over the last four weeks compared to the same period in 2020. It has been driven by strong demand
for holidays to theCanary Islands, Spain and Portugal- as well as ski flights toGeneva, Grenoble, Lyon, Chambery, Lyon, Innsbruck,
SalzburgandBarcelona[for Andorra], says the airline. It tells the BBC it is also seeing strong demand for holiday bookings this summer, withSpain, the Canary Islands, Balearic
Islands, PortugalandItalyall looking set for a busy summer. Greece, TurkeyandCyprusare also proving popular choices for British holidaymakers in the summer months, it adds. And while the UK's rules may have changed, travellers will still have to abide by local regulations at their destination You can read about what the rules are for British visitorsin some popular international holiday spots here. Hundreds of thousands of Covid cases could be missed from the UK's official figures each week, new analysis shows - despite the recent move to start including reinfections. An average of just over 100,000 people
tested positive each day from 16 to 22 January, according to the government's
coronavirus dashboard. But the true number of cases each day
was likely to be nearer 280,000, according to estimates by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS). It means more than 1.2
million cases will not have been included in the official count during the week
to 22 January. The difference in figures reflects the fact the dashboard only counts people who have reported themselves testing positive. In contrast, the ONS figures are based on analysis of swabs taken from a representative sample of more than 150,000 people. The same people are tested every week, irrespective of whether they have had symptoms or not, and the ONS uses those results to estimate the likely prevalence of cases across the whole population. Meanwhile in the US, we've learned that roughly 3,000 teachers,
firefighters and other New York City workersface losing their jobs after failing to meet the city's deadline to get jabbed. Despite days of protests against the vaccine mandate, New York
City Mayor Eric Adams says he will not change the rules that were announced by
his predecessor Bill de Blasio last year. More than 95% of staff have complied with the rule, but opponents
say the requirement violates their freedom, with one former teacher telling the
BBC: ""You don't force people to do this."" Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News A decision on whether all five to 11-year-old children should be
offered a Covid vaccine was expected this to be announced this afternoon, but
has now been pushed back to early next week. The UKâs vaccine advisory body, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), has clearly made a
decision â although itâs not clear what it is. However, the timing of it is in
the hands of ministers. So what might they have considered? Only children in this age group with underlying conditions, which put them at
high risk from Covid, are currently eligible for a vaccine - two low-dose
injections of Pfizer. With most healthy children at very low risk from the virus,
including Omicron, and around 70% of primary school age having already been
infected, vaccine experts have a tough call to make on the health benefits. When 12-15-year-olds were recommended to have the vaccine in
September, they said it was a finely-balanced health decision. Other factors,
such as keeping children in school, tipped the balance in favour of
vaccinating. In younger age groups, some experts say vaccines will come too late
to make a difference to the risk of children being infected or reduce absences
in schools â particularly with the more contagious Omicron. Others say vaccines could help protect children against long
Covid. Many countries, such as the US, Israel and Denmark, have
vaccinated millions of over-fives. Others have gone further. Cuba, for example, is vaccinating
toddlers as young as two, while China is jabbing three-year-olds. Unison says the health of vulnerable people and colleagues must
not be left to individual choice â if self-isolation requirements come to an
end later this month, as outlined by the PM on Wednesday. Any changes to official guidance could lead to some employers
insisting that staff work despite virus risks or face penalties for choosing
not to come in, the union says. ""Ditching Covid rules while the virus rages suggests public
health is less important to the prime minister than saving his job,"" says
Unison general secretary Christina McAnea. ""Putting a match to sensible safety measures, without
providing guidance to employers, is reckless and will cause confusion and
alarm. ""People will take the virus into work â and school, risking
the health of colleagues and commuters. Anyone vulnerable will rightly feel
they've been flung under the bus.""
She called on ministers to ""provide clarity to employers and workers""
across all sectors of the economy, backed up by ""a proper sick pay system
that rewards people properly for doing the right thing"". Spain's relaxing of rules for children entering the country is ""another positive step towards the full resumption of travel"", says Tui. The travel company says: ""Spain has always been one of the most sought after family
hotspots. ""We hope that with these changes, along with the relaxation of
testing coming back into the UK, more families will now feel reassured of a
holiday in their favourite destination this summer."" Another 34,203 people in the UK have their booster or
third dose of a coronavirus vaccine, government figures show. In total, 65.5% of the population over the age of 12 has now had three jabs. A further 58,899 coronavirus
cases have been reported in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures,external. There have
also been another 193 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. A look at the figures for the past week shows the recent trend of falling cases and deaths continues - cases over the past seven days are down 28.7% on the week before and deaths down 22.5%. Stephen McDonellBBC News, China correspondent Despite pursuing a tough ""dynamic-zero"" policy to contain coronavirus
- and unlike Japan during last summer's games - China has found a way to put
some spectators in the stands during the Winter Olympics. Through a complicated configuration dividing arenas into sections,
authorities have been able to invite fans to events and avoid them coming into
contact with those in the two bubble zones - the teams competing and the
locked-in sports media. To be chosen as a spectator for these Olympic events, you are most
likely to be from a Communist Party organisation, a state company, or a student
group. There are also local government officials with tickets to the Games,
sponsors, and a smattering of diplomats. The planners have decided that such groups can be easily counted on to
do what needs to be done (especially when compared to the general public). Then there is another category of people, of which I am one, who are
being allowed in to see these supreme athletes compete: foreign correspondents. We have to do a Covid test 96-hours prior to any event, then a second
test 24 hours before. According to the rules, this is then followed up with a
third test three days after and a fourth test a week later. Read more about how China is managing the games here. Spain's easing of travel ruleshas come as positive news for those longing for winter sun this half-term, but for one family we spoke to it's come too late. Chris Place arrived in Tenerife today with his 22-year-old son for a week's holiday with extended family. However, his wife and 14-year-old daughter remain back in the UK. He says it was a ""flick of a coin"" to decide who stayed behind to look after his daughter, who is yet to receive her second vaccination and therefore can't currently travel. From Monday, unvaccinated British teenagers will be allowed into Spain if they present a negative PCR test. Chris is frustrated that Spain's announcement has ""come too late to help many families"". Returning briefly to the Welsh governmentâs coronavirus briefing
earlier, it looks possible that all Covid restrictions in Wales could be lifted
by the end of March. Asked if keeping rules in place for longer than England is about
playing politics, Welsh economy minister Vaughan Gething said: ""The
measures we are taking are on the back of expert scientific advice and public
health advice from our chief medical officer. ""And we'll continue to take that advice as we do look
forward to a time when there can be no restrictions in place. ""It is possible that will come at the end of March, if the
public health position remains positive."" He also responded to a question about reports the UK government
is considering defunding universal lateral flow tests, saying it would be
""a really significant mistake"". ""Coronavirus is still in circulation, so it doesn't feel
like a sensible thing to be doing it at this point."" Strict coronavirus restrictions have seen celebrations for the anniversary of the Iranian revolution scaled back for the second year running. Prior to the event, authorities had decreed that there was to be ""no gathering or marching"" to mark the day. Instead, thousands of Iranians celebrated the 43rd anniversary of the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi by driving through the capital, Tehran, chanting slogans including ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"". Despite the restrictions and chilly temperatures, celebrants converged on the capital's iconic Azadi Square on bikes and motorcycles, while others had painted their cars in the red, white and green colours of the Iranian flag. The country has been heavily hit by Covid. More than 133,000 people have died from the virus, and another 6.5 million have been infected since the pandemic began. Gripped by the Omicron variant, Iran has recently seen new coronavirus cases spiral past more than 30,000 a day. Nearly 65% of the country's 88 million strong population have received at least two doses of a vaccine. London Luton Airport chief says it's been ""a very difficult
couple of years"" â but with the easing of some of travel rules, at least
in the UK, things are looking up. ""I get the impression we're starting to see the light at
the end of the tunnel and there are lots of reasons to be optimistic,""
says Alberto Martin. All testing requirements were removed for fully-vaccinated
arrivals on Friday morning, with only a Passenger Locator Form required. ""The airlines are telling us that sales are looking really
good for half-term and the fact that the travel restrictions are being eased,
this is going to make it as easy as it's always been [to travel],"" he
adds. Read more. ""Travel to Spain is returning to normal,"" says Steve Heapy The boss of Jet2 has welcomed this morning's announcement that Spain will allow in unvaccinated UK teenagers from Monday, if they present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. Steve Heapy says: ""We are pleased to
see the Spanish government taking positive action to welcome more arrivals from
the UK and we know that this will lead to an increase in bookings."" He says the tour operator is already seeing strong demand
and ""this will boost that even further"". ""The removal of the requirement for 12 to 17-year-olds to be double-vaccinated tells families that travelling to Spain is
returning to normal. ""After two years of missing out, we know how much
everyone wants to experience that famous Spanish sunshine again."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Wales' face mask law could be scrapped in March,"Face masks will still be required until at least the end of March Wales' remaining Covid laws - including on face coverings and self-isolation - could be scrapped by the end of March. The Welsh government says falling case rates mean it can begin to ease its remaining rules, with domesticCovid passrules axed from 18 February. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said self-isolation rules could change from being law to guidance next month. But the law will remain for now, despite UK government proposals to ease the restriction in Englandin February. Mr Gething said the prime minister's move is not based on scientific advice. Meanwhile rules on masks will be eased from 28 February so they are only required in shops, salons, hairdressers, public transport and health and social care. They will no longer be mandatory in other venues such as museums or cinemas. Pupils will not have to wear masks in class from the same date - schools can then decide their rules. Secondary pupils, visitors and staff will still need to wear masks in indoor physical areas where physical distancing is not possible. As it happened: Plans to ease Wales' Covid restrictions outlined What are Wales' Covid rules now? Wales' first minister tests positive for Covid From next Friday Covid passes will no longer be legally required at cinemas, theatres, clubs and large events, although businesses can still use them if they want to. They will still apply for another week, including for Wales v Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday. This video can not be played Mr Gething said the latest moves provided a pathway to seeing Covid ""properly in the rear view mirror"". Although there is no precise timetable, it is the first time the Welsh government has said how it may completely lift its pandemic regulations. The Welsh Conservatives called for a date for the removal of all Covid laws, while Plaid Cymru said Labour ministers should spell out what criteria must be met for the restrictions to be scrapped. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Mr Gething announced that officials were keeping a close eye on a new transmissible version of the Omicron variant, called BA.2. He said there had been reports that the variant was behind a surge of cases in Northern Ireland. There are 246 cases in Wales. The economy minister told BBC News the remaining restrictions in Wales may be removed at the end of March. ""At that point we may move to self-isolation being guidance rather than mandatory but at this point we think it is still important to have that as a protective measure in law,"" he said. He said that the move will depend on the evidence of government advisers at the time. A further Covid review is due by 3 March. Separately, from 11 February guidance will be updated to clarify that adults can remove their face coverings when interacting with babies and small children at baby and toddler groups. Guidance will remain recommending that people wear face coverings where they can when indoors, or in large crowds of people, Mr Gething said. In England Boris Johnson said that self-isolation rules could end by 21 February. Mr Gething said this was a""highly unusual"" move by the prime ministerwhich had not been discussed between the Welsh government's and the UK government's chief medical officers. He was asked what would happen to someone who had Covid who lived in England but came to work in Wales without self-isolating, Mr Gething said that person would be ""in breach of the law"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said his government was ""confident that coronavirus rates are falling and we can look forward to brighter times ahead"". But he said he would not remove all measures at once ""because the pandemic is not over yet"". Leandra Craine is concerned too many restrictions are being lifted at once Leandra Craine, 23, who works for Disability Wales, said she was worried too many restrictions were being eased at once. ""I especially think of friends and family members who are immuno-supressed and have been having to shield for two years,"" she added. ""I don't think we should go back to normal as was, as I don't think it was working too well... I think there should be a new normal."" Phillip Francis questioned how well the passes had worked Covid passes, which show evidence of vaccination as well as whether someone has tested negative for Covid in the last 48 hours, have been required to entering nightclubs and other entertainment venues. Phillip Francis, who works at Mocka Lounge nightclub in Cardiff, questioned how effectively the system had worked. ""A lot of people who I asked for Covid passes, all they did was take snapshots of their friend's Covid passes, and were showing me their friend's pass,"" he said. Claire Vaughan, cinema programme manager for Chapter in Cardiff, was happy to see Covid passes go. She said older people ""can get confused with Covid passes, they may be uncomfortable with digital and wonder if they are still valid and just not come"". Dafydd Rhys, director of Aberystwyth Arts Centre, said it was good news Covid passes will no longer be required. Customers will need to continue to wear masks in shops until at least sometime in March. Caitlin Jones, manager of Dylan's Den Crystal shop, in Aberystwyth, said: ""As a business we don't mind that the requirement to wear masks in shops stays as long as staff are protected and we can keep trading."" Dafydd Rhys, director, Aberystwyth Arts Centre, praised the lifting of Covid passes. He said: ""It is great news for venues across Wales - there is no doubt about that as it did add to our costs in terms of human resource as more staff were needed to check the passes, and it slowed down the whole process for people coming to the theatre or the auditorium."" Mr Gething led Friday's press conference on the latest Welsh government review because Mr Drakeford was self-isolating after hetested positive for Covid. The economy minister said Welsh Labour leader was ""fine all things being considered"", and was able to work ""through most of yesterday"". Denmarkis already there, as isSweden, and earlier this week Boris Johnson indicated the remaining Covid restrictions inEnglandcould end later this month. Wales, it seems, could be in a similar position come the end of March. Reaching that point would mark an incredibly significant milestone in the history of this pandemic - a full shift from government rules to personal responsibility. Long overdue, some will say. After all, the state doesn't legally instruct you how to deal with other illnesses. Others will question how such a move would square with Welsh ministers' narrative of a steady as she goes, cautious approach when there are still relatively high levels of transmission. All decisions, Vaughan Gething stressed today, will be ""supported by the latest public health advice"". We've long been told that we need to learn to live with Covid. Next month we'll get the government's plan as to how they intend to make that a reality. The most reliable measure now of infections is the weekly swab survey from the Office for National Statistics. It estimates that one in 25 people - around 4% of the population - had Covid in the week ending 5 February, a decrease. Covid case rates, based on positive test results, are more complicated to interpret, as they no longer include thousands of people who test positive with lateral flow tests. But even if we roughly calculate case numbers to include those ""missing"" lateral flow positive tests, the figures would still be more than 60% down on the peak in January. Numbers of patients in hospital with Covid have levelled out in the last week but remain much lower than last winter. There was a rolling average of 522 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on Thursday, down slightly (7%) on a week ago, while Covid patients in critical care and admissions have also flattened out. Nearly 70% of patients with a positive test for Covid in the last week were being treated primarily for other conditions. However, there are hundreds of former Covid patients now ""recovering"" and still waiting to be discharged, while acute bed occupancy is at record levels. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Covid passes have been required for large events such as football matches since last year Opposition politicians called for the Welsh government to spell out the way forward. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""The trend of infections, hospitalisations and deaths is downwards, a positive progression that shows the diminishing threat of the pandemic. ""Given these positive developments and the success of the vaccination campaign, this must mean that our freedoms in Wales are returned in full without delay."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth urged the Welsh government to ""keep things steady in the very real hope that we won't need to take a step back to any further restrictions in the future"". ""In the meantime, the Welsh government must set out the steps for what criteria must be met for all restrictions to be lifted in Wales."" Laws requiring the wearing of masks in indoor spaces were introduced in Wales in September 2020. The UK government lifted mask requirements in England last summer, before briefly reintroducing them for the Omicron wave at the end of 2021.

"Breaking|Breaking newsUK economy expanded 7.5% last yearGrowth was ahead of forecasts as the economy opened up from lockdown, despite a slowdown in December.Business","The UK economy rebounded last year with growth of 7.5% despite falling back in December due to Omicron restrictions, official figures show. It was the fastest pace of growth since 1941, although it came after a dramatic 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut. In December, the economy shrank 0.2% as Omicron restrictions hit the hospitality and retail sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the economy had been ""remarkably resilient"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures,externalshowed that in the last three months of 2021 growth was 1%, which ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said was ""pretty healthy"" given Omicron's spread and the introduction of some restrictions. The figures were stronger than expected, and Mr Morgan told the BBC the expansion in 2021 showed the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of nations. However, he urged caution about making strict comparisons. ""The growth in 2021 comes from a low base in 2020, when the economy fell sharply,"" Mr Morgan said. ""And if you look at where the UK economy is now, compared to its pre-pandemic level... the UK is middle of the pack, compared with the G7."" He said using this comparison, the US, Canadian and French economies were above the UK's, while the UK was above Italy, Germany and Japan. The worst of the overall pandemic economic hit is now behind us but the aftershocks remain. Downing Street is unlikely to avoid the opportunity to boast about 2021. During its hosting of the G7, the UK is now confirmed as the fastest growing economy of these major nations. But that comparison needs a great dollop of context. The 7.5% growth the UK economy recorded in 2021 is the highest of the G7 major economies and that does indicate a strong bounceback. This, as the ONS points to, should be seen alongside the sharpest fall of 9.4% for the UK compared to those same economies in 2020. On the internationally comparable basis, the economy is still slightly smaller than it was at the end of December 2019, unlike the US, France and Canada. On the slightly more timely basis, using monthly data not available in other countries, the UK economy is larger than it was in February 2020. The UK economy grew by 1% in the final quarter of 2021, a little lower than expectations, as the spread of the Omicron variant weighed on the economy in December. But as ever during these extraordinary times, this already looks like a rear view mirror on events. Looking forward, the extraordinary cost of living squeeze, with energy and other prices leading to falls in average living standards, is the significant iceberg for the economy in 2022. The ONS said that despite the fall in December, on a monthly basis GDP was in line with its pre-coronavirus level in February 2020. However, GDP in the October-to-December quarter remains 0.4% below its pre-Covid levels in the final three months of 2019. What is GDP and how does it affect me? Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Mr Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that despite Omicron the economy was remarkably resilient. We were the fastest growing economy in the G7 last year and are forecast to continue being the fastest growing economy this year. ""But I know that people are worried about rising prices, particularly energy bills... and that's why last week we announced a significant package of support to help millions of families meet the cost of bills."" Last year's growth was the strongest since ONS records began in 1948 and the fastest since 1941, during World War Two, using data collected by the Bank of England. The slump of 9.4% in 2020 was the biggest drop since 1919 when there was demobilisation after World War One. After 18 months of uncertainty, Ollie Vaulkhard's coffee shop and restaurant chain in north east England was seeing a strong end to 2021. He told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme that October and November were great months for the Vaulkhard Group as the economy opened up, but then things started to slow when Omicron hit. ""We lost customers, we lost staff to isolation and we had people being cautious because they had plans for Christmas."" He doesn't regard December as a disaster, more a loss of momentum. ""We lost the fizz off the top of a glass of champagne,"" he said. A better December would have been a good launch into 2022, when Mr Vaulkhard expects some tough times. ""We have wage cost rises, we have supply cost rises, we've had some brewery costs going up by 7% - they are all large,"" he said. The pandemic and lockdown kept a lid on costs for two years, but suddenly it's changing. ""I would prefer not to have them [price rises], but given the challenges we had this seems like another bridge to cross that we'll have to find a way over."" The economy is expected to face headwinds in 2022. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates, cut its economic growth forecast from 5% to 3.75% for this year and predicted that households were about to suffer the sharpest fall in living standards since records began three decades ago. This, said Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, would mean the economy will ""crawl"" this year and see the slowest growth of any G7 country. ""The reality is the way the government runs our economy is trapping us in a high tax, low growth cycle,"" he said. Inflation is forecast to hit 7% in April, the same month workers and firms will start to see a rise in their National Insurance (NI) contributions. Mr Sunak has been under pressure to scrap the NI increase, but vowed this month that it would go ahead. Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said he expected output lost during December and January to be regained in February and March, ""meaning that Omicron should not have had a lasting impact on the economy"". But he warned that consumer spending power would take a big hit in 2002. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, said that ""crippling"" inflation, tax rises in April, and higher energy bills means ""the UK economy is facing a materially weaker 2022"".

"Drinkers shun beer for wine and spiritsPeople in the UK drank less beer and more wine and spirits in the pandemic, an industry group says.Business","Beer sales plunged in the UK during the Covid pandemic as people avoided pubs and drank wine and spirits at home instead, industry analysis found. Pubs, bars and restaurants lost Â£5.7bn of revenue from beer sales in 2021 alone, the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said. It called on the government to cut beer duty to help it recover from the effects of the pandemic restrictions. The Treasury said it froze beer duty for a fourth year saving brewers Â£900m. People started drinking at home more during the pandemic, splashing out on wine and spirits while pubs, bars and restaurants had to grapple with changing Covid restrictions, the BBPA said. In 2021, pubs, bars, restaurants and clubs served the equivalent of 1.4 billion pints less, the trade body said. Beer prices will have to rise, says Cobra founder Prosecco and pint taxes to fall, red wine to rise Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the BBPA, said every unsold pint was ""a stark reminder of the dislocating effect Covid restrictions had on our sector and the communities our pubs sit at the heart of"". The industry group also analysed alcohol taxes collected from March 2020, when the first lockdowns started in the UK, to October 2021, when some of the restrictions were relaxed. It found beer receipts fell by Â£681m to Â£5.4bn, while wine receipts increased Â£583m to Â£7.7bn and spirits receipts rose Â£784m to Â£6.9bn. The BBPA also called for taxes to be linked to the strength of the alcoholic drink, with lower-alcohol drinks being taxed less. ""Our analysis showing falling beer consumption supports the Treasury's stated objective to incentivise lower-strength products and differentiate beer from stronger wine and spirits as part of planned reforms to the alcohol duty system,"" Ms McClarkin added. ""We must again ask ministers to go further and support our recovery by continuing to reduce the punitive tax burden on our sector to ensure the sustainability of brewing and pubs."" However, Richard Piper, chief executive of charity and campaign group Alcohol Change UK, said ""Alcohol duty overall must rise faster than inflation every year, so we reduce, not increase, alcohol harm"". He argued lowering the taxes on beer would not benefit pubs either. ""It would apply equally to the supermarkets, and because of purchasing volumes this in fact makes the differential between pub and supermarket prices even bigger - harming pubs,"" he said. ""Beer duty cuts are primarily called for from the huge manufacturers, not pub landlords. These massive beer producers, many of them not even based in the UK, love to hide behind the pub image, while behind the scenes they are raking in millions in profit from alcohol harm."" He said Alcohol Change supported the Treasury's proposals, along with the BBPA, to bring in a cut to duty on draught beer and cider. The ""draught relief"", he said, would support pubs ""far more effectively than a blanket reduction in beer duty, which would only subsidise the already dirt-cheap supermarket prices"". The Treasury said draught relief  - aimed at supporting pubs by cutting taxes on their most popular products - would see the duty on a pint fall by 5%. Under the new plans, a pint of 3.4% alcohol beer will attract 25p less in duty and VAT. A spokesman said the government had ""comprehensively backed pubs and brewers alike throughout the pandemic"" through the furlough scheme, grants, reduced VAT and business rates relief. ""We welcomed views from the industry on the qualifying criteria for our proposed alcohol duty reforms as part of a consultation process and we're currently analysing responses,"" he added.

"Biden says US citizens should leave Ukraine nowThe US president says he has issued the warning due to ""increased threats of Russian military action"".Europe","Ukrainian forces have been carrying out exercises amid concerns of a Russian invasion US President Joe Biden has called on all American citizens remaining in Ukraine to leave the country immediately, citing increased threats of Russian military action. Mr Biden said he would not send troops to rescue Americans if Moscow invades Ukraine. Several other countries, including the UK, also urged their citizens to leave. Russia has repeatedly denied any plans to invade Ukraine despite massing more than 100,000 troops near the border. But it has just begunmassive military drillswith neighbouring Belarus, and Ukraine has accused Russia ofblocking its access to the sea. The Kremlin says it wants to enforce ""red lines"" to make sure that its former Soviet neighbour does not join Nato. Five ways out of Ukraine conflict Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up? ""American citizens should leave now,"" Mr Bidentold NBC News,external. ""We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly."" Asked whether there was a scenario that could prompt him to send troops to rescue fleeing Americans, Mr Biden replied: ""There's not. That's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another. We're in a very different world than we've ever been."" A host of other countries, including the Netherlands, Japan and South Korea have also told their citizens to leave Ukraine. In its warning Latvia cited ""a serious threat to security posed by Russia"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on a visit to Australia, said on Friday that ""an invasion could begin at any time, and to be clear, that includes during the Olympics"". The Winter Olympics in China are scheduled to end on 20 February. This video can not be played Iâm staying in Ukraine, for now: Watch US citizen and English teacher Juan Tec explain why Diplomatic efforts are under way to defuse the current crisis over Ukraine. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned his counterpart in Moscow that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would have ""tragic consequences"" for both countries. But Sergei Shogiu said growing military tensions in Europe were ""not our fault"". The current tensions come eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula. Since then, Ukraine's military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in eastern areas near Russia's borders. Meanwhile, Ukraine accused Russia of blocking its access to the sea as Russia prepared for naval exercises. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the Sea of Azov had been completely blocked and the Black Sea almost fully cut off by Russian forces. Russia's naval exercises were due to take place next week in the two seas to the south of Ukraine, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. However, Ukraine's Border Guard Service said on Friday that Russia had told them it had cancelled its drill in the Sea of Azov, an internal sea bordered by both Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine's port authority later said restrictions there had been lifted. Russian naval drills were already taking place in Crimea on Friday, while 10 days of military exercises continued in Belarus, to the north of Ukraine. There are fears that if Russia tries to invade Ukraine, the exercises put the Russian military close to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, making an attack on the city easier. Russia says its troops will return to their permanent bases after the drills end. Ukraine has launched its own 10-day military exercises, though officials have given few details. Moscow says it cannot accept that Ukraine - a former Soviet republic with deep social and cultural ties with Russia - could one day join the Western defence alliance Nato and has demanded that this be ruled out. Russia has been backing a bloody armed rebellion in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region since 2014. Some 14,000 people - including many civilians - have died in fighting since then. There is some suggestion that a renewed focus on the so-called Minsk agreements - which sought to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine - could be used as a basis to defuse the current crisis.

"Drinkers shun beer for wine and spiritsPeople in the UK drank less beer and more wine and spirits in the pandemic, an industry group says.","Beer sales plunged in the UK during the Covid pandemic as people avoided pubs and drank wine and spirits at home instead, industry analysis found. Pubs, bars and restaurants lost Â£5.7bn of revenue from beer sales in 2021 alone, the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said. It called on the government to cut beer duty to help it recover from the effects of the pandemic restrictions. The Treasury said it froze beer duty for a fourth year saving brewers Â£900m. People started drinking at home more during the pandemic, splashing out on wine and spirits while pubs, bars and restaurants had to grapple with changing Covid restrictions, the BBPA said. In 2021, pubs, bars, restaurants and clubs served the equivalent of 1.4 billion pints less, the trade body said. Beer prices will have to rise, says Cobra founder Prosecco and pint taxes to fall, red wine to rise Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the BBPA, said every unsold pint was ""a stark reminder of the dislocating effect Covid restrictions had on our sector and the communities our pubs sit at the heart of"". The industry group also analysed alcohol taxes collected from March 2020, when the first lockdowns started in the UK, to October 2021, when some of the restrictions were relaxed. It found beer receipts fell by Â£681m to Â£5.4bn, while wine receipts increased Â£583m to Â£7.7bn and spirits receipts rose Â£784m to Â£6.9bn. The BBPA also called for taxes to be linked to the strength of the alcoholic drink, with lower-alcohol drinks being taxed less. ""Our analysis showing falling beer consumption supports the Treasury's stated objective to incentivise lower-strength products and differentiate beer from stronger wine and spirits as part of planned reforms to the alcohol duty system,"" Ms McClarkin added. ""We must again ask ministers to go further and support our recovery by continuing to reduce the punitive tax burden on our sector to ensure the sustainability of brewing and pubs."" However, Richard Piper, chief executive of charity and campaign group Alcohol Change UK, said ""Alcohol duty overall must rise faster than inflation every year, so we reduce, not increase, alcohol harm"". He argued lowering the taxes on beer would not benefit pubs either. ""It would apply equally to the supermarkets, and because of purchasing volumes this in fact makes the differential between pub and supermarket prices even bigger - harming pubs,"" he said. ""Beer duty cuts are primarily called for from the huge manufacturers, not pub landlords. These massive beer producers, many of them not even based in the UK, love to hide behind the pub image, while behind the scenes they are raking in millions in profit from alcohol harm."" He said Alcohol Change supported the Treasury's proposals, along with the BBPA, to bring in a cut to duty on draught beer and cider. The ""draught relief"", he said, would support pubs ""far more effectively than a blanket reduction in beer duty, which would only subsidise the already dirt-cheap supermarket prices"". The Treasury said draught relief  - aimed at supporting pubs by cutting taxes on their most popular products - would see the duty on a pint fall by 5%. Under the new plans, a pint of 3.4% alcohol beer will attract 25p less in duty and VAT. A spokesman said the government had ""comprehensively backed pubs and brewers alike throughout the pandemic"" through the furlough scheme, grants, reduced VAT and business rates relief. ""We welcomed views from the industry on the qualifying criteria for our proposed alcohol duty reforms as part of a consultation process and we're currently analysing responses,"" he added.

Rights group 'should lose status' over trans rowLGBT groups want the Equality and Human Rights Commission to lose its status as an independent body.Family & Education,"Britain's human rights watchdog faces a legal challenge to its status over a row about transgender rights. In documents shared exclusively with the BBC, campaigners say they want the Equality and Human Rights Commission's status as an independent group revoked. It comes after the EHRC was criticised forasking Scotland to pause its plansto make it easier for people to change their sex on their birth certificate. The EHRC said critics were ""aiming at the wrong target"". LGBT charity Stonewall, backed by the Good Law Project, has drawn up a submission to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions, calling for the EHRC to lose its ""A rating"". This would prevent it from being able to make representations at the UN Human Rights Council, or its committees on human rights. The dividing lines over Scotland's gender laws Women's group bids to block census gender changes Finding love as a trans woman The 19-page submission accuses the EHRC of being ""excessively"" influenced by the UK government in the appointments of the chair and board members. The EHRC told the BBC it takes all decisions impartially and ""based on evidence in the UK and internationally"". ""All appointments to our non-executive and executive roles are made through a fair, open and transparent recruitment process. ""The way the commission is governed and commissioners appointed is set out in the Equality Act, and has not changed since the commission was established."" The EHRC is funded by the Government Equalities Office, but says it operates independently of ministerial control. Jolyon Maugham, of The Good Law Project, told BBC News: ""The EHRC is subject to a level of oversight and micro-management from the department which is just not consistent with being a UN Human Rights Institution."" The submission accuses Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is also the women and equalities minister, of making ""politically motivated"" appointments to the EHRC. Since Ms Truss's appointments took up their posts, the submission letter alleges there has been a marked change in the EHRC's stance on Scotland'splanned changes to the Gender Recognition Act. A spokesperson for the government's Equality Hub insisted the EHRC remains an independent public body, adding that the government is ""fully committed to advancing LGBT rights"". ""In recent years we have taken great strides, including reducing the cost of applying for a Gender Recognition Certification."" There has been controversy over the proposals, with campaign groups and some politicians questioning howthey could affect women-only services. Liz Truss is accused of politically-motivated appointments In a 2018 statement, still available on its website,external, the EHRC said it was its ""firm legal view"" that the reform of the Gender Recognition Act would not affect those services. This position was re-iterated in 2020,external, when the EHRC said there is ""no reason"" why making it simpler for people to legally change their gender would have an impact on protected spaces or services. However, in a statement published in January 2022, the EHRC called for the plans to be paused, and noted ""concerns"" around single-sex services, but did not elaborate on what those concerns were. In response to the legal challenge, the EHRC's chief executive told BBC News that campaign groups should be working with, rather than against them. ""The EHRC has the power to prosecute people and companies that discriminate against trans people - we have done so,"" said Marcial Boo. ""Instead of criticising the statutory regulator that exists to protect the rights of everyone in Britain, campaign groups should work with us to identify discrimination against LGBT people, so we can take action together to stop it."" Nancy Kelley, CEO of Stonewall, told the BBC she believed there was ""credible evidence"" that the EHRC no longer met the criteria of a national human rights institution. ""The politicisation of the UK's human rights body has placed trans people in the firing line, but this attempt to create a hierarchy of human rights in the UK is a very real threat to everyone, particularly those of us protected by the Equality Act.""

UK and EU set for fresh NI Protocol talks,"Liz Truss and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ met at Carlton Gardens in London on Friday The UK and EU will hold ""intensive discussions"" in the coming days after another round of negotiations between Liz Truss and her EU counterpart MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ came to an end on Friday. The chief Brexit negotiator previously said fixingthe Northern Ireland Protocolwas an ""absolute priority"". A joint statement indicated the pair had agreed on the need for progress ""in the interest of people in NI"". They said they will ""keep in close touch"". The UK foreign secretary and EU Commission vice president spoke via video-conference last week, but no breakthrough was reached. A meeting of the Joint Committee, the formal body overseeing the protocol, will happen on 21 February. That will be the first such meeting of the committee in more than six months. The government has insisted it wants to reach a solution urgently,after the collapse of the power-sharing executive at Stormontlast week. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew Paul Givan as first ministeras part of its ongoing opposition to the Irish Sea border. The party has argued thatunless the arrangements are changed, political institutions in Northern Ireland cannot continueas normal. Liz Truss said she wants to work with the EU towards solutions that deliver for people in Northern Ireland Ahead of the meeting, Ms Truss said: ""Fixing the Northern Ireland Protocol is an absolute priority for me. ""We have a shared responsibility with the EU to work towards solutions as quickly as possible that deliver for the people of Northern Ireland. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. That arrangement has prevented a hardening of the Irish land border, but it means new paperwork and processes when importing goods from Great Britain. Unionist politicians have criticised the arrangementsand say the Irish Sea border undermines Northern Ireland's position in the UK as well as causing difficulties for some businesses. The fact that a statement is ""joint"" would usually be taken as a good sign. But today's readout, from the UK's Liz Truss and the EU's MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, was also very brief - with a good chunk of the word count used up describing the logistics of the meeting, rather than its actual substance. Rumours that the UK would use today to make a ""big"" new offer have been downplayed by both sides although I am told ideas are always being batted about. Customs is the area where there has been the most progress but it is slow-going. All eyes now turn to the ""joint committee"" on 21 February - where senior politicians and representatives will meet in Brussels. It is a moment to take stock and see what, if anything, can be formally agreed in this period of heightened political sensitivity in Northern Ireland, ahead of the assembly elections in May. Speaking after an anti-protocol rally in Dromore, County Down, on Thursday night, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it was ""the single greatest threat to Northern Ireland's place in the UK in a generation"". ""The presence of trade barriers within our own country has the grave potential to succeed where decades of terrorism failed, by driving an irrevocable wedge between Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK,"" Sir Jeffrey said. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the EU should act immediately to ""resolve the problems created by the protocol"" ""If the EU really care about political stability in Northern Ireland, then they should act immediately to resolve the problems created by the protocol."" The rally also featured TUV leader Jim Allister and Ulster Unionist assembly member Robbie Butler alongside Baroness Kate Hoey and former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib. On Thursday, former prime minister John Major described the protocol as ""arguably one of the worst pieces of negotiation we have seen in recent history"". ""It is causing an enormous amount of trouble,"" he said. ""Whether anyone deliberately misled about that I can't say - certainly they were mistaken. ""But it does help, if you sign treaties, if you understand them before you sign them."" Former prime minister John Major described the protocol as ""arguably one of the worst pieces of negotiation we have seen in recent history"" On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his view that the government would trigger a mechanism to override part of the deal, if a breakthrough cannot be reached. Article 16allows either the UK or EU to temporarily suspend the protocol, if it is deemed to be causing significant economic, societal or environmental difficulties. Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis Executive return 'difficult' if protocol remains A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Over the past seven months the UK government has been attempting to renegotiate the deal. In July, it proposed an arrangement in which goods from Great Britain, which are due to stay in Northern Ireland, would not be checked and would have minimal paperwork. Goods which are due to move onwards to the Republic of Ireland would be checked at Northern Ireland's ports. The EU published its own proposals in October, which it said would significantly reduce, but not eliminate, checks on goods. It has previously said that the easiest way to reduce checks would be for the UK to sign up to a Swiss-style agri-food agreement. That would involve all of the UK following the relevant EU rules, something the government has said it could not accept. What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Figure skater's failed drug test confirmed,"Valieva has continued to practise ahead of her individual event Kamila Valieva, the 15-year-old Russian figure skating star who helped her team win Winter Olympic gold in Beijing, failed a drugs test in December. Valieva, who was the first female skater to land a quadruple jump at an Olympics as her team won last Monday, had a sample collected on 25 December at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St Petersburg. But the positive result was only reported on Tuesday - the day after she helped to win team gold, but before the medal ceremony had taken place. Valieva case puts Russia & doping back in spotlight Valieva tested positive for trimetazidine, which is used in the prevention of angina attacks, but is on the banned list because it is classed as a cardiac metabolic modulator and has been proven to improve physical efficiency. A series of appeals means this case will now be taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to make a final ruling - with International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams saying he wanted a resolution ""as quickly as possible"". The medals for the team event - in which the United States finished second, Japan third and Canada fourth - will not be awarded until the outcome of the Cas hearing. A spokesman for the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it will ""take comprehensive measures in order to protect the rights and interests of the members of the ROC team and to preserve the honestly won Olympic gold medal"". Rusada - the Russian anti-doping agency - said on Friday that it is investigating Valieva's support team to ""identify all the circumstances of a possible anti-doping rule violation"". Cas will now hear the case before Valieva's scheduled appearance in the individual women's figure skating event, which starts next Tuesday, 15 February. The International Testing Agency (ITA) said Valieva had a sample collected on25 Decemberat the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St Petersburg. The sample was sent to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)-accredited laboratory in Stockholm, Sweden. Valieva competed in the European Figure Skating Championships in Tallinn, Estonia, inJanuary- which was between the positive test and the Winter Olympics - and won the women's singles, with Russian claiming a clean sweep of the gold medals. The ROC pointed out that Valieva's samples taken at the Europeans and before the Beijing Winter Olympics were both negative, adding: ""Taking into account that the positive doping sample of the athlete was not collected during the Olympic Games, the results of the athlete and the results of the team event during the Olympic Games are not automatically subject to review."" The adverse finding was reported on7 Februaryand Valieva was notified of the positive result on8 February. Valieva was provisionally suspended but she challenged the decision and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) agreed to lift it on9 February -enabling her to continue at the Beijing Games. Because of her age, Valieva was not confirmed as the athlete at the centre of ""legal issues"" delaying the medal ceremony, until it was widely reported in the media on10 February. The ITAconfirmed those reports,externalon11 Februarybecause of ""heightened public interest"". The International Olympic Committee, Wada and the International Skating Union (ISU) have all now appealed against Rusada's lifting of the provisional ban, with the ISU calling on the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to reinstate it. The ITA said the ""reasoned decision, including the grounds for which the provisional suspension was lifted, will be issued shortly to all concerned parties"". Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdnyakov told the Tass News Agency that the long gap between the 25 December test and the 8 February result looked suspicious and that he had ""serious questions about the process"". Rusada, the Russian anti-doping agency, claimed that the delay in processing Valieva's sample was due to Covid-19 cases at the Swedish laboratory that was analysing them. This video can not be played Kamila Valieva lands historic quadruple jump Valieva, who is favourite for the women's singles, has been seen training at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing. Eric Myles, chief sport officer of the Canadian Olympic Committee, said: ""We have the same questions as everyone else about the team figure skating case. ""It's important that a fair process unfolds and the integrity of sport is protected. Our hope is that this is resolved quickly and the medallists get the medal moment they've earned here in Beijing."" Russian athletes are competing under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee because Russia received a two-year ban from Wada in 2019 for its state-sponsored doping programme. Between 17 December 2020 and 17 December 2022, no athlete can represent Russia at the Olympics, Paralympics or World Championships. The ban was originally for four years but was reduced to two by Cas. Germany's Katarina Witt, a two-time Olympic figure skating champion, said: ""What they knowingly did to her, if true, cannot be surpassed in inhumanity and makes my athlete's heart cry infinitely. ""Kamila Valieva is a young girl and child prodigy, whose highly difficult performances and grace enchanted the whole world at only 15, a minor, depending on adults and she is not to blame here."" United States Anti-Doping Agency head Travis Tygart said: ""It is a catastrophic failure of the system to allow the star of the Games to have her sample not reported back close to five weeks, and then it gets reported the day after they won the team event."" BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott in Beijing After days of intense media speculation, the ITA have confirmed that the 15-year-old prodigy Kamila Valieva from Russia tested positive for a banned substance. Valieva is the favourite for gold in the women's singles figure skating event which begins on Tuesday (15 February) which means this whole process needs to be expedited. At the heart of this is a 15-year-old athlete. There are concerns over her welfare and the potential involvement of others in this. But viewers would be forgiven for feeling a sense of depressing deja vu that once again we are at an Olympics, there is a doping controversy and it involves Russia. Russia is still serving sanctions, but for many people they are Russia in all but name. Many people will be questioning whether they should have been allowed to compete at all, given the country's past with doping issues.

Cas will now hear the case before Valieva's scheduled appearance in the individual women's figure skating event, which starts next Tuesday, 15 February. The International Testing Agency (ITA) said Valieva had a sample collected on25 Decemberat the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St Petersburg. The sample was sent to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)-accredited laboratory in Stockholm, Sweden. Valieva competed in the European Figure Skating Championships in Tallinn, Estonia, inJanuary- which was between the positive test and the Winter Olympics - and won the women's singles, with Russian claiming a clean sweep of the gold medals. The ROC pointed out that Valieva's samples taken at the Europeans and before the Beijing Winter Olympics were both negative, adding: ""Taking into account that the positive doping sample of the athlete was not collected during the Olympic Games, the results of the athlete and the results of the team event during the Olympic Games are not automatically subject to review."" The adverse finding was reported on7 Februaryand Valieva was notified of the positive result on8 February. Valieva was provisionally suspended but she challenged the decision and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) agreed to lift it on9 February -enabling her to continue at the Beijing Games. Because of her age, Valieva was not confirmed as the athlete at the centre of ""legal issues"" delaying the medal ceremony, until it was widely reported in the media on10 February. The ITAconfirmed those reports,externalon11 Februarybecause of ""heightened public interest"". The International Olympic Committee, Wada and the International Skating Union (ISU) have all now appealed against Rusada's lifting of the provisional ban, with the ISU calling on the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to reinstate it. The ITA said the ""reasoned decision, including the grounds for which the provisional suspension was lifted, will be issued shortly to all concerned parties"". Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdnyakov told the Tass News Agency that the long gap between the 25 December test and the 8 February result looked suspicious and that he had ""serious questions about the process"". Rusada, the Russian anti-doping agency, claimed that the delay in processing Valieva's sample was due to Covid-19 cases at the Swedish laboratory that was analysing them.

Eric Myles, chief sport officer of the Canadian Olympic Committee, said: ""We have the same questions as everyone else about the team figure skating case. ""It's important that a fair process unfolds and the integrity of sport is protected. Our hope is that this is resolved quickly and the medallists get the medal moment they've earned here in Beijing."" Russian athletes are competing under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee because Russia received a two-year ban from Wada in 2019 for its state-sponsored doping programme. Between 17 December 2020 and 17 December 2022, no athlete can represent Russia at the Olympics, Paralympics or World Championships. The ban was originally for four years but was reduced to two by Cas. Germany's Katarina Witt, a two-time Olympic figure skating champion, said: ""What they knowingly did to her, if true, cannot be surpassed in inhumanity and makes my athlete's heart cry infinitely. ""Kamila Valieva is a young girl and child prodigy, whose highly difficult performances and grace enchanted the whole world at only 15, a minor, depending on adults and she is not to blame here."" United States Anti-Doping Agency head Travis Tygart said: ""It is a catastrophic failure of the system to allow the star of the Games to have her sample not reported back close to five weeks, and then it gets reported the day after they won the team event."" BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott in Beijing After days of intense media speculation, the ITA have confirmed that the 15-year-old prodigy Kamila Valieva from Russia tested positive for a banned substance. Valieva is the favourite for gold in the women's singles figure skating event which begins on Tuesday (15 February) which means this whole process needs to be expedited. At the heart of this is a 15-year-old athlete. There are concerns over her welfare and the potential involvement of others in this. But viewers would be forgiven for feeling a sense of depressing deja vu that once again we are at an Olympics, there is a doping controversy and it involves Russia. Russia is still serving sanctions, but for many people they are Russia in all but name. Many people will be questioning whether they should have been allowed to compete at all, given the country's past with doping issues.
