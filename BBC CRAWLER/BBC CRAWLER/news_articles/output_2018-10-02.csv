Costa ad banned for criticising avocados,"An advert for Costa Coffee has been banned for urging customers to buy a bacon roll rather than avocados. The radio ad featured a voiceover which said there was ""a great deal on ripen-at-home avocados"" but they will only ""be ready to eat for about 10 minutes, then they'll go off"". The advert told people to choose the ""better deal"" of a roll or egg muffin. Two listeners complained that the ad, which aired in June, discouraged people from opting for fresh fruit. Smartphone doctor ads ruled misleading The advertising watchdog agreed with the complaints and upheld them. Costa said its ad played on the ""frustration and unpredictability of the avocado"". The chain claimed it was not suggesting that listeners must choose between the two breakfast options, but that it was instead telling people about its promotional offer. The organisation which clears ads for broadcast, Radiocentre, said consumers would see the ad as a ""light-hearted remark"" about the experience of buying non-ripe avocados. But in its ruling, the Advertising Standards Authority said consumers would interpret the ad as a comparison between the experience of eating an avocado and a bacon roll or egg muffin. ""We considered that, although the ad was light-hearted, it nevertheless suggested avocados were a poor breakfast choice, and that a bacon roll or egg muffin would be a better alternative, and in doing so discouraged the selection of avocados,"" the ASA said. All radio and television adverts must comply with theUK Code of Broadcast Advertising (BCAP),externalwhich states that comparisons between foods must not discourage fruit and vegetables. The advert must not be broadcast again, and Costa has been told to make sure its future ads do not ""condone or encourage poor nutritional habits"".

Unarmed officer tried to 'tackle' attacker,"Clockwise from top left: PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives An unarmed police officer has told an inquest about trying to ""rugby tackle"" the Westminster attacker as he brandished two knives outside the Houses of Parliament. PC Nick Carlisle was posted on the gates on March 22 last year when Khalid Masood stabbed PC Keith Palmer. Masood also drove into and killed four people on Westminster bridge. PC Carlisle said he distracted Masood so his colleague could get away, but PC Palmer died of his injuries. The inquest into the deaths of PC Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, is taking place at the Old Bailey in central London. Masood, 52, was shot dead by armed police during the attack and an inquest into his death is due to start after the inquests into his victims. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Who was attacker Khalid Masood? Westminster attacker 'told children he would die' When asked by lawyers if he had any doubt around what Masood wanted to do, PC Carlisle said: ""None whatsoever. ""He looked me directly in the eye. He was coming through a crowd of people. He was not interested in members of the public. ""He was coming to kill police officers."" The police officer saw smoke coming through the fence where Masood had crashed his car after the attack on the bridge, followed by crowds of people screaming and surging towards Parliament Square. PC Carlisle said: ""A man wearing a suit in his 40s shouted 'men with knife stabbing people, men with knives'. ""As soon as he said that I was drawn to the attacker just behind."" After backing away, the officer then saw Masood had caught PC Palmer. ""I ran forward intending to issue a rugby tackle, shoulder barge,"" said PC Carlisle. ""He came at me with knives up. I was very close."" But the distraction worked and gave PC Palmer enough time to get up and run as his colleague shouted for ""armed support"", the inquest heard. CCTV footage of Masood hiring a car for the attack has been released PC Carlisle then pointed out the attacker to the armed police and Masood was shot. He saw PC Palmer on the ground surrounded by a ""gaggle of people"" and went to help, but his colleague was pronounced dead at the scene. Hugo Keith, representing the Metropolitan Police at the inquest, said: ""You bravely attempted to go towards Masood and PC Palmer to try to disable Masood, but the reality was there was no time to stop him before he got to PC Palmer and once he turned towards you with his knives there was no time or ability to stop him after that."" PC Carlisle replied: ""It's fair to say, sir."" Lawyer Susannah Stevens thanked PC Carlisle on behalf of PC Palmer's family for his bravery. Later, lawyers gave their closing statements to the inquest as the evidence into the attack came to a close. Dominic Adamson, who represented PC Palmer's widow, Michelle, said there were systematic failures in parliamentary security systems. ""As a result of those failures the consequences for PC Palmer were that there was a substantial loss of the opportunities for him to be saved,"" he added. Ms Stevens said the lack of firearms officers protecting the entrance to parliament contributed to PC Palmer's death. And Gareth Patterson QC, for families of victims on the bridge, said were ""troubling areas of concern"" from the inquest. He urged the coroner to make a report on the circumstances of the case to ""protect the public"".

Mixed-sex civil partnerships to go ahead,"This video can not be played Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan are looking forward to setting a date All couples in England and Wales will be able to choose to have a civil partnership rather than get married, Theresa May has announced. The move, which follows a Supreme Court ruling, will give mixed-sex couples and their families the option of greater security, the government said. And it will address the ""imbalance"" that allows same-sex couples to choose, but not mixed-sex couples. A couple who campaigned for the right said it was a ""major step"" forward. But they said they would only celebrate ""when legislation is agreed"". Others have taken to social media to welcome the news and even take the extra step of proposing civil partnerships to their partners. Catherine Oakley sent a message on WhatsApp to her boyfriend Sam,who she describes as ""the embodiment of understatement"", asking him to ""not marry me"". Allow Twitter content?

""It's not the most romantic or conventional of proposals,"" she told the BBC. ""Marriage comes with historical, religious and gendered connotations - this offers a blank canvas. ""It's uncharted territory, so you can make it your own."" 'Time is running out for us' 'Why we want a civil partnership' US to end visas for gay diplomat partners The proposed change comes afterthe Supreme Court, in June, ruled in favour of Rebecca Steinfeld, 37, and Charles Keidan, 41, who wanted to be allowed to have a civil partnership. The court said that the Civil Partnership Act 2004 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Scottish government is also now carrying out a consultation on allowing mixed-sex couples to enter into civil partnerships. They were created in 2004 to give same-sex couples - who at the time couldn't marry - similar legal and financial protection to a marriage. They weren't available to mixed-sex couples. Then, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales and the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 did the same there. Since then, same-sex couples there have been able to choose between marriage or civil partnerships - except in Northern Ireland, where they are still not able to marry. But the opposite didn't become true - mixed-sex couples didn't get the right to a civil partnership. That's what's now set to change. A civil partnership is formed by signing a document. There is no requirement for a ceremony to take place or to exchange vows - unlike for a marriage - but you can do so if you wish. There are a range of reasons people give for not wanting to get married. High on the list, the feeling among some that marriage as an institution doesn't reflect their equal relationship because of its roots in traditional gender roles. Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan campaigned for four years to get the law changed and more than 130,000 people signed an online petition in support of civil partnerships for everyone. The couple said the ""legacy of marriage... treated women as property for centuries"" and was not an option for them. ""We want to raise our children as equal partners and feel that a civil partnership - a modern, symmetrical institution - sets the best example for them,"" they added. Beyond the issues of principle, there are many practical reasons for why some unmarried couples might now want to enter into a civil partnership. As the BBC's legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman explains, many of the 3.3 million co-habiting couples in the UK believe they possess similar rights and protections to those enjoyed by married couples - but they don't. Civil partnership win for mixed-sex couple Where are heterosexual civil partnerships legal? It can cause enormous distress when co-habiting partners find out - often on separation or the death of their partner - that they have far fewer inheritance, property and pension rights than they had thought. Becoming civil partners means couples will get these benefits without having to get married. The government said there were ""a number of legal issues to consider, across pension and family law"" and ministers would now consult on the technical detail. Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt promised that the change in the law would happen ""as swiftly as possible"". Mr Keidan said the couple had become ""accidental campaigners"" on the issue, but told BBC News: ""It wasn't just about us. ""There are many, many thousands of couples who would wish to form a civil partnership."" He said he now wanted the law to change and to know when the first mixed-sex civil partnerships would happen. Ms Steinfeld added: ""Charlie and myself can finally formalise our relationship in the way we see fit."" The couple fought for four years before winning their case at the Supreme Court Martin Loat, of the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign, also welcomed it as ""another important step forward towards civil partnerships for all"". He added: ""Legislation would be fair, popular and promote stable families. It's a shame it won't be introduced before April 2019, as that is when I am set to get married and I would much rather be ""civilly partnered"". Slow process I guess, but good news that consultations are happening. As the legal precedent is now there, it should be legislated for as soon as possible.Salli LaBelle Platt I'm so pleased. We have been together since 1979 and have two grown up children. I never wanted to get married, for me it carries too many connotations of ""belonging"" to a man.Ann Storey Richard and I were one of the first couples to sign a Civil Partnership in December 2005. Unexpectedly, Richard died suddenly in 2013.  Having the law on my side - especially when it came to dealing with pension rights etc - was important.Stuart Warburton-Smith Conservative MP Edward Leigh tweeted saying civil partnerships should be extended to include siblings as well.

Where does rent hit young people the hardest?,"This video can not be played What sacrifices have you made to get on the housing ladder? People in their 20s who want to rent a place for themselves face having to pay out an ""unaffordable"" amount in two-thirds of Britain, BBC research shows. They face financial strain as average rents for a one-bedroom home eat up more than 30% of their typical salary in 65% of British postcode areas. Many housing organisations regard spending more than a third of income on rent as unaffordable. A salary of Â£51,200 is needed to ""afford"" to rent a one-bed London home. Housing organisations recommend spending no more than 30% of your salary on rent. The average rent of a 1-bedroom home exceeds this for twenty-somethings in two-thirds of Britain.    Contains OS data Â© Crown copyright and database rights 2018. Scroll down for methodology. Insufficient data is available for Northern Ireland. Flat-sharing - the choice of many young employees - does not entirely resolve the issue as 12% of postcode areas in Britain remain ""unaffordable"" for two people in their 20s sharing a two-bedroom home. Analysis by the BBC's data team shows that a gross annual income of Â£24,800 would be needed for the average one-bedroom rental flat in England to become affordable under the 30% measure. In Scotland Â£20,700 is needed and in Wales Â£17,600. Many people can pay more than 30% of income on rent, but housing organisations say this puts considerable strain on the rest of their finances. Friends Molly Ebdon, 22, Danielle Campbell, 25, and Amelia Scott, 24 say renting is too expensive Friends Molly Ebdon, 22, Danielle Campbell, 25, and Amelia Scott, 24, all work in Cheltenham but find it prohibitively expensive to rent in the town. ""It is expensive on a starting salary and any kind of saving is not an option,"" Danielle said. Amelia, who previously rented but was now back living in the family home, said that moving into a rented home in Cheltenham would mean giving up a car and cutting back on other spending. But staying with parents also brought restrictions on where to look for jobs. Morgan Twyning says she has chosen to live with her boyfriend's parents Shop manager Morgan Twyning said she and her partner moved in with his parents in order to save, as rent would have taken up most of their salary. The 25-year-old said that Sunday roasts were nice but the living arrangements were ""not what I had envisioned"". ""My friends definitely struggle. A lot of their money is used up in just their rent alone,"" she said. Why was I ashamed of the fact my mum had no money?,external Tenant rights: Can a landlord kick me out? Shared homes: 'We had one girl living on a balcony' Sex and dating when you live with parents Dan Wilson Craw, director of lobby group Generation Rent, said: ""This research is more evidence of how difficult it is to lead the life you expect. If you get a job and work hard, you should expect to have some choice about living arrangements. ""People in areas with a strong jobs market have to find somewhere to share with others in order to afford to live there."" The data reveals the importance of location in determining how big a chunk of their monthly salary is likely to be spent on rent. Kate Faulkner, housing analyst and managing director of Propertychecklists.co.uk, said that renting can be affordable in many areas outside of London, but the particular squeeze in the capital dominated the debate and meant many other pressing concerns for these tenants were overlooked by policymakers. In London, a 20-something with a typical average income would spend 55% of their monthly earnings on a mid-range one-bedroom flat. Housing charity Shelter considers any more than 50% as ""extremely unaffordable"". That rises to 156%, so one-and-a-half times a typical salary, in one part of Westminster - the most expensive part of London - where an average one-bedroom home costs Â£3,500 a month to rent. In contrast, a tenant aged 22-29 looking for a typical property of this kind in the Scottish district of Argyll and Bute would only have to spend 15% of their income. Epping Forest - postcode areas IG9 (rent Â£1,230; 71% of income), RM4 (rent Â£1,126; 65% of income), and IG7 (rent Â£1,087; 62% of income) Cambridge - postcode area CB2 (rent Â£1,082; 62% of income) Elmbridge - postcode area KT10 (rent Â£1,151; 62% of income) Argyll and Bute - postcode area PA28 (rent Â£266; 15% of income) Scottish Borders - postcode areas TD9 (rent Â£327; 19%) and TD8 (rent Â£343; 20% of income) Northumberland - postcode area NE62 (rent Â£324; 20% of income) East Ayrshire - postcode area KA16 (rent Â£347; 20% of income) Finding one or more flatmates is a popular way of cutting the cost for many young tenants. The figures show that two people aged in their 20s sharing a two-bedroom flat in Manchester could pay just over 20% of their income on rent. Separate research from Shelter suggests that tenants may already find that they are cramped for space compared with those who own their homes. What are people's experiences of living in a shared home? Number of middle-aged renters doubles in a decade 'Nightmare' rental shortage for the disabled The charity estimated that private tenants in England are spending Â£140 more in housing costs than people with a mortgage. In the last 10 years, when families have been increasingly likely to rent, owners have seen the average floor space of their homes increase by 7% compared with a 2% rise for tenants. That leaves owners with an average of 30 sq m extra floor space than tenants, which the charity suggests is the equivalent of a master bedroom and a kitchen. This all comes at a time when young adults might look back in anger at previous generations. The BBC research shows that a private tenant in the UK typically spends more than 30% of their income on rent. In 1980, UK private renters spent an average of 10% of their income on rent, or 14% in London. However, there were many more people renting from councils or in social housing at that time. Landlords say they face costs, including their mortgages, insurance, maintenance and licensing, that need to be covered from rents. ""These costs are increasing as the government introduces new measures to discourage investment in property, such as the removal of mortgage interest relief and the changes to stamp duty,"" said Chris Norris, director of policy at the National Landlords Association. ""This is compounded by the number of landlords divesting as their businesses become less financially viable, resulting in fewer properties available to rent, while demand for properties across the UK remains high."" BBC News has set up a UK Facebook group all about affordable living.Join the Affordable Living group here,external. Map development by Joe Reed and Scott Jarvis, design by Debie Loizou and Irene de la Torre Arenas. There is no official UK measure of what constitutes an ""unaffordable"" rent, but based on recommendations from housing organisations the analysis uses a threshold of no more than 30% of income. The National Housing Federation recommends 30% of gross median income as the measure generally used by people in the housing sector and academics. Shelter defines anything over 33% as ""unaffordable"" and additionally anything over 50% as ""extremely unaffordable"". Because it's the age group that is by far most likely to be renting. Renting has more than doubled over the last 20 years, and 65% of 16-24 year olds and 42% of 25-34 year olds now rent privately, according toHouse of Commons Library research,external.

Did sonar cause unexplained whale deaths?,"This video can not be played Why have so many deep water whales washed ashore in Scotland? Scientists are investigating why 75 deep-water whales washed up on Scottish and Irish coasts during August and September. Most are Cuvier's beaked whales, which are among the deepest-diving whales on the planet. Experts said 45 badly decomposed beaked whales were washed up on Hebridean islands such as North and South Uist and Tiree, with another 22 stranded on the west coast of Ireland and one in Northern Ireland. They said it was highly unlikely that the animals were killed by a natural phenomenon such as disease. And the experts want to know whether increased military activity in the east Atlantic may have played a part in their deaths. They said sounds, like sonar used to trace submarines, may frighten whales to the surface too quickly, leading them to suffer decompression sickness - or the bends - which is similar to the potentially fatal condition experienced by divers. There are concerns that the whales being washed up are just the ""tip of the iceberg"" and hundreds could have died at sea. The Royal Navy said it took its responsibilities ""very seriously"" and carried out avoidance actions ""when at all possible"" if whales were detected before or during sonar operations. Warning: The following content includes graphic images A rare view of a Cuvier's beaked whale off the coast of Mexico Dr Andrew Brownlow, from the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS), said far less was known about Cuvier's beaked whales than other species. ""They are five or six metres long and they can weigh up to two tonnes but they are very secretive and very cryptic,"" he said. They live off the edge of the continental shelf and dive down to great depths, up to two miles, and can spend more than two hours down in the deepest oceans. Often, just the bones of the mammal are discovered The first stranding alerts came from the west coast of Co Donegal and Co Mayo in Ireland at the beginning of August. Irish researchers noticed specimens being washed up in badly decomposed conditions but still identifiable as beaked whales. Soon after that cases began to be reported up the Atlantic seaboard of the Scottish coast, especially on islands such as the Uists and Tiree. 'Large blobs' on Scottish beaches could be dead whales Whale stranding death toll rises to 58 in Scotland and Ireland Investigations into whale strandings in Scotland and Ireland There have now been about 50 whales reported washed up on the Scottish coast and 20 in Ireland since the start of August. Dr Brownlow said that was more in one month than in the past 10 years. There are concerns that the whales being washed up are just the ""tip of the iceberg"" and hundreds could have died at sea The Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Service (SMASS) has been collating the whale strandings on Scotland's west coast. The largest number (about 22) have washed up on North and South Uist in the Western Isles. But the small island of Tiree has seen at least nine strandings and nearby Coll has had two. Islay, Mull, Ulva and places along the west Highland coast of the mainland have also experienced strandings. It has been difficult to carry out any kind of a pathological post-mortem on the carcasses left They are being investigated but the whales have been washed up in an extremely decomposed state, often just bones, so it is difficult to carry out any kind of a pathological post-mortem. Dr Brownlow said his team would normally look for evidence of trauma or infectious disease but this was not possible in this case. He said it would take a collaboration with lots of disciplines to get a ""coherent picture"" of what happened. Dr Brownlow said the pattern of the strandings meant disease was an unlikely cause. He said you would expect to see whales being washed up in different states of body condition and some would be ill when they were stranded. The animals started off being relatively decomposed and then they moved on to being very decomposed. ""We think it's very much a focussed event that happened in terms of time and that doesn't fit the pattern of what we know about the disease process,"" he said. Scientists are investigating whether sonar is altering the behaviour of the whales Dr Brownlow said whales have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years in an environment that has been quiet. They use sound to be able to forage for food, to communicate and to navigate. However, human activity over the past century has made the oceans much noisier and disrupted their behaviour. Mass strandings of Cuvier's beaked whales often result from offshore human activities. Most regularly, due to active sonar used by military forces to locate submarines. Dr Brownlow said: ""In particular we know these animals are sensitive to what's called mid-range sonar, these are between about one and 10 kilohertz, which is used quite extensively by the military to navigate and find other craft."" He said the noise can change their behaviour. If they spend longer at depths or surface too quickly it can cause serious problems, he said. ""I mean these are amazing animals but they are mammals. They are very much like us they can get the bends,"" he said. Peter Tyack, professor of marine animal biology at the University of St Andrews, said the sonar used to hunt for submarines triggers a panic reaction in the animals. He said: ""It causes them to disrupt their diving behaviour in a way that either can cause them to flee and strand on the shore - or that may disrupt the diving so they get decompression sickness and they die at sea and wash ashore."" Experts want to know whether increased military activity in the east Atlantic may have played a part in the deaths The UK military has been asked for its activities in the area but it is not as easy to get information from other agencies within Nato or foreign navies. Dr Brownlow said: ""For example if the Russian Navy have decided to come down to the eastern Atlantic then that information about what they've been doing is unlikely to ever be made available to us."" Human activity over the past century has made the oceans much noisier which in turn has disrupted whale behaviour A spokeswoman for the MoD said: ""The Royal Navy takes its responsibilities in safeguarding the environment very seriously and, when at all possible, operators take avoidance actions should animals be detected before or during sonar operations. ""Our precautionary practices are similar to those used in other marine industries and are regularly reviewed by statutory bodies to ensure they reflect the latest understanding of the marine environment and the effects of sound on it. ""To remain effective elements of UK defence, Royal Navy units need to operate flexibly in locations around the UK and the world."" Forty-five badly decomposed beaked whales were washed up on Hebridean islands such as North and South Uist and Tiree Prof Tyack said one of the best known cases was noticed off the Canary Islands. A Spanish biologist studied some of the animals that stranded alive and found they had both gas bubbles and fat had embolised in the body - that is consistent with decompression sickness. Prof Tyack said the animals were diving under deep pressure and they must have suddenly come to a lower pressure near the surface and that caused bubbles to form which - just like in human divers - can be lethal. He said: ""These animals probably died at sea and there's been one case in the Canaries where a whale washed ashore about a week or two after a sonar exercise and they were too decayed to see the air bubbles - but you could see other signs that indicate decompression sickness. ""So that suggests what could happen here is the animals close to the exercise and far from the shore, might have disrupted their diving, got decompression, died, floated to the surface and then some of them washed ashore."" The Scottish and UK governments have ordered an investigation into the washed up whales Prof Tyack said the response of the Canaries strandings was to ban sonar within 50 nautical miles of the coast. He said that in the US they conduct sonar exercises on underwater ranges where they can track the location of the whales and very few exercises or training exercises have been associated with any problem when they occur in this kind of setting. The Scottish and UK governments have ordered an investigation.

Bacon and sausages 'linked to breast cancer',"Regularly eating foods like bacon and sausages may raise the risk of breast cancer, according to researchers. A review of studies found women who ate high levels of processed meat had a 9% increased risk of the cancer compared with those who ate little of it. The study backs up previous findings of the World Health Organization, which says processed meats cause cancer. Experts recommend caution about the findings and say the actual risk for individual women is ""very small"". Processed meats do cause cancer - WHO How much of a cancer risk are processed meats? Ultra-processed foods 'linked to cancer' This review, which included data on more than a million women, shows a link between processed meat consumption and breast cancer risk, but it's not clear if the food is actually causing this. There are also other pitfalls to consider. The 15 studies used in the analysis had different definitions of the highest consumptions. For example, one of the UK studies in the review classed high consumption as more than 9g a day - the equivalent of just two or three rashers a week - while in others it was much higher. The researchers in the majority of these studies noted what people said they ate and followed them up to see which of them developed breast cancer. But the problem with this is that people who eat different amounts of processed meat may also have other behaviours that might explain the differences in breast cancer risk, such as being more or less healthy in other ways. In the UK about 14 out of every 100 women will get breast cancer at some point in their lives. That means a 9% increase in risk in this population would be expected to translate into roughly one extra case of cancer in every 100 women. Cancer Research UK estimates that about 23% of breast cancers are preventable,external. It estimates that about 8% of cases are caused by being overweight and obese and another 8% by alcohol. Authors of this study,published in the International Journal of Cancer,external, say the link they found is only for processed meat, not red meat. TheWHO lists processed meat as carcinogenic,external, primarily because of evidence linking it to a raised risk of bowel cancer, while it says red meat is ""probably carcinogenic"". Processed meat has been modified to either extend its shelf life or change the taste, usually by smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives to meat. This includes bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky and ham. There are different theories for why it may raise the risk of cancer, including that curing salt may react with protein in the meat to make it carcinogenic. Lead author Dr Maryam Farvid, of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in the US, recommends cutting down on the meat rather than eliminating it. Currently, the NHS recommends eating no more than 70g of red and processed meat a day. Dr Gunter Kuhnle, associate professor in nutrition and health at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the study, said it was ""questionable"" whether people should lower their red and processed meat consumption on the back of this study. He said the actual risk posed by processed meats was ""very small"" for the individual and more relevant on a population-wide level. However, he said the study's findings should be followed up to investigate the links between processed meat and cancer and see whether the associated risk could be reduced, for example through new food production methods.

Tesla production hits all time highThe report of record output comes at a turbulent time for the California-based electric carmaker.Business,"Tesla said it produced a record number of vehicles in the most recent quarter, easing fears about the firm's ability to boost manufacturing. Elon Musk's electric carmaker said,externalit made more than 80,000 vehicles, including more than 53,000 of the Model 3 - roughly in line with forecasts. The disclosure comes at a turbulent time for the company. On Saturday,Mr Musk settled fraud chargesbrought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The agreement, which resolved questions about claims he made regarding potential plans to take the firm private, required him to step down as chairman. The episode had increased scrutiny of the California-based company, which has struggled over the last year to boost output of its newest model. The lag has exacerbated a cash crunch as expenses rise and deadlines for debt payments approach. This spring it revamped its manufacturing process, scaling back some of its automated features, a move that Mr Musk has told investors was helping. Tesla hit a major milestone in June, producing 5,000 Model 3 sedans in a week. The figures released on Tuesday suggest it has roughly maintained that pace for the Model 3s, its newest and cheapest model. However, its overall average production rate, including other models, is still short of the 7,000 cars a week that Mr Musk told investors in July would make the firm ""sustainably profitable"". Prices for the Model 3 start below Tesla's SUV and sports car, in a bid to attract a bigger pool of buyers The firm also appears to be struggling to get the cars into the hands of customers - a challenge Mr Musk has conceded in the past. Tesla said it delivered 83,500 vehicles in the quarter - 80% more than its total in 2017. ""With production stabilised, delivery and outbound vehicle logistics were our main challenges during Q3,"" the company said. Tesla also warned that tariffs in China were causing challenges, underscoring an issue it raised last quarter. China has raised import duties on US-made cars as part of the broader trade fight with the US. Tesla said the costs that go into its cars are roughly 55% to 60% higher than for local firms, when tariffs and sea transport costs are take into account. It plans to speed up plans for its new factory in China - but the firm said earlier that bringing that plant online would take several years. ""This makes for a challenging competitive environment, given that China is by far the largest market for electric vehicles,"" it said.

"Indonesia tsunami deaths pass 1,300","The number of people known to have died in Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 1,347, disaster response officials say. The death toll jumped on Tuesday from a previously confirmed figure of 844. The 7.5-magnitude quake struck just off the central island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu. Aid supplies are beginning to arrive in the city, where survivors have no access to running water or electricity. As tensions and need run high, police have begun guarding shops against looters. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Palu saw police firing warning shots and tear gas on Tuesday as people tried to take supplies from one shop. Police fired over crowds who were trying to raid one shop in Palu... ... but shortly after, allowed people to take the basic supplies they needed. Large queues are forming around any fuel stations in the area Officers initially took a lenient approach to survivors seizing basic goods, deputy national police chief Ari Dono Sukmanto said, but some people have since been arrested for stealing computers and cash. ""After day two the food supply started to come in, it only needed to be distributed,"" he said. ""We are now re-enforcing the law."" Pilot hails 'guardian angel' controller A town smashed to pulp in minutes Aerial shots of debris and survival after tsunami Humanitarian relief convoys entering the city are also being escorted by soldiers and police. In a separate incident, a volcano began erupting on the same island, Sulawesi, on Wednesday. Mount Soputan is about 1,000km (600 miles) away from Palu, and it was not immediately seen as a threat to the aid operation. Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu After days of waiting for aid, Wasliha decided she had to walk to find help. Her young family trekked through the mountains for more than 10 hours from her devastated village of Lolu Sigi Biromaru to Palu airport. ""We had no clean water or food and all we have is the clothes we are wearing,"" she says. Her children gulp down the water we give them, they haven't drunk anything since yesterday She had heard the military was flying out and had joined hundreds of people at the airport hoping to get a seat. Everyone wants to get out. Most can't and are having to endure another day without power and limited drinking water. In the town square people patiently wait in line to refill water bottles. Those that can make it here receive two meals a day, from a community kitchen run by volunteers and gallon of water to bathe in. Erna Wahyuni is cutting up a mountain of cabbage for soup. Her house was destroyed, but she wants to help. ""I was saved so I have to give back. It's also hard just sitting in a tent in the hot sun all day, I would rather be cooking,"" she laughs. Some people were rescued from the rubble in the first few days. This video can not be played Indonesia quake turns ground into liquid But many of the buildings brought down by the quake were then swamped by the tsunami, so hopes of more rescues are fading. In the hills above Palu, volunteers are filling a vast grave with the bodies of the dead. They have been told to prepare for 1,300 victims to arrive. The ground has become highly unstable and is constantly moving, making the search a dangerous operation and raising the risk of mudslides. Among the people confirmed dead are 34 Indonesian students, whose bodies were found under a church buried by one mudslide. Dozens more are still missing there. Teams have so far recovered three survivors from the ruins of the collapsed Hotel Roa Roa in Palu. An estimated 50 people were also inside when the quake hit. This is what's left of the Hotel Roa Roa in Palu Rescue team leader Agus Haryono said they were using acoustic detectors to try to locate more survivors. He said concrete and metal cutters were helping to clear the debris but added: ""We have to be very careful so we don't risk hurting any survivors."" Walls at a prison in Palu collapsed, allowing dozens of inmates to escape President Joko Widodo has called for reinforcements, telling the national search-and-rescue agency to send more police officers and soldiers into affected districts. ""There are some main priorities that we must tackle and the first is to evacuate, find and save victims who've not yet been found,"" he said. Across Palu, a damaged bridge, blocked roads, a partially closed airport and broken telecommunications have made it difficult to bring help into the affected area, and impossible to contact more remote regions. Aerial photos show the effects of the quake and tsunami on a major bridge in Palu With hospitals damaged, injured people have been treated in the open and at least one military field hospital has been set up. The military has taken over the airport to fly aid in, and injured people and other evacuees out. But for thousands of people wanting to get the first commercial flight out of Palu, the wait continues. ""I'd get a plane anywhere. I've been waiting for two days. Haven't eaten, barely had a drink,"" 44-year-old food vendor Wiwid told Reuters. This video can not be played Tsunami survivor: ""I was hugging my wife, but when the wave came... I immediately lost her"" On Monday, 3,000 to 5,000 people who wanted to be evacuated from Palu swarmed the airport hoping to hitch a ride on a military Hercules plane. The military arranged for them to depart on ferries instead. Bustling city with a population of approximately 350,000 people, with many banks and supermarkets Situated in a rain shadow - where there is very little precipitation - and one of Indonesia's driest places Near the popular beach area of Tanjung Karang Served by a busy regional airport The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs says there are nearly 200,000 people in urgent need of assistance, about a quarter of them children. How Palu suffered a 'worst case scenario' tsunami How warning system failed the victims Why Sulawesi's tsunami is puzzling scientists The British government said on Tuesday it was sending a transport aircraft filled with urgent aid to Indonesia. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""Britain stands united with Indonesia as they recover from this devastating tragedy."" The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday. Scientists believe it may have triggered an underwater landslide which set off a tsunami. The waves built up height and speed as they travelled down the long narrow bay towards Palu. Vice-President Jusuf Kalla has said the final death toll could be in the thousands, while the Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected. The moment the waves hit Palu.

"Clapping out, jazz hands in at university","This video can not be played SU access officer Sara Khan demonstrates British Sign Language applause A student union has ditched clapping, whooping and cheering in favour of ""jazz hands"". Reps at the University of Manchester voted to replace noisy appreciation with the British Sign Language (BSL) equivalent - a wave of both hands. Union officer Sara Khan said traditional clapping can cause issues for students with autism, sensory issues or deafness. But the move was criticised by some who accused students of being ""pampered"". Under the new measures, BSL clapping will be used at student events such as debates, panels and talks. Student groups and societies will also be encouraged to move away from audible clapping. Ms Khan, the union's liberation and access officer, who proposed the motion at a recent meeting said clapping can ""discourage"" some from attending democratic events. So-called ""jazz hands"", she said, encouraged an ""environment of respect"". ""I think a lot of the time, even in Parliamentary debates, I've seen that clapping, whooping, talking over each other, loud noises, encourages an atmosphere that is not as respectful as it could be,"" she said. This video can not be played The students' union say clapping affects people with certain health issues Ms Khan said the union was looking for more ways to make its events more inclusive. News of the measure was met with criticism in some quarters, with broadcasters Piers Morgan and Jeremy Vine among those weighing in. Morgan said it was a sign of Britain ""losing its mind"", while Vine posted a picture of soldiers in the trenches during WW1, suggesting they had managed to ""ignore the difficulties caused by sudden noises 100 years ago"".

Google to stream Assassin's Creed for free,"Assassin's Creed Odyssey is set in Ancient Greece in the year 413 BC Google is offering a limited number of gamers the chance to play popular video game Assassin's Creed Odyssey free of charge via its Chrome browser. In a blogpost outlining its plans for Project Stream,external, the search engine said it wanted to take streaming to ""the next level"". But it admitted there were technical challenges involved in streaming graphically rich content via a browser. One expert said it was a bold move from Google to grab gaming revenue. According to analyst company IHS Markit, global spending on games content and services is expected to reach $129bn (Â£99bn) this year. While that could represent rich pickings for Google, it does not underestimate the size of the challenge. Writing about Project Stream, Google's product manager, Catherine Hsiao, said: ""The technology and creativity behind these AAA [major] video games is extraordinary - from incredible detail and lifelike movement of the characters' skin, clothing, and hair, to the massive scale of the world in which the game unfolds, down to every last blade of grass. ""Every pixel is powered by an array of real-time rendering technology, artistry, visual effects, animation, simulation, physics and dynamics. ""We're inspired by the game creators who spend years crafting these amazing worlds, adventures and experiences. And we're building technology that we hope will support and empower that creativity."" IHS Markit's director of games research, Piers Harding-Rolls, said it was an obvious next move for the search giant. ""One area of the market that has yet to have been majorly disrupted and is still dominated by three incumbents is the TV console market,"" he said. ""Google believes it can disrupt this part of the market and force a way into the value chain. ""There are lots of other Google products and initiatives that align with cloud gaming - Google Cloud, Daydream VR, ARCore, Android, Android TV, Chrome, Chromecast - the list is really quite long, so it looks like a good strategic fit."" But, he added, challenges remained, including: the requirement for high-speed broadband the need to be close to data centres latency the cost of streaming and infrastructure to the operator the availability of content Games hardware companies such as Sony and Microsoft are already working on streaming services, with Sony offering PlayStation Now and Microsoft looking to partner AMD and make use of its cloud capability. The Project Stream trial is open to gamers, aged 17 or older, in the US. There will be no charges for the duration of the test.

Saudi woman 'barred from marrying musician',"The oud is an ancient Middle Eastern stringed instrument A Saudi woman has reportedly lost a legal battle to marry the man of her choice after her family objected because he played a musical instrument. Relatives of the woman, a bank manager, refused to allow her to wed the man, a teacher, saying his oud (lute) playing made them ""religiously incompatible"". A lower court backed that view, and its verdict has now been confirmed at appeal, a lawyer and local media say. Some people in the conservative Muslim state say music is ""haram"" (forbidden). Despite that, Saudi Arabia has a distinctive musical tradition - in which the oud features - and public concerts by Arab and Western artists are permitted. Arrested for having breakfast with a woman Woman 'held in Saudi for hugging singer' Inquiry into Saudi TV presenter's clothing The case of the bank manager and teacher came to light over the weekend, whenSaudi lawyer Abdul Rahman al-Lahim discussed it in a video on Snapchat,external. He said a woman from Unaiza, in the Qassim region, had asked him two years ago to file a lawsuit against her brothers because they had refused to give their permission for her to marry a man who ""once played the oud and so was not considered religious"". A court in Qassim had ruled in favour of the woman's family, he added,external. The newspaper Okaz cited the judge as saying: ""Because the suitor plays a musical instrument he is unsuitable for the woman from a religious point of view."" An appeals court recently upheld the verdict, making it final. Mr Lahim said the man had not been given the chance to defend himself before a court, and thatthe judgements ""established serious principles"",external. Mohammed Abdu, one of Saudi Arabia's most popular singers, has performed in public The woman told Okaz that she was still determined to marry the man, who she described as ""very pious and with a good reputation"". She will ask the country's ""highest authorities"" - an apparent reference to the royal court - to intervene. Mr Lahim's video sparked a fierce debate among Saudis on social media,external, with some people condemning the authorities for stopping a couple wanting to get married but failing to prevent forced marriages in the kingdom. Under Saudi Arabia's guardianship system, adult women must obtain permission from a male guardian - usually a husband, father, brother, or son - to apply for a passport, travel outside the country, study abroad on a government scholarship, get married or even leave prison. Since May, several women's rights activists campaigning for the guardianship system to be abolished have been detained,externalas part of an apparent crackdown on dissent.

Antidepressant withdrawal 'hits millions',"Millions of people get bad side-effects trying to cut down on or come off antidepressants, a large review says. TheAll Party Parliamentary Group for Prescribed Drug Dependence,externalreview suggests half of patients have withdrawal symptoms and for half of these the symptoms will be severe. Patients should be properly warned, it says. Yet guidance says symptoms are usually mild and clear up in a week. But it's not uncommon for side-effects to last for weeks, months or longer. The extreme side effects of antidepressants Teenage antidepressants 'doing more harm than good' Antidepressants: 'It's keeping me going' The review authors, Dr James Davies, from the University of Roehampton, and Prof John Read, from the University of East London, say about four million people in England may experience symptoms when withdrawing from antidepressants, and about 1.8 million may experience these as severe. This might include: anxiety sleep problems hallucinations Possible side effects of antidepressants - Mind,external They looked at 24 pieces of research, involving more than 5,000 patients, to reach their conclusions, published in theJournal of Addictive Behaviours,external. Some comments shared by these patients included: ""It took me two months of hell to come off the antidepressants - was massively harder than I expected"" ""While there is no doubt I am better on this medication, the adverse effects have been devastating - when I have tried to withdraw - with 'head zaps', agitation, insomnia and mood changes"" ""The difficulty of getting off has been a tough road and taken me years of trying and is something that doctors could be more knowledgeable of and supportive with"" Dr Davies said: ""This new review of the research reveals what many patients have known for years - that withdrawal from antidepressants often causes severe, debilitating symptoms which can last for weeks, months or longer. ""Existing NICE [National Institute for Clinical Excellence] guidelines fail to acknowledge how common withdrawal is and wrongly suggest that it usually resolves within one week. ""This leads many doctors to misdiagnose withdrawal symptoms, often as relapse, resulting in much unnecessary and harmful long-term prescribing."" Public Health England will look at the new data as part of itsreview into prescribed drug dependenceand NICE is currently gathering more evidence to update its advice. Antidepressants are one of the most common prescription drugs in the UK and their use has been rising. NHS figures show there were nearly 65 million of these prescriptions given out in England in 2016 - 3.7 million more than in 2006. Antidepressants are not addictive. And research shows they can be helpful but can take a few weeks to take effect. If you take an antidepressant for four weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist about whether you should continue on them. ProfWendy Burn, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""Antidepressants are an effective, evidence-based treatment for moderate to severe depression, and are a life-saver for many people. But not enough research has been done into what happens when you stop taking them. As this review shows, for many people the withdrawal effects can be severe, particularly when antidepressants are stopped abruptly. ""It's good to see more of a focus on this. We are pleased that Public Health England are prioritising dependence on, and withdrawal from, prescribed medicines as an area of review and welcome NHS England's referral to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) asking that they do the same.""

Cambridge plan to recruit poorer students,"Cambridge University is to open its doors to students from disadvantaged backgrounds who show great potential but have not met the entry grades. Vice-chancellor Prof Toope said it was time to dispel the stereotype of the highly selective university as a ""bastion of privilege"". Under the plan, some students who have faced ""educational challenge"" will be asked to join a transition programme. Presently, entry to Cambridge requires at least three As or A*s at A-level. Applicants also need to perform well in an interview. But, last year,data revealedthat four-fifths of students accepted at Oxford and Cambridge universities between 2010 and 2015 had parents with top professional and managerial jobs. And Cambridge was further criticised for its relatively low recruitment rate of black students. Last year, 58 black students were admitted across the university. Under the transition programme, candidates who show promise of excellence but may have come up against barriers to achieving their full potential may join a three-week bridging scheme or attend a foundation year designed to help them reach the required standard for Cambridge entry. In a speech marking the start of term,Prof Toope said,external: ""We cannot be truly great as a university if - even inadvertently - we are not open to the social and cultural diversity of the world around us. ""I would go as far as to ask,' Can we call ourselves a place of excellence if we are not fully inclusive of the most diverse talent?' ""This is not just a matter of box-ticking. ""For me, it goes even beyond acknowledging the obvious fact that all of us benefit in countless ways from teaching, learning, researching and working in environments where diverse nationalities, ethnicities, skill-sets, world-views or family backgrounds enrich one another."" Prof Toope said it was an ethical issue for Cambridge and the university could expect to receive public support only if it was prepared to encourage top talent ""regardless of where it flows from"". But he said: ""We will not lower our academic standards for admission. ""We will, however, continue to actively encourage applications from those eligible students - undergraduate and postgraduate, from the UK and from overseas - who may have been disadvantaged as a result of their educational journey."" Cambridge is aiming to raise at least Â£500 million to attract and support undergraduate and postgraduate students from around the world on the programme.

Trump: 'Scary time for young men'The remarks come as his Supreme Court nominee faces accusations of sexual assault which he denies.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Trump: ""Somebody could accuse you of something and you're automatically guilty."" President Donald Trump has told reporters it is a ""difficult"" and ""scary"" time for young men in the US. Mr Trump's remarks came as he reiterated his support for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is battling sexual misconduct claims by several women. A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh has been delayed as the FBI investigates the claims, which he denies. Mr Trump said he believed the Senate would approve the judge. His appointment would be expected to tilt America's top court in favour of conservatives for years to come. #BelieveWomen v #BackBrett Key takeaways from the Kavanaugh hearings Watch: 'They're using #MeToo politically' Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Mr Trump said: ""My whole life I've heard, 'you're innocent until proven guilty', but now you're guilty until proven innocent. That's a very, very difficult standard. ""It's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of."" The president said he was waiting to see what would come out of the FBI investigation into his top court pick, and he did not want to ""interrupt"" anything. At a rally later in Southaven, Mississippi, Mr Trump mocked last week's Senate testimony by Prof Christine Blasey Ford, without mentioning her by name. She says Judge Kavanaugh, 53, assaulted her when they were teenagers. This video can not be played How US teens talk about sexual assault The audience laughed as the president said: ""Thirty-six years ago this happened: I had one beer! Well, you think it wasâ¦? Nope! It was one beer. ""Oh, good. How'd you get home? I don't remember. How'd you get there? I don't remember. Where was the place? I don't remember. ""How many years ago was it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! I don't know! What neighbourhood was it in? I don't know. ""Where's the house? I don't know! Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don't know! But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters."" Mr Trump then criticised those who he accused of manipulating the accusers for political reasons. ""They want to destroy people,"" he said. ""These are really evil people."" The crowd chanted: ""We want Kavanaugh! We want Kavanaugh!"" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America correspondent The president has come to the defence of young (presumably white, presumably privileged) men, innocent or guilty, who suddenly find their reputations and livelihood threatened a year after the #MeToo whirlwind first swept on to the scene. In a nation whereyoung black men are incarcerated at a rate five times,externalthose of their white counterparts, the concept of ""innocent until proven guilty"" in criminal proceedings may ring hollow. For the rest of the nation, however - particularly the wealthy and well-connected - it has been central to the American concept of justice and due process. Those guarantees are proving to be scant protection now, however, when it's the court of public opinion, the court of the mass media, the court of American culture at large that are rendering their verdicts. Judge Kavanaugh's critics have been quick to point out that his nomination process is more akin to a job interview, where the worst that can happen is he doesn't get a promotion to the most powerful court in the nation. But is it just a promotion at play? Judge Kavanaugh's defenders counter that the accusations against him risk making the man a professional and social pariah. He has been disavowed by students and faculty of his alma mater, and his Harvard Law School teaching job has been terminated. If his nomination fails, he may still be a judge - but he will be always be the accused judge. The court of public opinion may not send people to prison, but - as the president notes - its verdicts come with their own sharp bite. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday only senators will see the FBI's report on its investigation. Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans want the FBI inquiry over this week. Meanwhile, a lawyer for Prof Ford said they had yet to be contacted by investigators, five days after the inquiry was launched. ""It's inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr Ford's allegations without interviewing her,"" her legal team wrote in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray. Republicans accuse Democrats of seeking to delay a vote until after the mid-term elections, in the hope they will win control of Congress and derail Judge Kavanaugh's appointment. But Democrats say they should not be rushed into a vote and the FBI should be allowed more time to investigate all allegations against the nominee. Why US top court is more political than UK's Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court Top judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein said Friday would be too soon to vote on the nomination, as Republicans are thought to be planning. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has fiercely championed the nominee, said the president should put Judge Kavanaugh forward again if the Senate fails to confirm him. Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who helped spur the FBI inquiry, criticised the judge for ""sharp and partisan"" remarks in his own Senate testimony last week. ""That concerns me,"" Mr Flake said at an event in Washington on Tuesday. ""We can't have this on the court."" It is not clear how Mr Flake will vote, but Republicans narrowly control the Senate by 51-49 and can only afford one defection. In his recent testimony, Judge Kavanaugh portrayed the allegations against him as a smear plot ""on behalf of the Clintons"". Appearing at the same event as Mr Flake on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton scorned the nominee's claim. ""I mean, really,"" she said. ""Yes, it deserves a lot of laughter."" What will the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh actually do? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Judge Kavanaugh denies the claims of three women: Psychology lecturer Prof Christine Blasey Ford, the first woman to come forward, says he tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth at a house party in 1982, when she was 15 and he was 17 Deborah Ramirez, a student at Yale at the same time as him, says he exposed himself to her during a college drinking game Julie Swetnick says she went to house parties attended by him in the early 1980s, where she said he and his friends had tried to ""spike"" girls' drinks Who are Supreme Court nominee's accusers?

May: No special treatment for EU migrants,"Low-skilled migration will fall when the UK ends EU free movement access after Brexit, Theresa May has promised. The prime minister said high-skilled workers would be prioritised with no preferential treatment for people from the EU compared with those from the rest of the world. But she said a future trade deal with the EU could include an agreement on ""mobility"" of each other's workers. Business groups expressed alarm about a crackdown on low-skilled workers. The Confederation of British Industry said it would make a shortage of care, construction and hospitality workers worse, adding: ""Restricting access to the workers the UK needs is self-defeating."" The British Retail Consortium said the policy should be based on the economy's needs rather an ""arbitrarily"" drawing a line based on salaries or skills. And Labour said the government was making a ""dubious distinction"" between low and high-skilled workers - saying care workers were technically ""low-skilled"" but were ""vital to our society"". How has EU migration changed the UK? The detail of Cabinet on immigration Reality Check: Which jobs are EU migrants doing? As it stands, EU freedom of movement allows people from the European Economic Area - all EU countries, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - plus Switzerland, to travel and work in the UK without visas, regardless of skills. For the rest of the world, specific categories of visas are needed to come and work or study in the UK, including one for ""skilled workers"" - who usually have to earn at least Â£30,000 and have a job offer. Currently, no ""Tier 3"" - low-skilled labour - visas are being given out. The UK defines low skilled roles as ones which do not require post-16 education or more than a short period of on-the-job training. The post-Brexit immigration plans follow arecommendation by the Migration Advisory Committee,external, which was also backed by Labour. The cabinet agreed to the committee's recommendations last week, and a White Paper setting out the details is promised in the autumn. Under the proposals: The passports of short-stay tourists and business people from all ""low-risk"" countries would be scanned at e-gates - currently only EU citizens can do this Security and criminal records checks would be carried out before visits, similar to the system of prior authorisation in the US Workers wanting to stay for longer periods would need a minimum salary, to ""ensure they are not competing with people already in the UK"" Successful applicants for high-skilled work would be able to bring their immediate family, but only if sponsored by their future employers The new system will not cap the number of student visas ""The new skills-based system will make sure low-skilled immigration is brought down and set the UK on the path to reduce immigration to sustainable levels, as we promised,"" Mrs May said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said free movement would end ""once and for all"" once the UK leaves the EU. This video can not be played The government will retain its commitment to reducing net migration, says Theresa May Asked whether exemptions would be made for industries requiring high levels of unskilled labour, she said the plan would recognise ""the further needs of the economy"" but that there would not be ""lots of exemptions"" for different sectors. And asked whether tourists would face extra bureaucracy when they visit EU countries, she said she hoped this would be dealt with in the course of the negotiations with the EU. The new system would aim to bring net migration to ""sustainable levels"", she promised - which she has defined as being below 100,000, a target the Tories set years ago but have never met. The EU's view The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt said the EU would not accept a UK immigration system that discriminated based on skills and job type - and that's the centre-piece of Mrs May's proposal. But it is not clear the extent to which the two sides will ever negotiate over this issue: the Brexit talks so far have been about the rights of people who have already moved and the negotiations about a future trade deal are likely to be about tourists, students and businesspeople - known in the jargon as ""mobility"" rather than immigration. In typical fastidious fashion Michel Barnier's team has already thought about all of this, giving a presentation to diplomats in February which said that UK migrants to the EU would be treated like citizens from anywhere else after Brexit. In a BBC Breakfast TV interview which also covered broader Brexit policy, Mrs May brushed off suggestions that there would have to be a general election or a referendum on any deal struck with the EU: Allow Twitter content?

The government has already announced the rights of EU citizens already living and working in the UK would be safeguarded after Brexit. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Home Secretary Sajid Javid told them: ""Deal or no deal, we want you to stay. We need you to stay. You can stay."" Mr Javid said the UK had an ""incredible opportunity"" to set out an immigration system ""without being constrained by the EU"". The new rules would be ""based on merit"", he said, promising a system that ""That judges people not by where they are from, but on what they can do"". In his conference speech, Mr Javid also said he would raise the standard of English required for people wanting to become British citizens and reform the official 'Life in the UK' test to make it better reflect British values. Please upgrade your browser Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, said the EU would not accept a system ""based on discrimination of skills and nationality"". British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson told the BBC it did not make sense to have separate rules for low and high-skilled workers. ""We shouldn't be thinking about it like that, we should be thinking about what it is the economy needs and, from a retail industry point of view, what it is that we as consumers need in our day-to-day lives in buying the products that we are taking for granted,"" she said. CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said the latest proposals had ""taken a wrong turn"". ""By dismissing the importance of low skilled workers to the UK economy, the government risks harming businesses and living standards now and in the future."" Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith predicted the UK benefits system would remain a ""massive pull factor"" for unskilled workers coming from the EU to compete with Britons. Asked about the warnings of shortages in sectors like care homes if this was cut, he said investment in new technology to monitor people in their own homes was needed to reduce dependency on cheap labour. Alp Mehmet, of the Migration Watch UK campaign group, claimed the proposals were ""not likely"" to cut net migration because EU migration would be replaced with arrivals from the rest of the world. ""That's taking your foot off the brake and frankly slipping onto the accelerator,"" he said.

"Johnson speech made me 'cross', says May","This video can not be played Theresa May: ""There are one or two things that Boris said that I am cross about"" Theresa May has told the BBC she is ""cross"" with Boris Johnson after the former foreign secretary launched a fresh attack on her plan for Brexit. The PM said Mr Johnson, who addressed an audience of more than 1,000 people at the Tory conference, could always be relied upon to put on a ""good show"". But she said parts of his speech about Northern Ireland angered her. ""He wanted to tear up our guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is part of the UK."" Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July in protest at Brexit policy, was cheered by activists when he urged Mrs May to drop her plan for future co-operation with the EU. Johnson calls May's Brexit plan a 'cheat' Would young voters back Tories for Â£10,000? Brexit: All you need to know DUP 'won't accept' Brexit sea checks In a speech in Birmingham, he argued her blueprint, called the Chequers plan, was ""undemocratic"" as it kept the UK within the ""tractor beam"" of Brussels and was not what people voted for. Urging Mrs May to return to the vision she originally set out in her Lancaster House speech in early 2017, he warned ""if we get it wrong we will be punished"". This video can not be played In full: Theresa May interview with Laura Kuenssberg The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg The prime minister, who is publicly as controlled as they come, revealed a flash of polite irritation telling me that she is ""cross"" with the things Boris Johnson has said. Trust me, the things that people in government have been saying about him privately are often far worse than that. The view of some of Mr Johnson's former colleagues is that he is a charlatan, who never showed that he could do the work needed, to show the responsibility required, to make decisions that would affect the lives of the public. There are numerous anecdotes of how the former foreign secretary would make promises he never kept, wouldn't properly focus on the documents, the detail, that came across his desk in one of the highest offices in the land. However, in a moment of proper candour, another of his former colleagues who knows him well, told me that the truth is, ""we're all a bit jealous"". Read more from Laura But Mrs May told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that she had not watched the speech and she was putting the national interest first in the negotiations. Her plan, she said, was the only one that would minimise disruption to trade while also upholding the UK's territorial integrity and Northern Ireland's constitutional status within the UK. Proposals put forward by the EU and others which did not do that were unacceptable, she said. ""There are one or two things that Boris said that I am cross about,"" she said. ""You know we, he and I are all members of the Conservative and Unionist Party. That's because we believe in the union of the United Kingdom. This video can not be played People were queuing for hours to hear Mr Johnson attack Theresa May's Brexit plan ""Northern Ireland is part of that union. And we have a guarantee for the people of Northern Ireland and we are upholding that. Our Chequers plan does that it's the only plan on the table at the moment that does."" Pressed on whether she believed Mr Johnson, who in his speech urged his party to cut taxes and make the case for free markets, was undermining her authority, she replied: ""There's one thing we all know about Boris is that he'll put on a good show. ""But what we've been doing here at conference of course and I think what matters to people out there is what the government does and what we focus on in terms of their day to day lives and what really matters to them."" Mrs May, who will make her leader's speech to conference on Wednesday, has also been defending the government's post-Brexit immigration policy, details of which were unveiled earlier. It will prioritise high-skilled workers and ensure EU nationals are treated the same as those from the rest of the world. Low-skilled migration would fall when EU free movement access ends, she said, although a future trade deal with the EU could include a ""mobility"" agreement to enable businesses to bring qualified people into the country for short periods of time. ""I think people will feel a difference because they will know that for the first time in decades it is the UK government that is deciding who can come into the country,"" she said. ""We will be able to decide the basis on which people come to the UK,"" she said. ""That hasn't been possible for many years for people coming from the EU. That will change.""

'Time's running out for us',"Joanna and Stephen never wanted to marry. But they have always wanted to make a ""public declaration"" of their relationship - and this became even more pressing when Stephen was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer six years ago. They went to their local registry office and found, to their great surprise, that they weren't allowed a civil partnership. So they waited. And waited. Now it's been announced that all couples in England and Wales - not just same-sex couples - will be able to choose to have a civil partnership rather than get married. But for this couple, at least, it's not about finances or security. ""It would just be nice to share some public declaration, particularly with our children,"" says Stephen Anderson, 57. ""And there is urgency because I'm living with this illness. It would be a jolly nice thing to do."" Mixed-sex civil partnerships to go ahead Why choose civil partnership over marriage? 'Time is running out for us' The couple have been together for 30 years and have three grown-up children. Joanna Christina, 63, a retired teacher who now runs a vegan street food business, and Stephen, a retired lecturer, are opposed to marriage because they feel it is outdated. For them the attraction of a civil partnership lies in the fact it ""hasn't been socially defined yet - it leaves us to define what we want it to mean"". ""It is more egalitarian. It's a partnershipâ¦ Civil partnerships are the way ahead for those who value liberalism,"" explains Joanna. There is no timescale for any law change - and the couple's disappointment at this is all too clear. ""We want to know when - when, when, when - is this going to happen?"" says Joanna. She is confident that withoutJune's Supreme Courtruling the government ""would be doing nothing"". ""We need a timetable now."" ""I'm fed up and frustrated,"" adds Stephen. ""I'm not delighted that it's been announced because it's been a great frustration that it hasn't been allowed from the first instance."" The campaign for Equal Civil Partnerships says it now hopes Joanna and Stephen will be one of the first different sex couples to form a civil partnership. Stephen says he'd like the law change to happen ""this afternoon"" - but for now the couple, who live in Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire, simply ""celebrate each day"" they have together. And on the day the law changes? ""We'd go and initiate the process immediately and then have a jolly good party!"" says Stephen.

Johnson: May Brexit plan a 'cheat',"This video can not be played Delegates cheer as Boris Johnson urges them to ""chuck Chequers"" Crowds packed into a speech by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. Mr Johnson renewed his attack on Theresa May's Brexit plan, describing it as a ""cheat"" that could lead to a boost for the far-right. In a wide-ranging speech, he also called for tax cuts and an increase in house-building. Long queues formed outside the event more than an hour before he began. He started with a self-deprecating joke about the chancellor's Brexit warnings. Philip Hammond's prediction that Mr Johnson would never be prime minister, he said, could be ""the only Treasury forecast in some time to have a distinct ring of truth"". Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""put some lead in the collective pencil"" and end a ""seeping away of our self-belief"". He also spoke up for police use of stop-and-search. Allow Twitter content?

But Brexit was his main focus as he called for the government to ditch the Chequers plan that led to his resignation from the government in July. He denounced the proposals - at one point suggesting the PM risked being prosecuted under a 14th century law saying that ""no foreign court or government shall have jurisdiction in this country"" - describing it as an ""outrage"". Mr Johnson spoke to a full house The BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth in Birmingham Expectations couldn't have been higher. Delegates started queuing at least an hour before the doors opened in order to get a seat at the much-anticipated event. At the foot of the stage there was a press scrum, cameras trained on former Brexit ministers David Davis and Steve Baker in the front row - alongside Stanley Johnson who'd come to see his son. No surprise then that when Boris Johnson took to the stage many in the audience rose to their feet. The speech was typically verbose and littered with jokes. There was applause for his criticism of the Labour Party and his fierce defence of Conservative values. But undoubtedly the biggest reaction came from his attack on the Prime Minister's Brexit proposals; cheers and enthusiastic clapping as he urged the party to ""chuck Chequers"". This wasn't a speech littered with standing ovations; matching the hype of such an event is hard. But Mr Johnson - and crucially his opposition to Theresa May's Brexit plan - proved hugely popular with many in the hall today and no doubt No 10 would have been watching. Remaining ""half-in half-out"" would prolong ""this toxic tedious business"", he said. ""If we cheat the electorate - and Chequers is a cheat - we will escalate the sense of mistrust. ""We will give credence to those who cry betrayal, and I am afraid we will make it more likely that the ultimate beneficiary of the Chequers deal will be the far right in the form of UKIP."" After the speech, he left the venue in a media scrum as he faced questions about whether he had been setting out a leadership pitch. His appearance was one of the most-anticipated events of the week The media scrum as Boris Johnson arrived for his speech Scottish Secretary David Mundell said people were ""concerned about Mr Johnson's behaviour"". Brexit negotiations are at a ""really critical point"" and people should support the prime minister, he said. ""Unfortunately Mr Johnson seems to behave in a way that suggests that he's only focused on his own self-interests and not on the interests of our country."" Earlier party chairman Brandon Lewis brushed off claims Mr Johnson's alternative agenda sought to undermine Theresa May. ""It's always dangerous getting into hypotheticals about what people may or may not say in the future, even if it's just later on today,"" he said. Mr Johnson has been a vocal critic of the prime minister's Brexit plan since leaving the Cabinet, calling it ""a moral and intellectual humiliation"" when setting out an alternative last week. May: No special treatment for EU migrants Middle-class drug users 'to be targeted' Emergency Â£240m to free up hospital beds Ahead of his conference appearance, he was pictured out jogging, in what some interpreted as a ""parody"" of Mrs May's claim that the ""naughtiest"" thing she did as a child was to run through a field of wheat. When asked before the fringe event how she had been getting on with Mr Johnson, the prime minister laughed and told BBC One's Breakfast: ""Well, I'm sure that's going to be a very lively event."" Questioned again later on BBC Radio 4's Today about how she felt that her former colleague appeared to be mocking her, she replied: ""What I feel is that I, and this government, and this party, are getting on with the important job... of getting a good deal for the United Kingdom when we leave the European Union."" Mr Johnson's attitude towards business - he was reported to have used the f-word in response to their Brexit concerns - wascriticised by Sir Digby Jones, former boss of lobby group the CBI, at the weekend.

Where else has civil partnerships?,"Civil partnerships will soon become gender-neutral in the UK The UK's Supreme Court decided on 27 June to make civil partnerships available for heterosexual couples as well as same-sex couples, In a civil partnership, a couple is entitled to the same legal treatment in terms of inheritance, tax, pensions and next-of-kin arrangements as marriage. Some, such as the UK couple who challenged the ban on civil partnerships for heterosexual couples, see traditional marriage as a patriarchal structure that ""has held women back"". Civil partnerships are referred to under different names in different countries around the world. Some call them civil unions, whilst other prefer to label them as domestic partnerships. But where are heterosexual civil partnerships permitted around the world? The picture regarding civil partnerships varies greatly across Europe. Some countries have made their civil partnerships gender-neutral - that is to say, applicable to both same-sex and heterosexual couples. Others have restricted civil partnerships to same-sex couples only, and a few have scrapped the concept of civil partnerships after making same-sex marriage legal. In France, the civil solidarity pact gives both same-sex and heterosexual couples the right to enter into a civil partnership. These ""pacts"" give couples many of the same legal benefits as married couples, but they are easier to annul during the divorce process. Similar gender-neutral civil partnerships exist in the Netherlands (since 1998), Belgium (since 2000), Luxembourg (2004), Andorra (since 2005), Greece (they were originally set up for opposite-sex couples in 2008, however they have been gender-neutral since 2015), Gibraltar and Malta (since 2014), Cyprus (since 2015), and Estonia (since 2016). Civil partnership win for mixed-sex couple 'Why we want a civil partnership' Why choose civil partnership over marriage? On the other hand, a number of European countries used to have civil partnerships for same-sex couples only, but got rid of them when they legalised same-sex marriage. Denmark was the world's first country to introduce civil partnerships for same-sex couples in 1989, scrapping the concept when it introduced same-sex marriage in 2012. Other Nordic countries (and Germany and Ireland) carried out similar processes, legalising civil partnerships but scrapping them when marriage for same-sex couples was legalised. Legal and financial protection for both parties in the event of the relationship ending, like in marriage It is free of the religious connotations of marriage Some object to marriage as an institution and its associations with property and patriarchy In the US, laws regarding civil partnerships (known as ""civil unions"" or ""domestic partnerships"") are passed at a city or state level. New York City has offered domestic partnerships to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples (if they above 18 and resident in New York City) since 1997, whileSan Francisco has given legal recognition to the ''domestic partnership'' of homosexuals and unmarried heterosexual couples since 1989,external. In California as a whole, domestic partnerships have existed for same-sex couples and for opposite-sex couples in which one person is above the age of 62 since 2000. Similar laws exist in the states of Washington and New Jersey. In the states of Colorado, Hawaii, Maine and Maryland, gender-neutral civil partnerships are legal. In Brazil, co-habiting couples have similar rights to married couples, but they do not have the automatic right of inheritance. In Ecuador, civil unions between two people were legalised by the 2008 constitution, without any reference made to gender, opening the option to both heterosexual and same-sex couples. Uruguay permitted gender-neutral civil unions from 2008 too. In South Africa, same-sex and heterosexual couples can register their relationships as either marriages or civil partnerships, with no legal difference. In Israel, a heterosexual couple are can enter a civil union-type agreement, where they are said to be ""known to the public,"" granting them legal rights without having to get married. Same-sex marriage is now legal in 26 countries around the world. 'Why we want a civil partnership' Australia approves same-sex marriage Why choose civil partnership over marriage?

Kuenssberg: He can't be ignored,"This video can not be played In full: Theresa May interview with Laura Kuenssberg ""It's over!""... ""He's forgotten the electorate""... ""Who cares?"" These are some of the more polite ways that cabinet ministers have responded to Boris Johnson's recent behaviour. The prime minister who is, publicly, as controlled as they come, revealed a flash of polite irritation telling me - in the interview you can watch on this page - that she is ""cross"" with some of the things he said. Trust me, the things that people in government have been saying about him privately are often far worse than that. Johnson speech made me 'cross', says May Johnson calls May's Brexit plan a 'cheat' The view of some of Mr Johnson's former colleagues is that he is a charlatan, who never showed that he could do the work needed, to show the responsibility required, to make decisions that would affect the lives the public.

However, in a moment of proper candour, another of his former colleagues who knows him well, told me that the truth is, ""we're all a bit jealous"". That's the crux. You may not trust Boris Johnson to run a bath, let alone the country. But just as in the Vote Leave campaign, we saw today that there is a constituency of people who want to hear him, who want to watch him, who care what he thinks and find that what he says inspires them. And on a serious point, that's not soap opera, some insiders close to the Brexit negotiations agree with him that the prime minister's Chequers proposal is not going to work. The government's official position of course is that it is the only offer that's workable and deliverable, and many ministers believe it can be at least the basis for a final deal. But today, baldly, one minister told me: ""Chequersisdead, and the prime minister will have to pivot."" That's why although his colleagues, and No 10, are more and more annoyed about his behaviour, he brought the Tory conference to life today, and why Boris Johnson cannot be ignored.

Amazon raises wages amid criticism,"Online retailing giant Amazon is raising pay for hundreds of thousands of workers in the US and the UK. Amazon's lowest paid US workers will receive $15 an hour. In the UK, pay will rise from Â£8.20 an hour in London to Â£10.50, while outside London the rate rises from Â£8 an hour to Â£9.50. The move comes after criticism of its employment practices, with complaints over its warehouse working conditions. Amazon has also been attacked by campaigners for how much tax it pays. The company is one of the biggest companies in the world, worth about $1 trillion. The Bezos backlash Amazon and Starbucks blast Seattle homeless tax How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top Amazon UK tax bill falls despite profits leap Its founder, Jeff Bezos, is the world's richest man, with a fortune estimated at some $150bn. The new pay rates start on 1 November, and will apply to all staff, full and part-time, as well as temporary and seasonal workers. The move will benefit 250,000 workers in the US, 17,000 in the UK and tens of thousands of seasonal workers. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the UK's GMB union, welcomed the announcement but said more needed to be done: ""Given their owner is the richest man in the world you'd think he could see fit to dig a little deeper, but it's a start. Mr Roache said that 90% of the GMB Amazon members had said they experienced ""constant pain at work"". The union said Amazon did not allow it to operate under its roof. TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: ""If Amazon is really serious about looking after its workforce it must recognise trade unions. ""Today's announcement is... only a start and shouldn't be spun as a huge act of generosity."" Amazon said in a statement: ""Amazon is a safe place to work. ""The facts clearly show allegations to the contrary are simply wrong and misleading when attempting to portray Amazon as an unsafe workplace."" Amazon owner Jeff Bezos is the world's richest man Amazon's move comes after widespread strikes by workers across Europe. This summer, workers took action to coincide with the internet retail giant's Prime promotion event. Staff at warehouses in Germany Spain and Poland were trying to force the firm to offer better working conditions. In the US, Amazon is also facing pressure from workers. The increase in Amazon workers' wages coincides with a cross-US movement by retail unions to raise wages to a minimum of $15 an hour, the so-called ""Fight for Fifteen"" movement. Already rival retailers such as Target and Walmart have had to raise their wages. Major US companies are finding recruitment a growing challenge with US unemployment so low and are having to raise wages to attract staff. The Democrat Senator and prominent Amazon critic, Bernie Sanders, told Reuters it was a good move that others should emulate: ""I want to give credit where credit is due. There is no reason why other profitable corporations in the fast food industry, the airlines and retail should not be following."" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said politics had played a part in Amazon's decision: ""The narrative that Amazon is an ungenerous employer at a time when the company's sales, profits, and valuation are soaring does not play well among many customer segments."" One way to understand Amazon's pay decision is politics. By one calculation, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos earns the median US Amazon employee annual salary every ten seconds. That disparity has led to political pressure to raise wages from those like Senator Bernie Sanders, who introduced a bill in the US, subtly named the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (BEZOS) Act, to tax the company, who he claims pays such low wages that its workers still rely on government programmes like food stamps. But the other, perhaps more salient way to put Amazon's decision in context, is economics. The US economy is booming right now, with record low unemployment and wage growth not seen in nearly a decade. Although the US federal minimum wage is $7.25, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current average hourly earnings for someone employed in the retail sector is $13.20. That's put pressure not just on Amazon, but on rivals like Costco, Target and Walmart, all of whom have announced pay raises for their lowest paid workers. In this context, Amazon is simply trying to catch up with a cannily timed move meant to lure workers in the crucial lead up to the holiday shopping season. Amazon said it would press for a change to the US Federal minimum wage level, which is currently $7.25. However, 29 US states as well as Washington DC have set their minimum wage levels higher than this. Amazon spokesman Jay Carney said: ""We will be working to gain Congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage. The current rate of $7.25 was set nearly a decade ago."" In the UK, the legal minimum wage is Â£7.83 an hour for over-25s and Â£7.38 for those aged 21 to 24. The retailer also said it would phase out one of its share incentive schemes, adding that the ""net effect of this change and the new higher cash compensation is significantly more total compensation for employees... and with more predictability"". Mr Bezos said: ""We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead."" The Bezos backlash: Is 'big philanthropy' a charade?

First woman Physics Nobel winner in 55 years,"Dr Strickland shared the prize for discoveries in laser physics The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to a woman for the first time in 55 years. Donna Strickland, from Canada, is only the third woman winner of the award, along with Marie Curie, who won in 1903, and Maria Goeppert-Mayer, who was awarded the prize in 1963. Dr Strickland shares this year's prize with Arthur Ashkin, from the US, and Gerard Mourou, from France. It recognises their discoveries in the field of laser physics. Dr Ashkin developed a laser technique described as optical tweezers, which is used to study biological systems. Drs Mourou and Strickland paved the way for the shortest and most intense laser pulses ever created. They developed a technique called Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA). It has found uses in laser therapy targeting cancer and in the millions of corrective laser eye surgeries which are performed each year. Speaking to the BBC, Dr Strickland said it was ""surprising"" it had been such a long time since a woman had won the award. However, she stressed that she had ""always been treated as an equal"", and that ""two men also won it with me, and they deserve this prize as much if not more than me"". Who is 'laser jock' Nobel winner Donna Strickland? The women standing up for science Arthur Ashkin and Gerard Mourou were honoured for their contributions to the field The award comes a few days aftera physicist gave a ""highly offensive"" lecture at the Cern particle physics laboratory in Genevain which he said that physics had been ""built by men"" and that male scientists were being discriminated against. He has since been suspended by the research centre. Dr Strickland called the physicist's remarks ""silly"" and said she never took such comments ""personally"". The last woman to win the physics prize, German-born American physicist Maria Goeppert-Mayer, took the award for her discoveries about the nuclei of atoms. Polish-born physicist Marie Curie shared the 1903 award with her husband Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel for their research into radioactivity. The award is worth a total of nine million Swedish kronor (Â£770,686; $998,618). Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie Reacting to her win, Dr Strickland, who is based at the University of Waterloo in Canada, said: ""First of all you have to think it's crazy, so that was my first thought. And you do always wonder if it's real. ""As far as sharing it with Gerard, of course he was my supervisor and mentor and he has taken CPA to great heights so he definitely deserves this award. And I'm so happy Art Ashkin also won."" She added: ""I think that he made so many discoveries early on that other people have done great things with that it's fantastic that he is finally recognised."" In a statement, the American Institute of Physics (AIP) offered its congratulations to all the winners, adding: ""The countless applications made possible by their work, like laser eye surgery, high-power pettawat lasers, and the ability to trap and study individual viruses and bacteria, only promise to increase going forward. ""It is also a personal delight to see Dr Strickland break the 55-year hiatus since a woman has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, making this year's award all the more historic."" Mourou and Strickland's technique has found several applications, including in laser eye surgery Before Dr Strickland and Dr Mourou's pioneering work, the peak power of laser pulses was limited because, when cranked up to high intensities, they would destroy the material used for amplifying its energy. To get round this, the researchers first stretched the laser pulses in time to reduce their peak power, then amplified them and finally compressed them. When a laser pulse is compressed in time and becomes shorter, more light is packed into a small space. This dramatically increases the intensity of the pulse. Dr Strickland and Dr Mourou's technique, called chirped pulse amplification (CPA), became standard for high intensity lasers. Arthur Ashkin realised an old dream in science fiction - using the radiation pressure of light to move physical objects. In doing so, he invented the optical tweezers that are today used to grab particles, atoms, viruses and living cells with their laser-based pincers. He first worked on getting laser light to push small particles towards the centre of the beam and hold them there. Then, in 1987, he used the tweezers to capture living bacteria without harming them. The technique is now used widely to study the machinery of life.

Johnson calls May's Brexit plan a 'cheat',"This video can not be played Delegates cheer as Boris Johnson urges them to ""chuck Chequers"" Crowds packed into a speech by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. Mr Johnson renewed his attack on Theresa May's Brexit plan, describing it as a ""cheat"" that could lead to a boost for the far-right. In a wide-ranging speech, he also called for tax cuts and an increase in house-building. Long queues formed outside the event more than an hour before he began. He started with a self-deprecating joke about the chancellor's Brexit warnings. Philip Hammond's prediction that Mr Johnson would never be prime minister, he said, could be ""the only Treasury forecast in some time to have a distinct ring of truth"". Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""put some lead in the collective pencil"" and end a ""seeping away of our self-belief"". He also spoke up for police use of stop-and-search. Allow Twitter content?

But Brexit was his main focus as he called for the government to ditch the Chequers plan that led to his resignation from the government in July. He denounced the proposals - at one point suggesting the PM risked being prosecuted under a 14th century law saying that ""no foreign court or government shall have jurisdiction in this country"" - describing it as an ""outrage"". Mr Johnson spoke to a full house The BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth in Birmingham Expectations couldn't have been higher. Delegates started queuing at least an hour before the doors opened in order to get a seat at the much-anticipated event. At the foot of the stage there was a press scrum, cameras trained on former Brexit ministers David Davis and Steve Baker in the front row - alongside Stanley Johnson who'd come to see his son. No surprise then that when Boris Johnson took to the stage many in the audience rose to their feet. The speech was typically verbose and littered with jokes. There was applause for his criticism of the Labour Party and his fierce defence of Conservative values. But undoubtedly the biggest reaction came from his attack on the Prime Minister's Brexit proposals; cheers and enthusiastic clapping as he urged the party to ""chuck Chequers"". This wasn't a speech littered with standing ovations; matching the hype of such an event is hard. But Mr Johnson - and crucially his opposition to Theresa May's Brexit plan - proved hugely popular with many in the hall today and no doubt No 10 would have been watching. Remaining ""half-in half-out"" would prolong ""this toxic tedious business"", he said. ""If we cheat the electorate - and Chequers is a cheat - we will escalate the sense of mistrust. ""We will give credence to those who cry betrayal, and I am afraid we will make it more likely that the ultimate beneficiary of the Chequers deal will be the far right in the form of UKIP."" After the speech, he left the venue in a media scrum as he faced questions about whether he had been setting out a leadership pitch. His appearance was one of the most-anticipated events of the week The media scrum as Boris Johnson arrived for his speech Scottish Secretary David Mundell said people were ""concerned about Mr Johnson's behaviour"". Brexit negotiations are at a ""really critical point"" and people should support the prime minister, he said. ""Unfortunately Mr Johnson seems to behave in a way that suggests that he's only focused on his own self-interests and not on the interests of our country."" Earlier party chairman Brandon Lewis brushed off claims Mr Johnson's alternative agenda sought to undermine Theresa May. ""It's always dangerous getting into hypotheticals about what people may or may not say in the future, even if it's just later on today,"" he said. Mr Johnson has been a vocal critic of the prime minister's Brexit plan since leaving the Cabinet, calling it ""a moral and intellectual humiliation"" when setting out an alternative last week. May: No special treatment for EU migrants Middle-class drug users 'to be targeted' Emergency Â£240m to free up hospital beds Ahead of his conference appearance, he was pictured out jogging, in what some interpreted as a ""parody"" of Mrs May's claim that the ""naughtiest"" thing she did as a child was to run through a field of wheat. When asked before the fringe event how she had been getting on with Mr Johnson, the prime minister laughed and told BBC One's Breakfast: ""Well, I'm sure that's going to be a very lively event."" Questioned again later on BBC Radio 4's Today about how she felt that her former colleague appeared to be mocking her, she replied: ""What I feel is that I, and this government, and this party, are getting on with the important job... of getting a good deal for the United Kingdom when we leave the European Union."" Mr Johnson's attitude towards business - he was reported to have used the f-word in response to their Brexit concerns - wascriticised by Sir Digby Jones, former boss of lobby group the CBI, at the weekend.

"Dad jailed for murdering daughter, 8","Mylee pleaded 'please daddy, no daddy, stop it' as Billingham dragged her into his home A controlling man who murdered his eight-year-old daughter in an act of revenge against his ex-partner has been jailed for a minimum of 27 years. William Billingham, 55, stabbed Mylee to death with a kitchen knife at his home near Walsall on 20 January. Judge Paul Farrer QC told him it was an act of ""revenge"" which was ""driven by jealousy and anger"". Mylee's mum, Tracey Taundry said her daughter was ""taken by a man who was supposed to protect and care for her."" Unemployed factory worker Billingham was convicted of murder and making a threat to kill Miss Taundry. ""How can I ever explain how the murder of my beautiful daughter - 'Smiley Mylee' - has affected me, her sisters and her immediate family?,"" Miss Taundry said. Tracey Taundry said she had ""constant nightmares"" about the night her daughter died ""Mylee was brutally taken from us by a man who was supposed to protect and to care for her. ""Since this incident I have struggled to sleep. I have constant nightmares and I relive that terrible night over and over again. None of us will ever get over what has happened."" The jury at Birmingham Crown Court heard Billingham ""turned his anger"" on Mylee after Miss Taundry began a relationship with a woman. Judge Farrer said he ""killed her in order to cause pain to her mother"". ""As such, this was an act of revenge. Alternately, this was the brutal, cowardly, killing of a defenceless and much-loved child who had her whole life ahead of her,"" the judge added. Billingham denied murder but claimed he was guilty of manslaughter due to depression Billingham opted not to give evidence during the trial and claimed he had no memory of stabbing Mylee. He claimed he was guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter due to depression. Jurors deliberated for about 80 minutes before unanimouslyconvicting him on Monday. Midlands Live: For news and updates The trial had heard how Billingham, who had six children with three women, produced a knife when Miss Taundry arrived at his home to pick up their daughter. She said she heard the ""tink"" of the blade as she waited for Mylee to get a bag from inside. He then told Miss Taundry ""I'm going to kill you"" before dragging Mylee back inside as she screamed ""mummy, mummy"" and ""please daddy, no daddy, stop it"", prosecutors said. The court heard accounts from two former partners about Billingham's history of violence. Forensic psychiatrist Philip Joseph told jurors: ""He has a particular difficulty in coping with the end of relationships and is likely to behave in an aggressive and intimidating manner."" Billingham was convicted of causing actual bodily harm in 1990 for an attack on his then girlfriend. He was also cautioned in 2007 after Mylee's mother alleged he slapped her in the face. As well as his sentence for murder, he was given a concurrent two-year sentence for making a threat to kill Miss Taundry while holding the knife to her neck. Billingham's barrister Balraj Bhatia said the killer had been verbally abused in the cells before being brought to court. ""Just this morning as I was preparing him for the impact statement, there was a palpable rush of hatred from every prisoner that walked by the cell,"" he said. ""This court will punish him in terms of years. His punishment - to use his own words - is that he is still breathing.""

Did the bends kill whales washed up in Scotland?,"This video can not be played Why have so many deep water whales washed ashore in Scotland? Scientists are investigating why 75 deep-water whales washed up on Scottish and Irish coasts during August and September. Most are Cuvier's beaked whales, which are among the deepest-diving whales on the planet. Experts said 45 badly decomposed beaked whales were washed up on Hebridean islands such as North and South Uist and Tiree, with another 22 stranded on the west coast of Ireland and one in Northern Ireland. They said it was highly unlikely that the animals were killed by a natural phenomenon such as disease. And the experts want to know whether increased military activity in the east Atlantic may have played a part in their deaths. They said sounds, like sonar used to trace submarines, may frighten whales to the surface too quickly, leading them to suffer decompression sickness - or the bends - which is similar to the potentially fatal condition experienced by divers. There are concerns that the whales being washed up are just the ""tip of the iceberg"" and hundreds could have died at sea. The Royal Navy said it took its responsibilities ""very seriously"" and carried out avoidance actions ""when at all possible"" if whales were detected before or during sonar operations. Warning: The following content includes graphic images A rare view of a Cuvier's beaked whale off the coast of Mexico Dr Andrew Brownlow, from the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS), said far less was known about Cuvier's beaked whales than other species. ""They are five or six metres long and they can weigh up to two tonnes but they are very secretive and very cryptic,"" he said. They live off the edge of the continental shelf and dive down to great depths, up to two miles, and can spend more than two hours down in the deepest oceans. Often, just the bones of the mammal are discovered The first stranding alerts came from the west coast of Co Donegal and Co Mayo in Ireland at the beginning of August. Irish researchers noticed specimens being washed up in badly decomposed conditions but still identifiable as beaked whales. Soon after that cases began to be reported up the Atlantic seaboard of the Scottish coast, especially on islands such as the Uists and Tiree. 'Large blobs' on Scottish beaches could be dead whales Whale stranding death toll rises to 58 in Scotland and Ireland Investigations into whale strandings in Scotland and Ireland There have now been about 50 whales reported washed up on the Scottish coast and 20 in Ireland since the start of August. Dr Brownlow said that was more in one month than in the past 10 years. There are concerns that the whales being washed up are just the ""tip of the iceberg"" and hundreds could have died at sea The Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Service (SMASS) has been collating the whale strandings on Scotland's west coast. The largest number (about 22) have washed up on North and South Uist in the Western Isles. But the small island of Tiree has seen at least nine strandings and nearby Coll has had two. Islay, Mull, Ulva and places along the west Highland coast of the mainland have also experienced strandings. It has been difficult to carry out any kind of a pathological post-mortem on the carcasses left They are being investigated but the whales have been washed up in an extremely decomposed state, often just bones, so it is difficult to carry out any kind of a pathological post-mortem. Dr Brownlow said his team would normally look for evidence of trauma or infectious disease but this was not possible in this case. He said it would take a collaboration with lots of disciplines to get a ""coherent picture"" of what happened. Dr Brownlow said the pattern of the strandings meant disease was an unlikely cause. He said you would expect to see whales being washed up in different states of body condition and some would be ill when they were stranded. The animals started off being relatively decomposed and then they moved on to being very decomposed. ""We think it's very much a focussed event that happened in terms of time and that doesn't fit the pattern of what we know about the disease process,"" he said. Scientists are investigating whether sonar is altering the behaviour of the whales Dr Brownlow said whales have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years in an environment that has been quiet. They use sound to be able to forage for food, to communicate and to navigate. However, human activity over the past century has made the oceans much noisier and disrupted their behaviour. Mass strandings of Cuvier's beaked whales often result from offshore human activities. Most regularly, due to active sonar used by military forces to locate submarines. Dr Brownlow said: ""In particular we know these animals are sensitive to what's called mid-range sonar, these are between about one and 10 kilohertz, which is used quite extensively by the military to navigate and find other craft."" He said the noise can change their behaviour. If they spend longer at depths or surface too quickly it can cause serious problems, he said. ""I mean these are amazing animals but they are mammals. They are very much like us they can get the bends,"" he said. Peter Tyack, professor of marine animal biology at the University of St Andrews, said the sonar used to hunt for submarines triggers a panic reaction in the animals. He said: ""It causes them to disrupt their diving behaviour in a way that either can cause them to flee and strand on the shore - or that may disrupt the diving so they get decompression sickness and they die at sea and wash ashore."" Experts want to know whether increased military activity in the east Atlantic may have played a part in the deaths The UK military has been asked for its activities in the area but it is not as easy to get information from other agencies within Nato or foreign navies. Dr Brownlow said: ""For example if the Russian Navy have decided to come down to the eastern Atlantic then that information about what they've been doing is unlikely to ever be made available to us."" Human activity over the past century has made the oceans much noisier which in turn has disrupted whale behaviour A spokeswoman for the MoD said: ""The Royal Navy takes its responsibilities in safeguarding the environment very seriously and, when at all possible, operators take avoidance actions should animals be detected before or during sonar operations. ""Our precautionary practices are similar to those used in other marine industries and are regularly reviewed by statutory bodies to ensure they reflect the latest understanding of the marine environment and the effects of sound on it. ""To remain effective elements of UK defence, Royal Navy units need to operate flexibly in locations around the UK and the world."" Forty-five badly decomposed beaked whales were washed up on Hebridean islands such as North and South Uist and Tiree Prof Tyack said one of the best known cases was noticed off the Canary Islands. A Spanish biologist studied some of the animals that stranded alive and found they had both gas bubbles and fat had embolised in the body - that is consistent with decompression sickness. Prof Tyack said the animals were diving under deep pressure and they must have suddenly come to a lower pressure near the surface and that caused bubbles to form which - just like in human divers - can be lethal. He said: ""These animals probably died at sea and there's been one case in the Canaries where a whale washed ashore about a week or two after a sonar exercise and they were too decayed to see the air bubbles - but you could see other signs that indicate decompression sickness. ""So that suggests what could happen here is the animals close to the exercise and far from the shore, might have disrupted their diving, got decompression, died, floated to the surface and then some of them washed ashore."" The Scottish and UK governments have ordered an investigation into the washed up whales Prof Tyack said the response of the Canaries strandings was to ban sonar within 50 nautical miles of the coast. He said that in the US they conduct sonar exercises on underwater ranges where they can track the location of the whales and very few exercises or training exercises have been associated with any problem when they occur in this kind of setting. The Scottish and UK governments have ordered an investigation.

But when ministers faced accusations of under-funding schools in England, a figure they quoted widely as evidence of high spending has been found to include billions of pounds of university fees being paid by students, rather than only government spending. School leaders have described this discovery as ""shocking and disturbing"". Last week,more than a thousand head teachers marched on Downing Street, protesting about school funding shortages. The Department for Education rejected their claims, saying not only were record amounts going into schools but the ""OECD has recently confirmed that the UK is the third highest spender on education in the world"". The claim for world-beating spending was used repeatedly by the DfE, it was published on the department's website and the Minister for School Standards, Nick Gibb, used the same argument on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, in a debate over school budgets. ""We are spending record amounts on our school funding. We are the third highest spender on education in the OECD,"" said Mr Gibb. It sounds impressive. But the third-place ranking from the OECD, an international economics organisation, is not just a schools figure or even about government spending. It shows the proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), the value of goods and services produced, spent on all educational institutions, including universities as well as schools - and it's for 2015 and not 2018. Head teachers last week complained about funding shortages What really might be unexpected is that it includes personal spending - and that means that all the billions paid by students on their tuition fees are part of this total. The UK in this measure of spending as a proportion of GDP is in third place, behind Norway and New Zealand, and ahead of Colombia and Chile. The OECD makes comparisons at a UK level, rather than the four separate education systems in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And the figure for the UK is mostly driven by changes in England - with the high ranking reflecting that school budgets had mostly been protected between 2010 and 2015 - combined with the introduction of some of the world's highest tuition fees. The high placing of Colombia and Chile in 2015 also reflects the relative costs of higher education. Of course, the DfE's claim that the UK is the ""third highest spender on education in the world"" is not incorrect. It does not anywhere explicitly say it is about the government funding of schools that was under discussion. The ONS is investigating whether the public cost of student finance should show up in the deficit But would parents listening to arguments about school spending really expect this? The DfE accepts that the third-highest spending claim includes tuition fees but says the statement remains ""accurate"". A spokesman points to other OECD figures, also for 2015, showing the UK has above-average spending on primary and secondary schools. But Jules White, the head teacher who organised last week's protest on funding, said the use of ""erroneous figures"" was ""both shocking and disturbing"". He said there was independent evidence to show schools were struggling with cuts - but he accused the Department for Education of using ""partial and distorted information"". But Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: ""It is disingenuous if the government is conflating school and university funding. ""Instead of mounting increasingly spurious attempts to undermine the evidence, the government should focus on providing schools and colleges with the investment they so clearly need."" But there is another twist in the tail from this - which could see billions being added to the chancellor's deficit figures. While ministers and head teachers are arguing over school funding, there is a separate debate aboutmeasuring the real cost of the student finance system. The review of tuition fees in England, commissioned by the prime minister, is currently having to wait until a decision is reached on how to classify student fees in the public accounts. Schools have been warning of funding shortages The Office for National Statistics is investigating whether the money lent to students every year for tuition fees - much of which will never be repaid - should appear as a cost in the public finances. Last year, the ONS said Â£17bn was lent to students, with about Â£3bn received in repayments. Two parliamentary committees have heavily criticised the way the cost of student finance is invisible in terms of public spending. They have suggested that the borrowing and lending associated with tuition fees should show up in the national balance sheet, with accusations that the current system is a ""fiscal illusion"". But the Department for Education seems to have pre-empted this - wrapping tuition fees into its definition of education spending. Has it inadvertently signalled to the ONS that it agrees that lending for fees should be counted alongside public spending? The chancellor might be surprised at such an intervention that could add billions to the deficit.

Amazon raises wages for lower-paid workers,"Online retailing giant Amazon is raising pay for hundreds of thousands of workers in the US and the UK. Amazon's lowest paid US workers will receive $15 an hour. In the UK, pay will rise from Â£8.20 an hour in London to Â£10.50, while outside London the rate rises from Â£8 an hour to Â£9.50. The move comes after criticism of its employment practices, with complaints over its warehouse working conditions. Amazon has also been attacked by campaigners for how much tax it pays. The company is one of the biggest companies in the world, worth about $1 trillion. The Bezos backlash Amazon and Starbucks blast Seattle homeless tax How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top Amazon UK tax bill falls despite profits leap Its founder, Jeff Bezos, is the world's richest man, with a fortune estimated at some $150bn. The new pay rates start on 1 November, and will apply to all staff, full and part-time, as well as temporary and seasonal workers. The move will benefit 250,000 workers in the US, 17,000 in the UK and tens of thousands of seasonal workers. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the UK's GMB union, welcomed the announcement but said more needed to be done: ""Given their owner is the richest man in the world you'd think he could see fit to dig a little deeper, but it's a start. Mr Roache said that 90% of the GMB Amazon members had said they experienced ""constant pain at work"". The union said Amazon did not allow it to operate under its roof. TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: ""If Amazon is really serious about looking after its workforce it must recognise trade unions. ""Today's announcement is... only a start and shouldn't be spun as a huge act of generosity."" Amazon said in a statement: ""Amazon is a safe place to work. ""The facts clearly show allegations to the contrary are simply wrong and misleading when attempting to portray Amazon as an unsafe workplace."" Amazon owner Jeff Bezos is the world's richest man Amazon's move comes after widespread strikes by workers across Europe. This summer, workers took action to coincide with the internet retail giant's Prime promotion event. Staff at warehouses in Germany Spain and Poland were trying to force the firm to offer better working conditions. In the US, Amazon is also facing pressure from workers. The increase in Amazon workers' wages coincides with a cross-US movement by retail unions to raise wages to a minimum of $15 an hour, the so-called ""Fight for Fifteen"" movement. Already rival retailers such as Target and Walmart have had to raise their wages. Major US companies are finding recruitment a growing challenge with US unemployment so low and are having to raise wages to attract staff. The Democrat Senator and prominent Amazon critic, Bernie Sanders, told Reuters it was a good move that others should emulate: ""I want to give credit where credit is due. There is no reason why other profitable corporations in the fast food industry, the airlines and retail should not be following."" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said politics had played a part in Amazon's decision: ""The narrative that Amazon is an ungenerous employer at a time when the company's sales, profits, and valuation are soaring does not play well among many customer segments."" One way to understand Amazon's pay decision is politics. By one calculation, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos earns the median US Amazon employee annual salary every ten seconds. That disparity has led to political pressure to raise wages from those like Senator Bernie Sanders, who introduced a bill in the US, subtly named the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (BEZOS) Act, to tax the company, who he claims pays such low wages that its workers still rely on government programmes like food stamps. But the other, perhaps more salient way to put Amazon's decision in context, is economics. The US economy is booming right now, with record low unemployment and wage growth not seen in nearly a decade. Although the US federal minimum wage is $7.25, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current average hourly earnings for someone employed in the retail sector is $13.20. That's put pressure not just on Amazon, but on rivals like Costco, Target and Walmart, all of whom have announced pay raises for their lowest paid workers. In this context, Amazon is simply trying to catch up with a cannily timed move meant to lure workers in the crucial lead up to the holiday shopping season. Amazon said it would press for a change to the US Federal minimum wage level, which is currently $7.25. However, 29 US states as well as Washington DC have set their minimum wage levels higher than this. Amazon spokesman Jay Carney said: ""We will be working to gain Congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage. The current rate of $7.25 was set nearly a decade ago."" In the UK, the legal minimum wage is Â£7.83 an hour for over-25s and Â£7.38 for those aged 21 to 24. The retailer also said it would phase out one of its share incentive schemes, adding that the ""net effect of this change and the new higher cash compensation is significantly more total compensation for employees... and with more predictability"". Mr Bezos said: ""We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead."" The Bezos backlash: Is 'big philanthropy' a charade?

Cristiano Ronaldo rape claim case reopened,"Ronaldo has branded the rape allegation ""fake news"" Police in Las Vegas have reopened a sexual assault investigation from 2009 at the request of a woman who has alleged she was raped by Cristiano Ronaldo. Kathryn Mayorga says she was attacked by the Portuguese footballer in a hotel room in the US city that year. Juventus forward Ronaldo, 33, has dismissed the claim, first reported in Germany's Der Spiegel, as ""fake news"". His representatives said he would take legal action against the magazine. Der Spiegel said Ms Mayorga, 34, filed a report with Las Vegas police shortly after the alleged incident. In 2010, she reportedly reached an out-of-court settlement with Ronaldo involving a $375,000 (Â£288,000) payment for agreeing never to go public with the allegations. Her lawyers are now seeking to declare the non-disclosure agreement void. Ronaldo, 33, is the captain of the Portuguese national team Las Vegas police confirmed they had investigated a complaint in June 2009, but added they had no suspect in the case. ""At the time the report was taken, the victim did not provide detectives with the location of the incident or suspect description,"" a statement said. ""As of September 2018, the case has been reopened and our detectives are following up on information being provided,"" it added. Ronaldo joined Italy's Juventus from Real Madrid for Â£99.2m ($128m) earlier this year. The Portuguese international is regarded as one of the greatest players of all time.

Johnson sets out his Tory vision,"This video can not be played Delegates cheer as Boris Johnson urges them to ""chuck Chequers"" Crowds packed into a speech by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. Mr Johnson renewed his attack on Theresa May's Brexit plan, describing it as a ""cheat"" that could lead to a boost for the far-right. In a wide-ranging speech, he also called for tax cuts and an increase in house-building. Long queues formed outside the event more than an hour before he began. He started with a self-deprecating joke about the chancellor's Brexit warnings. Philip Hammond's prediction that Mr Johnson would never be prime minister, he said, could be ""the only Treasury forecast in some time to have a distinct ring of truth"". Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""put some lead in the collective pencil"" and end a ""seeping away of our self-belief"". He also spoke up for police use of stop-and-search. Allow Twitter content?

But Brexit was his main focus as he called for the government to ditch the Chequers plan that led to his resignation from the government in July. He denounced the proposals - at one point suggesting the PM risked being prosecuted under a 14th century law saying that ""no foreign court or government shall have jurisdiction in this country"" - describing it as an ""outrage"". Mr Johnson spoke to a full house The BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth in Birmingham Expectations couldn't have been higher. Delegates started queuing at least an hour before the doors opened in order to get a seat at the much-anticipated event. At the foot of the stage there was a press scrum, cameras trained on former Brexit ministers David Davis and Steve Baker in the front row - alongside Stanley Johnson who'd come to see his son. No surprise then that when Boris Johnson took to the stage many in the audience rose to their feet. The speech was typically verbose and littered with jokes. There was applause for his criticism of the Labour Party and his fierce defence of Conservative values. But undoubtedly the biggest reaction came from his attack on the Prime Minister's Brexit proposals; cheers and enthusiastic clapping as he urged the party to ""chuck Chequers"". This wasn't a speech littered with standing ovations; matching the hype of such an event is hard. But Mr Johnson - and crucially his opposition to Theresa May's Brexit plan - proved hugely popular with many in the hall today and no doubt No 10 would have been watching. Remaining ""half-in half-out"" would prolong ""this toxic tedious business"", he said. ""If we cheat the electorate - and Chequers is a cheat - we will escalate the sense of mistrust. ""We will give credence to those who cry betrayal, and I am afraid we will make it more likely that the ultimate beneficiary of the Chequers deal will be the far right in the form of UKIP."" After the speech, he left the venue in a media scrum as he faced questions about whether he had been setting out a leadership pitch. His appearance was one of the most-anticipated events of the week The media scrum as Boris Johnson arrived for his speech Scottish Secretary David Mundell said people were ""concerned about Mr Johnson's behaviour"". Brexit negotiations are at a ""really critical point"" and people should support the prime minister, he said. ""Unfortunately Mr Johnson seems to behave in a way that suggests that he's only focused on his own self-interests and not on the interests of our country."" Earlier party chairman Brandon Lewis brushed off claims Mr Johnson's alternative agenda sought to undermine Theresa May. ""It's always dangerous getting into hypotheticals about what people may or may not say in the future, even if it's just later on today,"" he said. Mr Johnson has been a vocal critic of the prime minister's Brexit plan since leaving the Cabinet, calling it ""a moral and intellectual humiliation"" when setting out an alternative last week. May: No special treatment for EU migrants Middle-class drug users 'to be targeted' Emergency Â£240m to free up hospital beds Ahead of his conference appearance, he was pictured out jogging, in what some interpreted as a ""parody"" of Mrs May's claim that the ""naughtiest"" thing she did as a child was to run through a field of wheat. When asked before the fringe event how she had been getting on with Mr Johnson, the prime minister laughed and told BBC One's Breakfast: ""Well, I'm sure that's going to be a very lively event."" Questioned again later on BBC Radio 4's Today about how she felt that her former colleague appeared to be mocking her, she replied: ""What I feel is that I, and this government, and this party, are getting on with the important job... of getting a good deal for the United Kingdom when we leave the European Union."" Mr Johnson's attitude towards business - he was reported to have used the f-word in response to their Brexit concerns - wascriticised by Sir Digby Jones, former boss of lobby group the CBI, at the weekend.

The television presenter, who was on the first series of The Apprentice said she was ""in it to win it"". ""I thought 'I'm too old, I can't do it, I'm going fall.' And my little boy said 'have you heard yourself mum?' He shamed me into it. I'm doing this for my kids,"" she added. Skating stars Torvill and Dean have also been confirmed to return to head up the judging panel for 2019. On Monday, fellow Dancing on Ice contestant Gemma Collins told ITV's This Morning she was ""scared"" and ""nervous"" about ""how they are going to lift me up"".

Learning disabilities care 'far from home',"This video can not be played Tracey wants her disabled son to be released from Carstairs New figures obtained by BBC Scotland show that people with learning disabilities and autism are still being forced to live far from their families. This is despite a Scottish government pledge five years ago to end the practice. The BBC also found the number of people with learning disabilities unable to leave hospital units was increasing. The Scottish government said work had been done to identify the gaps and it was committed to addressing the issue. In 2013, the government said that ""by 2018 people with learning disabilities and autism and complex care needs who are currently in facilities outwith Scotland should be supported to live nearer their family in Scotland"". Dr Anne MacDonald has studied the issue for the Scottish government However, data obtained by the BBC showed there were 79 people from Scotland still in care homes and hospitals in England and Wales. The figures come from a study carried out by Dr Anne MacDonald, who has been seconded in to the Scottish government to assess the numbers of people who are still trapped in hospital units and, separately, those stuck a long way from family. Across the UK the policy direction is to move everyone with learning disabilities into community provision close to families or to being supported in their own homes. But the study found that more than 400 people were still in care homes and hospitals out of their local area, not through choice. It said 109 of them needed to be brought home as a priority. Dr MacDonald, project lead for the Keys to Life Project, told the BBC those in the 109 group were of particular concern. She said: ""I think it is absolutely clear that anybody with a learning disability can be in their local community and indeed should be. ""It is about getting these services right for individuals."" Dr MacDonald said there were many good examples around the country of individuals with learning disabilities and complex care needs getting the right services close to home. However, she said: ""It is just unfortunate there are also lots of examples of where this isn't happening and these are the ones we want to focus on going forward to see what we can do better to ensure all people are able to come back and live in their local communities and lead successful lives like the rest of us."" Dr MacDonald also looked at the use of restraint for the 109 people requiring to be brought nearer their families. She found 21% were subject to physical restraint, 11% subject to seclusion and 44% had their behaviour managed with sedatives. The doctor said she was disappointed that more positive methods were not being used instead of restraint. She said there was evidence that chemical restraint was ineffective and that physical restraint could cause long-term damage. The policy to move people out of institutional care and closer to family follows decades of promises to get people with learning disabilities out of big hospital institutions and into the community but a number seem to have become stuck in the system. Louis was sent to a care facility in Hartlepool, a four-and-a-half hour drive away from his family Kate Sainsbury says her son Louis was born perfect. But when he was just a few days old he contracted meningitis. Louis's brain was damaged. As a result he has learning disabilities and his communication is impaired. ""Louis is tall and strong and charming,"" she said. He went to a residential school and went home at weekends but at the end of school he struggled and ended up in a hospital inpatient unit. ""After that it was really difficult getting a suitable placement for Louis,"" Kate said. And then earlier this year he lost his placement of six years. ""Last summer his biological father died and Louis understandably acted out. He was evicted from his placement and then we couldn't find anywhere for him and the only place the social worker could find was in Hartlepool. ""For him the move was really frightening. It was a bereavement of everything he had known. ""It's desperate. I drive down every fortnight but it takes four-and-a-half hours to get there. ""We're looking to move Louis to a flat near us where he can be supported but it's proven really hard. He can communicate and he just keeps telling us he wants to come home."" Colin Mackay, chief executive of the Mental Welfare Commission (MWC), said there was great momentum in the 1980s and 1990s to get people out of institutional care but that it had stalled. He said: ""My worry now is that we have lost that sense of ambition and drive and that what is happening just now isn't acceptable and we need to do something to resolve it."" He told the BBC the numbers of people with learning disabilities stuck and unable to leave hospital units should be going down but was actually growing. Colin Mackay from the Mental Welfare Commission said momentum had stalled A report the commission carried out in 2016 found there were about 58 people with learning disabilities and autism who had been assessed as ready to leave inpatient care but whose discharge has been delayed because of a lack of provision in the community - sometimes for months and even years. A recent check found the figure had gone up to 78. The Scottish government's most recent Programme for Government does not mention the 2013 target but talks about reducing out-of-area placements from autumn 2018 onwards. It said Dr MacDonald's work meant they were much better informed about the gaps in services and were able to address them. Clare Haughey, the minister for mental health, said: ""We are committed to considering how best to take forward work based on Dr MacDonald's findings, including discussing this with Health and Social Care Partnerships in relation to the commissioning of local services, developing community services, transition planning and specialist skills."" The BBC's File on 4 radio programme has revealed the use of restraint in inpatient units in England has risen sharplyand that thousands of people with learning disabilities are still trapped in institutional care across the UK.

Where are heterosexual civil partnerships legal?,"Civil partnerships will soon become gender-neutral in the UK The UK's Supreme Court decided on 27 June to make civil partnerships available for heterosexual couples as well as same-sex couples, In a civil partnership, a couple is entitled to the same legal treatment in terms of inheritance, tax, pensions and next-of-kin arrangements as marriage. Some, such as the UK couple who challenged the ban on civil partnerships for heterosexual couples, see traditional marriage as a patriarchal structure that ""has held women back"". Civil partnerships are referred to under different names in different countries around the world. Some call them civil unions, whilst other prefer to label them as domestic partnerships. But where are heterosexual civil partnerships permitted around the world? The picture regarding civil partnerships varies greatly across Europe. Some countries have made their civil partnerships gender-neutral - that is to say, applicable to both same-sex and heterosexual couples. Others have restricted civil partnerships to same-sex couples only, and a few have scrapped the concept of civil partnerships after making same-sex marriage legal. In France, the civil solidarity pact gives both same-sex and heterosexual couples the right to enter into a civil partnership. These ""pacts"" give couples many of the same legal benefits as married couples, but they are easier to annul during the divorce process. Similar gender-neutral civil partnerships exist in the Netherlands (since 1998), Belgium (since 2000), Luxembourg (2004), Andorra (since 2005), Greece (they were originally set up for opposite-sex couples in 2008, however they have been gender-neutral since 2015), Gibraltar and Malta (since 2014), Cyprus (since 2015), and Estonia (since 2016). Civil partnership win for mixed-sex couple 'Why we want a civil partnership' Why choose civil partnership over marriage? On the other hand, a number of European countries used to have civil partnerships for same-sex couples only, but got rid of them when they legalised same-sex marriage. Denmark was the world's first country to introduce civil partnerships for same-sex couples in 1989, scrapping the concept when it introduced same-sex marriage in 2012. Other Nordic countries (and Germany and Ireland) carried out similar processes, legalising civil partnerships but scrapping them when marriage for same-sex couples was legalised. Legal and financial protection for both parties in the event of the relationship ending, like in marriage It is free of the religious connotations of marriage Some object to marriage as an institution and its associations with property and patriarchy In the US, laws regarding civil partnerships (known as ""civil unions"" or ""domestic partnerships"") are passed at a city or state level. New York City has offered domestic partnerships to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples (if they above 18 and resident in New York City) since 1997, whileSan Francisco has given legal recognition to the ''domestic partnership'' of homosexuals and unmarried heterosexual couples since 1989,external. In California as a whole, domestic partnerships have existed for same-sex couples and for opposite-sex couples in which one person is above the age of 62 since 2000. Similar laws exist in the states of Washington and New Jersey. In the states of Colorado, Hawaii, Maine and Maryland, gender-neutral civil partnerships are legal. In Brazil, co-habiting couples have similar rights to married couples, but they do not have the automatic right of inheritance. In Ecuador, civil unions between two people were legalised by the 2008 constitution, without any reference made to gender, opening the option to both heterosexual and same-sex couples. Uruguay permitted gender-neutral civil unions from 2008 too. In South Africa, same-sex and heterosexual couples can register their relationships as either marriages or civil partnerships, with no legal difference. In Israel, a heterosexual couple are can enter a civil union-type agreement, where they are said to be ""known to the public,"" granting them legal rights without having to get married. Same-sex marriage is now legal in 26 countries around the world. 'Why we want a civil partnership' Australia approves same-sex marriage Why choose civil partnership over marriage?

Consultation on mixed-sex civil partnerships,"The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favour of Rebecca Steinfeld, 37, and Charles Keidan, 41, from London A consultation is being held on opening up civil partnerships to heterosexual couples in Scotland. The Scottish government is seeking public views on the issue following a landmark ruling in June. The UK Supreme Court said then that the law as it stands in the UK goes against the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on equality grounds. The secular partnerships became available to same-sex couples in 2005 following a change in legislation. The consultation puts forwards two options - barring further partnerships or opening up civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples. Social Security and Older People Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ""This is very simply about ensuring equality. ""The Supreme Court made it clear that the Civil Partnership Act 2004 is not compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights because civil partnership is open to same-sex couples only, whereas marriage is open to everyone. ""That judgment related to England and Wales but the facts and circumstances in Scotland are very similar. ""Therefore, we must now consult on the future of civil partnership in Scotland and I would urge anyone with an interest in this area to take part."" Equalities campaignersRebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan won their Supreme Court challenge in Junewhen justices ruled the Civil Partnership Act's restriction to same sex couples is discriminatory. Scottish Green equalities spokesman Patrick Harvie called for people to back an extension of civil partnerships. He said: ""The Supreme Court ruling was very welcome, challenging the lack of choice available to mixed-sex couples. ""The way to correct this is not to roll back the clock and restrict that choice for everyone, but to allow all couples to choose what's right for them: marriage, civil partnership or cohabitation. ""Anything else would be a return to the bad old days, when the government decided what the best family structure was and simply imposed it on people."" Gordon MacRae, chief executive of Humanist Society Scotland, welcome the consultation. He said: ""We believe all couples should have the freedom to choose marriage or civil partnership and the current system must now be opened up. ""We know that there is demand from opposite-sex couples who have approached Humanist Society Scotland looking for a civil partnership rather than a marriage and we believe they should be given that choice. ""If civil partnerships are extended, there should also be consideration given to removing gender entirely from the marriage laws - given that marriage and civil partnership will be equally available to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples."" Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said: ""It seems only sensible to allow mixed-sex couples to choose the form of partnership best suited to them. ""Now it's up to the government to get on with the legislation and ensure that there are no hurdles in the way of equality."" The Scottish government consultation closes on 21 December and the government has pledged to then take a decision to ensure future compatibility with the ECHR.

"Indonesia tsunami toll rises to 1,200","The number of people known to have died in Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 1,347, disaster response officials say. The death toll jumped on Tuesday from a previously confirmed figure of 844. The 7.5-magnitude quake struck just off the central island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu. Aid supplies are beginning to arrive in the city, where survivors have no access to running water or electricity. As tensions and need run high, police have begun guarding shops against looters. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Palu saw police firing warning shots and tear gas on Tuesday as people tried to take supplies from one shop. Police fired over crowds who were trying to raid one shop in Palu... ... but shortly after, allowed people to take the basic supplies they needed. Large queues are forming around any fuel stations in the area Officers initially took a lenient approach to survivors seizing basic goods, deputy national police chief Ari Dono Sukmanto said, but some people have since been arrested for stealing computers and cash. ""After day two the food supply started to come in, it only needed to be distributed,"" he said. ""We are now re-enforcing the law."" Pilot hails 'guardian angel' controller A town smashed to pulp in minutes Aerial shots of debris and survival after tsunami Humanitarian relief convoys entering the city are also being escorted by soldiers and police. In a separate incident, a volcano began erupting on the same island, Sulawesi, on Wednesday. Mount Soputan is about 1,000km (600 miles) away from Palu, and it was not immediately seen as a threat to the aid operation. Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu After days of waiting for aid, Wasliha decided she had to walk to find help. Her young family trekked through the mountains for more than 10 hours from her devastated village of Lolu Sigi Biromaru to Palu airport. ""We had no clean water or food and all we have is the clothes we are wearing,"" she says. Her children gulp down the water we give them, they haven't drunk anything since yesterday She had heard the military was flying out and had joined hundreds of people at the airport hoping to get a seat. Everyone wants to get out. Most can't and are having to endure another day without power and limited drinking water. In the town square people patiently wait in line to refill water bottles. Those that can make it here receive two meals a day, from a community kitchen run by volunteers and gallon of water to bathe in. Erna Wahyuni is cutting up a mountain of cabbage for soup. Her house was destroyed, but she wants to help. ""I was saved so I have to give back. It's also hard just sitting in a tent in the hot sun all day, I would rather be cooking,"" she laughs. Some people were rescued from the rubble in the first few days. This video can not be played Indonesia quake turns ground into liquid But many of the buildings brought down by the quake were then swamped by the tsunami, so hopes of more rescues are fading. In the hills above Palu, volunteers are filling a vast grave with the bodies of the dead. They have been told to prepare for 1,300 victims to arrive. The ground has become highly unstable and is constantly moving, making the search a dangerous operation and raising the risk of mudslides. Among the people confirmed dead are 34 Indonesian students, whose bodies were found under a church buried by one mudslide. Dozens more are still missing there. Teams have so far recovered three survivors from the ruins of the collapsed Hotel Roa Roa in Palu. An estimated 50 people were also inside when the quake hit. This is what's left of the Hotel Roa Roa in Palu Rescue team leader Agus Haryono said they were using acoustic detectors to try to locate more survivors. He said concrete and metal cutters were helping to clear the debris but added: ""We have to be very careful so we don't risk hurting any survivors."" Walls at a prison in Palu collapsed, allowing dozens of inmates to escape President Joko Widodo has called for reinforcements, telling the national search-and-rescue agency to send more police officers and soldiers into affected districts. ""There are some main priorities that we must tackle and the first is to evacuate, find and save victims who've not yet been found,"" he said. Across Palu, a damaged bridge, blocked roads, a partially closed airport and broken telecommunications have made it difficult to bring help into the affected area, and impossible to contact more remote regions. Aerial photos show the effects of the quake and tsunami on a major bridge in Palu With hospitals damaged, injured people have been treated in the open and at least one military field hospital has been set up. The military has taken over the airport to fly aid in, and injured people and other evacuees out. But for thousands of people wanting to get the first commercial flight out of Palu, the wait continues. ""I'd get a plane anywhere. I've been waiting for two days. Haven't eaten, barely had a drink,"" 44-year-old food vendor Wiwid told Reuters. This video can not be played Tsunami survivor: ""I was hugging my wife, but when the wave came... I immediately lost her"" On Monday, 3,000 to 5,000 people who wanted to be evacuated from Palu swarmed the airport hoping to hitch a ride on a military Hercules plane. The military arranged for them to depart on ferries instead. Bustling city with a population of approximately 350,000 people, with many banks and supermarkets Situated in a rain shadow - where there is very little precipitation - and one of Indonesia's driest places Near the popular beach area of Tanjung Karang Served by a busy regional airport The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs says there are nearly 200,000 people in urgent need of assistance, about a quarter of them children. How Palu suffered a 'worst case scenario' tsunami How warning system failed the victims Why Sulawesi's tsunami is puzzling scientists The British government said on Tuesday it was sending a transport aircraft filled with urgent aid to Indonesia. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""Britain stands united with Indonesia as they recover from this devastating tragedy."" The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday. Scientists believe it may have triggered an underwater landslide which set off a tsunami. The waves built up height and speed as they travelled down the long narrow bay towards Palu. Vice-President Jusuf Kalla has said the final death toll could be in the thousands, while the Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected. The moment the waves hit Palu.

"Father jailed for murdering daughter, 8","Mylee pleaded 'please daddy, no daddy, stop it' as Billingham dragged her into his home A controlling man who murdered his eight-year-old daughter in an act of revenge against his ex-partner has been jailed for a minimum of 27 years. William Billingham, 55, stabbed Mylee to death with a kitchen knife at his home near Walsall on 20 January. Judge Paul Farrer QC told him it was an act of ""revenge"" which was ""driven by jealousy and anger"". Mylee's mum, Tracey Taundry said her daughter was ""taken by a man who was supposed to protect and care for her."" Unemployed factory worker Billingham was convicted of murder and making a threat to kill Miss Taundry. ""How can I ever explain how the murder of my beautiful daughter - 'Smiley Mylee' - has affected me, her sisters and her immediate family?,"" Miss Taundry said. Tracey Taundry said she had ""constant nightmares"" about the night her daughter died ""Mylee was brutally taken from us by a man who was supposed to protect and to care for her. ""Since this incident I have struggled to sleep. I have constant nightmares and I relive that terrible night over and over again. None of us will ever get over what has happened."" The jury at Birmingham Crown Court heard Billingham ""turned his anger"" on Mylee after Miss Taundry began a relationship with a woman. Judge Farrer said he ""killed her in order to cause pain to her mother"". ""As such, this was an act of revenge. Alternately, this was the brutal, cowardly, killing of a defenceless and much-loved child who had her whole life ahead of her,"" the judge added. Billingham denied murder but claimed he was guilty of manslaughter due to depression Billingham opted not to give evidence during the trial and claimed he had no memory of stabbing Mylee. He claimed he was guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter due to depression. Jurors deliberated for about 80 minutes before unanimouslyconvicting him on Monday. Midlands Live: For news and updates The trial had heard how Billingham, who had six children with three women, produced a knife when Miss Taundry arrived at his home to pick up their daughter. She said she heard the ""tink"" of the blade as she waited for Mylee to get a bag from inside. He then told Miss Taundry ""I'm going to kill you"" before dragging Mylee back inside as she screamed ""mummy, mummy"" and ""please daddy, no daddy, stop it"", prosecutors said. The court heard accounts from two former partners about Billingham's history of violence. Forensic psychiatrist Philip Joseph told jurors: ""He has a particular difficulty in coping with the end of relationships and is likely to behave in an aggressive and intimidating manner."" Billingham was convicted of causing actual bodily harm in 1990 for an attack on his then girlfriend. He was also cautioned in 2007 after Mylee's mother alleged he slapped her in the face. As well as his sentence for murder, he was given a concurrent two-year sentence for making a threat to kill Miss Taundry while holding the knife to her neck. Billingham's barrister Balraj Bhatia said the killer had been verbally abused in the cells before being brought to court. ""Just this morning as I was preparing him for the impact statement, there was a palpable rush of hatred from every prisoner that walked by the cell,"" he said. ""This court will punish him in terms of years. His punishment - to use his own words - is that he is still breathing.""

""Since this incident I have struggled to sleep. I have constant nightmares and I relive that terrible night over and over again. None of us will ever get over what has happened."" The jury at Birmingham Crown Court heard Billingham ""turned his anger"" on Mylee after Miss Taundry began a relationship with a woman. Judge Farrer said he ""killed her in order to cause pain to her mother"". ""As such, this was an act of revenge. Alternately, this was the brutal, cowardly, killing of a defenceless and much-loved child who had her whole life ahead of her,"" the judge added. Billingham denied murder but claimed he was guilty of manslaughter due to depression Billingham opted not to give evidence during the trial and claimed he had no memory of stabbing Mylee. He claimed he was guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter due to depression. Jurors deliberated for about 80 minutes before unanimouslyconvicting him on Monday. Midlands Live: For news and updates The trial had heard how Billingham, who had six children with three women, produced a knife when Miss Taundry arrived at his home to pick up their daughter. She said she heard the ""tink"" of the blade as she waited for Mylee to get a bag from inside. He then told Miss Taundry ""I'm going to kill you"" before dragging Mylee back inside as she screamed ""mummy, mummy"" and ""please daddy, no daddy, stop it"", prosecutors said. The court heard accounts from two former partners about Billingham's history of violence. Forensic psychiatrist Philip Joseph told jurors: ""He has a particular difficulty in coping with the end of relationships and is likely to behave in an aggressive and intimidating manner."" Billingham was convicted of causing actual bodily harm in 1990 for an attack on his then girlfriend. He was also cautioned in 2007 after Mylee's mother alleged he slapped her in the face. As well as his sentence for murder, he was given a concurrent two-year sentence for making a threat to kill Miss Taundry while holding the knife to her neck. Billingham's barrister Balraj Bhatia said the killer had been verbally abused in the cells before being brought to court. ""Just this morning as I was preparing him for the impact statement, there was a palpable rush of hatred from every prisoner that walked by the cell,"" he said. ""This court will punish him in terms of years. His punishment - to use his own words - is that he is still breathing.""

The neighbours who both lost children to suicide,"Harry Lisle and Rachel Finke were pupils in the same year at the same secondary school. They barely knew each other but their suicides, only weeks apart, led to an outpouring of grief and brought their mothers together. In the days after Harry died, there was a ""maelstrom"" of people round the house, his mother, Rose, says. Teenagers came inside and sat on the sofas weeping. Rose remembers her 16-year-old son as lively, funny, very clever, very energetic, very popular, with a huge group of a friends and a lovely girlfriend. ""How can you not have known you were that loved?"" she asks. But one Saturday, at the end of October 2016, two weeks after his birthday, Harry tried to kill himself. It emerged he had secretly been buying the tranquiliser Xanax online to self-medicate for social anxiety. Until that moment, Harry had given away very little about his mental state. Asked if she had had any idea, Rose, a primary school teacher with decades of experience, replies: ""Genuinely no - and that makes me feel awful. ""Part of my whole life and job has been about being able to think about other people's emotions."" What the family had known was that Harry, fair-skinned and tall like his mother, was very prone to blushing, and he hated it, to the extent he had asked to be referred to a specialist. But no-one had suspected there was anything more serious. At the hospital, after his attempted suicide, Rose remembers asking doctors if there was anything to look out for.  Would Xanax have effects?' ""He was decided to be low risk so we took him home,"" she says. But Rose still wonders whether Harry's decision to take his own life could have been linked to the tranquiliser. Normally available in the UK only on private prescription Meant for short-term treatment only Uncontrolled use has been linked to addiction, impulsive behaviour and, in some cases, suicidal thoughts Supplies bought online are likely to be counterfeit The family spent most of the following night in and out of Harry's room, checking he was all right. Early the next morning, Rose heard him moving around and went in. ""He said, 'I think I'm probably going to go and play football with the boys tomorrow,'"" she says. ""I said, 'OK - but let's see how you're feeling'."" It was 4am or 5am, she says, and exhausted, she fell asleep. When Rose went to wake him for breakfast, she found he had made a second attempt. They called an ambulance, attempted resuscitation and, ""from then on there was just a mad panic of police and ambulance and, yeah, really, really awful"". ""As soon as I felt his cold hand,"" Rose says, ""I was just thinking, 'You can't go back.'"" On the Monday, the hospital psychologist rang for Harry, as did the assistant for the doctor he had been seeing about his blushing. ""He did write us a note from the first attempt which was very clear about him not being able to cope anymore and he wanted out... that he loved us all, that we had been great parents, that the Xanax had become a bit of a problem,"" Rose says. They had spoken in the hospital about his dependence, how he would cope and the fact ""you can't self-medicate"". ""Anyway, he decided at that point... what he was going to do. 'Suicide' was on the death certificate."" Rose describes the difficulty of thinking she knew her son really well. ""At the time, honestly, I really didn't see it at all, which is the worst thing about suicide. You wonder what you should have done and what you should have noticed."" Sarah remembers her daughter Rachel's diary entry from when she heard about Harry's death: ""This has happened to a boy in my school. I feel so sorry for his family. I could never do that to my family."" Only a few weeks later, Rachel, also 16, took her own life. Before she became ill, Rachel was ""like a whirlwind"" her mother says. ""She was going to a load of sport. She ran... was in the athletics club... was running for the school. She was also ""bright and quite political"" and ""furious about the latest injustice"". ""Every cause she could espouse, in school as well as out of school, she did."" But by the end of Year 9 Rachel had started to experience lethargy, the beginnings of depression and worries about her marks. Her predicted GCSE grades were very high and she was determined to live up to them. But in the first term of Year 10, coinciding with lots of tests at school to get the pupils used to the idea of exams, she ""really went downhill"". Rachel eased off the sport, started to put on a bit of weight and began describing herself as ""ugly and stupid and all of these kinds of things which she wasn't"". She had started self-harming and took herself to a doctor, at the insistence of a friend. ""Both her arms she'd cut quite badly and she kept it hidden."" The local child and adolescent mental health service acted quickly, with regular appointments, but by January Rachel was no better. ""They were worrying about suicide because she had told them she was suicidal and started to suggest she should take medication, started to suggest that she might need to go into hospital,"" Sarah says. Rachel was prescribed the anti-depressant fluoxetine but, soon afterwards, made her first suicide attempt. The family had set up a watch, Rachel's uncle and aunt more or less moved in to make sure someone was up all night and they saved her. The doctors immediately took Rachel off the fluoxetine. She attended the adolescent unit at London's Newham hospital as a day-patient, until being allowed back to school in April. But she didn't really get much better. ""She would say she couldn't bear it,"" Sarah says. ""She struggled with noise and chaos, school generally."" A series of overdoses meant that in December 2016 her medication changed again - this time to sertraline, a similar type of drug to fluoxetine. Sarah believes Rachel's major suicide attempts coincided with changes to her medication. (She wrote about her daughter's ordeal,externalafter the inquest into her death.) Changes to Rachel's close medical team at about the same time meant she wasn't as honest with them, says Sarah. Just before Christmas, Rachel took an overdose near a river, after which she was sectioned. But after returning home, more self-harming and another overdose meant she was never long out of hospital. Rachel's mother and father phoned each other constantly to check where she was. On the Monday after the start of term, Sarah says, Rachel went into school. ""She left school at lunchtime, which generally they are allowed to do in those years, and that's when she killed herself in the park."" The inquest found Rachel had died by suicide - but Sarah disputes the coroner's conclusion that nothing could have been done differently to save her daughter. ""She really struggled for a long time. I do think the medication was part of the reason. I think it destabilised her a lot."" Rose White (left) and Sarah Finke (right) have been able to support each other The north London comprehensive Harry and Rachel attended is huge, with some 240 pupils in each year group. The bereaved mothers had never met but when Rose heard what had happened to Rachel, she left a frank note for Sarah. ""Just to say, 'This is shit but if you want to talk about it...'"" ""And I did want to,"" says Sarah. ""It's just the worst thing for a parent,"" she says, ""that your child has killed themselves, that you could be such a terrible parent that your child, A) doesn't want to live, and B) you didn't look after them."" Rose agrees that ""the sense of guilt and shame and trauma does make you quite isolated"". ""So it is really comforting in a strange sort of way, just to have somebody who knows what it feels like."" There was also massive support from the wider community, who ""kind of held and supported us"". ""People were really happy to let me talk about Harry and were not judgemental,"" says Rose. The school laid on extra counsellors for students, there were pens and paper and they were able to write, and red boxes where they could deposit their notes anonymously if they wanted to. One of Harry's friends set up an online fundraiser for a bench and a tree in the park, aiming for about Â£500. But the amount donated was soon well into the thousands and the money was eventually used to establish a charity,Safaplace,external, which Rose and Sarah are helping to run. ""I felt a massive responsibility for Harry's friends,"" Rose says. ""I was just really worried about the copycat thing. I felt really awful for them so it felt important initially to be doing something that would support them in school. ""There's the whole thing about this senseless loss and trying to make something, anything, positive come out of it."" The bench in Harry's memory is now in the local park. There's also a new garden for anyone who needs a bit of quiet, in the school grounds. And the charity has hosted a conference on teenage mental health. Even before the terrible events of two years ago, the mental wellbeing of pupils and staff was a priority for the school. But Rose and Sarah want to go further, taking the support offered in school into the wider community ""and perhaps the school becoming a hub for mental health awareness and support"", Sarah says. She sees two major areas where services could be stronger. The first is picking people up early and encouraging them to talk, she says. ""And that perhaps would be more the case in Harry's situation than it was in Rachel's. ""So I think to some extent, for me, the stuff that's related to Rachel is about making school more aware and more bearable for kids... and putting more in place once you are ill, because it doesn't stop with raising the alarm."" Simple things could really help, she says, such as making sure schools have up-to-date lists of mental health help-lines - and that these phone numbers are answered. If the charity develops the way they hope, they want to be able to help other schools to do the same. ""Part of it is to protect others going through awful experiences and part of it is to build on the support of the community,"" Sarah says. ""My life feels ruined quite a lot of the time,"" says Rose. ""If we could stop anyone else having to go through this, that would be wonderful."" The latest available UK-wide figures show in 2017, 207 15- to 19-year-olds killed themselves. Bernadka Dubicka, who chairs the Royal College of Psychiatrists' child and adolescent faculty, says suicide is a tragedy for the individual who takes their own life, with ""a lasting impact on family, friends and those who have provided care"". ""Anti-depressants are part of a range of treatments for severe depression which include psychotherapy,"" says Dr Dubicka She adds that Prozac (fluoxetine) is recommended in national guidance from the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as the first antidepressant that can be offered to young people with moderate to severe depression if psychotherapy has not worked or if the symptoms are very concerning. ""Where it has failed, NICE recommends sertraline as an alternative. NICE advise that antidepressants should always be prescribed alongside psychotherapy and monitored closely."" On Xanax, Dr Dubicka says: ""Buying substances from the internet is dangerous. It is unclear what is in them and Xanax has massive addictive potential.""

Passengers stranded as airline collapsesStansted airport tells travellers with bookings on Primera Air flights on Tuesday not to turn up.Business,"A budget airline that began offering long-haul flights from UK airports earlier this year, including Stansted to the US, has collapsed. Primera Air said it was ceasing all operations at midnight on Monday after 14 years of operations. Flights to Washington and New York due to leave Stansted on Monday night were grounded and passengers have been told not to go to the airport on Tuesday. One flight from Birmingham to Malaga arrived on Monday evening. The airline, which had 15 planes, began offering low-cost flights from Stansted and Birmingham to North America - including Washington, Newark, and Toronto - earlier this year. Flights from Manchester to Malaga were due to start later this month. Most of the airline's business involved taking Scandinavian holidaymakers to destinations such as Spain, Greece, Italy, Egypt and Turkey. Canadian Angela Dorau and her husband are stranded in Paris Canadian Angela Dorau was in a queue to board a plane from Paris to Toronto with her husband when there was an announcement saying the flight had been cancelled. She said: ""Everybody was stranded. Currently my husband and I are in a dumpy motel by the airport trying to frantically scrounge together the funds to pay for another way home."" They are yet to find an alternative flight home - and she says what was supposed to be a budget trip looks like costing them an extra â¬2,000 (Â£1,780). The UK's Civil Aviation Authority has advised passengers who have travelled on an outward Primera flight they willneed to make their own arrangements,externalto return to the UK. The Danish-registered airline is not part of the Civil Aviation Authority's ATOL Protection scheme, which covers only passengers booked on package holidays. If you've paid by credit card for your flight, and paid more than Â£100, you may be able to claim compensation from your credit card firm under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. If you've paid by debit card, and paid more than Â£100, you could try to contact your bank and ask about ""chargeback"". However, to get this form of compensation, your bank would need to claw back your money from Primera, which is insolvent. If you booked through a travel agent which is ATOL-protected, you may be able to claim compensation via your travel agent. If you have travel insurance, and your insurance covers insolvency, you may be able to claim from your insurance firm. Consumer group Which? advises that you should contact your credit card issuer, travel agent, or insurer as soon as possible. Stranded in Malaga as our flight has now been cancelled for Monday 8 October. Will have to try and get other flights home.Sally James My daughter Catherine is now stuck in Spain. She flew out on Saturday and was due to come back this Thursday.Antony Meadley I was on a flight back to Newark (New Jersey) that was meant to depart at 5:55...an announcement went out at around 5:30. No one was given any plans, and everyone was just asked to leave...a horrible experience.Nickolaus Lachman The airline said it had failed to secure long-term financing, meaning it had ""no choice"" but to file for bankruptcy. Primera's decision to start competing with other low-cost long-haul operators such as Norwegian and Wow appears to have led to its demise. Signs that the airline was in trouble came in August, when it saidshort-haul flights from Birminghamto seven European destinations would end on 3 September. It also blamed the late arrival of new aircraft from Airbus that forced it to cancel flights and lease planes. When it began long-haul operations from Stansted in May, Primera was offering flights to New York's Newark airport, Boston, Washington DC and Toronto starting at Â£149 each way. It had planned to start flying from Madrid to New York, Boston and Toronto next month from â¬149 each way. Airline analyst Alex Macheras told the BBC the airline's growth ""simply wasn't sustainable"". ""The general feeling in the industry was: this airline is travelling a bit too fast in terms of their expansion with a fleet of that size,"" he said.

How EU migration has changed the UK,"When almost 17.5 million people voted for Brexit, concerns about immigration were at the forefront of many of their minds. As the referendum campaign kicked off, official statistics revealednear-record levels of net migration, undermining David Cameron's attempts to show that his policies to control it were working. But despite almost everyone having a view about EU migration, the evidence for how it really affects the UK was thin on the ground. A chunky report by the Migration Advisory Committee, an independent public body that advises the government, is a serious attempt to try to explain all the effects of European Economic Area (EEA) immigration. So let's go through the key facts. There's no disputing this one. The UK has seen more people arriving to live here than leave for other shores and the population has been rising for two decades. Going back to the late 1990s, although freedom of movement was already in place, there wasn't substantial concern about EU migration. Things changed when eastern and central European nations joined in 2004 and the UK (unlike Germany and others) chose not to exercise a seven-year block on workers from these poorer countries accessing the UK's labour market. And the rest is history. Between 2004 and 2017, the share of the population who were from an EEA country rose from 1.5% to just over 5%. But things are changing again. The number ofEU citizens moving to the UK has decreasedsince the Brexit vote. Workers from the east now earn more at home than before. In 2004, theBritish pound bought more than seven Polish Zlotys,external, while now it is less than five. So for potential eastern European migrants, moving to Britain looks less and less attractive. This stands to reason - the most skilled are the most likely to have the get-up-and-go to move countries - and that's been seen in economic migration the world over. But that average figure masks a more complex picture. The most highly skilled EEA migrants to the UK are likely to be from the ""old member states"" - including the original founding nations such as France, Germany and Italy. The figures also show that workers from the ""new member states"" are better qualified than their British peers. But they're not always using those skills to maximise how much they can earn in the UK. If you look at the range of hourly rates paid to European workers, those from the east are likely to earn less than those from the old member states. They also tend to be in jobs earning less than British workers. In the early days of eastern European migration, there were no end of anecdotal stories of highly qualified people coming to the UK to do very basic jobs because they could earn so much more than at home. But the all-important question is what effect does this have on the national coffers? Figures calculated for the Migration Advisory Committee show that the average adult migrant from the EEA contributes Â£2,300 more to the UK public purse than the average UK resident. Old member state citizens contribute the most - but even the lower-paid eastern European workers are making a net public contribution. In all, say the MAC, EEA migrants paid Â£4.7bn more in taxes than they took out in benefits and public services. It's a big number - but the MAC says it's small beer. Averaged out over the whole of the UK-born population, it amounts to an extra Â£1.70 a week, per person. Take one example, in the agriculture sector: the graph clearly shows that there had been a long-term decline in British production of asparagus, cherries, raspberries and strawberries. But all four crops have grown or stabilised since 2004 when new workers from the east became available. Farmers, quite simply, saw an opportunity to expand thanks to a massive supply of cheap labour they didn't have before. They say that British workers, by and large, don't want the jobs, with long hours and not-so-fantastic pay. What's not remotely clear is how employers would respond if the ready supply of EEA labour dried up, should free movement end. Critics of the current system say they would inevitably have to offer better terms and conditions to existing workers in the UK and invest more in productivity and technology  - think strawberry-picking machine, rather than strawberry picker. That, say critics of free movement, would be a good thing for the UK. And that brings us to the other big topic - is the disruption caused by mass migration affecting the UK in other ways? The MAC report looked at a number of key public services - starting with health - and found EEA migrants contribute more to the NHS and social care than they use. EEA workers make up an increasing share of the workforce in this sector, although historically the UK has relied more on nurses and doctors born in Commonwealth countries. The NHS doesn't record the country of birth of patients. So the report used the fact that EEA migrants to the UK tend to be younger - and we know that more is spent on caring for elderly than young people - to conclude that they're contributing more through their taxes than they are taking out. The MAC did find an effect in both private and social housing, though. Its analysis suggests that migration has increased house prices and added to the demand for social housing, ""inevitably at the expense"" of others. Although migrants are a small fraction of people in social housing, they are a rising number. However, the report concludes that the reduction in stock - because too few homes for social rent are being built - has a part to play too. And it adds that the impact of migration on house prices cannot be seen ""in isolation from other government policies"". All of which leaves one final question: what has been the effect on communities? The MAC says this is the hardest question to answer. Anecdotally, people are concerned about change - and the committee says ministers need to do more to monitor and manage how migration affects local communities. But it also said it found no evidence that migration had damaged communities through crime. Citizens of new member states were more likely to receive a caution or conviction, than UK-born people, but there are also disproportionately more younger men among migrant workers - and young men of any background are the most likely to break the law. The MAC found no evidence that migration, despite all the apparent concern, had damaged people's sense of belonging. Two academic studies, the British Household Panel Survey and the UK Household Longitudinal study found that people like their neighbourhoods more now than ever. The government's own annual study of how involved people are in their community has found no alarm bells ringing because of increased migration. However, some critics say the pace of change to the character of some communities, brought on by migration, can't be fully measured by these nationwide studies.

"May: No special treatment for EU migrantsBusiness groups criticise a proposed crackdown on ""low-skilled"" migrants from Europe.UK PoliticsComments","Low-skilled migration will fall when the UK ends EU free movement access after Brexit, Theresa May has promised. The prime minister said high-skilled workers would be prioritised with no preferential treatment for people from the EU compared with those from the rest of the world. But she said a future trade deal with the EU could include an agreement on ""mobility"" of each other's workers. Business groups expressed alarm about a crackdown on low-skilled workers. The Confederation of British Industry said it would make a shortage of care, construction and hospitality workers worse, adding: ""Restricting access to the workers the UK needs is self-defeating."" The British Retail Consortium said the policy should be based on the economy's needs rather an ""arbitrarily"" drawing a line based on salaries or skills. And Labour said the government was making a ""dubious distinction"" between low and high-skilled workers - saying care workers were technically ""low-skilled"" but were ""vital to our society"". How has EU migration changed the UK? The detail of Cabinet on immigration Reality Check: Which jobs are EU migrants doing? As it stands, EU freedom of movement allows people from the European Economic Area - all EU countries, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - plus Switzerland, to travel and work in the UK without visas, regardless of skills. For the rest of the world, specific categories of visas are needed to come and work or study in the UK, including one for ""skilled workers"" - who usually have to earn at least Â£30,000 and have a job offer. Currently, no ""Tier 3"" - low-skilled labour - visas are being given out. The UK defines low skilled roles as ones which do not require post-16 education or more than a short period of on-the-job training. The post-Brexit immigration plans follow arecommendation by the Migration Advisory Committee,external, which was also backed by Labour. The cabinet agreed to the committee's recommendations last week, and a White Paper setting out the details is promised in the autumn. Under the proposals: The passports of short-stay tourists and business people from all ""low-risk"" countries would be scanned at e-gates - currently only EU citizens can do this Security and criminal records checks would be carried out before visits, similar to the system of prior authorisation in the US Workers wanting to stay for longer periods would need a minimum salary, to ""ensure they are not competing with people already in the UK"" Successful applicants for high-skilled work would be able to bring their immediate family, but only if sponsored by their future employers The new system will not cap the number of student visas ""The new skills-based system will make sure low-skilled immigration is brought down and set the UK on the path to reduce immigration to sustainable levels, as we promised,"" Mrs May said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said free movement would end ""once and for all"" once the UK leaves the EU. This video can not be played The government will retain its commitment to reducing net migration, says Theresa May Asked whether exemptions would be made for industries requiring high levels of unskilled labour, she said the plan would recognise ""the further needs of the economy"" but that there would not be ""lots of exemptions"" for different sectors. And asked whether tourists would face extra bureaucracy when they visit EU countries, she said she hoped this would be dealt with in the course of the negotiations with the EU. The new system would aim to bring net migration to ""sustainable levels"", she promised - which she has defined as being below 100,000, a target the Tories set years ago but have never met. The EU's view The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt said the EU would not accept a UK immigration system that discriminated based on skills and job type - and that's the centre-piece of Mrs May's proposal. But it is not clear the extent to which the two sides will ever negotiate over this issue: the Brexit talks so far have been about the rights of people who have already moved and the negotiations about a future trade deal are likely to be about tourists, students and businesspeople - known in the jargon as ""mobility"" rather than immigration. In typical fastidious fashion Michel Barnier's team has already thought about all of this, giving a presentation to diplomats in February which said that UK migrants to the EU would be treated like citizens from anywhere else after Brexit. In a BBC Breakfast TV interview which also covered broader Brexit policy, Mrs May brushed off suggestions that there would have to be a general election or a referendum on any deal struck with the EU: Allow Twitter content?

The government has already announced the rights of EU citizens already living and working in the UK would be safeguarded after Brexit. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Home Secretary Sajid Javid told them: ""Deal or no deal, we want you to stay. We need you to stay. You can stay."" Mr Javid said the UK had an ""incredible opportunity"" to set out an immigration system ""without being constrained by the EU"". The new rules would be ""based on merit"", he said, promising a system that ""That judges people not by where they are from, but on what they can do"". In his conference speech, Mr Javid also said he would raise the standard of English required for people wanting to become British citizens and reform the official 'Life in the UK' test to make it better reflect British values. Please upgrade your browser Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, said the EU would not accept a system ""based on discrimination of skills and nationality"". British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson told the BBC it did not make sense to have separate rules for low and high-skilled workers. ""We shouldn't be thinking about it like that, we should be thinking about what it is the economy needs and, from a retail industry point of view, what it is that we as consumers need in our day-to-day lives in buying the products that we are taking for granted,"" she said. CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said the latest proposals had ""taken a wrong turn"". ""By dismissing the importance of low skilled workers to the UK economy, the government risks harming businesses and living standards now and in the future."" Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith predicted the UK benefits system would remain a ""massive pull factor"" for unskilled workers coming from the EU to compete with Britons. Asked about the warnings of shortages in sectors like care homes if this was cut, he said investment in new technology to monitor people in their own homes was needed to reduce dependency on cheap labour. Alp Mehmet, of the Migration Watch UK campaign group, claimed the proposals were ""not likely"" to cut net migration because EU migration would be replaced with arrivals from the rest of the world. ""That's taking your foot off the brake and frankly slipping onto the accelerator,"" he said.

Middle-class drug users 'to be targeted'Sajid Javid will announce a review into who is buying drugs - as well as who sells them.UK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played Sajid Javid: ""On my watch, illegal drug use will never be tolerated."" Middle-class drug users will be targeted as part of a crackdown on the causes of violent crime, Home Secretary Sajid Javid has announced. He used his Tory conference speech to launch a review of drug buyers and sellers - and how shifts in the market are linked to outbreaks of bloodshed. Justice Secretary David Gauke also announced a new financial crime unit to seize the assets of drugs ""kingpins"". Labour says the proposals will not make up for cuts to public services. Affluent drug users have been linked to the rise in gang-related knife crime in London and other cities. In August, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, echoing London Mayor Sadiq Khan, said: ""There are some Londoners who think it is a victimless crime, taking cocaine at 'middle-class parties'."" The results of the Home Office drug misuse review - targeting all types of user, including professionals - will be used to help police crack down on buyers and sellers, Mr Javid said. In a pre-speech interview, hetold the Daily Mail,external: ""We need to make people understand that if you are a middle-class drug user and you sort of think, 'Well, I'm not doing any damage, I know what I'm doing,' well, there's a whole supply chain that goes into that. ""Youths whose lives have been abused, the county lines, other drug takers being abused, crime being encouraged. ""You are not innocent - no one is innocent if they are taking illegal drugs."" The money trail used by drug sellers will be targeted So-calledcounty linesdrug dealing is where young people are recruited by gangs in large cities to sell drugs in rural areas. Addressing delegates in Birmingham, Mr Javid said: ""We know that one of the causes of the rise of serious violence is changes in the market for illegal drugs. ""We need a much better understanding of who drug users are, what they take, how often they take it, and so much more."" He is also launching a consultation on plans to ensure public sector workers in health, education, social services, local government and housing services make tackling the root causes of serious violence a top priority. A Â£200m youth endowment fund is being set up that will focus on violent crime hotspots. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""Violent crime is rising and recorded drug-related crime is surging, but all the Tories can offer is a review, yet another consultation and a Â£200m fund that doesn't replace the money they have already cut from local authorities. This video can not be played Conservative conference: ex-drug dealer Jacob Hill on rehabilitating offenders ""It's no use Sajid Javid saying health, education, social services, local government, housing and others are at the root cause of violent crime. He is part of a government that has been implementing damaging austerity measures in all of these areas for more than eight years."" Labour also says Mr Gauke's measures fall short of what is needed to tackle ""the emergency in our prisons"". The justice secretary's planned new financial crimes unit will investigate how bank accounts are being used to pay for drugs in prison and track down the criminals linked to them. The unit, which will be based in Peterborough, will have the power to close accounts and freeze assets as well as make arrests. The people who are really using cocaine UK becoming 'cocaine capital' of Europe ""My message to kingpins is this: we are already blocking your phones, putting you in isolation and now we will make sure you can't access your money,"" Mr Gauke said. Meanwhile, more prisoners will be given training to help them get into work once they are released. And Â£5m will be put into creating the first secure school to improve the education of young offenders. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson made his only appearance at this year's conference in Birmingham on Tuesday. Days aftercriticising Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plans, he delivered a wide-ranging speech at a fringe event, touching on areas over which he has never had ministerial responsibility, such as law and order, tax cuts and housebuilding. Back in the main hall, Health Secretary Matt Hancockwill announce a Â£240m packageto ease pressure on the NHS this winter by enabling more elderly people to be looked after at home.

Laser breakthroughs win physics Nobel,"Dr Strickland shared the prize for discoveries in laser physics The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to a woman for the first time in 55 years. Donna Strickland, from Canada, is only the third woman winner of the award, along with Marie Curie, who won in 1903, and Maria Goeppert-Mayer, who was awarded the prize in 1963. Dr Strickland shares this year's prize with Arthur Ashkin, from the US, and Gerard Mourou, from France. It recognises their discoveries in the field of laser physics. Dr Ashkin developed a laser technique described as optical tweezers, which is used to study biological systems. Drs Mourou and Strickland paved the way for the shortest and most intense laser pulses ever created. They developed a technique called Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA). It has found uses in laser therapy targeting cancer and in the millions of corrective laser eye surgeries which are performed each year. Speaking to the BBC, Dr Strickland said it was ""surprising"" it had been such a long time since a woman had won the award. However, she stressed that she had ""always been treated as an equal"", and that ""two men also won it with me, and they deserve this prize as much if not more than me"". Who is 'laser jock' Nobel winner Donna Strickland? The women standing up for science Arthur Ashkin and Gerard Mourou were honoured for their contributions to the field The award comes a few days aftera physicist gave a ""highly offensive"" lecture at the Cern particle physics laboratory in Genevain which he said that physics had been ""built by men"" and that male scientists were being discriminated against. He has since been suspended by the research centre. Dr Strickland called the physicist's remarks ""silly"" and said she never took such comments ""personally"". The last woman to win the physics prize, German-born American physicist Maria Goeppert-Mayer, took the award for her discoveries about the nuclei of atoms. Polish-born physicist Marie Curie shared the 1903 award with her husband Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel for their research into radioactivity. The award is worth a total of nine million Swedish kronor (Â£770,686; $998,618). Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie Reacting to her win, Dr Strickland, who is based at the University of Waterloo in Canada, said: ""First of all you have to think it's crazy, so that was my first thought. And you do always wonder if it's real. ""As far as sharing it with Gerard, of course he was my supervisor and mentor and he has taken CPA to great heights so he definitely deserves this award. And I'm so happy Art Ashkin also won."" She added: ""I think that he made so many discoveries early on that other people have done great things with that it's fantastic that he is finally recognised."" In a statement, the American Institute of Physics (AIP) offered its congratulations to all the winners, adding: ""The countless applications made possible by their work, like laser eye surgery, high-power pettawat lasers, and the ability to trap and study individual viruses and bacteria, only promise to increase going forward. ""It is also a personal delight to see Dr Strickland break the 55-year hiatus since a woman has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, making this year's award all the more historic."" Mourou and Strickland's technique has found several applications, including in laser eye surgery Before Dr Strickland and Dr Mourou's pioneering work, the peak power of laser pulses was limited because, when cranked up to high intensities, they would destroy the material used for amplifying its energy. To get round this, the researchers first stretched the laser pulses in time to reduce their peak power, then amplified them and finally compressed them. When a laser pulse is compressed in time and becomes shorter, more light is packed into a small space. This dramatically increases the intensity of the pulse. Dr Strickland and Dr Mourou's technique, called chirped pulse amplification (CPA), became standard for high intensity lasers. Arthur Ashkin realised an old dream in science fiction - using the radiation pressure of light to move physical objects. In doing so, he invented the optical tweezers that are today used to grab particles, atoms, viruses and living cells with their laser-based pincers. He first worked on getting laser light to push small particles towards the centre of the beam and hold them there. Then, in 1987, he used the tweezers to capture living bacteria without harming them. The technique is now used widely to study the machinery of life.

"Antidepressant withdrawal 'hits millions'Nearly two million people in England experience bad side-effects when coming off the tablets, experts say.Health","Millions of people get bad side-effects trying to cut down on or come off antidepressants, a large review says. TheAll Party Parliamentary Group for Prescribed Drug Dependence,externalreview suggests half of patients have withdrawal symptoms and for half of these the symptoms will be severe. Patients should be properly warned, it says. Yet guidance says symptoms are usually mild and clear up in a week. But it's not uncommon for side-effects to last for weeks, months or longer. The extreme side effects of antidepressants Teenage antidepressants 'doing more harm than good' Antidepressants: 'It's keeping me going' The review authors, Dr James Davies, from the University of Roehampton, and Prof John Read, from the University of East London, say about four million people in England may experience symptoms when withdrawing from antidepressants, and about 1.8 million may experience these as severe. This might include: anxiety sleep problems hallucinations Possible side effects of antidepressants - Mind,external They looked at 24 pieces of research, involving more than 5,000 patients, to reach their conclusions, published in theJournal of Addictive Behaviours,external. Some comments shared by these patients included: ""It took me two months of hell to come off the antidepressants - was massively harder than I expected"" ""While there is no doubt I am better on this medication, the adverse effects have been devastating - when I have tried to withdraw - with 'head zaps', agitation, insomnia and mood changes"" ""The difficulty of getting off has been a tough road and taken me years of trying and is something that doctors could be more knowledgeable of and supportive with"" Dr Davies said: ""This new review of the research reveals what many patients have known for years - that withdrawal from antidepressants often causes severe, debilitating symptoms which can last for weeks, months or longer. ""Existing NICE [National Institute for Clinical Excellence] guidelines fail to acknowledge how common withdrawal is and wrongly suggest that it usually resolves within one week. ""This leads many doctors to misdiagnose withdrawal symptoms, often as relapse, resulting in much unnecessary and harmful long-term prescribing."" Public Health England will look at the new data as part of itsreview into prescribed drug dependenceand NICE is currently gathering more evidence to update its advice. Antidepressants are one of the most common prescription drugs in the UK and their use has been rising. NHS figures show there were nearly 65 million of these prescriptions given out in England in 2016 - 3.7 million more than in 2006. Antidepressants are not addictive. And research shows they can be helpful but can take a few weeks to take effect. If you take an antidepressant for four weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist about whether you should continue on them. ProfWendy Burn, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""Antidepressants are an effective, evidence-based treatment for moderate to severe depression, and are a life-saver for many people. But not enough research has been done into what happens when you stop taking them. As this review shows, for many people the withdrawal effects can be severe, particularly when antidepressants are stopped abruptly. ""It's good to see more of a focus on this. We are pleased that Public Health England are prioritising dependence on, and withdrawal from, prescribed medicines as an area of review and welcome NHS England's referral to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) asking that they do the same.""

Dancing on Ice casts first contestants,"L-R: Richard Blackwood, Gemma Collins, Brian McFadden, James Jordan Former Strictly Come Dancing professional James Jordan has denied he'll have an ""unfair advantage"" over his fellow Dancing On Ice competitors. He will join former Towie star Gemma Collins, actor Richard Blackwood and ex-singer Brian McFadden on the show. Jordan spent eight years as a professional dancer on Strictly. ""People are going to probably say I've got an unfair advantage but when I got on the ice, I actually shocked myself how bad I was."" James's participation was revealed on BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday morning. Speaking to the station, he said: ""I can dance but I'm a lot older than I used to be. ""I want to be able to impress Torvill and Dean more than anyone else, but I'm a lot worse than I thought I'd be."" During his time on Strictly, Jordan partnered stars including Denise Van Outen and Vanessa Feltz. He is also married to fellow Strictly dancer Ola Jordan. Coincidentally, the star's crossover to the ITV show comes in the same year former Dancing on Ice judge Ashley Roberts is herself a contestant on Strictly. Saira Khan announced her involvement on Loose Women Saira Khan was unveiled as the fifth celebrity skater on the show on Loose Women. The television presenter, who was on the first series of The Apprentice said she was ""in it to win it"". ""I thought 'I'm too old, I can't do it, I'm going fall.' And my little boy said 'have you heard yourself mum?' He shamed me into it. I'm doing this for my kids,"" she added. Skating stars Torvill and Dean have also been confirmed to return to head up the judging panel for 2019. On Monday, fellow Dancing on Ice contestant Gemma Collins told ITV's This Morning she was ""scared"" and ""nervous"" about ""how they are going to lift me up"". She added that she was also concerned about ""how fast I can move around that ice, but I really want to give it a go."" The new series kicks off on ITV in January with eight more celebrities still to be announced. Holly and Phil return to hosting duties Each week the 12 celebrities will skate live with their professional partners in a bid to impress both the panel and the viewers, who will ultimately decide who wins the show. Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby will once again return to hosting duties. Blackwood is best known for his recent role in EastEnders as Vincent Hubbard - he joined the BBC soap in 2015 and left earlier this year. He confessed to This Morning that he had experience of skating and dancing as a teenager but said: ""I can skate but I normally dance on dry land so dancing and skating [together] are two different things."" McFadden was a member of boyband Westlife but left the band in 2004. He was also a judge on Australia's Got Talent and in 2016, he took part in the third series of The Jump on Channel 4.

FBI can question 'anybody' on KavanaughThe president says agents can interview anyone about his nominee as Republicans vow a vote this week.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Trump: I'd be the world's worst drinker President Trump has said he wants the FBI to conduct a ""very comprehensive investigation"" into sexual assault allegations against his Supreme Court nominee - but not a ""witch hunt"". US media reportsearlier suggested the White House wanted to restrict the inquiry into Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Mr Trump said he had requested that the FBI be given free rein, but added: ""I'd like it to go quickly."" The inquiry has delayed a Senate vote for the confirmation of Mr Kavanaugh. His confirmation would tilt the top US court in favour of conservatives for years to come and represent a major victory for the Trump administration. The issue has become central to the campaign for US mid-term elections. Conservative Republicans have accused the opposition Democrats of trying to delay the vote in the hope that they will win control of Congress after the November poll and therefore stop the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh. What will the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh actually do? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Who are Supreme Court nominee's accusers? On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the upper chamber would vote this week on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. ""The goal posts keep shifting,"" he said as he accused Democrats of attempting to derail the nomination. ""But the goal hasn't moved an inch. ""The time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close."" Mr McConnell did not specify when exactly the vote would be held, but it is expected to be Friday - the deadline for the FBI to finish its inquiry - or the following day. This video can not be played How US teens talk about sexual assault The FBI is expected to interview Judge Kavanaugh and some of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct - including Prof Ford, who testified last week to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge has already been interviewed. Mr Judge's testimony is considered key to the investigation, as Professor Christine Blasey Ford says he was in the room when Brett Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her at a house in 1982. Mr Judge has not appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said in a statement: ""I do not recall the party described in Dr Ford's letter."" Quoting an unnamed senior US official, NBC reported that the FBI's witness list does not include Julie Swetnick, the third accuser to come forward with a claim against Judge Kavanaugh. US reports also say,externalformer classmates of the judge who have claimed he drank heavily in college are not on the witness list. However, the New York Times earlier reported that a contemporary who accused the judge of lying under oath about his relationship with alcohol plans to speak to the FBI on Monday. This video can not be played ""I like beer"": Kavanaugh defends his high school drinking during testimony Because the agency isn't running a criminal investigation, but performing a background check at the request of the White House, it is the White House that defines the inquiry's parameters. The president told reporters on Monday: ""The FBI should interview anybody that they want within reason, but you have to say within reason."" He went on: ""They should also be guided, and I'm being guided, by what the senators are looking for."" Professor Charles Ludington, who teaches at North Carolina State University, said he had seen Judge Kavanaugh slurring his words and staggering after excessive alcohol consumption while at Yale. Outside his home on Monday, Prof Ludington told reporters ""unequivocally"" that Judge Kavanaugh ""has not told the truth"" in denying the possibility that he blacked out from drinking. He added: ""I never saw him passed out but I saw him quite drunk."" The White House rebutted these claims with statements from two former Yale classmates of Judge Kavanaugh. Chris Dudley and Dan Murphy said they had never seen the nominee black out while drunk at Yale, or behave inappropriately with women. The New York Times also reported on Monday that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend Chris Dudley had been questioned,external, but not charged, over an altercation that involved a third man in a bar in 1985. According to a copy of the police report obtained by the paper, Mr Kavanaugh was accused of throwing ice at the man, and Mr Dudley is alleged to have thrown a beer glass at him, cutting his ear. At the time, Mr Dudley denied the accusation, while Mr Kavanaugh did not want ""to say if he threw the ice or not,"" the police report said. Classmate: Kavanaugh lied about drinking On Monday nine of the 10 Democrat Senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray with a list of 24 people they believe should be interviewed. They called on the FBI to interview all three of the judge's accusers. Democrats have requested copies of all the FBI's witness interviews, and the names of any who decline to co-operate. Judge Kavanaugh denies the claims of his accusers: Psychology lecturer Prof Ford, the first woman to come forward, says he tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth at a house party in 1982, when she was 15 and he was 17 Deborah Ramirez, a student at Yale at the same time as him, says he exposed himself to her during a college drinking game Julie Swetnick says she went to house parties attended by him in the early 1980s, where she said he and his friends had tried to ""spike"" girls' drinks The Republican party's narrow 51-49 majority means if all Democratic senators vote against the nominee, Republicans can only afford one defection. In that instance, Vice-President Mike Pence has the casting vote, and would go in Judge Kavanaugh's favour. Why US top court is more political than UK's Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court The FBI investigation was launched at the urging of Republican Senators Jeff Flake, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.

Restraint of disabled patients rising,"Face-down restraint can restrict people's breathing The use of restraints on adults with learning disabilities in hospital units in England rose by 50% between 2016 and 2017, figures show. In 2017, restraints were used more than 22,000 times - once every half an hour. This was up from 15,000 times in 2016. Former Social Care Minister Norman Lamb said the use of restraint was ""shameful"". The Department of Health said it was committed to reducing the use of restrictive force in hospitals. The data, which covers both adults and children, obtained from NHS digital by BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme also found: Patient on patient assaults rose from 3,600 to more than 9,000 over the same period and figures for January to May this year suggest they are continuing to rise Instances of face-down or prone restraint - which should no longer be used according to government guidelines - also increased from more than 2,200 to 3,100 Authorities in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland said it was not possible for them to provide fully comparative data. Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who introduced guidelines to reduce the use of force in hospitals in 2014, said the use of face-down restraint was ""absolutely shocking"" and ""extraordinarily demeaning"". ""The bottom line is that I had wanted to see and expected to see a substantial decline in the use of restraint and that hasn't happened. ""I think that's really shameful when we know that it's possible in very many cases to avoid the use of restraint at all through a more sophisticated approach to people in inpatient settings."" Viv Cooper, of the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, a charity which supports people with severe learning disabilities, said: ""We're putting people in situations that are causing them distress and that are damaging them - and that's entirely unacceptable."" The increases happened over a period when the government said the overall number of people with learning disabilities in inpatient beds was falling. But the BBC investigation also found the government's pledge to move between 35% and 50% of people with learning disabilities and autism out of hospitals and into the community by March 2019 was unlikely to be met. Latest figures show the number of adults in inpatient units has reduced from about 2,600 to about 2,400 but the number of children in such units has almost doubled. Rob Greig, former national director for Learning Disabilities, said of the government's Transforming Care programme: ""All that happened was that one person moved out and somebody else was ready to move in, because someone else had been let down by the community services not supporting them properly."" But a Department of Health and Social Care official said since 2015 there had been about 5,500 discharges into the community and more than 410 inpatient beds decommissioned. The official added: ""People with learning disabilities and autism deserve the best support and care. ""We are clear that any kind of restraint should only be used as a last resort and we are working to reduce restrictive interventions and improve patient safety through improved monitoring and training."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said it was working towards getting people the services they needed in the community but adult social care services faced a Â£3.5bn funding gap by 2025. A representative said: ""For people to receive effective and safe support, social care needs to be financially sustainable.""

Middle-class drug users 'to be targeted',"This video can not be played Sajid Javid: ""On my watch, illegal drug use will never be tolerated."" Middle-class drug users will be targeted as part of a crackdown on the causes of violent crime, Home Secretary Sajid Javid has announced. He used his Tory conference speech to launch a review of drug buyers and sellers - and how shifts in the market are linked to outbreaks of bloodshed. Justice Secretary David Gauke also announced a new financial crime unit to seize the assets of drugs ""kingpins"". Labour says the proposals will not make up for cuts to public services. Affluent drug users have been linked to the rise in gang-related knife crime in London and other cities. In August, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, echoing London Mayor Sadiq Khan, said: ""There are some Londoners who think it is a victimless crime, taking cocaine at 'middle-class parties'."" The results of the Home Office drug misuse review - targeting all types of user, including professionals - will be used to help police crack down on buyers and sellers, Mr Javid said. In a pre-speech interview, hetold the Daily Mail,external: ""We need to make people understand that if you are a middle-class drug user and you sort of think, 'Well, I'm not doing any damage, I know what I'm doing,' well, there's a whole supply chain that goes into that. ""Youths whose lives have been abused, the county lines, other drug takers being abused, crime being encouraged. ""You are not innocent - no one is innocent if they are taking illegal drugs."" The money trail used by drug sellers will be targeted So-calledcounty linesdrug dealing is where young people are recruited by gangs in large cities to sell drugs in rural areas. Addressing delegates in Birmingham, Mr Javid said: ""We know that one of the causes of the rise of serious violence is changes in the market for illegal drugs. ""We need a much better understanding of who drug users are, what they take, how often they take it, and so much more."" He is also launching a consultation on plans to ensure public sector workers in health, education, social services, local government and housing services make tackling the root causes of serious violence a top priority. A Â£200m youth endowment fund is being set up that will focus on violent crime hotspots. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""Violent crime is rising and recorded drug-related crime is surging, but all the Tories can offer is a review, yet another consultation and a Â£200m fund that doesn't replace the money they have already cut from local authorities. This video can not be played Conservative conference: ex-drug dealer Jacob Hill on rehabilitating offenders ""It's no use Sajid Javid saying health, education, social services, local government, housing and others are at the root cause of violent crime. He is part of a government that has been implementing damaging austerity measures in all of these areas for more than eight years."" Labour also says Mr Gauke's measures fall short of what is needed to tackle ""the emergency in our prisons"". The justice secretary's planned new financial crimes unit will investigate how bank accounts are being used to pay for drugs in prison and track down the criminals linked to them. The unit, which will be based in Peterborough, will have the power to close accounts and freeze assets as well as make arrests. The people who are really using cocaine UK becoming 'cocaine capital' of Europe ""My message to kingpins is this: we are already blocking your phones, putting you in isolation and now we will make sure you can't access your money,"" Mr Gauke said. Meanwhile, more prisoners will be given training to help them get into work once they are released. And Â£5m will be put into creating the first secure school to improve the education of young offenders. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson made his only appearance at this year's conference in Birmingham on Tuesday. Days aftercriticising Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plans, he delivered a wide-ranging speech at a fringe event, touching on areas over which he has never had ministerial responsibility, such as law and order, tax cuts and housebuilding.

"Breaking|Breaking newsIndonesia death toll rises over 1,200Number of people killed in Indonesia quake and tsunami rises to more than 1,200, officials sayAsia","The number of people known to have died in Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 1,347, disaster response officials say. The death toll jumped on Tuesday from a previously confirmed figure of 844. The 7.5-magnitude quake struck just off the central island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu. Aid supplies are beginning to arrive in the city, where survivors have no access to running water or electricity. As tensions and need run high, police have begun guarding shops against looters. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Palu saw police firing warning shots and tear gas on Tuesday as people tried to take supplies from one shop. Police fired over crowds who were trying to raid one shop in Palu... ... but shortly after, allowed people to take the basic supplies they needed. Large queues are forming around any fuel stations in the area Officers initially took a lenient approach to survivors seizing basic goods, deputy national police chief Ari Dono Sukmanto said, but some people have since been arrested for stealing computers and cash. ""After day two the food supply started to come in, it only needed to be distributed,"" he said. ""We are now re-enforcing the law."" Pilot hails 'guardian angel' controller A town smashed to pulp in minutes Aerial shots of debris and survival after tsunami Humanitarian relief convoys entering the city are also being escorted by soldiers and police. In a separate incident, a volcano began erupting on the same island, Sulawesi, on Wednesday. Mount Soputan is about 1,000km (600 miles) away from Palu, and it was not immediately seen as a threat to the aid operation. Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu After days of waiting for aid, Wasliha decided she had to walk to find help. Her young family trekked through the mountains for more than 10 hours from her devastated village of Lolu Sigi Biromaru to Palu airport. ""We had no clean water or food and all we have is the clothes we are wearing,"" she says. Her children gulp down the water we give them, they haven't drunk anything since yesterday She had heard the military was flying out and had joined hundreds of people at the airport hoping to get a seat. Everyone wants to get out. Most can't and are having to endure another day without power and limited drinking water. In the town square people patiently wait in line to refill water bottles. Those that can make it here receive two meals a day, from a community kitchen run by volunteers and gallon of water to bathe in. Erna Wahyuni is cutting up a mountain of cabbage for soup. Her house was destroyed, but she wants to help. ""I was saved so I have to give back. It's also hard just sitting in a tent in the hot sun all day, I would rather be cooking,"" she laughs. Some people were rescued from the rubble in the first few days. This video can not be played Indonesia quake turns ground into liquid But many of the buildings brought down by the quake were then swamped by the tsunami, so hopes of more rescues are fading. In the hills above Palu, volunteers are filling a vast grave with the bodies of the dead. They have been told to prepare for 1,300 victims to arrive. The ground has become highly unstable and is constantly moving, making the search a dangerous operation and raising the risk of mudslides. Among the people confirmed dead are 34 Indonesian students, whose bodies were found under a church buried by one mudslide. Dozens more are still missing there. Teams have so far recovered three survivors from the ruins of the collapsed Hotel Roa Roa in Palu. An estimated 50 people were also inside when the quake hit. This is what's left of the Hotel Roa Roa in Palu Rescue team leader Agus Haryono said they were using acoustic detectors to try to locate more survivors. He said concrete and metal cutters were helping to clear the debris but added: ""We have to be very careful so we don't risk hurting any survivors."" Walls at a prison in Palu collapsed, allowing dozens of inmates to escape President Joko Widodo has called for reinforcements, telling the national search-and-rescue agency to send more police officers and soldiers into affected districts. ""There are some main priorities that we must tackle and the first is to evacuate, find and save victims who've not yet been found,"" he said. Across Palu, a damaged bridge, blocked roads, a partially closed airport and broken telecommunications have made it difficult to bring help into the affected area, and impossible to contact more remote regions. Aerial photos show the effects of the quake and tsunami on a major bridge in Palu With hospitals damaged, injured people have been treated in the open and at least one military field hospital has been set up. The military has taken over the airport to fly aid in, and injured people and other evacuees out. But for thousands of people wanting to get the first commercial flight out of Palu, the wait continues. ""I'd get a plane anywhere. I've been waiting for two days.

The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday.

Tensions rise as need for Palu aid growsThe BBC sees police firing warning shots as people grapple for supplies in the disaster-hit town.Asia,"Police fired warning shots as people tried to raid a shop for basic supplies People in Palu, Indonesia, are growing increasingly desperate for aid after a quake and tsunami hit the town. Supplies of water, food and fuel are scarce and with roads damaged it is proving hard to bring more in, or reach the more remote areas. The BBC's Jonathan Head, who is in the town, saw police firing warning shots and tear gas at crowds trying to take items from a small shop. At least 844 people are confirmed to have been killed by Friday's disaster. Officials say the final figure could be in the thousands. Among those killed are 34 Indonesian students whose bodies were found under a church buried by a mudslide. There are fears some survivors may still be trapped under the rubble of that and other buildings. Jonathan Head, BBC News, Palu Everyone we meet in Palu is focused on trying to get basic goods for their families. All normal services in the town have broken down; there's little running water, power, food or drinking water. People are desperate. We saw one group of armed police guarding a shop, being pressed by local people to let them in. Suddenly the police shouted, warning everyone to back off, followed by volleys of shots fired in the air and tear gas. Some of the men threw stones at the police; for a moment it seemed it might escalate. Yet an hour later the police backed down and let the crowd in. The atmosphere was transformed, from anger to jubilation as people came running down the street clutching shopping bags. The police tried to stop people taking non-food items - some were made to empty the sacks bulging with commandeered produce, and hand over plastic toys and toiletries. One officer wearily told me it was his responsibility to protect the shop - but what could he do when people needed so much. The bodies of the 34 students were found in Sigi Biromaru, just outside Palu, on Tuesday. They were among a group of 86 students reported missing from a Bible camp in the Jonooge Church Training Centre. The whereabouts of the other 52 students are not known. This video can not be played Tsunami survivor: ""I was hugging my wife, but when the wave came... I immediately lost her"" Aid workers told the BBC they were still in the process of retrieving the bodies, and were being hampered by mud. ""The mud conditions in that area are terrible, we have to walk about 1.5 hours to reach [the mudslide area], that makes it very difficult,"" Ridwan Sobri, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross told the BBC. How Palu suffered a 'worst case scenario' tsunami Air traffic controller hailed as quake hero A town smashed to pulp in minutes Aerial shots of debris and survival after tsunami Mr Sobri said the identities and ages of the students could not yet be confirmed. Rescuers are also still hunting for survivors in the ruins of a four storey hotel in the town. An estimated 50 people were inside the Hotel Roa Roa when it collapsed. About 12 people have been recovered - only three came out alive.

A mass grave in Palu On the outskirts of Palu, bodies were brought for burial by lorries. At one mass grave which measured more than 50 metres (165ft), the smell of decomposition was said to be ""overpowering"". The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami.

Ashley sacks House of Fraser management,"Mike Ashley's firm has sacked the senior management at House of Fraser just weeks after it bought the chain. In a one-sentence statement,,externalSports Direct said it had ""dismissed the former directors and senior management of House of Fraser"". Those departing the chain will include chief executive Alex Williamson. It is not clear who will replace the management team at House of Fraser. Sports Direct paid Â£90m for House of Fraser's 58 UK stores in August. Richard Lim of Retail Economics, a consultancy, said the new owner had taken ""drastic action following a series of woeful management decisions, clumsy execution and an outdated perception of the UK market"". He added: ""The retailer operates in the part of the industry under the most significant amount of pressure and the race is on to rapidly restructure the business to ensure the takeover is a success."" House of Fraser: Five things that went wrong Anger mounts over House of Fraser gift cards Debenhams and House of Fraser merger 'mooted' Richard Hyman, independent retail analyst, agreed the previous management team had been weak, but said this way of bringing in new leadership was unnecessarily abrupt: ""He was always likely to want his own people in there. One might have thought he'd do it in a low key way, avoiding making waves and disruption. ""But he is always unconventional and thus seems like an over-dramatic, heavy handed and unnecessarily negative way of doing it. ""One would have thought a few of them would be worth keeping in order to maintain continuity at least."" Mike Ashley also owns Newcastle United On Monday, flooring and furniture specialist ScS, which operates concessions in 27 House of Fraser stores, said the problems at the department store chain meant trading at those concessions remained ""challenging"". ""We are currently in discussions with the new owners with a view to agreeing a mutually beneficial arrangement, which will allow us to continue trading in a profitable manner in as many of the current concessions as possible,"" ScS added. Mr Ashley has vowed to turn the department store chain into the ""Harrods of the High Street"" and to keep most of its stores open. ""We think the biggest and most important thing House of Fraser is missing is luxury brands,""he told the Sun,externalin August. Since buying House of Fraser, Mr Ashley has been negotiating with the chain's landlords to try to cut rents. Emma Simpson, business correspondent It's not that surprising the top brass at House of Fraser are being shown the door. The chairman, Frank Slevin, has already left - a key executive who had no retail experience. The chief executive, Alex Williamson, who was appointed little over a year ago, also lacked a background in retail having previously run the Goodwood estate in Sussex. The chain's chief financial officer also had no retail background to speak of either. House of Fraser's problems go back many years.  But many observers believe these top executives simply didn't have the necessary expertise to turn around such a big and complex chain. It's not clear from the brief statement how many of the management team Mr Ashley has dismissed. The big question is who is going to run the business from now on, with the crucial Christmas trading period getting underway? Reviving the fortunes of House of Fraser will take great skill as well as investment. Last month, he said that 15 sites previously earmarked for closure would stay open. However,Mr Ashley blamed ""greedy landlords"" for the closure of storesin Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon.

FBI can question 'anybody' on Kavanaugh,"This video can not be played Trump: I'd be the world's worst drinker President Trump has said he wants the FBI to conduct a ""very comprehensive investigation"" into sexual assault allegations against his Supreme Court nominee - but not a ""witch hunt"". US media reportsearlier suggested the White House wanted to restrict the inquiry into Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Mr Trump said he had requested that the FBI be given free rein, but added: ""I'd like it to go quickly."" The inquiry has delayed a Senate vote for the confirmation of Mr Kavanaugh. His confirmation would tilt the top US court in favour of conservatives for years to come and represent a major victory for the Trump administration. The issue has become central to the campaign for US mid-term elections. Conservative Republicans have accused the opposition Democrats of trying to delay the vote in the hope that they will win control of Congress after the November poll and therefore stop the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh. What will the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh actually do? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Who are Supreme Court nominee's accusers? On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the upper chamber would vote this week on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. ""The goal posts keep shifting,"" he said as he accused Democrats of attempting to derail the nomination. ""But the goal hasn't moved an inch. ""The time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close."" Mr McConnell did not specify when exactly the vote would be held, but it is expected to be Friday - the deadline for the FBI to finish its inquiry - or the following day. This video can not be played How US teens talk about sexual assault The FBI is expected to interview Judge Kavanaugh and some of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct - including Prof Ford, who testified last week to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge has already been interviewed. Mr Judge's testimony is considered key to the investigation, as Professor Christine Blasey Ford says he was in the room when Brett Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her at a house in 1982. Mr Judge has not appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said in a statement: ""I do not recall the party described in Dr Ford's letter."" Quoting an unnamed senior US official, NBC reported that the FBI's witness list does not include Julie Swetnick, the third accuser to come forward with a claim against Judge Kavanaugh. US reports also say,externalformer classmates of the judge who have claimed he drank heavily in college are not on the witness list. However, the New York Times earlier reported that a contemporary who accused the judge of lying under oath about his relationship with alcohol plans to speak to the FBI on Monday. This video can not be played ""I like beer"": Kavanaugh defends his high school drinking during testimony Because the agency isn't running a criminal investigation, but performing a background check at the request of the White House, it is the White House that defines the inquiry's parameters. The president told reporters on Monday: ""The FBI should interview anybody that they want within reason, but you have to say within reason."" He went on: ""They should also be guided, and I'm being guided, by what the senators are looking for."" Professor Charles Ludington, who teaches at North Carolina State University, said he had seen Judge Kavanaugh slurring his words and staggering after excessive alcohol consumption while at Yale. Outside his home on Monday, Prof Ludington told reporters ""unequivocally"" that Judge Kavanaugh ""has not told the truth"" in denying the possibility that he blacked out from drinking. He added: ""I never saw him passed out but I saw him quite drunk."" The White House rebutted these claims with statements from two former Yale classmates of Judge Kavanaugh. Chris Dudley and Dan Murphy said they had never seen the nominee black out while drunk at Yale, or behave inappropriately with women. The New York Times also reported on Monday that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend Chris Dudley had been questioned,external, but not charged, over an altercation that involved a third man in a bar in 1985. According to a copy of the police report obtained by the paper, Mr Kavanaugh was accused of throwing ice at the man, and Mr Dudley is alleged to have thrown a beer glass at him, cutting his ear. At the time, Mr Dudley denied the accusation, while Mr Kavanaugh did not want ""to say if he threw the ice or not,"" the police report said. Classmate: Kavanaugh lied about drinking On Monday nine of the 10 Democrat Senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray with a list of 24 people they believe should be interviewed. They called on the FBI to interview all three of the judge's accusers. Democrats have requested copies of all the FBI's witness interviews, and the names of any who decline to co-operate. Judge Kavanaugh denies the claims of his accusers: Psychology lecturer Prof Ford, the first woman to come forward, says he tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth at a house party in 1982, when she was 15 and he was 17 Deborah Ramirez, a student at Yale at the same time as him, says he exposed himself to her during a college drinking game Julie Swetnick says she went to house parties attended by him in the early 1980s, where she said he and his friends had tried to ""spike"" girls' drinks The Republican party's narrow 51-49 majority means if all Democratic senators vote against the nominee, Republicans can only afford one defection. In that instance, Vice-President Mike Pence has the casting vote, and would go in Judge Kavanaugh's favour. Why US top court is more political than UK's Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court The FBI investigation was launched at the urging of Republican Senators Jeff Flake, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.

"Cern scientist suspended after commentsProf Alessandro Strumia, of Pisa University, had said ""physics was invented and built by men"".Europe","Cern, based in Switzerland, is one of the world's largest centres for scientific research A senior scientist who said physics ""was invented and built by men"" has been suspended with immediate effect from working with the European nuclear research centre Cern. Prof Alessandro Strumia, of Pisa University, made the comments during a presentation organised by the group. He said,in comments first reported by the BBC's Pallab Ghosh, that physics was ""becoming sexist against men"". Cern said on Monday it was suspending Prof Strumia pending an investigation. It stated that his presentation was ""unacceptable"". ""Cern always strives to carry out its scientific mission in a peaceful and inclusive environment,""the statement reads,external, calling the presentation ""contrary to the Cern Code of Conduct"". The organisation said it was ""unfortunate"" the views of the scientist, who works at a collaborating university, ""risks overshadowing the important message and achievements of the event"". Seven trailblazing women in science Female scientists post 'distractingly sexy' photos Viewpoint: Women must fight sexism in science Prof Strumia, who regularly works at Cern, was speaking at a workshop in Geneva on gender and high energy physics. He told his audience of young, predominantly female physicists that his results ""proved"" that ""physics is not sexist against women. However the truth does not matter, because it is part of a political battle coming from outside"". He produced a series of graphs,externalwhich, he claimed, showed that women were hired over men whose research was cited more by other scientists in their publications, which is an indication of higher quality. He also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers but men scored progressively better as their careers progressed. Prof Strumia claimed there were examples where men were discriminated against Another one of the slides from Alessandro Strumia's talk at Cern When the BBC contacted Prof Strumia he said: ""People say that physics is sexist, physics is racist. I made some simple checks and discovered that it wasn't, that it was becoming sexist against men and said so."" Last month, Prof Jocelyn Bell Burnell told the BBC she believed thatunconscious bias against women prevented them from getting jobs in physics research. Anda major study published in 2012 in the US scientific journal PNAS,externalshowed that science faculty members rated identical job applications more highly when presented to them with a male name rather than a female name. Scientists reacted to Prof Strumia's presentation on social media, complaining about discrimination they had suffered in the course of their work. Allow Twitter content?

Bodies found in ruins of Palu church,"Police fired warning shots as people tried to raid a shop for basic supplies People in Palu, Indonesia, are growing increasingly desperate for aid after a quake and tsunami hit the town. Supplies of water, food and fuel are scarce and with roads damaged it is proving hard to bring more in, or reach the more remote areas. The BBC's Jonathan Head, who is in the town, saw police firing warning shots and tear gas at crowds trying to take items from a small shop. At least 844 people are confirmed to have been killed by Friday's disaster. Officials say the final figure could be in the thousands. Among those killed are 34 Indonesian students whose bodies were found under a church buried by a mudslide. There are fears some survivors may still be trapped under the rubble of that and other buildings. Jonathan Head, BBC News, Palu Everyone we meet in Palu is focused on trying to get basic goods for their families. All normal services in the town have broken down; there's little running water, power, food or drinking water. People are desperate. We saw one group of armed police guarding a shop, being pressed by local people to let them in. Suddenly the police shouted, warning everyone to back off, followed by volleys of shots fired in the air and tear gas. Some of the men threw stones at the police; for a moment it seemed it might escalate. Yet an hour later the police backed down and let the crowd in. The atmosphere was transformed, from anger to jubilation as people came running down the street clutching shopping bags. The police tried to stop people taking non-food items - some were made to empty the sacks bulging with commandeered produce, and hand over plastic toys and toiletries. One officer wearily told me it was his responsibility to protect the shop - but what could he do when people needed so much. The bodies of the 34 students were found in Sigi Biromaru, just outside Palu, on Tuesday. They were among a group of 86 students reported missing from a Bible camp in the Jonooge Church Training Centre. The whereabouts of the other 52 students are not known. This video can not be played Tsunami survivor: ""I was hugging my wife, but when the wave came... I immediately lost her"" Aid workers told the BBC they were still in the process of retrieving the bodies, and were being hampered by mud. ""The mud conditions in that area are terrible, we have to walk about 1.5 hours to reach [the mudslide area], that makes it very difficult,"" Ridwan Sobri, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross told the BBC. How Palu suffered a 'worst case scenario' tsunami Air traffic controller hailed as quake hero A town smashed to pulp in minutes Aerial shots of debris and survival after tsunami Mr Sobri said the identities and ages of the students could not yet be confirmed. Rescuers are also still hunting for survivors in the ruins of a four storey hotel in the town. An estimated 50 people were inside the Hotel Roa Roa when it collapsed. About 12 people have been recovered - only three came out alive. This is what's left of the Roa Roa hotel in Palu ""We have to be very careful so we don't risk hurting any survivors when we move the debris,"" the head of the rescue team, Agus Haryono, told Reuters. Across Palu, blocked roads, a damaged airport and broken telecommunications have made it difficult to bring help into the affected area, and impossible to contact more remote regions. With hospitals damaged, injured people have been treated in the open and at least one military field hospital has been set up. The military has taken over the airport to fly aid in, and injured people and other evacuees out. But for thousands of people wanting to get the first commercial flight out of Palu, the wait continues. ""I'd get a plane anywhere. I've been waiting for two days. Haven't eaten, barely had a drink,"" 44-year-old food vendor Wiwid told Reuters news agency. This video can not be played Indonesia quake looter: ""We need to eat"" The charity Save the Children says many of the children in Palu ""will have experienced unimaginable trauma and distress"". ""Losing their mother or father, and watching everything they have known washed away,"" said the charity's Tom Howells. Children in front of a tent on a field of a mosque where they took refuge in Palu Many people are having to sleep in makeshift shelters or on the street, with little access to food, medication or emotional support, added Mr Howells. How Indonesiaâs tsunami warning system failed the victims Why Sulawesi's tsunami is puzzling scientists Across the city, mass graves are being dug, one of them to hold up to 300 bodies. A mass grave in Palu On the outskirts of Palu, bodies were brought for burial by lorries. At one mass grave which measured more than 50 metres (165ft), the smell of decomposition was said to be ""overpowering"". The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami. The earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis. Vice-President Jusuf Kalla has said the final death toll could be in the thousands while the Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected.

The detail of Cabinet on immigration,"By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg and BBC Political Correspondent Iain Watson For swathes of voters, immigration was the biggest question in the referendum campaign. But details of what to do about it after Brexit have been slow in coming. But ministers took a big step towards how the future system will look, with the biggest reboot of the immigration system in decades. The Cabinet on Monday agreed in principle that after Brexit EU nationals and people from other parts of the world should face the same immigration rules if they want to come to live or work in the UK. Ministers discussed proposals at length around the cabinet table and heard a presentation from the chair of the Migration Advisory Committee, Professor Alan Manning. Ministers reached what sources described as a ""high-level conclusion"" that after Brexit people wanting to come to live or work in the UK should be subject to the same rules, wherever they are from. No preference for EU migrants, cabinet agrees How has EU migration changed the UK? There was broad agreement on that principle, and the Home Office will now spend weeks working out further details. But the precise details in a future White Paper might not emerge until after a deal is reached with the EU in November. One insider told the BBC that the system would be based on ""skills not nationality"". Although free movement for EU nationals would end, government sources suggest there could still be ""light touch migration"" from the EU as part of a wider trade deal but they say the EU would not get ""something for nothing"" and there would have to be the same access for British citizens in Europe. They said that would not be ""preferential treatment"" because other future trade partners, for example the United States, could be offered the same kind of thing. In the Chequers agreement there is provision for a so-called ""mobility partnerships"" with the EU. It is understood that the Business Secretary Greg Clark raised the prospect of concerns from business at a sudden change, arguing that there could be pressure for a gradual, rather than an immediate, shake-up after Brexit. The Chancellor Philip Hammond agreed that was likely. But sources are adamant that the chancellor did not push for a delay and that there was a unanimous decision to move to a new system based on the principle of equal access. But the cabinet did accept that some sectors would need low-skilled migrants from the EU. If there is no deal, insiders have admitted that the new migration system won't be ready and would have to be ""tapered in"". EU citizens coming to the UK would have to apply for a work visa after they had arrived. Another cabinet source suggested however that no final decisions had been made. It's been suggested that the prime minister hopes to make an announcement about new immigration rules at the Tory conference next week.

"Father guilty of murdering daughter, eight","This video can not be played Neighbour describes Mylee Billingham murder scene A man who stabbed his eight-year-old daughter in the chest in an apparent act of revenge against his ex-partner has been found guilty of murder. William Billingham, 55, used a kitchen knife to kill Mylee after ignoring her screams as he dragged her into his bungalow near Walsall on 20 January. Birmingham Crown Court heard he killed her moments after holding the blade to the neck of her mother, Tracey Taundry. Billingham was convicted of murder and making a threat to kill Miss Taundry. The jurors deliberated for about 80 minutes before unanimously convicting Billingham of the two charges. The unemployed factory worker opted not to give evidence and claimed he had no memory of stabbing Mylee. He said he was guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter due to depression. Prosecutors said Billingham had ""turned his anger"" on Mylee to spite Miss Taundry after she began a relationship with a woman. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands The trial had heard how Billingham, who had six children with three women, produced a knife when his ex-partner arrived at his home in Brownhills to pick up their daughter. William Billingham admitted manslaughter due to depression but denied murder Miss Taundry told the court she heard the ""tink"" of the knife as she waited for Mylee to get a bag from inside.

"Cern scientist suspended after 'built by men' commentsProf Alessandro Strumia, of Pisa University, had said ""physics was invented and built by men"".Europe","Cern, based in Switzerland, is one of the world's largest centres for scientific research A senior scientist who said physics ""was invented and built by men"" has been suspended with immediate effect from working with the European nuclear research centre Cern. Prof Alessandro Strumia, of Pisa University, made the comments during a presentation organised by the group. He said,in comments first reported by the BBC's Pallab Ghosh, that physics was ""becoming sexist against men"". Cern said on Monday it was suspending Prof Strumia pending an investigation. It stated that his presentation was ""unacceptable"". ""Cern always strives to carry out its scientific mission in a peaceful and inclusive environment,""the statement reads,external, calling the presentation ""contrary to the Cern Code of Conduct"". The organisation said it was ""unfortunate"" the views of the scientist, who works at a collaborating university, ""risks overshadowing the important message and achievements of the event"". Seven trailblazing women in science Female scientists post 'distractingly sexy' photos Viewpoint: Women must fight sexism in science Prof Strumia, who regularly works at Cern, was speaking at a workshop in Geneva on gender and high energy physics. He told his audience of young, predominantly female physicists that his results ""proved"" that ""physics is not sexist against women. However the truth does not matter, because it is part of a political battle coming from outside"". He produced a series of graphs,externalwhich, he claimed, showed that women were hired over men whose research was cited more by other scientists in their publications, which is an indication of higher quality. He also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers but men scored progressively better as their careers progressed. Prof Strumia claimed there were examples where men were discriminated against Another one of the slides from Alessandro Strumia's talk at Cern When the BBC contacted Prof Strumia he said: ""People say that physics is sexist, physics is racist. I made some simple checks and discovered that it wasn't, that it was becoming sexist against men and said so."" Last month, Prof Jocelyn Bell Burnell told the BBC she believed thatunconscious bias against women prevented them from getting jobs in physics research. Anda major study published in 2012 in the US scientific journal PNAS,externalshowed that science faculty members rated identical job applications more highly when presented to them with a male name rather than a female name. Scientists reacted to Prof Strumia's presentation on social media, complaining about discrimination they had suffered in the course of their work. Allow Twitter content?

Ashley sacks House of Fraser managementSports Direct owner says the dismissals follow calls for an investigation into the chain's collapse.Business,"Mike Ashley's firm has sacked the senior management at House of Fraser just weeks after it bought the chain. In a one-sentence statement,,externalSports Direct said it had ""dismissed the former directors and senior management of House of Fraser"". Those departing the chain will include chief executive Alex Williamson. It is not clear who will replace the management team at House of Fraser. Sports Direct paid Â£90m for House of Fraser's 58 UK stores in August. Richard Lim of Retail Economics, a consultancy, said the new owner had taken ""drastic action following a series of woeful management decisions, clumsy execution and an outdated perception of the UK market"". He added: ""The retailer operates in the part of the industry under the most significant amount of pressure and the race is on to rapidly restructure the business to ensure the takeover is a success."" House of Fraser: Five things that went wrong Anger mounts over House of Fraser gift cards Debenhams and House of Fraser merger 'mooted' Richard Hyman, independent retail analyst, agreed the previous management team had been weak, but said this way of bringing in new leadership was unnecessarily abrupt: ""He was always likely to want his own people in there. One might have thought he'd do it in a low key way, avoiding making waves and disruption. ""But he is always unconventional and thus seems like an over-dramatic, heavy handed and unnecessarily negative way of doing it. ""One would have thought a few of them would be worth keeping in order to maintain continuity at least."" Mike Ashley also owns Newcastle United On Monday, flooring and furniture specialist ScS, which operates concessions in 27 House of Fraser stores, said the problems at the department store chain meant trading at those concessions remained ""challenging"". ""We are currently in discussions with the new owners with a view to agreeing a mutually beneficial arrangement, which will allow us to continue trading in a profitable manner in as many of the current concessions as possible,"" ScS added. Mr Ashley has vowed to turn the department store chain into the ""Harrods of the High Street"" and to keep most of its stores open. ""We think the biggest and most important thing House of Fraser is missing is luxury brands,""he told the Sun,externalin August. Since buying House of Fraser, Mr Ashley has been negotiating with the chain's landlords to try to cut rents. Emma Simpson, business correspondent It's not that surprising the top brass at House of Fraser are being shown the door. The chairman, Frank Slevin, has already left - a key executive who had no retail experience. The chief executive, Alex Williamson, who was appointed little over a year ago, also lacked a background in retail having previously run the Goodwood estate in Sussex. The chain's chief financial officer also had no retail background to speak of either. House of Fraser's problems go back many years.  But many observers believe these top executives simply didn't have the necessary expertise to turn around such a big and complex chain. It's not clear from the brief statement how many of the management team Mr Ashley has dismissed. The big question is who is going to run the business from now on, with the crucial Christmas trading period getting underway? Reviving the fortunes of House of Fraser will take great skill as well as investment. Last month, he said that 15 sites previously earmarked for closure would stay open. However,Mr Ashley blamed ""greedy landlords"" for the closure of storesin Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon. Sports Direct was forced to rule out making a takeover bid for Debenhams after Simon Bentley, an outgoing director of Sports Direct, said the board had discussed combining the two department store chains. Mr Ashley's firm owns a 29.7% stake in Debenhams. Mr Bentley later said he had ""made no mention of any merger"".

"Low-skill migration to fall, May vows","Low-skilled migration will fall when the UK ends EU free movement access after Brexit, Theresa May has promised. The prime minister said high-skilled workers would be prioritised with no preferential treatment for people from the EU compared with those from the rest of the world. But she said a future trade deal with the EU could include an agreement on ""mobility"" of each other's workers. Business groups expressed alarm about a crackdown on low-skilled workers. The Confederation of British Industry said it would make a shortage of care, construction and hospitality workers worse, adding: ""Restricting access to the workers the UK needs is self-defeating."" The British Retail Consortium said the policy should be based on the economy's needs rather an ""arbitrarily"" drawing a line based on salaries or skills. And Labour said the government was making a ""dubious distinction"" between low and high-skilled workers - saying care workers were technically ""low-skilled"" but were ""vital to our society"". How has EU migration changed the UK? The detail of Cabinet on immigration Reality Check: Which jobs are EU migrants doing? As it stands, EU freedom of movement allows people from the European Economic Area - all EU countries, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - plus Switzerland, to travel and work in the UK without visas, regardless of skills. For the rest of the world, specific categories of visas are needed to come and work or study in the UK, including one for ""skilled workers"" - who usually have to earn at least Â£30,000 and have a job offer. Currently, no ""Tier 3"" - low-skilled labour - visas are being given out. The UK defines low skilled roles as ones which do not require post-16 education or more than a short period of on-the-job training. The post-Brexit immigration plans follow arecommendation by the Migration Advisory Committee,external, which was also backed by Labour. The cabinet agreed to the committee's recommendations last week, and a White Paper setting out the details is promised in the autumn. Under the proposals: The passports of short-stay tourists and business people from all ""low-risk"" countries would be scanned at e-gates - currently only EU citizens can do this Security and criminal records checks would be carried out before visits, similar to the system of prior authorisation in the US Workers wanting to stay for longer periods would need a minimum salary, to ""ensure they are not competing with people already in the UK"" Successful applicants for high-skilled work would be able to bring their immediate family, but only if sponsored by their future employers The new system will not cap the number of student visas ""The new skills-based system will make sure low-skilled immigration is brought down and set the UK on the path to reduce immigration to sustainable levels, as we promised,"" Mrs May said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said free movement would end ""once and for all"" once the UK leaves the EU. This video can not be played The government will retain its commitment to reducing net migration, says Theresa May Asked whether exemptions would be made for industries requiring high levels of unskilled labour, she said the plan would recognise ""the further needs of the economy"" but that there would not be ""lots of exemptions"" for different sectors. And asked whether tourists would face extra bureaucracy when they visit EU countries, she said she hoped this would be dealt with in the course of the negotiations with the EU. The new system would aim to bring net migration to ""sustainable levels"", she promised - which she has defined as being below 100,000, a target the Tories set years ago but have never met. The EU's view The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt said the EU would not accept a UK immigration system that discriminated based on skills and job type - and that's the centre-piece of Mrs May's proposal. But it is not clear the extent to which the two sides will ever negotiate over this issue: the Brexit talks so far have been about the rights of people who have already moved and the negotiations about a future trade deal are likely to be about tourists, students and businesspeople - known in the jargon as ""mobility"" rather than immigration. In typical fastidious fashion Michel Barnier's team has already thought about all of this, giving a presentation to diplomats in February which said that UK migrants to the EU would be treated like citizens from anywhere else after Brexit. In a BBC Breakfast TV interview which also covered broader Brexit policy, Mrs May brushed off suggestions that there would have to be a general election or a referendum on any deal struck with the EU: Allow Twitter content?

The government has already announced the rights of EU citizens already living and working in the UK would be safeguarded after Brexit. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Home Secretary Sajid Javid told them: ""Deal or no deal, we want you to stay. We need you to stay. You can stay."" Mr Javid said the UK had an ""incredible opportunity"" to set out an immigration system ""without being constrained by the EU"". The new rules would be ""based on merit"", he said, promising a system that ""That judges people not by where they are from, but on what they can do"". In his conference speech, Mr Javid also said he would raise the standard of English required for people wanting to become British citizens and reform the official 'Life in the UK' test to make it better reflect British values. Please upgrade your browser Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, said the EU would not accept a system ""based on discrimination of skills and nationality"". British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson told the BBC it did not make sense to have separate rules for low and high-skilled workers. ""We shouldn't be thinking about it like that, we should be thinking about what it is the economy needs and, from a retail industry point of view, what it is that we as consumers need in our day-to-day lives in buying the products that we are taking for granted,"" she said. CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said the latest proposals had ""taken a wrong turn"". ""By dismissing the importance of low skilled workers to the UK economy, the government risks harming businesses and living standards now and in the future."" Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith predicted the UK benefits system would remain a ""massive pull factor"" for unskilled workers coming from the EU to compete with Britons. Asked about the warnings of shortages in sectors like care homes if this was cut, he said investment in new technology to monitor people in their own homes was needed to reduce dependency on cheap labour. Alp Mehmet, of the Migration Watch UK campaign group, claimed the proposals were ""not likely"" to cut net migration because EU migration would be replaced with arrivals from the rest of the world. ""That's taking your foot off the brake and frankly slipping onto the accelerator,"" he said.

Some remote areas have yet to be contacted, and there are fears that the death toll could rise further. A lack of heavy lifting equipment is hampering rescuers' attempts to reach people who remain alive in the ruins of collapsed buildings. Dozens of people are feared to be underneath the rubble of one hotel alone, the Roa-Roa in the devastated resort of Palu. Volunteers filling a mass grave were instructed to prepare for a total of 1,300 victims to arrive In Sigi, south of Palu, the bodies of 34 children were found at a church which was engulfed in mud and debris, Indonesia Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani was quoted as saying by Reuters. She said the children were on a ""Bible camp"". An aerial photo of the devastation in the Donggala area, north of Palu Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency confirmed to the BBC that none of the country's tsunami detector buoys were working before Sulawesi was hit. Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the 21 floating detection units - which are connected to deep sea sensors - had been damaged by vandals or stolen. A tsunami warning was still sent out - but it appears to have drastically underestimated the scale of the waves that would follow. Many people in Palu did not receive alerts because of power cuts caused by the tremor. There were also no sirens located along the coast. How warning system failed the victims Why Sulawesi's tsunami is puzzling scientists Air traffic controller hailed as quake hero In pictures: Search for survivors ""Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. Yenni Suryani, of Catholic Relief Services, said aid agencies were struggling to get staff into affected areas as the main airport at Palu was damaged, landslides had cut road links and ""power is out almost everywhere"". Some survivors have been looting shops for food, water and fuel, telling reporters they have run out of supplies. Reuters news agency reports that police are escorting aid convoys to prevent supplies being stolen.

Military aircraft have been evacuating some of the injured Government officials say some 1,200 inmates escaped from three prisons in the region as the quake struck. In the hills above Palu, volunteers filling a mass grave were instructed to prepare for a total of 1,300 victims to arrive. Trucks arrived with bodies wrapped in orange, yellow and black body bags. They were dragged into the grave and motorised diggers poured earth on top. But many people are still looking for missing loved ones. Adi told AFP he was hugging his wife by the beach in Palu when the tsunami struck, and has not seen her since. ""When the wave came, I lost her,"" he said. ""I was carried about 50 metres. I couldn't hold anything."" By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu Lying on a stretcher in the dark outside the Mamboro health clinic in Palu is a five-year-old girl with a broken leg. She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. ""We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live."" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies. A few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: ""They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer."" Rows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood. People's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open. Read Rebecca's first full report from the disaster zone The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles),externaljust off Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami. The earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis. A warning system was put in place across the whole Pacific region after the 2004 disaster, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people. Videos show people screaming as waves 6m (20ft) high power over the beach - where a festival was being set-up - sweeping up everything in their path. Indonesia lies on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide and many of the world's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur. Have you been affected by the earthquake?
