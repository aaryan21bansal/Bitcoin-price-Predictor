UK's controversial 'porn blocker' plan dropped,"The government has dropped a plan to use strict age verification checks to stop under-18s viewing porn online. It said the policy, which was initially set to launch in April 2018, would ""not be commencing"" after repeated delays, and fears it would not work. The so-called porn blocker would have forced commercial porn providers to verify users' ages, or face a UK ban. Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan said other measures would be deployed to achieve the same objectives. The government first mooted the idea of a porn blocker in 2015, with the aim of stopping youngsters ""stumbling across"" inappropriate content. Pornographic sites which failed to check the age of UK visitors would have faced being blocked by internet service providers. Government error hits porn age-check plan UK to introduce porn age-checks in July But critics warned that many under-18s would have found it relatively easy to bypass the restriction using virtual private networks (VPNs), which disguise their location, or could simply turn to porn-hosting platforms not covered by the law, such as Reddit or Twitter. Likewise, platforms which host pornography on a non-commercial basis - meaning they do not charge a fee or make money from adverts - would not have been affected. There were also privacy concerns, amid suggestions that websites could ask users to upload scans of their passports or driving licences. It was a plan, said ministers, to protect children from stumbling across pornography - an objective bound to be hugely popular with parents and anyone concerned about child safety. But throughout its troubled life the porn block has met opposition from across the political spectrum. The critics said it was an attack on civil liberties, it was the government trying to censor the web, it could endanger privacy and any database of porn users would be a honeypot for scammers. Most of all questions were raised about whether it would work, with pornography shared on social media sites not affected by the ban, and savvy teenagers able to use VPNs to get round it. Now the fifth culture secretary to be in post since the idea was first mooted has dropped the plan. Nicky Morgan insists its objectives can still be achieved via the new regulator envisaged by the recent Online Harms White Paper. But expect more wrangling about the precise nature of the ""duty of care"" the watchdog will impose on the pornography websites and how they will be punished for any failings. In a written statement issued on Wednesday,external, Ms Morgan said the government would not be ""commencing Part 3 of the Digital Economy Act 2017 concerning age verification for online pornography"". Instead, she said, porn providers would be expected to meet a new ""duty of care"" to improve online safety. This will be policed by a new online regulator ""with strong enforcement powers to deal with non-compliance"". ""This course of action will give the regulator discretion on the most effective means for companies to meet their duty of care,"" she added. There were concerns users would have had to upload scans of their passports OCL, one of the firms offering age verification tools, was not happy about the decision. ""It is shocking that the government has now done a U-turn and chosen not to implement [this],"" said chief executive Serge Acker. ""There is no legitimate reason not to implement legislation which has been on the statue books for two years and was moments away from enactment this summer. [This] would have protected children against seeing pornography on the internet, a move which would undoubtedly have been welcomed by all sensible parents in the UK."" But Jim Killock, executive director of civil liberties organisation Open Rights Group, welcomed the news. ""Age verification for porn as currently legislated would cause huge privacy problems if it went ahead. We are glad the government has stepped back from creating a privacy disaster, that would lead to blackmail scams and individuals being outed for the sexual preferences. ""However it is still unclear what the government does intend to do, so we will remain vigilant to ensure that new proposals are not just as bad, or worse."" In June, the porn blocker was delayed a second time after the government failed to tell European regulators about the plan, leading Labour to describe the policy as an ""utter shambles"".

Man cleared of killing wife by not getting help,"Neil Crilley was cleared of the culpable homicide of his wife, Maureen A pensioner has been cleared of killing his wife by failing to get her medical attention. Maureen Crilley, 67, died in hospital after spending eight weeks lying on her living room floor with a broken leg. At the High Court in Glasgow a jury found a charge of culpable homicide against her husband not proven. Neil Crilley, 77, claimed his wife begged him not to call an ambulance after she fell at their home in Clydebank in July 2017. She died after a pressure sore on her back became infected, causing spinal meningitis. Man 'totally ashamed' about wife dying in pain Woman died from untreated pressure sore Prosecutors alleged the former shipyard worker with BAE Systems had failed to obtain ""appropriate, timely and adequate"" medical help for his wife from 1 July to 2 September 2017, causing her ""unnecessary suffering"". Mr Crilley, now of Whitecrook, West Dunbartonshire, had denied the charge and previously told the court that evidence given by doctors during his trial made him realise his wife was in agony as she died. He said his wife had a fear of hospitals and needles, and that he was unaware that his wife was lying in her own filth and had two sores festering on her back - one of them the size of a saucer. May Mackie said justice was not done Speaking outside of court, Mrs Crilley's sister May Mackie said: ""Two years we've waited for this, and justice was not done. Leaving my sister to rot in hell, that's what he done. ""He left her lying for nine weeks, couldn't get up, couldn't eat. Said he put nightdresses on her, [but] she was left naked. ""What is this all about?"" The trial previously heard from a GP called out to the house. She recalled finding Mrs Crilley naked on the living room floor, surrounded by nappies. The doctor said it was the worst case she had seen in 32 years. Mrs Crilley was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, where she died on 4 September 2017. Neil Crilley was acquitted of a charge of culpable homicide Mr Crilley told the court: ""I totally failed her and I don't want to live - I don't deserve to live."" In evidence, he said he cooked mince and potatoes and fish cakes for her while she lay on the floor. He said he had no sense of smell and did not realise how bad her injuries were. The court heard Mrs Crilley would have survived if medical treatment had been sought promptly. Mr Crilley told his QC Tony Graham that he visited his wife's grave every day and spoke to her. He was asked if he had wanted his wife dead and replied: ""No, God, no. Maureen was my life, I will never smile again. I wanted to look after her for the time we had left."" He told jurors that his wife would hide her illnesses from him to avoid going to the doctors. In 2009, she broke her kneecap and he said it took him six weeks to persuade her to go to hospital.

Celebrities admit climate change 'hypocrisy',"Hundreds defied the protest ban to gather in Trafalgar Square Celebrity Extinction Rebellion supporters have admitted in an open letter being ""hypocrites"" over their high-carbon lifestyles. But stars including Benedict Cumberbatch, who last week joined London protests, called for ""systemic change"" to the ""fossil-fuel economy"". It comes as Extinction Rebellion was granted permission to challenge a London-wide protest ban in court. Several demonstrators have been arrested as hundreds defied the ban. More than 100 celebrity supporters of Extinction Rebellion signedthe letter to the media,external, which urges the media to focus on ""the real story"" of the climate and ecological emergency. Spice Girl Mel B, comedian Steve Coogan, musician Bob Geldof, actor Sir Mark Rylance, model Lily Cole and Glastonbury's Emily Eavis, among others, all confessed their culpability in the climate crisis. 'I rebel so I can look my grandchildren in the eye' What does Extinction Rebellion want? Met 'stretched' by Extinction Rebellion protests The letter says: ""Dear journalists who have called us hypocrites. You're right. ""We live high carbon lives and the industries that we are part of have huge carbon footprints. ""Like you, and everyone else, we are stuck in this fossil-fuel economy and without systemic change, our lifestyles will keep on causing climate and ecological harm."" But they called on the media to focus on the ""more urgent story"" of life on earthdying in a sixth mass extinction. They said they cannot ignore the call of young people such as Greta Thunberg to ""fight for their already devastated future"", even if it means putting themselves ""in your firing line"". Meanwhile, theprime minister is to chair a new cabinet committee on climate changeto drive action to cut emissions across the government. Green groups have been calling for such top-level co-ordination - although they remain critical of other policy details. It comes as police have begun making arrests after Extinction Rebellion activists defied an order banning them from demonstrating anywhere in London. About 500 protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square, some of whom covered their mouths with black tape to symbolise the silencing of their protest. Within a couple of hours, the protest broke up and large numbers dispersed. Police arrested a small group who were blocking Whitehall, BBC correspondent Andy Moore said. Among those arrested were Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley and George Monbiot, the author and Guardian journalist. As he was arrested, Mr Monbiot said: ""We have to make a stand against the destruction of our life support systems."" Author George Monbiot was arrested after refusing to move from the road at Whitehall An application for a judicial review of the ban was accepted by the High Court, according to an Extinction Rebellion spokesman. It means the case can go ahead, with an initial hearing scheduled for Thursday. The claimants include the Green Party's Caroline Lucas and Baroness Jenny Jones, Labour MPs Clive Lewis and David Drew, and Mr Monbiot. Extinction Rebellion argues the ban is disproportionate and an unprecedented curtailment of the right to free speech and free assembly. The group hopes the High Court will quash the decision to implement the blanket ban. It follows the Metropolitan Police announcingnew restrictions under Section 14 of the Public Order Act,external, which required protesters to disperse by 21:00 BST or risk arrest. Any assembly of more than two people linked to the Extinction Rebellion action is now illegal in London. The force said it decided to impose the rules after ""continued breaches"" of conditions which limited the demonstrations to Trafalgar Square. More than 1,600 people have been arrested since the protests, dubbed the Autumn Uprising, began on October 7. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor, who is leading the policing of the demonstrations, said he was confident the Met's decision was ""entirely lawful"" and ""entirely proportionate"". Dozens of mothers and babies defied the ban to protest outside Google's London HQ The mothers wore sashes saying ""their future"" as they cradled their children A large group of protesters gathered outside YouTube's offices in London's King's Cross Also on Wednesday, a group of mothers and babies defied the restriction, staging a ""feed-in"" outside Google's offices in London's King's Cross, while other activists targeted the nearby offices of YouTube - a Google subsidiary. They said they wanted to highlight the company's political donations to organisations that have campaigned against action on climate change. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said concerns had been raised about the police's decision to ban the protests, adding that shadow home secretary Diane Abbott was discussing it with the police. ""I think it's important to protect the right of free speech, and the right to demonstrate in our society - obviously in a non-violent way,"" he said. He added that Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan had no involvement in the ""operational decision"" by police to remove the protesters. The Mayor of Woodbridge, Green Party member Eamonn O'Nolan, was part of the protest On Tuesday, Mr Khan said he was ""seeking further information"" about why the ban was necessary, saying he believed ""the right to peaceful and lawful protest must always be upheld"". A government spokesman said the UK was already taking ""world-leading action to combat climate change as the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely by 2050"". ""While we share people's concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt people's day-to-day lives,"" he added. Police have the powers to ban a protest under thePublic Order Act 1986,external, if a senior officer has reasonable belief that it may cause ""serious disruption to the life of the community"". Police are also under a duty to balance the task of keeping the streets open with the right freedom of assembly under Article 11 of theHuman Rights Act 1998,externaland freedom of expression, under Article 10. These rights are not absolute - the state can curtail them. However, the BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said: ""The test, if and when it gets to a human rights court battle, is whether police action was proportionate to the threat and only what was strictly necessary."" By law, the organiser of a public march must tell the police certain information in writing six days in advance. Police have the power to limit or change the route of the march or set other conditions. A Section 14 notice issued under the Public Order Act allows police to impose conditions on a static protest and individuals who fail to comply with these can be arrested.

Car parts firm to shut with 125 jobs to be lost,"The company supplies parts to manufacturers including BMW A car parts firm has announced it will close in 2021, with the loss of about 125 jobs. Hi-Lex Cable System Company makes door and window parts and cables for cars at its plant on Baglan energy park. Management at the firm, which supplies Honda, Audi and BMW among others, said it did not anticipate any redundancies in the next 12 months. Any remaining business at the plant in 2021 will be transferred to a Hi-Lex plant in Hungary. A statement issued by the company said the decision had been taken following a meeting at the parent company, Hi-Lex Corporation in Japan, which discussed a restructure of its European operations. It continued: ""Hi-Lex Corporation regrets the need for the decision to re-structure its operations, but it is based solely upon a significant reduction in the sales forecast at HCS, from 2021 onwards. ""Hi-Lex will now contact all of our supply chain partners to discuss and agree plans to meet the needs of our customers up to the closure of the HCS facility."" Ford set to close Bridgend plant in 2020 Hundreds of steel jobs could go at Newport plant Adam Glaznieks, managing director at the Port Talbot site, said: ""The reason for making the announcement now is that we need to commence preparations to transfer any remaining business after 2021 to the Hi-Lex plant in Hungary."" The leader of Neath Port Talbot council, Rob Jones, said the closure would be ""keenly felt"" in the area and the authority would try to support workers ""wherever we can into new employment"". Hi-Lex was founded in 1946 and has 50 sites in 18 countries across North America, Europe and Asia. Hi-Lex Cable System Company is based at Baglan energy park The car industry is facing serious challenges - there's been a drop in demand for diesel cars in the UK, sales abroad have slowed and the industry and consumers have been slow to respond to the development of electric vehicles. Uncertainty over the future trading relationship with the EU after Brexit is also a headache in an industry that's heavily integrated, with components being manufactured and transferred across borders. There were concerns about the potential impact on Hi-Lex when Honda announced it would stop production at its Swindon plant in 2021. Ford in Bridgend will close next year and there have been job losses in Llanelli at Calsonic Kansei and Schaeffler. It's not all been bad news for the industry though - Aston Martin will take on 1,000 workers at St Athan and Ineos could create up to 500 jobs in the long term at its Bridgend site.

Paedophile Huckle 'strangled and stabbed',"Paedophile Richard Huckle died after being strangled and stabbed with a makeshift weapon that may have been fashioned from a toothbrush, sources have told the BBC. Huckle, 33, who was in prison for abusing up to 200 Malaysian children, waskilled on Sundayin his cell. It is thought he was strangled with some sort of bandage. The police investigation is reportedly focusing on Paul Fitzgerald, a fellow inmate jailed for serious sex offences. It is understood that he has been placed in isolation pending investigation of murder. He has not been arrested or charged. Malaysia abuse Briton gets 22 life terms How Richard Huckle was caught Paedophile Richard Huckle stabbed to death in jail Police were called shortly after 12:30pm on Sunday to Huckle's cell at Full Sutton Prison, near York. In 2016, Huckle, from Ashford, Kent, was given 22 life sentences after admitting 71 charges of sex abuse of children aged between six months and 12 years, between 2006 and 2014. Huckle's trial at the Old Bailey in 2016 heard that investigators who checked his computer found more than 20,000 indecent pictures and videos of his assaults. These were shared with paedophiles worldwide through a hidden website on the so-called dark web. Huckle, who worked as a freelance photographer, tried to make a business out of his abuse by crowd-funding the release of the images. He was compiling a paedophile's manual at the time of his arrest in 2014. The Old Bailey judge sentencing him described the 60-page manual as a ""truly evil document"". At the end of his trial, Judge Peter Rook said Huckle's sentence reflected the ""public abhorrence"" over his ""campaign of rape"". This video can not be played The BBC's Angus Crawford traces the path of Richard Huckle in Kuala Lumpur Huckle was arrested at Gatwick Airport by National Crime Agency officials in December 2014, following a tip-off by Australian authorities. He presented himself as a practising Christian and first visited Malaysia on a teaching gap year when he was 18 or 19. He went on to groom children while doing voluntary work. Malaysians deplore 'devil' Huckle The 'gap year' paedophile Richard Huckle 'highly likely' to have had UK victims In online posts, Huckle had bragged: ""Impoverished kids are definitely much easier to seduce than middle-class Western kids."" Commenting on one of his victims, he boasted: ""I'd hit the jackpot, a 3yo girl as loyal to me as my dog and nobody seemed to care."" Huckle's encrypted paedophile manual was found on his laptop ready for publication on the dark web. Last year,BBC Three produced a documentaryabout Huckle, which explored his proximity to children in Cambodia, India and the UK. Full Sutton is a maximum security men's prison around 11 miles east of York that holds ""some of themost difficult and dangerous criminals in the country,external"", according to the Ministry of Justice website. It has a total capacity of around 550, and holds only Category A prisoners, whose escape would be consideredhighly dangerous,,externaland Category B prisoners, whose escape must be made ""very difficult"". Last August one hundred officers were calledwhen a prisoner went on a rampage, attacking staff and starting a fire. Plans to build a Category C facility alongside the current facilities,making a 1,440-inmate ""mega prison"",have been opposed by Humberside Police, who fear it would increase violent crime within the jail and raise demands on the force.

US suspect 'disappointed' by Dunn family rejection,"This video can not be played Trump said he ""spoke with Boris"" before meeting Harry Dunn's family The US woman accused of involvement in the crash which killed Harry Dunn has said she was ""disappointed"" not to have met his family. Mr Dunn's parentsrejected a ""bombshell"" offer from Donald Trumpto meet Anne Sacoolas at the White House on Tuesday. Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn felt ""a little ambushed"" when the president revealed she was in the next room. Mr Trump described his meeting with the couple as ""beautiful"" but ""very sad"". This video can not be played Charlotte Charles says meeting Anne Sacoolas on Tuesday ""wouldn't have brought any healing to her or us"" A statement issued by Mrs Sacoolas' lawyer Amy Jeffress said: ""We are trying to handle the matter privately and look forward to hearing from the family or their representatives. ""Anne accepted the invitation to the White House with the hope that the family would meet and was disappointed."" Mrs Sacoolas, 42, returned to the United States under diplomatic immunity days after the crash which killed Harry, 19. Harry's parents said they wanted to meet her in the UK. In an interview with the BBC Ms Charles said:""Meeting Anne Sacoolas in the White house yesterday wouldn't have brought any healing to her or us."" ""We all accepted right from the off it was a tragic accident. She has to live with that"". Ms Charles called on Mrs Sacoolas to ""do the right thing and set an example to her children"". ""Come back to UK soil and face the justice system and then we can all sit in a room and then we can all start the healing process,"" she said. Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Speaking to journalists about the meeting, President Trump said: ""My meeting with the family, it was beautiful in a certain way."" Referring to Mrs Sacoolas he said: ""[Mrs Sacoolas] was in the room right out there, we met right here. ""I offered to bring the person in question in, and they weren't ready for it. ""I spoke with [Prime Minister] Boris [Johnson], he asked me if I'd do that, and I did it. ""Unfortunately they wanted to meet with her and unfortunately when we had everybody together they decided not to meet. ""Perhaps they had lawyers involved by that time, I don't know exactly."" Despite the couple's refusal, Mr Trump described their encounter as ""a very good meeting"" and said the Dunns were ""very nice people"". Referring to the crash, he said: ""I believe it [the car] was going down the wrong way and that happens in Europe - you go to Europe and the roads are opposite and it's very tough if you're from the United States. ""That decision to make a right turn when you're supposed to make a left turn when the roads are opposite and she said that's what happened. ""It happens to a lot of people, by the way - but she said that's what happened."" Mr Dunn said he felt the President was ""trying to do it right but it  didn't seem right"" to them . Harry Dunn's family threaten judicial review What is diplomatic immunity? US crash suspect's return 'non-negotiable' A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister and President spoke last Wednesday. ""The Prime Minister asked the President to do all he could to help resolve this tragic issue. The President agreed to work on trying to find a way forward."" Harry Dunn died on 27 August when his motorcycle crashed with a Volvo near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official stationed at the base - was interviewed by police but then returned to the United States after claiming diplomatic immunity. That status has since beencast into doubtby the Foreign Office and Mr Dunn's family want Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK. Family spokesman Radd Seiger said US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told the family during the meeting that Mrs Sacoolas ""was never coming back"" to the UK. Mrs Sacoolas was said to be covered by diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a US intelligence official, though that protection is now in dispute. Northamptonshire Police said it will be submitting a file to the Crown Prosecution Service ""very soon"" on the fatal collision that led to the Mr Dunn's death.

What are the backstop options?,"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

Jessops owner plans to call in administrators,"Peter Jones bought Jessops out of administration in 2013 Dragons Den star Peter Jones, who owns camera chain Jessops, plans to call in administrators to help secure the future of the High Street brand. Mr Jones bought the chain from administrators in 2013 after it collapsed under Â£81m of debt. While revenues have increased most years since then, profits fell to less than Â£10,000 last year. Now Mr Jones reportedly plans to seek a rescue deal for the firm's property arm, JR Prop Limited. The division has reported a steep increase in rental costs since 2017. High Street: How many UK shops have closed? Empty shops hit highest level for four years Now Mr Jones is reportedly planning to seek a rescue deal, known as a company voluntary agreement (CVA) with its landlords and lenders. This is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts and is often used as an opportunity to renegotiate rents. Sky News said theCVA was expected,externalto lead to store closures and rent cuts. But sources close to Jessops, which employs around 500 people, said Mr Jones still saw a future in the business and would not say how many of the chain's 46 stores were at risk of closure. This video can not be played Peter Jones: ""I've never been more excited about re-launching a business"" Mr Jones bought Jessops in March 2013, just months after it had gone into administration and closed its 187 stores. At the time, he said the chain would reopen some of its High Street shops to give it between 30 and 40 stores across the country. He told the BBC that he wanted the price charged in store to be the same as online. Asked then whether there really was a market for cameras that were not integrated into mobile phones, Mr Jones said: ""The amateur photographer, you wouldn't see them walking down the street taking that perfect picture with a mobile phone."" But interest did not live up to his expectations. He forecasted sales of at least Â£80m in the first year under his control. But he failed to turn around the group's performance and the firm reported lacklustre turnover of Â£57.9m for the period. However, in 2016, the firm's revenues did reach Â£80.3m. The next year they surpassed Â£95m before dipping slightly amid tough trading conditions on the High Street. The chain is the latest High Street brand to acknowledge tough trading conditions. Last year, big chains such as Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld collapsed and vanished altogether. Others such as Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look did restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of shops between them. Who is Peter Jones? The serial entrepreneur's first venture was to start a tennis coaching school, after spending his summers working at a tennis academy run by his English teacher That gave him a taste for the world of business and, in his 20s, he started a computer business. That allowed him ""a nice house, a BMW, a Porsche, and plenty of money to spend"", he later wrote But the good times didn't last forever and the firm went under after a number of its biggest customers went bust, forcing Mr Jones to move back in with his parents aged 29. He went to work for Siemens UK and a year later was running its UK computer business But he didn't remain an employee for long and in 1998, he started Phones International, which made him millions and earned him a seat as an investor on the BBC's Dragon Den On the show, he invested a total of Â£4,085,667 in firms including Levi Roots, known for its Reggae Reggae Sauce.

Northern rail could be nationalised,"The government is considering whether the management of the North of England's largest rail commuter service should be taken into public hands. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Northern's poor performance, with trains regularly arriving late or not at all, ""cannot continue"". Mr Shapps said he had issued a ""request for proposals"" from the firm and the Operator of Last Resort (OLR). This could lead to services being brought into direct government control. Giving evidence to the Commons' Transport Select Committee, Mr Shapps said: ""As a fellow long-suffering commuter, I entirely believe we cannot carry on just thinking it is OK for trains not to arrive, or Sunday services not to be in place. That has to change."" The Department for Transport confirmed it was developing contingency plans for the replacement of the current franchise ""with either a new short-term management contract with Northern or the Operator of Last Resort (OLR)"". ""In the context of significant challenges facing the operator, such as delays to infrastructure upgrades and historic underinvestment in the northern rail network, issuing a request for proposal enables the department to examine whether the contract is properly aligned with current operating challenges in the North,"" it said. ""It also allows us to determine whether the franchise owner or an OLR would be best placed to tackle these issues and deliver for passengers."" David Brown, managing director at Northern, said the firm had faced several challenges in the past couple of years, outside the direct control of Northern. The most significant of these is the continuing late delivery of major infrastructure upgrades, including the North West electrification, which is more than two years late. Mr Brown added: ""Arriva and Northern remain fully committed to delivering the transformation of the North's railways and improving customers' experience. We are delivering the biggest transformation of local rail for a generation."" This is another black mark for Britain's rail system. A second franchise, potentially brought under government control is not what Conservative ministers wanted. Labour will press its argument that the system is so broken that the same should happen to all train companies. But Northern (a large commuter network) is a much more complex franchise than the East Coast Mainline (intercity services) which the government took control of last year and rebranded LNER. For that reason the government is probably keen to stop short of the ""full public control"" option and take-on a more supervisory role, with Arriva (Northern's parent company) still in charge of the day-to-day. But several leading politicians argue Northern has failed and therefore should be removed wholesale from managing the franchise. Northern argues the system is at fault because delayed infrastructure upgrades (managed by publicly-owned Network Rail) have not allowed it to run the services passengers demand. There is no silver bullet to fixing the railways but the government-commissioned rail review will, in a matter of weeks, attempt to come up with answers. Northern, which is one of the biggest franchises in the country, has been in trouble for years. Industry sources have confirmed to the BBC that the train company, which is owned by Arriva, has been losing money for some time. Passenger numbers on Northern dropped after the botched introduction of new timetables in the summer of last year. Mr Shapps said: ""If you are northern, and you are a Northern passenger, you're as frustrated as I was in 2018. With Northern it has failed to recover."" On Friday, Transport for the North said it believed the franchise should be taken into public hands, via what is known as an Operator of Last Resort (OLR). The OLR is, on behalf of the government, currently in charge of London North East Railway, the East Coast Mainline intercity franchise. However, the OLR is not the only option for the government. It could also opt for what is known as a ""management contract"", which would mean that Arriva would still operate rail services, but the Department for Transport would adopt a much more hands-on role for the operation of the franchise. The OLR has been monitoring Northern for some time and any change to the operation of the franchise would take months to implement. A review of the railways in the UK is already under way. The Williams Review, led by former British Airways boss Keith Williams, is due to publish its findings in coming weeks. It is expected that the rail franchise system will be completely overhauled, a point mentioned in the Queen's Speech earlier this week.

Harry Dunn's parents reject 'bombshell' meeting,"This video can not be played Harry Dunn's parents say they were told by the president he would ""try to push this from a different angle"" Harry Dunn's parents rejected a ""bombshell"" offer from Donald Trump to meet the woman accused of involvement in their son's fatal crash. Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn said they felt ""a little ambushed"" when the president revealed Anne Sacoolas was in the next room at the White House. Mrs Sacoolas returned to the United States under diplomatic immunity days after the crash which killed Harry, 19. Harry's parents said they wanted to meet Mrs Sacoolas, 42, in the UK. Mr Dunn said a White House official told them she would not be returning to the UK, but Mr Trump said he would ""try to push this from a different angle"". Harry Dunn died on 27 August when his motorcycle crashed with a Volvo near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official stationed at the base - was interviewed by police but then returned to the United States after claiming diplomatic immunity. That status has since beencast into doubtby the Foreign Office and Mr Dunn's family want Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK. Speaking on CBS This Morning, Mr Dunn said the president had suggested the meeting with Mrs Sacoolas ""two or three times"". ""We said no, we didn't feel it was right. He said 'she's here, let's get it on, get some healing,' something like that,"" Mr Dunn told the US TV network. ""There was a bit of pressure but we stuck to our guns."" In a separate interview, Mr Dunn said: ""We didn't want to be railroaded into, not a circus as such, but into a meeting we weren't prepared for."" Ms Charles said they were ""a bit shocked"", adding: ""The bombshell was dropped soon after we walked in the room that Anne Sacoolas was in the building, and was willing to meet with us. ""I don't think it would be appropriate to meet her without therapists or mediators in the room."" Harry died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Family spokesman Radd Seiger described the White House meeting as ""absolutely extraordinary"" and ""unprecedented"".

US crash suspect's return 'non-negotiable' Ms Charles said she had told Mr Trump during the White House meeting: ""If it was your son you would be doing the same as us."" She added: ""He actually gripped my hand a little bit tighter and said 'yes I would be'. And that's when he said he would try and look at this from a different angle. ""I can only hope that he was sincere enough to consider doing that for us. ""He's the one in control here, but we're the ones in control of our situation as much as we can be - we still want justice for Harry and we will take it as far as we possibly can to ensure that that's done. ""We do feel that we have done as much as we can at the moment."" Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Ms Charles later told ITV's Good Morning Britain the family would ""be forever disappointed, forever disgusted in both the UK and US governments"" if Mrs Sacoolas did not return. Mr Dunn said the trip to the White House ""didn't feel like a stunt"". ""I think the president was very graceful and spoke very well to us,"" he said. ""I genuinely do think he will look to resolve this in a way that will help us."" Over the weekend, Mrs Sacoolas broke her silence over Mr Dunn's death in a letter via her lawyers. In it she said she wanted to meet his parents ""so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident"".

"UK's controversial 'porn blocker' plan droppedA plan to force porn sites to verify users' ages will be shelved, says Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan.Technology","The government has dropped a plan to use strict age verification checks to stop under-18s viewing porn online. It said the policy, which was initially set to launch in April 2018, would ""not be commencing"" after repeated delays, and fears it would not work. The so-called porn blocker would have forced commercial porn providers to verify users' ages, or face a UK ban. Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan said other measures would be deployed to achieve the same objectives. The government first mooted the idea of a porn blocker in 2015, with the aim of stopping youngsters ""stumbling across"" inappropriate content. Pornographic sites which failed to check the age of UK visitors would have faced being blocked by internet service providers. Government error hits porn age-check plan UK to introduce porn age-checks in July But critics warned that many under-18s would have found it relatively easy to bypass the restriction using virtual private networks (VPNs), which disguise their location, or could simply turn to porn-hosting platforms not covered by the law, such as Reddit or Twitter. Likewise, platforms which host pornography on a non-commercial basis - meaning they do not charge a fee or make money from adverts - would not have been affected. There were also privacy concerns, amid suggestions that websites could ask users to upload scans of their passports or driving licences. It was a plan, said ministers, to protect children from stumbling across pornography - an objective bound to be hugely popular with parents and anyone concerned about child safety.

Government drops controversial 'porn blocker' plan,"The government has dropped a plan to use strict age verification checks to stop under-18s viewing porn online. It said the policy, which was initially set to launch in April 2018, would ""not be commencing"" after repeated delays, and fears it would not work. The so-called porn blocker would have forced commercial porn providers to verify users' ages, or face a UK ban. Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan said other measures would be deployed to achieve the same objectives. The government first mooted the idea of a porn blocker in 2015, with the aim of stopping youngsters ""stumbling across"" inappropriate content. Pornographic sites which failed to check the age of UK visitors would have faced being blocked by internet service providers. Government error hits porn age-check plan UK to introduce porn age-checks in July But critics warned that many under-18s would have found it relatively easy to bypass the restriction using virtual private networks (VPNs), which disguise their location, or could simply turn to porn-hosting platforms not covered by the law, such as Reddit or Twitter. Likewise, platforms which host pornography on a non-commercial basis - meaning they do not charge a fee or make money from adverts - would not have been affected. There were also privacy concerns, amid suggestions that websites could ask users to upload scans of their passports or driving licences. It was a plan, said ministers, to protect children from stumbling across pornography - an objective bound to be hugely popular with parents and anyone concerned about child safety. But throughout its troubled life the porn block has met opposition from across the political spectrum. The critics said it was an attack on civil liberties, it was the government trying to censor the web, it could endanger privacy and any database of porn users would be a honeypot for scammers.

Extinction Rebellion begin legal fight over ban,"Hundreds defied the protest ban to gather in Trafalgar Square Celebrity Extinction Rebellion supporters have admitted in an open letter being ""hypocrites"" over their high-carbon lifestyles. But stars including Benedict Cumberbatch, who last week joined London protests, called for ""systemic change"" to the ""fossil-fuel economy"". It comes as Extinction Rebellion was granted permission to challenge a London-wide protest ban in court. Several demonstrators have been arrested as hundreds defied the ban. More than 100 celebrity supporters of Extinction Rebellion signedthe letter to the media,external, which urges the media to focus on ""the real story"" of the climate and ecological emergency. Spice Girl Mel B, comedian Steve Coogan, musician Bob Geldof, actor Sir Mark Rylance, model Lily Cole and Glastonbury's Emily Eavis, among others, all confessed their culpability in the climate crisis. 'I rebel so I can look my grandchildren in the eye' What does Extinction Rebellion want? Met 'stretched' by Extinction Rebellion protests The letter says: ""Dear journalists who have called us hypocrites. You're right. ""We live high carbon lives and the industries that we are part of have huge carbon footprints. ""Like you, and everyone else, we are stuck in this fossil-fuel economy and without systemic change, our lifestyles will keep on causing climate and ecological harm."" But they called on the media to focus on the ""more urgent story"" of life on earthdying in a sixth mass extinction. They said they cannot ignore the call of young people such as Greta Thunberg to ""fight for their already devastated future"", even if it means putting themselves ""in your firing line"". Meanwhile, theprime minister is to chair a new cabinet committee on climate changeto drive action to cut emissions across the government. Green groups have been calling for such top-level co-ordination - although they remain critical of other policy details. It comes as police have begun making arrests after Extinction Rebellion activists defied an order banning them from demonstrating anywhere in London. About 500 protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square, some of whom covered their mouths with black tape to symbolise the silencing of their protest. Within a couple of hours, the protest broke up and large numbers dispersed. Police arrested a small group who were blocking Whitehall, BBC correspondent Andy Moore said. Among those arrested were Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley and George Monbiot, the author and Guardian journalist. As he was arrested, Mr Monbiot said: ""We have to make a stand against the destruction of our life support systems."" Author George Monbiot was arrested after refusing to move from the road at Whitehall An application for a judicial review of the ban was accepted by the High Court, according to an Extinction Rebellion spokesman. It means the case can go ahead, with an initial hearing scheduled for Thursday. The claimants include the Green Party's Caroline Lucas and Baroness Jenny Jones, Labour MPs Clive Lewis and David Drew, and Mr Monbiot. Extinction Rebellion argues the ban is disproportionate and an unprecedented curtailment of the right to free speech and free assembly. The group hopes the High Court will quash the decision to implement the blanket ban. It follows the Metropolitan Police announcingnew restrictions under Section 14 of the Public Order Act,external, which required protesters to disperse by 21:00 BST or risk arrest. Any assembly of more than two people linked to the Extinction Rebellion action is now illegal in London. The force said it decided to impose the rules after ""continued breaches"" of conditions which limited the demonstrations to Trafalgar Square. More than 1,600 people have been arrested since the protests, dubbed the Autumn Uprising, began on October 7. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor, who is leading the policing of the demonstrations, said he was confident the Met's decision was ""entirely lawful"" and ""entirely proportionate"". Dozens of mothers and babies defied the ban to protest outside Google's London HQ The mothers wore sashes saying ""their future"" as they cradled their children A large group of protesters gathered outside YouTube's offices in London's King's Cross Also on Wednesday, a group of mothers and babies defied the restriction, staging a ""feed-in"" outside Google's offices in London's King's Cross, while other activists targeted the nearby offices of YouTube - a Google subsidiary. They said they wanted to highlight the company's political donations to organisations that have campaigned against action on climate change. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said concerns had been raised about the police's decision to ban the protests, adding that shadow home secretary Diane Abbott was discussing it with the police. ""I think it's important to protect the right of free speech, and the right to demonstrate in our society - obviously in a non-violent way,"" he said. He added that Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan had no involvement in the ""operational decision"" by police to remove the protesters. The Mayor of Woodbridge, Green Party member Eamonn O'Nolan, was part of the protest On Tuesday, Mr Khan said he was ""seeking further information"" about why the ban was necessary, saying he believed ""the right to peaceful and lawful protest must always be upheld"". A government spokesman said the UK was already taking ""world-leading action to combat climate change as the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely by 2050"". ""While we share people's concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt people's day-to-day lives,"" he added. Police have the powers to ban a protest under thePublic Order Act 1986,external, if a senior officer has reasonable belief that it may cause ""serious disruption to the life of the community"". Police are also under a duty to balance the task of keeping the streets open with the right freedom of assembly under Article 11 of theHuman Rights Act 1998,externaland freedom of expression, under Article 10. These rights are not absolute - the state can curtail them. However, the BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said: ""The test, if and when it gets to a human rights court battle, is whether police action was proportionate to the threat and only what was strictly necessary."" By law, the organiser of a public march must tell the police certain information in writing six days in advance. Police have the power to limit or change the route of the march or set other conditions. A Section 14 notice issued under the Public Order Act allows police to impose conditions on a static protest and individuals who fail to comply with these can be arrested.

Family threaten judicial review,"This video can not be played Harry Dunn suspect ""should do the right thing"" Harry Dunn's family are asking the government to turn over all documents it has about the diplomatic immunity status of the suspect in the teenager's death. Anne Sacoolas, 42, left the UK just days after a road crash which killed the 19-year-old motorcyclist. A Dunn family spokesman said if the advice was not disclosed they would launch a judicial review. Mr Dunn, 19, died near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Family spokesman Radd Seiger said their lawyers, Mark Stephens and Geoffrey Robertson QC, were ready to launch a full investigation into the role the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) played in the decision to grant immunity to Mrs Sacoolas. Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Mr Seiger said: ""What Mark [Stephens] and I are going to do, is we are going to write to the FCO very shortly, explaining that we don't want to do a judicial review, but to avoid that, please let us have the following documents - all e-mails, messages and notes in relation to your advice to Northamptonshire Police that this lady had it [diplomatic immunity]. ""What we don't know is whether somebody cocked up or whether they were put under pressure by the Americans to concede. ""But we want to conduct an investigation into the FCO's decision to advise Northamptonshire Police that this lady had the benefit of diplomatic immunity. ""If we're not satisfied, then we'll go to a judicial review and ask a High Court judge to review it all."" Radd Seiger (centre) is the spokesman for Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn On Monday, Harry's parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn gave interviews on US TV after flying to New York in a bid to publicise their case. They hope media exposure will put pressure on the US government to force Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK. Over the weekend Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official who was stationed at RAF Croughton - broke her silence over Mr Dunn's death in a letter via her lawyers. In it she said she wanted to meet his parents ""so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident"". Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mrs Sacoolas was said to be covered by diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a US intelligence official, though that protection is now in dispute. On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family to explain that the British and US governments now considered Mrs Sacoolas's immunity irrelevant. He said the matter was now ""in the hands"" of Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service. US crash suspect's return 'non-negotiable' What is diplomatic immunity? US diplomat's wife 'devastated' by death The letter was sent three days after a meeting between the Dunn family and Mr Raab, who was described as ""twitchy"" by Mr Seiger. ""He [Mr Raab] was stiff, he was cold, he was unpleasant, he was rude. Harry's parents described the meeting as ""terrible"" and said Mr Rabb was ""adamant that Mrs Sacoolas did have immunity"". ""We do not know what is going on but the matter is now in the hands of our legal team,"" they added.

The UK cities where rent is rising the fastest,"Nottingham recorded the fastest increase, the figures show The cost of renting a home rose fastest in Nottingham, Leeds and Bristol in the past year, research indicates, while Aberdeen recorded the biggest fall. The survey, from property website Zoopla, said tenants moving into a Nottingham home this summer paid 5.4% more in rent than a year earlier. Leeds and Bristol (up 4.5%) were the only other UK cities where rents rose faster than UK average wage growth. On average, renting a UK home has become more affordable, Zoopla said. Part of the reason lies in an increase in the number of people buying their first own home, relieving some of the pressure on the rental sector. Lettings fee ban brings cheer to tenants Flats out of fashion with first-time buyers Tenants moving in Aberdeen - where the local economy is affected significantly by the oil industry - saw rents drop by 4.1% in the third quarter of the year, compared with a year earlier. Coventry and Middlesbrough also saw renting become cheaper, according to the inaugural Zoopla quarterly rental report. Nearly three-quarters of 16 to 24-year-olds and almost half of 25 to 34-year-olds rent from a private landlord, according to the government's Family Resources Survey. The sector is concentrated in London, with about a third of rental properties in the UK found in the city. This is also where the typical rent per month is the most expensive. The Zoopla report suggests that the typical tenant in the UK spends nearly a third of their earnings on rent (31.8%), slightly less than the peak in 2016. Outside of London, tenants spent the highest proportion of earnings in Oxford, Brighton and Cambridge, with the lowest in Hull, Bradford and Stoke. UK-wide rental prices are up by an average of 2% in the last year, which is about half the typical level of wage rises. Amy moved to Bristol five years ago and has found renting in the city has become increasingly expensive. ""There's a much smaller pool of houses within my budget now,"" said the 28-year-old, who works full-time in insurance. ""I have had to move further away from the centre to find somewhere I can afford."" She has also had to compromise on space as it was too expensive to rent a flat on her own. ""I'm 28 - I should be living in my own place but instead I have to share,"" she said. Amy is moving house again later this month and said she spent months trying to find somewhere affordable, despite the fact her wages have gone up since she first moved to Bristol. ""You end up changing your whole lifestyle,"" she said. ""I've had to find other areas where I can cut my spending. ""I've been trying to save up to go back to university but I have had to put that on hold."" ""Renting is more affordable today than the 10-year average. [An increase in] first-time buyers, 80% of whom exit the private renting sector to buy, has also moderated rental demand,"" said Richard Donnell, of Zoopla, which has based the figures on its listings and other data. ""Rental affordability varies widely across the country, reflecting the relative strength of local economies."" Across the UK, homes take an average of 17 days to rent, based on the time between a listing being posted and removed. This is down from one year ago, when homes took 19 days to rent, and much shorter than the time it takes to sell a property. The typical tenant spent nearly four years in the same property, Mr Donnell said. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

"Brain-damaged Tafida, 5, arrives in Italy for care","Mohammed Raqeeb and Shelina Begum (centre) were given an official welcome outside Gaslini paediatric hospital A brain-damaged girl has arrived in Italy after her parents won a High Court battle to take her abroad for treatment. Five-year-old Tafida Raqeeb had been on life support at the Royal London Hospital since suffering a traumatic brain injury in February. Health bosses had tried to block attempts to take her to the Gaslini children's hospital in Genoa. Her mother said she was seeking Italian citizenship for her daughter. Shelina Begum and her husband Mohammed Raqeeb, from Newham, east London, were met outside the hospital in an official welcome organised by CitizenGo Italy, a community organisation which paid for Tafida's transfer. Dr Andrea Moscatelli is head of intensive care at Gaslini children's hospital and said what Tafida needs is time. ""We don't know if we can make her improve but if we optimise the support of the vital function we might give her the opportunity for a spontaneous recovery. ""Maybe just a little bit. Even if we find it very unlikely because the brain injury is devastating,"" he said. Specialists at the Royal London Hospital believe Tafida Raqeeb has no chance of recovery At a press conference, Mrs Begum thanked the hospital for ""believing in my daughter's recovery"". ""I visited Tafida this morning, she is stable, she was awake, fully awake, turning her head from side to side,"" she said ""I am feeling emotionally drained. I think I will burst into tears very soon."" Do hospitals or parents of sick children get to decide? Girl 'will suffer if life support continues' Brain-damaged girl's mum 'doesn't trust UK medics' She added: ""I just believe that since Tafida is in Italy it will be wise for her to have Italian citizenship."" Tafida was transferred by air ambulance via Genoa's Cristoforo Colombo airport Mrs Begum said the family was crowdfunding for Tafida's treatment but added it had sponsors in place and the money ""should not run out"". UK specialists had previously argued any further treatment of Tafida, who suffered a brain haemorrhage, would be futile. Bosses at Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital in Whitechapel, had said ending Tafida's life support was in her best interests. By Fergus Walsh, BBC health correspondent in Genoa The treatment in Genoa is centred on keeping Tafida alive. But doctors here say although Tafida has suffered devastating brain damage they cannot rule out some small spontaneous recovery in the months ahead. Dr Andrea Moscatelli denied his team was giving Tafida's parents false hope. The Genoa medical team told the High Court they did not foresee any therapies that might improve Tafida's neurological condition. But doctors now intend to give Tafida a tracheostomy - meaning she'll have a tube inserted in her windpipe, connected to a ventilator - which will hopefully allow her to be cared for at home by her parents. Tafida - deemed by the High Court to have minimal awareness and being unable to feel pain - has a sleep-wake cycle and opens and closes her eyes. Doctors in London had argued it was near-impossible for Tafida to derive any benefit from continued life and she should be allowed the ""dignity of dying peacefully"". Tafida's parents, both practising Muslims, argued Islamic law said only God could take the decision to end her life.

School mobile phone ban relaxed to 'ease friction',"This video can not be played Two schools in Wales are taking different approaches to the use of mobile phones A ban on mobile phones in school caused ""friction"" and detracted from pupils' education, a head teacher has said. Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi in Holyhead, Anglesey, has now relaxed the ban and uses phones as a ""powerful"" educational tool. Head teacher Adam Williams said he had not seen any deterioration in pupil behaviour or wellbeing. The Welsh Government said mobile phone use was a matter for individual schools. It comes amidconcerns mobile phone use is affecting wellbeingand concentration. Tom Crick, chairman of the group advising the Welsh Government on science and technology in the new curriculum, said an outright ban ""could send the wrong message"" in efforts to develop digital skills. ""It's a really contentious issueâ¦ the evidence base is not immediately clear,"" the professor of digital education at Swansea University said. ""The problem with doing research in these areas is... it's very hard to attribute the impact of a specific device and [show] a direct correlation with academic performance."" He added it was difficult to have a blanket approach across all schools because of different challenges and catchment areas. Pupils prepare to take an online quiz to help their teacher check their understanding of a lesson When the ban was in place, pupils had to keep phones out of sight. ""We spent too much time challenging children for using phones during the day and that took time from things which were more important - the child's education,"" said Mr Williams. ""Also it created a negative atmosphere during the day."" After consultation, they relaxed the policy and now some teachers bring smartphones into use in the class. ""I think as a school, we've got a responsibility to teach our students how to use technology effectively... and prepare our students for the world of work."" Social media has 'little effect on girls' wellbeing' Social media 'disrupting teens' sleep and exercise' 15-year-old Harrison says he learns better through watching videos than copying things down Pupil Harrison, 15, has found it beneficial in many ways: ""We can check our progress. We can see homework that needs to be handed in and we can just do revision at break times or when we have free lessons. ""My parents think it's a good idea because they can see if I need more help at home and they can track what I'm doing."" He likes using educational videos ""to learn through listening and watching things rather than copying things down"" and Kahoot, an app which provides a quick way for teachers to quiz pupils to check their learning. Mr Williams said he had not seen any negative impact on pupil wellbeing and nearly all children have a smartphone, with devices being shared to make sure no one misses out. At Llangatwg Community School, head teacher Alan Rowlands uses a walkie talkie to communicate with staff after banning mobiles Llangatwg Community School just outside Neath encourages children to use technology ""where appropriate"", but in September they banned phones - teachers now use walkie-talkies to communicate. Head teacher Alan Rowlands said: ""What we were finding as a school was the overreliance on mobile phones was affecting children's concentration levels, affecting their communication with each other and we really asked ourselves the serious question what is the purpose of a mobile phone in school?"" Children are allowed to have phones turned off in their bags, but they are not allowed to be seen during the school day. ""Some of us felt it would be difficult to implement, however... the children seem very much on board,"" Mr Rowlands said. French MPs back ban on mobile phone use in schools Phone bans 'improve school exam results' Head boy and head girl Benjamin and Annalise said pupils talk to each other more and listen better after the ban Head boy and Year 11 pupil Benjamin said children were listening more, while head girl Annalise, 15, said it was ""100 times better now"" and no longer thinks about checking her texts or social media. ""I used to walk in the canteen, everyone was on their phones, and no one's socialising, they were used excessivelyâ¦ People are now interacting,"" she added. Mr Rowlands found the policy change ""liberating"" and said while it may seem counterintuitive to remove technology from the classroom, the school had seen benefits in communication between pupils and staff. Many schools have a policy that mobiles should be switched off during lessons, but some - such as Aberconwy School in Conwy, allow their use at break times. Stanwell School in Penarth has a total ban on electronic devices of any sort and they cannot be brought to school unless officially authorised. The Welsh Government said it did not issue guidance on the use of mobile phones, as ""it is a matter for individual schools"" but the effect on learning and wellbeing should be considered. ""Teachers already have the power to restrict the use of phones and we recognise that, where managed properly, phones can be used effectively in classrooms as learning tool,"" a spokesman said. The UK government policy is that it is the responsibility of head teachers to determine on how phones should be used. Last year, the then-UK culture secretary Matt Hancock saidhe admired schoolsthat had enforced mobile phone bans. NASUWT said schools should have clear and robust phone and social media policies. Its official in Wales, Neil Butler, said: ""Too often pupils are distracted from learning by constantly checking their phones and messaging. No pupil needs constant access to their phone during lessons."" Sarah Hannafin, senior policy adviser for the National Association for Head Teachers, said the union supported school autonomy on the issue: ""Outright banning mobile phones can cause more problems than it solves, making problems less visible and obvious for schools to tackle.""

'Send nudes' Boohoo ad banned after complaint,"Boohoo said the word ""nudes"" referred to a beige jacket a model was wearing UK fashion company Boohoo has been told one of its emailed advertisements must not use the phrase ""Send nudes"". The company put the phrase in a message sent to promote a range of clothes coloured to resemble skin. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld a complaint about the advert because it made light of a ""potentially harmful social trend"". Boohoo has also been told to make sure its advertising is ""socially responsible"". In its ruling, the ASA said it knew the term ""nude"" was often used in the fashion world to refer to colours similar to skin tones. But it said the phrase ""Send nudes"" was more likely to be interpreted as a harassing request for sexual photos rather than as a reference to a range of clothes. As well as the words appearing across an image inside the emailed advert, the phrase also formed the message's subject line. The ASA said: ""Increased pressure to share such photos had been linked to negative outcomes for young people."" And the market Boohoo targeted probably meant the advert had reached children - especially those who wanted to dress like a ""slightly older age group"". Boohoo said: ""We note the ASA's ruling and recognise our obligations to ensure that advertising is socially responsible."" In a separate ruling, the ASA banned a video advert for clothing company Missguided, broadcast in June, which ""objectified women"". Missguided said the advert, featuring women assuming a series of seductive poses in swimwear and other summer clothes, served to promote a ""particular lifestyle"" rather than just clothing. And the ""display of skin was relevant, necessary and unavoidable"" given the ad was for beach-wear. The ASA disagreed and said the images were ""highly sexualised"" and some of the women depicted in the poses were not wearing the clothes Missguided said it was promoting. The ad was likely to cause ""serious offence"" to some people, it said. Missguided has been told not to run the ad again and must guard against creating similar content that ""objectifies women"".

London couple accused over adopted son's murder,"This video can not be played Asian Network reporter Poonam Taneja asks Arti Dhir about the murder of her adopted son A couple living in London are facing calls to be extradited to India over allegations they arranged for the murder of their adopted son for profit. Arti Dhir, 55, and Kaval Raijada, 30, from west London, deny arranging to have 11-year-old Gopal Sejani killed for an insurance pay-out in 2017. Britain has so far rejected requests to extradite the couple to face trial in India on human rights grounds. However, the Indian government has been granted leave to appeal the decision. The husband and wife, from Hanwell, had travelled to Keshod, a town in Gujarat, to adopt an orphan in 2015. According to court documents, Indian authorities say the couple placed an advert in a local newspaper, promising they would take an adopted child to live in London. The couple then met Gopal, a farm boy who was living with his older sister and her husband, Harsukh Kardani. Kaval Raijada is also accused of the double murder The pair, who were his guardians, agreed to the adoption, believing the child would have a better life in the UK. They began preparing adoption papers. However, Indian police claim Ms Dhir and Mr Raijada - who had no children of their own - had other plans. Authorities in India say Ms Dhir took out an insurance policy in Gopal's name. The policy was worth approximately Â£150,000 and would pay out after 10 years, or in the event of his death. According to the documents, she made two premium payments, each of Â£15,000. ""After a few days she took out an insurance policy in his name,"" Superintendent Saurab Singh of Junagadh Police, in Gujarat, told the BBC. ""It was a huge amount and she paid two premiums, knowing very well that in the event of Gopal's death, she would be paid 10 times the insured amount."" Gopal Sejani was murdered by a gang on motorbikes The couple returned home to London but Gopal never made it to the UK. He remained in Gujarat while visa papers were arranged for him. On 8 February 2017, he was abducted by two men on motorbikes, stabbed and left by a road in Gujarat. His brother-in-law, Mr Kardani, was also attacked as he tried to defend the boy. Both died of their injuries in hospital later that month. Indian authorities say two previous attempts had been made against the boy's life, but both failed. The insurance policy never paid out. Officers in India arrested a suspect who they said was a friend of the couple and had spent time with them as a student in London. He is one of four men who have been arrested in India for alleged involvement in the crime. The investigations are ongoing. Ms Dhir and Mr Raijada, who face six charges in India, including conspiracy to murder and kidnapping, were arrested in the UK in June 2017 after a request from the Indian government. However, on 2 July this year, a judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court refused their extradition on human rights grounds. Harsukh Kardani was also killed in the attack In her judgment, Senior District Judge Emma Arbuthnot, found there was sufficient evidence to justify their extradition as there was a ""circumstantial prima facie case that Ms Dhir and Mr Raijada acting together and with others committed the offences"". But because the penalty for double murder in Gujarat is life in prison without parole, she ruled extradition would have been contrary to the couple's human rights under UK law. She said if extradited, the pair could be given ""an irreducible sentence"" and a lack of a review would be ""inhuman and degrading"". The Indian authorities have been granted an appeal, which is expected to be heard in the new year. Commenting on the case, Nick Vamos, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service's extradition team, said the decision had been made because there was no prospect of release, even in exceptional compassionate circumstances. Superintendent Saurab Singh wants the couple to be extradited to India Outside the couple's west London home, the BBC tried to question Ms Dhir about the case and why she was refusing to travel to India to stand trial. She refused to respond. Both Ms Dhir and Mr Raijada deny the allegations. According to the court papers, they say there is ""no prima facie case against them"". The couple remain on bail pending an appeal. Superintendent Singh added: ""We are trying our best. This is a very serious offence that has taken place in India. ""We want the two accused to be brought here to face trial in an Indian court as per the Indian laws, and for this we are trying our best to assist the UK court."" If the appeal fails, the chief magistrate said it was ""not impossible"" the couple could be prosecuted in the UK, if there was evidence that an agreement to murder was made in this country.

"Child, 4, among 1,383 pupils caught with weapons","More than a thousand children were caught with weapons in school last year, according to a survey of 29 police forces in England and Wales. The weapons included knives, blades, knuckledusters and a Taser stun gun, the Press Association survey found. The children included a 14-year-old with a sword and a four-year-old with an unnamed weapon. Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said the findings were ""grim but unsurprising"". The survey, which follows concern about rising levels of knife crime, was based on Freedom of Information data from police forces. It found schoolchildren involved in incidents with many different types of bladed weapon, including lock knives, penknives, craft knives and garden shears. In Bedfordshire, a pupil was caught in possession of a machete and in Manchester a samurai sword was recovered from school premises. Thames Valley police discovered a bayonet in a school and in the West Midlands, a 15-year-old was found in possession of an axe. The figures showed 1,072 incidents involving weapons, up from 831 in the same areas in the previous year - but did not include statistics from the biggest force, the Metropolitan Police in London. The data was based on the financial year - and the survey found another 311 incidents between April and August 2019. ""Serious violence is a growing problem amongst young people and we continue to work closely with partners to address this,"" said Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney, lead for young people on the National Police Chiefs' Council. Police in schools increase after knife crimes Surgeons who want young people to touch knife crime Losing a loved one to knife crime ""Police involvement in schools, whether it be officers delivering talks and interactive sessions or based in schools themselves as part of the Safer Schools Partnership, helps us to educate young people and explain why carrying a weapon is never the right choice."" But Lucy Martindale, a youth worker from south London who campaigns against knife violence, said: ""The situation is getting worse, even just this year. ""Some young people I speak to say before they leave the house - where most people check they have picked up their keys and wallet or purse - they check they have their knives with them."" Mr Barton, general secretary of the ASCL head teachers' union, said this is a problem that schools cannot tackle on their own and called for more community support and ""investment in policing"". ""The scourge of weapons has grown worse in recent years, and while there are a number of complex factors involved, a key issue has been cuts in policing and local support services for vulnerable families. ""Gangs have filled this vacuum and often pressure and groom young people into dealing drugs and carrying weapons,"" Mr Barton said. A Department for Education spokesman said Â£10m had been invested in ""behaviour hubs"" to share information between schools on improving discipline. ""We have strengthened teachers' powers so they can take action if they suspect a pupil has brought a prohibited item, including knives, into school.""

Sturgeon says indyref2 'must happen next year'The SNP leader tells her party's conference that Westminster has 'no right' to block a Scottish independence referendum.,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""My call is that the referendum must happen next year"" A second referendum on Scottish independence ""must happen next year"", Nicola Sturgeon has told the SNP conference. Ms Sturgeon confirmed that she will ask the UK government for formal consent by the end of this year. She said Westminster had ""no right"" to block the request, and its opposition to indyref2 is ""not sustainable"". But she stressed any referendum had to be legal if the result was to be recognised internationally. She said this was because her aim was not merely to deliver a referendum - but to deliver independence. Could social care charges be abolished? Brian Taylor: 'A faintly surreal SNP conference' SNP conference: Three questions facing the party SNP 'winning independence economic argument' Ms Sturgeon, who is Scotland's first minister, told delegates at the conference in Aberdeen: ""My call is that the referendum must happen next year. ""And we are getting ready. By the new year, we will have completed our legislative preparations. We are already working to update the independence prospectus. ""And I can confirm today that before the end of this year, I will demand the transfer of power that puts the legality of a referendum beyond any doubt."" The UK government has repeatedly said it will not grant a Section 30 order, which was used to ensure the legality of the independence referendum in 2014 in which Scottish voters opted to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%. Delegates overwhelmingly rejected an attempt to have Plan B debated when the SNP conference opened on Sunday This has led to calls for Ms Sturgeon to outline a so-called Plan B, with some activists and elected politicians arguing that the SNP winning a majority of Scottish seats in an election would be enough for independence negotiations to begin with the UK government. Others have called for an unofficial referendum to be held, similar to the disputed one in Catalonia in 2017 - while the Scottish government's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, has not ruled out the possibility of a legal challenge to the UK's government's position. SNP election win 'could be independence mandate' But Ms Sturgeon told the conference that the question should not be what the SNP will do if Westminster refuses to agree to a Section 30. She said: ""The question should be demanded of the Westminster parties - what gives you any right to deny people in Scotland our ability to choose our own future? ""The Westminster refusal is not sustainable. We can already see the cracks appearing. ""Just like us, they know there is going to be a referendum. And they know that when there is, Scotland will choose independence."" However, she again stressed that the process ""must be legal"" and must ""allow majority support to be expressed clearly and unambiguously"". She added: ""It must have the recognition of the international community. Why? Because our job is not just to deliver a referendum. Our job is to deliver independence."" Large pro-independence marches have been held across Scotland in recent months Analysis by polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice It is very clear that the SNP now want an early independence referendum, and they are clearly buoyed up by polls that show something of an increase of support for independence - not least among those who voted Remain. But let's just bear in mind the polls are at best saying 50% support for independence. We're still a very long way from the position that we were told not so long ago that the SNP would want to see opinion polls consistently, over a considerable period of time, saying 60% support before they would take the prospect of another referendum. Holding an early referendum is potentially a very risky project. In particular, I think there's a crucial question that the circumstance under which a second referendum might actually happen are ones that are perhaps rather different from the current political circumstances. If we accept - as Nicola Sturgeon implied - that a referendum is only to happen if we get a hung parliament, well, the hung parliament implies that Boris Johnson no longer prime minister so that reason for independence disappears. But also it probably implies that we may have had another referendum on EU membership which might have come up with a different result and therefore Brexit is no longer a potential rallying call for independence. Any Westminster party that wants SNP support if there is a hung Parliament after a general election should not pick up the phone if they ""don't respect Scotland's right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing"". The Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats should apologise for the ""broken promises"" they made ahead of the 2014 independence referendum. Brexit will ""continue to dominate Westminster for years to come"" regardless of whether the UK leaves the EU with or without a deal. SNP MPs will never vote for any Brexit deal that takes Scotland ""out of the EU, out of the single market and out of the customs union."" Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would introduce a new law to establish emergency protective orders which would help to ensure that it is the perpetrators of domestic violence rather than the victims who lose their homes. She said: ""We need to change the reality that for women and their children, often the only way to escape an abuser is to flee their home. For too many, that results in the victims of abuse becoming homeless."" Ms Sturgeon also announced that the SNP will scrap non-residential social care charges for all if she is still first minister after the Holyrood election in 2021. And she said her party would pledge to expand childcare into the school holidays for primary pupils from the poorest backgrounds in its election manifesto. Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw said the answer from Downing Street to Ms Sturgeon's request for a Section 30 order should be an ""unequivocal no"". And he claimed Ms Sturgeon ""simply wanted to get through what was a potentially hostile conference with a series of vacuous promises which will never be kept, and throw some red meat to the hardliners"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said Ms Sturgeon plan would mean ""more division and uncertainty"" and could result in a hard border between Scotland and England. And Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Deomcrats, said independence would be ""bad for Scotland just like Brexit because breaking up long-term economic partnerships is very hard to do"".

Asos profits plunge in 'disappointing' year,"Profits at Asos have plunged after warehouse problems led to what the online fashion retailer said was a ""disappointing"" year. Over the last year, Asos has installed more robots in its European warehouses and expanded its facilities in the US. But the speed of growth hit profits, which dropped almost 70% falling to Â£33.1m for the year. ""With the benefit of hindsight, we were not adequately prepared for the additional complexities,"" Asos said. The company said it ""lost focus"" on key areas like ""product, presentation and customer engagement"". ""The transformation has been huge and we underestimated the impacts of large scale operational change being executed on two continents simultaneously,"" it said in a statement. Despite the drop in profits, sales rose 13% in the year to the end of August. Animal print, broderie and satin styles had been particularly popular, the firm said. Asos has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years as it has benefited from the shift towards shopping online. However, last December it surprised investors with a shock profit warning. In July, the online retailer said it expected full year profits to be between Â£30m and Â£35m, well below the Â£55m forecast by analysts at the time. The firm's stock price has more than halved over the past year. Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, called Wednesday's drop in profits ""inevitable"" as he said the firm was ""caught in the vice of competitive price cuts and rising costs"". ""Chief executive Nick Beighton candidly admits that Asos underestimated the cost and complexity of becoming an international player,"" he said. ""But the halcyon days when Asos had the online fashion marketplace to itself are in the past. It will be a hard slog getting profits back to last year's Â£100m."" However, investors welcomed Wednesday's announcement sending the company's share price up by as much as 17% in early trading.

What is Johnson's Brexit plan?,"Boris Johnson hasoutlined his plan to the European Union (EU),externalto avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Mr Johnson said the plan ""removes the so-called backstop"". The backstop is the insurance policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU. It is designed to avoid any physical border infrastructure, which it is feared would bring back memories of the Troubles, after Brexit. It would keep the UK in the same customs territory as the EU, and Northern Ireland closely tied to EU regulations - until the UK and the EU reach a trade deal. But it would stop the UK striking its own trade deals, which is why so many Conservative MPs, including Mr Johnson, oppose the backstop. So, what is his alternative? The government wants the UK to leave the EU customs union. This would mean Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ending up in two different customs territories. This means lorries entering the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland will need to complete customs declarations. This is to ensure the correct tariffs (tax on imports) are paid when UK goods enter the EU customs union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Reality Check's Chris Morris:From the beginning the EU has struggled to see how Ireland and Northern Ireland can exist in different customs territories while keeping the border as open as it is now under all circumstances. They will argue that - in the absence of a future free trade deal - this proposal means the UK is breaking commitments it has made about the border. The UK counters that the backstop has already been rejected in Parliament three times, and something needs to change. Instead of installing customs posts and other physical infrastructure at the Irish border, the UK says declarations should be done electronically. The government says physical checks would still be needed ""on a very small proportion of movements"". Currently, about one in 100 consignments entering the EU customs union are inspected to check that the goods match the information on the declaration. These inspections could be carried out at warehouses or ""designated locations, which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland."" The government's proposal does not spell out what these ""designated locations"" would look like, but it adds there should be ""a firm commitment (by both parties) never to conduct checks at the border in future"". Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? If adopted, a border solution relying on technology and remote checks would be a first. The EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has previously rejected a customs solution that relies on technology. Back in January, Sabine Weyand, the EU's director-general for trade, said: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" The government says that some small traders should be exempt from paying duty. However, the document does not address smuggling head on. In other words, what will be done to detect and prevent traders, who should be paying duty, from crossing the border without completing custom declarations first? Reality Check's Chris Morris:The EU will see much of this as a rehash of previous ideas that it doesn't think will work. And many people will worry that unspecified ""designated locations"" could become targets for anyone seeking to undermine the Northern Ireland peace process. The EU will push back hard against suggestions that it needs to revise its own customs rules to suit the UK. When it comes to the regulation of goods, Northern Ireland would keep to the rules of the EU's single market, rather than UK rules. That removes the need for product standard and safety checks on goods at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it creates the need for checks between the rest of the UK - which will not be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland.. All agricultural, food or animal products entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will have to go through a Border Inspection Post. That's a bit of infrastructure where goods can be physically examined and paperwork checked. Manufactured goods in Northern Ireland would also have to keep to EU rules, and these goods would be checked ""at the boundary of the zone"" - presumably at crossings between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, on the Irish Sea. Reality Check's Chris Morris:This is quite a big concession from the UK side - basically accepting that there would have to be quite intrusive checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for a number of years, on things like product standards and food safety. The EU has always said there have to be checks carried out somewhere, and both sides will try to deny any suggestion that this amounts to a new border in the Irish Sea. Having Northern Ireland following EU rules for the production of goods over which it has no say is, as the document says, ""a significant democratic problem"". As a result, it is proposed that the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive will have to sign off on the plan before it takes effect. The Northern Irish institutions will be asked to approve the plan again every four years, and if they do not then Northern Ireland would stop following EU rules one year later. The Northern Ireland Assembly has not met since early 2017. Reality Check's Chris Morris:The issue of democratic legitimacy is a crucial one, but it cannot be applied unevenly. The EU is likely to have a problem with anything which suggests that only Northern Ireland could have - in effect - a veto on this plan. The point of the backstop was to provide a legal guarantee to keep an open border under all circumstances. Being subject to approval every four years simply isn't the same thing. If Northern Ireland voted to leave this arrangement things like checks on food safety would have to take place at the Irish border. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Warren under attack in US Democratic debate,"This video can not be played WATCH: Warren evades questions about tax rises - and her rivals pile on US Democratic White House front-runner Elizabeth Warren has been fiercely attacked by rivals in a live TV debate. They accused the senator of refusing to say whether she would raise taxes. Two other front-runners were also feeling the heat. Joe Biden denied any wrongdoing in Ukraine, while Bernie Sanders sought to allay health doubts after a heart attack this month. The Democratic winner will take on President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the November 2020 election. The debate in the electoral battleground state of Ohio was the most crowded so far in the Democratic race - with all 12 White House hopefuls squaring off in the primetime forum. Snapping at the heels of the pack leaders, Pete Buttigieg - mayor of the town of South Bend in Indiana - California Senator Kamala Harris and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar came out fighting on Tuesday night. Who were the debate winners and losers? Joe Biden's son defends business dealings The Trump impeachment story explained Ocasio-Cortez 'to endorse Sanders for president' Also on stage were New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, former Obama housing secretary Julian Castro, Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and billionaire activist Tom Steyer. Time is running out for the lower-tier contenders to make an impression. The Democratic White House race officially begins with the Iowa caucuses on 3 February. The pack will be whittled down in state-by-state votes until a final candidate is crowned at the party convention next July. Ms Warren found a bullseye on her back after surging to the top of the field over the past two months. Both Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, and Ms Warren favour free healthcare for all Americans through ""Medicare for All"" - a government-run health insurance plan that would transform the US healthcare system. Some analysts have said the system could cost $32 trillion (Â£25 trillion) over a decade. But unlike Mr Sanders, Ms Warren has repeatedly avoided stating explicitly whether her version of the policy would raise taxes on working families. She was pressed on the issue by debate moderators and replied that she would not sign any bill that hiked costs on the middle class. Are voters biased against women candidates? Mr Buttigieg rounded on her, saying: ""You heard it tonight - a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. ""This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular."" Even Ms Warren's progressive ally Mr Sanders took a veiled jab, saying: ""I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up."" Ms Klobuchar pounced: ""At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and taxes are going to go up."" Mr Biden took a pop at both Ms Warren and Mr Sanders. ""Both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for All,"" he said. ""Now look, here's the deal, come on, it costs 30 trillion dollars!"" Ms Warren did not appear flustered under the repeated attacks, focusing on her policy prescriptions for ending income inequality. Mr Biden was asked about Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims that the former US vice-president improperly tried to aid his son Hunter Biden's business interests in Ukraine. ""My son did nothing wrong,"" replied Mr Biden, whose once commanding lead in opinion polls has been slipping. ""I did nothing wrong."" He was pressed by the debate moderator on whether he made a mistake while he was the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine by allowing his son to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Hunter Biden defends Ukraine and China business dealings What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Mr Biden replied that he never discussed ""a single thing"" about Ukraine with his son. Meanwhile, his rivals refrained from attacking him about it. It was the first debate since congressional Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Mr Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. Every candidate on stage backed the investigation, which may seek to remove the president from office, railing against Mr Trump's ""criminality"" and ""corruption"". It's the largest number on a single stage in this debate series - 12 Elizabeth Warren knew she was going to take some shots now that she's reached the top of the pack. She was not wrong. Once again, her refusal to acknowledge that her universal healthcare plan raises some taxes was targeted by the more moderate candidates. She doggedly refused to be pinned down, but for once the attacks - particularly from Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar - felt like they had more bite. She can keep dancing, but her weakness here isn't going away - and could become a real problem in a general election. Despite this, she had her share of memorable lines. Her early support for Donald Trump's impeachment helped give her answer on the topic - that ""impeachment is the way that we establish that no one will be able to break the law over and over again without consequences"" - extra punch. Her defence of a wealth tax, saying that she prefers to invest in a generation of Americans and not ""protect billionaires"", will resonate with many Democrats. And when Joe Biden spoke about his efforts to get votes for Ms Warren's financial reform legislation in 2009, she pointedly praised Barack Obama - and not the vice-president - for his support. It was a subtle way of prying Mr Biden away from his embrace of Mr Obama's political legacy. Read Anthony's analysis in full Mr Sanders was closely watched for signs of fatigue in the three-hour debate after he suffered a heart attack earlier this month. The oldest contender at 78, Mr Sanders has dropped into third place in the polls. ""I'm healthy,"" the self-described democratic socialist told a moderator who questioned his fitness. ""I'm feeling great."" In a touching gesture, he added: ""Let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including so many of my colleagues up here for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes."" In a major boost for Mr Sanders's support among younger liberals, his campaign aides briefed reporters that he would be endorsed on Saturday by progressive firebrand congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A watch party at a bar in West Hollywood, California Mr Biden was also asked by the moderators about his age - he would turn 80 during his first term as US president. ""One of the reasons I am running is because of my age and my experience,"" he replied. ""With it comes wisdom. ""We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies."" His reply will be interpreted as an implicit put-down of his younger challengers such as Mr Buttigieg, 37, Mr Yang, 44, and Mr Castro, 45. The key issues for the candidates In one of the most aggressive exchanges of the night, Mr Buttigieg and Mr O'Rourke clashed over firearms policy. This video can not be played America's gun laws explained in 2017 Mr O'Rourke was challenged by a moderator on his plan to remove assault-style weapons from private ownership under a so-called mandatory gun buyback. When Mr Buttigieg said Mr O'Rourke did not know how he was going to take weapons off the streets, the Texan implied the young mayor was in thrall to ""consultants and the focus groups"". Mr Buttigieg, a military veteran, hit back: ""I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal."" Mr O'Rourke countered that it was ""slap in the face"" to victims of gun violence when his idea was disparaged by Mr Buttigieg as ""a shiny object"". About 40% of Americans say they own a gun or live in a household with one,according to a 2017 survey.,externalThe right to bear arms is enshrined in the US constitution, and gun control is among the most divisive issues in the country. Election day is still more than a year away but the race to become the Democratic challenger to Mr Trump is already well under way. The latest polling suggests Ms Warren and Mr Biden are the front-runners, while Mr Sanders is also a popular contender.

More children caught bringing knives into school,"More than a thousand children were caught with weapons in school last year, according to a survey of 29 police forces in England and Wales. The weapons included knives, blades, knuckledusters and a Taser stun gun, the Press Association survey found. The children included a 14-year-old with a sword and a four-year-old with an unnamed weapon. Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said the findings were ""grim but unsurprising"". The survey, which follows concern about rising levels of knife crime, was based on Freedom of Information data from police forces. It found schoolchildren involved in incidents with many different types of bladed weapon, including lock knives, penknives, craft knives and garden shears. In Bedfordshire, a pupil was caught in possession of a machete and in Manchester a samurai sword was recovered from school premises. Thames Valley police discovered a bayonet in a school and in the West Midlands, a 15-year-old was found in possession of an axe. The figures showed 1,072 incidents involving weapons, up from 831 in the same areas in the previous year - but did not include statistics from the biggest force, the Metropolitan Police in London. The data was based on the financial year - and the survey found another 311 incidents between April and August 2019. ""Serious violence is a growing problem amongst young people and we continue to work closely with partners to address this,"" said Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney, lead for young people on the National Police Chiefs' Council. Police in schools increase after knife crimes Surgeons who want young people to touch knife crime Losing a loved one to knife crime ""Police involvement in schools, whether it be officers delivering talks and interactive sessions or based in schools themselves as part of the Safer Schools Partnership, helps us to educate young people and explain why carrying a weapon is never the right choice."" But Lucy Martindale, a youth worker from south London who campaigns against knife violence, said: ""The situation is getting worse, even just this year. ""Some young people I speak to say before they leave the house - where most people check they have picked up their keys and wallet or purse - they check they have their knives with them."" Mr Barton, general secretary of the ASCL head teachers' union, said this is a problem that schools cannot tackle on their own and called for more community support and ""investment in policing"". ""The scourge of weapons has grown worse in recent years, and while there are a number of complex factors involved, a key issue has been cuts in policing and local support services for vulnerable families. ""Gangs have filled this vacuum and often pressure and groom young people into dealing drugs and carrying weapons,"" Mr Barton said. A Department for Education spokesman said Â£10m had been invested in ""behaviour hubs"" to share information between schools on improving discipline. ""We have strengthened teachers' powers so they can take action if they suspect a pupil has brought a prohibited item, including knives, into school.""

School mobile phone ban relaxed to 'ease friction'A head teacher says the ban detracted from pupils' education - but other schools take a different view.Wales,"This video can not be played Two schools in Wales are taking different approaches to the use of mobile phones A ban on mobile phones in school caused ""friction"" and detracted from pupils' education, a head teacher has said. Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi in Holyhead, Anglesey, has now relaxed the ban and uses phones as a ""powerful"" educational tool. Head teacher Adam Williams said he had not seen any deterioration in pupil behaviour or wellbeing. The Welsh Government said mobile phone use was a matter for individual schools. It comes amidconcerns mobile phone use is affecting wellbeingand concentration. Tom Crick, chairman of the group advising the Welsh Government on science and technology in the new curriculum, said an outright ban ""could send the wrong message"" in efforts to develop digital skills. ""It's a really contentious issueâ¦ the evidence base is not immediately clear,"" the professor of digital education at Swansea University said. ""The problem with doing research in these areas is... it's very hard to attribute the impact of a specific device and [show] a direct correlation with academic performance."" He added it was difficult to have a blanket approach across all schools because of different challenges and catchment areas. Pupils prepare to take an online quiz to help their teacher check their understanding of a lesson When the ban was in place, pupils had to keep phones out of sight. ""We spent too much time challenging children for using phones during the day and that took time from things which were more important - the child's education,"" said Mr Williams. ""Also it created a negative atmosphere during the day."" After consultation, they relaxed the policy and now some teachers bring smartphones into use in the class. ""I think as a school, we've got a responsibility to teach our students how to use technology effectively... and prepare our students for the world of work."" Social media has 'little effect on girls' wellbeing' Social media 'disrupting teens' sleep and exercise' 15-year-old Harrison says he learns better through watching videos than copying things down Pupil Harrison, 15, has found it beneficial in many ways: ""We can check our progress. We can see homework that needs to be handed in and we can just do revision at break times or when we have free lessons. ""My parents think it's a good idea because they can see if I need more help at home and they can track what I'm doing."" He likes using educational videos ""to learn through listening and watching things rather than copying things down"" and Kahoot, an app which provides a quick way for teachers to quiz pupils to check their learning. Mr Williams said he had not seen any negative impact on pupil wellbeing and nearly all children have a smartphone, with devices being shared to make sure no one misses out. At Llangatwg Community School, head teacher Alan Rowlands uses a walkie talkie to communicate with staff after banning mobiles Llangatwg Community School just outside Neath encourages children to use technology ""where appropriate"", but in September they banned phones - teachers now use walkie-talkies to communicate. Head teacher Alan Rowlands said: ""What we were finding as a school was the overreliance on mobile phones was affecting children's concentration levels, affecting their communication with each other and we really asked ourselves the serious question what is the purpose of a mobile phone in school?"" Children are allowed to have phones turned off in their bags, but they are not allowed to be seen during the school day. ""Some of us felt it would be difficult to implement, however... the children seem very much on board,"" Mr Rowlands said. French MPs back ban on mobile phone use in schools Phone bans 'improve school exam results' Head boy and head girl Benjamin and Annalise said pupils talk to each other more and listen better after the ban Head boy and Year 11 pupil Benjamin said children were listening more, while head girl Annalise, 15, said it was ""100 times better now"" and no longer thinks about checking her texts or social media. ""I used to walk in the canteen, everyone was on their phones, and no one's socialising, they were used excessivelyâ¦ People are now interacting,"" she added. Mr Rowlands found the policy change ""liberating"" and said while it may seem counterintuitive to remove technology from the classroom, the school had seen benefits in communication between pupils and staff. Many schools have a policy that mobiles should be switched off during lessons, but some - such as Aberconwy School in Conwy, allow their use at break times. Stanwell School in Penarth has a total ban on electronic devices of any sort and they cannot be brought to school unless officially authorised. The Welsh Government said it did not issue guidance on the use of mobile phones, as ""it is a matter for individual schools"" but the effect on learning and wellbeing should be considered. ""Teachers already have the power to restrict the use of phones and we recognise that, where managed properly, phones can be used effectively in classrooms as learning tool,"" a spokesman said. The UK government policy is that it is the responsibility of head teachers to determine on how phones should be used. Last year, the then-UK culture secretary Matt Hancock saidhe admired schoolsthat had enforced mobile phone bans. NASUWT said schools should have clear and robust phone and social media policies. Its official in Wales, Neil Butler, said: ""Too often pupils are distracted from learning by constantly checking their phones and messaging. No pupil needs constant access to their phone during lessons."" Sarah Hannafin, senior policy adviser for the National Association for Head Teachers, said the union supported school autonomy on the issue: ""Outright banning mobile phones can cause more problems than it solves, making problems less visible and obvious for schools to tackle.""

NHS screening 'needs to fit with busy lives',"There needs to be easier access to NHS screening programmes in England, including evening and weekend clinics, to increase uptake, a review says. The report by Prof Sir Mike Richards also called for tests to be offered in a wider variety of locations, including mobile units. And it recommended using social media to promote what was available. The government had asked Sir Mike to look at the five adult programmes covering cancer and other conditions. They are: bowel cancer (men and women aged 60 to 74, or from 55 in some pilot areas) cervical cancer (women aged 25 to 64) breast cancer (women aged 50 to 71) abdominal aortic aneurysms (a weakness in the main blood vessel supplying the heart) (men aged 65) diabetic eye screening Sir Mike, a former national cancer director and chief inspector of hospitals, said the screening programmes were saving 10,000 lives a year through prevention and early diagnosis. But it was clear they were still not reaching their full potential, especially the cancer ones. Some 15 million people are invited to take part in these screening programmes each year - but just over 10 million take up the invitation. Uptake for bowel cancer screening is lowest, at below 60%. Changes are already being introduced, including a new easier-to-use screening test for bowel cancer. And Sir Mike said the use of artificial intelligence and genetic testing would continue to drive forward improvements. But, he said, more needed to be done. ""People live increasingly busy lives and we need to make it as easy and convenient as possible for people to attend these important appointments,"" Sir Mike said. He wants to see more use of different locations. Most screening takes places in hospitals and GP centres. But there is work being done to offer some of the tests via mobile units at supermarket car parks and in other health clinics, such as sexual health centres for cervical screening. Weekend and evening opening could also help, Sir Mike said. He also called for more to be done to engage the public. He highlighted local projects that had increased uptake by posting breast cancer screening opportunities into Facebook community groups and carrying out follow-up phone calls to people who did not take part in bowel cancer screening. Meanwhile, he said, responsibility for all the screening programmes should lie with NHS England - at the moment it is shared with Public Health England. And improvements in IT programs were needed - something NHS England is already looking at. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said they were ""sensible recommendations"" that would be acted on. Macmillan Cancer Support gave its backing to the recommendations, saying they should be implemented ""urgently"".

"'Send nudes' Boohoo ad banned after complaintThe advert for clothes in skin tones was not socially responsible, the UK advertising watchdog rules.Technology","Boohoo said the word ""nudes"" referred to a beige jacket a model was wearing UK fashion company Boohoo has been told one of its emailed advertisements must not use the phrase ""Send nudes"". The company put the phrase in a message sent to promote a range of clothes coloured to resemble skin. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld a complaint about the advert because it made light of a ""potentially harmful social trend"". Boohoo has also been told to make sure its advertising is ""socially responsible"". In its ruling, the ASA said it knew the term ""nude"" was often used in the fashion world to refer to colours similar to skin tones. But it said the phrase ""Send nudes"" was more likely to be interpreted as a harassing request for sexual photos rather than as a reference to a range of clothes. As well as the words appearing across an image inside the emailed advert, the phrase also formed the message's subject line. The ASA said: ""Increased pressure to share such photos had been linked to negative outcomes for young people."" And the market Boohoo targeted probably meant the advert had reached children - especially those who wanted to dress like a ""slightly older age group"". Boohoo said: ""We note the ASA's ruling and recognise our obligations to ensure that advertising is socially responsible."" In a separate ruling, the ASA banned a video advert for clothing company Missguided, broadcast in June, which ""objectified women"". Missguided said the advert, featuring women assuming a series of seductive poses in swimwear and other summer clothes, served to promote a ""particular lifestyle"" rather than just clothing. And the ""display of skin was relevant, necessary and unavoidable"" given the ad was for beach-wear. The ASA disagreed and said the images were ""highly sexualised"" and some of the women depicted in the poses were not wearing the clothes Missguided said it was promoting. The ad was likely to cause ""serious offence"" to some people, it said. Missguided has been told not to run the ad again and must guard against creating similar content that ""objectifies women"".

Brexit talks continue amid claims deal is close,"Downing Street is playing down reports of an imminent Brexit deal with the EU, saying talks are still ongoing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure to get a fresh agreement by Thursday's EU summit, but his spokesman said there was ""more work still to do"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier had said the two sides must agree the details by the end of Tuesday. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it was not clear whether a text could be signed off by then. She said Mr Barnier was due to brief EU ambassadors at 1300 BST on Wednesday, after a possible European Commissioners meeting, meaning a new deal could get the ""green light"" from Brussels in the afternoon. The Guardian is reporting that a draft treaty,externalcould be published on Wednesday morning, claiming the UK has made further concessions over the issue of customs and the Irish border. What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Could no-deal still happen? DUP meet prime minister again over Brexit Brexit has a new phrase - difficult but possible The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Talks remain constructive but there is more work still to do."" Meanwhile, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said talks were ""moving in the right direction"" but gaps between the sides remained, and it was still unclear whether a deal would be ready in time for the Brussels summit. His deputy, TÃ¡naiste Simon Coveney, said earlier that ""big steps"" were needed on Tuesday ""to build on progress that has been slow"" because there would be no haggling over the details of the text once the summit began. The two-day EU summit is crucial because, under legislation passed last month - the Benn Act - the PM must get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturday if he is to avoid asking for a delay. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October and Boris Johnson says that deadline must be honoured. He is trying to hold together a coalition of Conservative Brexiteers and Democratic Unionists in support of his proposed alternative to the Irish backstop - the arrangement designed to keep an open border in Ireland. This video can not be played ""We need to deal with the facts,"" say the Irish deputy PM The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, had more than an hour of talks in Downing Street on Monday night and met the PM again on Tuesday evening for a further 90 minutes. Following that meeting, the DUP released a statement saying it would not give ""a detailed commentary"" but added ""it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required"". Earlier, Mrs Foster had told the BBC her party would ""stick with our principles"" that Northern Ireland ""must remain"" within the UK's customs union. She dismissed as ""speculation"" claims the new Brexit deal included a possible customs border in the Irish Sea - meaning Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of the UK - saying the DUP could never accept that. Giving the Northern Ireland Assembly a regular vote on post-Brexit customs arrangements - which is reported to have been ditched in response to Ireland's objections - was also important to the DUP, Mrs Foster said. She said it was ""right to give space and time"" to negotiators to try to get a deal, but ""everyone knows our position"". Earlier on Tuesday, members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group attended a meeting at No 10, with chairman Steve Baker saying afterwards he was ""optimistic"" that ""a tolerable deal"" could be reached. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the widely-held view there was that the UK was unlikely to be leaving on 31 October, and the question was whether an extension could be short in order to iron out some small issues, or had to be much longer to deal with bigger problems. After updating EU ministers on Tuesday morning, Mr Barnier signalled that he expected the UK to share the legal text of any proposed changes to the withdrawal agreement within hours. He said there was a ""narrow path"" to be trod between the EU's objective of protecting the single market and Mr Johnson's goal of keeping Northern Ireland in the UK's customs territory. While there had been progress, Mr Barnier said there was still a big disagreement about the inclusion of so-called ""level playing field"" provisionsin the political declarationsketching out the two sides' future trade relationship. These provisions would limit the UK's ability to diverge from the EU across a whole range of areas, including competition policy, employment rights, environmental standards and state aid. The UK says loosening these conditions is vital if it is to have an independent trade policy, but the EU says the UK cannot have privileged access to the single market market without following its rules as this would give it an unfair advantage. Asked whether it recognised talk of an EU deadline later on Tuesday, No 10 said Mr Johnson was ""aware of the time restraints"" and the UK was working hard to secure a deal ""as soon as possible"".

Bulgarian football and its problem with racism,"Racism has long been a problem in Bulgarian stadiums The monkey chants and Nazi salutes from black-clad Bulgaria fans shocked many of those who watched the match with England in Sofia on Monday night, but they weren't perhaps entirely surprising. For years Bulgarian football has been plagued by racism in its stadiums. In 2011, the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) was fined after England players Ashley Young, Ashley Cole and Theo Walcott were subjected to racist abuse from fans during a European Championship qualifier. On 20 April 2013, halfway through a match, fans of Levski Sofia unveiled a banner wishing Adolf Hitler a happy birthday. And last year the club was fined after photos from the Bulgarian cup final showed a child making a Nazi salute, alongside another with a swastika drawn on his chest. While many have been quick to point out the problem is not only a Bulgarian one - top leagues have faced scandals involving racism in the not-so-distant past,including the English Premier League- it is one of the worst offenders in Europe. Raheem Sterling has faced racial abuse in England ""I've spoken to some of the ordinary football fans and they feel ashamed of what's going on because this is the image of the country,"" said Yana Pelovska, a Bulgarian journalist based in Sofia. Despite obvious examples of racism in the Bulgarian league, Ms Pelovska said that most of the worst abuse is saved for the international stage. 'Football family must wage war on racists' Racist abuse 'clear as day' - Mings Unsavoury and sinister - a bleak night handled with dignity by England Hardcore fans of clubs like CSKA Sofia told her that they wouldn't racially abuse local opposition teams because they had black players on their own side. ""It's complicated. I can't say this racist chanting is normal in Bulgarian matches,"" she said. Kamen Alipiev, a sports reporter based in Sofia, said there were wider societal issues over why racism was still a problem among Bulgarian fans. ""We have problems with communications with our Roma Gypsies in the area, with refugees coming from Asia and Africa... so maybe sometimes it sounds like it's normal."" The fans ""can't imagine that they are racist,"" he explained. Bulgarian fans hold up a ""No respect"" jumper Tihomir Bezlov and Dr Atanas Rusev, researchers at the Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD) in Sofia, believe the behaviour is not only driven by racist attitudes, but also financial interests. Some supporters with a history of racist behaviour demand payment from clubs in order to stop, they say. In 2015, the CSD produced a report entitled Radicalisation in Bulgaria: Threats and Trends.It documents widespread racism,externalamong the country's football supporters. ""A famous Levski supporter explained that he does not like African-Americans, Turkish people and Arabs, but he does not mind the dark-skinned football players of Levski,"" the report notes. Although ""skinheads sharing racist views used to be very popular in CSKA factions"", the report says their influence has been diminished, partly because of the interventions of a fan leader, Rossen ""the Animal"" Petrov. This video can not be played Bulgaria v England: Tyrone Mings heard racist abuse before warming up The CSD researchers, Mr Alipiev and Bulgarian reporter Momchil Indjov, told the BBC they suspected there were links between football hooligans and far-right nationalist movements. Dr Rusev said hooligans had been mobilised during protests and to attack Roma communities. Mr Indjov said he believed many of those involved in the racist abuse on Monday were part of SW99 - a hooligan faction belonging to Levski Sofia - and said the behaviour appeared planned. Mr Bezlov said police had told him that CSKA Sofia fans were involved. While Bulgaria has faced criticism for its efforts - or lack thereof - at combating racism in football in the past, Monday night's scenes appear to have been taken more seriously. The match was halted twice, and on Tuesday the president of the BFU, Borislav Mihaylov, resigned after being told to quit by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov. Borislav Mihaylov (left) resigned as president of the BFU on Tuesday The president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, said the ""football family and governments"" need to ""wage war on the racists"". ""There were times, not long ago, when the football family thought that the scourge of racism was a distant memory,"" Mr Ceferin said. ""The last couple of years have taught us that such thinking was, at best, complacent."" The British government said it had written to Uefa to demand more action, and Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings against Bulgaria. The shame many Bulgarians have felt from the behaviour of some of its fans on Monday could result in a long-overdue discussion about racism in the country, Mr Alipiev said. ""It will definitely create a discussion, especially after the reaction of our prime minister today... I think a red light is going on across the country,"" he said. ""It's not just about the football fans. We need to speak about our ability to accept others, not only in the stadiums. ""I really hope there will be a public discussion because it's a discussion about the state of the nation."" Reality Check: Is football racism rising?

Elizabeth Warren under attack in Democratic debate,"This video can not be played WATCH: Warren evades questions about tax rises - and her rivals pile on US Democratic White House front-runner Elizabeth Warren has been fiercely attacked by rivals in a live TV debate. They accused the senator of refusing to say whether she would raise taxes. Two other front-runners were also feeling the heat. Joe Biden denied any wrongdoing in Ukraine, while Bernie Sanders sought to allay health doubts after a heart attack this month. The Democratic winner will take on President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the November 2020 election. The debate in the electoral battleground state of Ohio was the most crowded so far in the Democratic race - with all 12 White House hopefuls squaring off in the primetime forum. Snapping at the heels of the pack leaders, Pete Buttigieg - mayor of the town of South Bend in Indiana - California Senator Kamala Harris and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar came out fighting on Tuesday night. Who were the debate winners and losers? Joe Biden's son defends business dealings The Trump impeachment story explained Ocasio-Cortez 'to endorse Sanders for president' Also on stage were New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, former Obama housing secretary Julian Castro, Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and billionaire activist Tom Steyer. Time is running out for the lower-tier contenders to make an impression. The Democratic White House race officially begins with the Iowa caucuses on 3 February. The pack will be whittled down in state-by-state votes until a final candidate is crowned at the party convention next July. Ms Warren found a bullseye on her back after surging to the top of the field over the past two months. Both Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, and Ms Warren favour free healthcare for all Americans through ""Medicare for All"" - a government-run health insurance plan that would transform the US healthcare system. Some analysts have said the system could cost $32 trillion (Â£25 trillion) over a decade. But unlike Mr Sanders, Ms Warren has repeatedly avoided stating explicitly whether her version of the policy would raise taxes on working families. She was pressed on the issue by debate moderators and replied that she would not sign any bill that hiked costs on the middle class. Are voters biased against women candidates? Mr Buttigieg rounded on her, saying: ""You heard it tonight - a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. ""This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular."" Even Ms Warren's progressive ally Mr Sanders took a veiled jab, saying: ""I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up."" Ms Klobuchar pounced: ""At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and taxes are going to go up."" Mr Biden took a pop at both Ms Warren and Mr Sanders. ""Both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for All,"" he said. ""Now look, here's the deal, come on, it costs 30 trillion dollars!"" Ms Warren did not appear flustered under the repeated attacks, focusing on her policy prescriptions for ending income inequality. Mr Biden was asked about Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims that the former US vice-president improperly tried to aid his son Hunter Biden's business interests in Ukraine. ""My son did nothing wrong,"" replied Mr Biden, whose once commanding lead in opinion polls has been slipping. ""I did nothing wrong."" He was pressed by the debate moderator on whether he made a mistake while he was the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine by allowing his son to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Hunter Biden defends Ukraine and China business dealings What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Mr Biden replied that he never discussed ""a single thing"" about Ukraine with his son. Meanwhile, his rivals refrained from attacking him about it. It was the first debate since congressional Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Mr Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. Every candidate on stage backed the investigation, which may seek to remove the president from office, railing against Mr Trump's ""criminality"" and ""corruption"". It's the largest number on a single stage in this debate series - 12 Elizabeth Warren knew she was going to take some shots now that she's reached the top of the pack. She was not wrong. Once again, her refusal to acknowledge that her universal healthcare plan raises some taxes was targeted by the more moderate candidates. She doggedly refused to be pinned down, but for once the attacks - particularly from Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar - felt like they had more bite. She can keep dancing, but her weakness here isn't going away - and could become a real problem in a general election. Despite this, she had her share of memorable lines. Her early support for Donald Trump's impeachment helped give her answer on the topic - that ""impeachment is the way that we establish that no one will be able to break the law over and over again without consequences"" - extra punch. Her defence of a wealth tax, saying that she prefers to invest in a generation of Americans and not ""protect billionaires"", will resonate with many Democrats. And when Joe Biden spoke about his efforts to get votes for Ms Warren's financial reform legislation in 2009, she pointedly praised Barack Obama - and not the vice-president - for his support. It was a subtle way of prying Mr Biden away from his embrace of Mr Obama's political legacy. Read Anthony's analysis in full Mr Sanders was closely watched for signs of fatigue in the three-hour debate after he suffered a heart attack earlier this month. The oldest contender at 78, Mr Sanders has dropped into third place in the polls. ""I'm healthy,"" the self-described democratic socialist told a moderator who questioned his fitness. ""I'm feeling great."" In a touching gesture, he added: ""Let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including so many of my colleagues up here for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes."" In a major boost for Mr Sanders's support among younger liberals, his campaign aides briefed reporters that he would be endorsed on Saturday by progressive firebrand congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A watch party at a bar in West Hollywood, California Mr Biden was also asked by the moderators about his age - he would turn 80 during his first term as US president. ""One of the reasons I am running is because of my age and my experience,"" he replied. ""With it comes wisdom. ""We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies."" His reply will be interpreted as an implicit put-down of his younger challengers such as Mr Buttigieg, 37, Mr Yang, 44, and Mr Castro, 45. The key issues for the candidates In one of the most aggressive exchanges of the night, Mr Buttigieg and Mr O'Rourke clashed over firearms policy. This video can not be played America's gun laws explained in 2017 Mr O'Rourke was challenged by a moderator on his plan to remove assault-style weapons from private ownership under a so-called mandatory gun buyback. When Mr Buttigieg said Mr O'Rourke did not know how he was going to take weapons off the streets, the Texan implied the young mayor was in thrall to ""consultants and the focus groups"". Mr Buttigieg, a military veteran, hit back: ""I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal."" Mr O'Rourke countered that it was ""slap in the face"" to victims of gun violence when his idea was disparaged by Mr Buttigieg as ""a shiny object"". About 40% of Americans say they own a gun or live in a household with one,according to a 2017 survey.,externalThe right to bear arms is enshrined in the US constitution, and gun control is among the most divisive issues in the country. Election day is still more than a year away but the race to become the Democratic challenger to Mr Trump is already well under way. The latest polling suggests Ms Warren and Mr Biden are the front-runners, while Mr Sanders is also a popular contender.

Harry Dunn's parents meet Trump at White House,"This video can not be played Harry Dunn's parents say they were told by the president he would ""try to push this from a different angle"" Harry Dunn's parents rejected a ""bombshell"" offer from Donald Trump to meet the woman accused of involvement in their son's fatal crash. Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn said they felt ""a little ambushed"" when the president revealed Anne Sacoolas was in the next room at the White House. Mrs Sacoolas returned to the United States under diplomatic immunity days after the crash which killed Harry, 19. Harry's parents said they wanted to meet Mrs Sacoolas, 42, in the UK. Mr Dunn said a White House official told them she would not be returning to the UK, but Mr Trump said he would ""try to push this from a different angle"". Harry Dunn died on 27 August when his motorcycle crashed with a Volvo near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official stationed at the base - was interviewed by police but then returned to the United States after claiming diplomatic immunity. That status has since beencast into doubtby the Foreign Office and Mr Dunn's family want Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK. Speaking on CBS This Morning, Mr Dunn said the president had suggested the meeting with Mrs Sacoolas ""two or three times"". ""We said no, we didn't feel it was right. He said 'she's here, let's get it on, get some healing,' something like that,"" Mr Dunn told the US TV network. ""There was a bit of pressure but we stuck to our guns."" In a separate interview, Mr Dunn said: ""We didn't want to be railroaded into, not a circus as such, but into a meeting we weren't prepared for."" Ms Charles said they were ""a bit shocked"", adding: ""The bombshell was dropped soon after we walked in the room that Anne Sacoolas was in the building, and was willing to meet with us. ""I don't think it would be appropriate to meet her without therapists or mediators in the room."" Harry died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Family spokesman Radd Seiger described the White House meeting as ""absolutely extraordinary"" and ""unprecedented"". But he said US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told the family during the meeting that Mrs Sacoolas ""was never coming back"" to the UK. Harry Dunn's family threaten judicial review What is diplomatic immunity? US crash suspect's return 'non-negotiable' Ms Charles said she had told Mr Trump during the White House meeting: ""If it was your son you would be doing the same as us."" She added: ""He actually gripped my hand a little bit tighter and said 'yes I would be'. And that's when he said he would try and look at this from a different angle. ""I can only hope that he was sincere enough to consider doing that for us. ""He's the one in control here, but we're the ones in control of our situation as much as we can be - we still want justice for Harry and we will take it as far as we possibly can to ensure that that's done. ""We do feel that we have done as much as we can at the moment."" Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Ms Charles later told ITV's Good Morning Britain the family would ""be forever disappointed, forever disgusted in both the UK and US governments"" if Mrs Sacoolas did not return. Mr Dunn said the trip to the White House ""didn't feel like a stunt"". ""I think the president was very graceful and spoke very well to us,"" he said. ""I genuinely do think he will look to resolve this in a way that will help us."" Over the weekend, Mrs Sacoolas broke her silence over Mr Dunn's death in a letter via her lawyers. In it she said she wanted to meet his parents ""so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident"". Mrs Sacoolas was said to be covered by diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a US intelligence official, though that protection is now in dispute. Northamptonshire Police said it would be submitting an evidence file to the UK Crown Prosecution Service ""very soon"".

"Democratic front-runners to be tested in TV debateJoe Biden is under siege, Bernie Sanders is recovering from a heart attack, and Elizabeth Warren may face new scrutiny.US & Canada","This video can not be played WATCH: Warren evades questions about tax rises - and her rivals pile on US Democratic White House front-runner Elizabeth Warren has been fiercely attacked by rivals in a live TV debate. They accused the senator of refusing to say whether she would raise taxes. Two other front-runners were also feeling the heat. Joe Biden denied any wrongdoing in Ukraine, while Bernie Sanders sought to allay health doubts after a heart attack this month. The Democratic winner will take on President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the November 2020 election. The debate in the electoral battleground state of Ohio was the most crowded so far in the Democratic race - with all 12 White House hopefuls squaring off in the primetime forum. Snapping at the heels of the pack leaders, Pete Buttigieg - mayor of the town of South Bend in Indiana - California Senator Kamala Harris and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar came out fighting on Tuesday night. Who were the debate winners and losers? Joe Biden's son defends business dealings The Trump impeachment story explained Ocasio-Cortez 'to endorse Sanders for president' Also on stage were New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, former Obama housing secretary Julian Castro, Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and billionaire activist Tom Steyer. Time is running out for the lower-tier contenders to make an impression. The Democratic White House race officially begins with the Iowa caucuses on 3 February. The pack will be whittled down in state-by-state votes until a final candidate is crowned at the party convention next July. Ms Warren found a bullseye on her back after surging to the top of the field over the past two months. Both Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, and Ms Warren favour free healthcare for all Americans through ""Medicare for All"" - a government-run health insurance plan that would transform the US healthcare system. Some analysts have said the system could cost $32 trillion (Â£25 trillion) over a decade. But unlike Mr Sanders, Ms Warren has repeatedly avoided stating explicitly whether her version of the policy would raise taxes on working families. She was pressed on the issue by debate moderators and replied that she would not sign any bill that hiked costs on the middle class. Are voters biased against women candidates? Mr Buttigieg rounded on her, saying: ""You heard it tonight - a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. ""This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular."" Even Ms Warren's progressive ally Mr Sanders took a veiled jab, saying: ""I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up."" Ms Klobuchar pounced: ""At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and taxes are going to go up."" Mr Biden took a pop at both Ms Warren and Mr Sanders. ""Both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for All,"" he said. ""Now look, here's the deal, come on, it costs 30 trillion dollars!"" Ms Warren did not appear flustered under the repeated attacks, focusing on her policy prescriptions for ending income inequality. Mr Biden was asked about Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims that the former US vice-president improperly tried to aid his son Hunter Biden's business interests in Ukraine. ""My son did nothing wrong,"" replied Mr Biden, whose once commanding lead in opinion polls has been slipping. ""I did nothing wrong."" He was pressed by the debate moderator on whether he made a mistake while he was the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine by allowing his son to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Hunter Biden defends Ukraine and China business dealings What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Mr Biden replied that he never discussed ""a single thing"" about Ukraine with his son. Meanwhile, his rivals refrained from attacking him about it. It was the first debate since congressional Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Mr Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. Every candidate on stage backed the investigation, which may seek to remove the president from office, railing against Mr Trump's ""criminality"" and ""corruption"". It's the largest number on a single stage in this debate series - 12 Elizabeth Warren knew she was going to take some shots now that she's reached the top of the pack. She was not wrong. Once again, her refusal to acknowledge that her universal healthcare plan raises some taxes was targeted by the more moderate candidates. She doggedly refused to be pinned down, but for once the attacks - particularly from Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar - felt like they had more bite. She can keep dancing, but her weakness here isn't going away - and could become a real problem in a general election. Despite this, she had her share of memorable lines. Her early support for Donald Trump's impeachment helped give her answer on the topic - that ""impeachment is the way that we establish that no one will be able to break the law over and over again without consequences"" - extra punch. Her defence of a wealth tax, saying that she prefers to invest in a generation of Americans and not ""protect billionaires"", will resonate with many Democrats. And when Joe Biden spoke about his efforts to get votes for Ms Warren's financial reform legislation in 2009, she pointedly praised Barack Obama - and not the vice-president - for his support. It was a subtle way of prying Mr Biden away from his embrace of Mr Obama's political legacy. Read Anthony's analysis in full Mr Sanders was closely watched for signs of fatigue in the three-hour debate after he suffered a heart attack earlier this month. The oldest contender at 78, Mr Sanders has dropped into third place in the polls. ""I'm healthy,"" the self-described democratic socialist told a moderator who questioned his fitness. ""I'm feeling great."" In a touching gesture, he added: ""Let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including so many of my colleagues up here for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes."" In a major boost for Mr Sanders's support among younger liberals, his campaign aides briefed reporters that he would be endorsed on Saturday by progressive firebrand congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A watch party at a bar in West Hollywood, California Mr Biden was also asked by the moderators about his age - he would turn 80 during his first term as US president. ""One of the reasons I am running is because of my age and my experience,"" he replied. ""With it comes wisdom. ""We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies."" His reply will be interpreted as an implicit put-down of his younger challengers such as Mr Buttigieg, 37, Mr Yang, 44, and Mr Castro, 45. The key issues for the candidates In one of the most aggressive exchanges of the night, Mr Buttigieg and Mr O'Rourke clashed over firearms policy. This video can not be played America's gun laws explained in 2017 Mr O'Rourke was challenged by a moderator on his plan to remove assault-style weapons from private ownership under a so-called mandatory gun buyback. When Mr Buttigieg said Mr O'Rourke did not know how he was going to take weapons off the streets, the Texan implied the young mayor was in thrall to ""consultants and the focus groups"". Mr Buttigieg, a military veteran, hit back: ""I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal."" Mr O'Rourke countered that it was ""slap in the face"" to victims of gun violence when his idea was disparaged by Mr Buttigieg as ""a shiny object"". About 40% of Americans say they own a gun or live in a household with one,according to a 2017 survey.,externalThe right to bear arms is enshrined in the US constitution, and gun control is among the most divisive issues in the country. Election day is still more than a year away but the race to become the Democratic challenger to Mr Trump is already well under way.
