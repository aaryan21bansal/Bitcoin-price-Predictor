Indian actor Milind Soman charged over nude photoSoman was reprimanded for sharing an image of him running naked down a beach in the city of Goa.,"Milind Soman is a keen sportsman as well as an actor and model Indian actor and model Milind Soman has been charged by police after he shared a naked picture of himself on Instagram. Soman posted the image on Wednesday, showing him sprinting nude down a Goa beach, with the caption ""Happy Birthday to me!"".Â It attracted over 147,000 likes and thousands of comments. But police were called to action following a complaint by political party Goa Suraksha Manch. The party said Soman had indulged in public obscenity, and tainted Goa's image. Police charged him on Friday with public obscenity and sharing lewd images online. In an interview with the Bombay Times, his wife Ankita Konwar, who took the photo, said it ""sends out a very positive message on body positivity and being free and happy with who you are. Indian couple bullied over wedding photoshoot ""I think anyone who accepts themselves for who they are has this incredible light and energy around them, and people start liking their presence,"" she added. ""Milind's always been like that. Always himself."" Sameer Khutwalker, president of Goa Suraksha Manch, told the Indian Express newspaper he was happy Soman had been charged. ""He has used Goa for cheap publicity and acted foolishly on a public beach,"" said Mr Khutwalker. ""When these things become public, people will imagine that 'anything is possible in Goa,"" he added. ""When will all this stop?"" It is the second time Soman has been booked for charges of obscenity. In 1995, he and model Madhu Sapre were charged for appearing nude in an advertising campaign, wearing only a pair of shoes and a python wrapped around them. Earlier this year, Soman posted the picture on his social media, with the caption ""What the reaction would have been if it had been released todayâ¦"". The latest charge also comes days after actor and model Poonam Pandey, and her husband, were arrested for allegedly trespassing on government property and shooting an ""objectionable"" video at a dam in Goa. The pair have since been released on bail.

"'Significant differences' in Brexit talks, says PM","Mr Johnson believes there is 'a deal to be done' ""Significant differences"" between the UK and the EU remain, as negotiations for a post-Brexit trade deal continue, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday, the PM said progress had been made but there were still issues around the ""level playing field"" and fishing. Both parties agreed negotiating teams would resume talks in London on Monday. They also agreed to remain ""in close contact"" over the coming days. A statement from Downing Street on Saturday said: ""Prime Minister Boris Johnson today spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a stock take on the progress in the negotiations between the UK and the EU. ""The prime minister set out that, while some progress had been made in recent discussions, significant differences remain in a number of areas, including the so-called level playing field and fish. ""The prime minister and president agreed that their negotiating teams would continue talks in London next week, beginning on Monday, in order to redouble efforts to reach a deal. ""They agreed to remain in personal contact about the negotiations,"" the statement said. Echoing Mr Johnson, Ms von der Leyen acknowledged ""some progress had been made, but large differences remain"". ""Our teams will continue working hard next week,"" she wrote on Twitter.

The prime minister has said he believes there is ""a deal to be done"" and ""very much hopes"" to come to an agreement, but he has insisted the country was ""very well prepared"" to move on should the two parties not be able to agree a deal. Meanwhile, the National Audit Office has warned of ""significant disruption"" when the Brexit transition period ends. 'Differences remain' after Brexit trade talks Trade talks are back on - but what's changed? Brexit: What is a level playing field? The UK left the EU on 31 January and entered the transition period - continuing to follow many EU rules - while a trade deal was negotiated. But while both sides said a deal needed to be done in October, they have yet to come to an agreement, and talks between the negotiating teams have intensified. The transition period is due to come to an end on 31 December, meaning the UK would trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules - meaning tariffs are imposed - if a deal is not in place. Critics say this could cause damage to the UK economy, but the government insists the country will prosper with or without a deal. Earlier this week, both the UK and EU's chief trade negotiatorswarned of ""wide"" and ""serious divergences"" between the two sides. Sticking points include fishing rights, competition rules and how a deal would be enforced. Asked on Friday if the UK could get a deal in the next 10 days, Mr Johnson said: ""I very much hope that we will, but obviously that depends on our friends and partners across the Channel. ""I think there is a deal to be done, if they want to do it. ""If not, the country is, of course, very well prepared. As I have said before, we can do very well with on Australian terms [without a deal], if that is what we have to go for."" Thomas Byrne, Ireland's minister for European affairs, said the talks up to this point between the EU and UK's negotiators, Michel Barnier and David Frost, had been ""difficult"", with ""big issues"" still remaining. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I personally don't expect that there would me major progress today, but at the same time I think it's very good that they are talking - I think that's really positive. But I'm not sure that we would expect a moment at this point."" Has US election slowed down Brexit negotiations? Mr Byrne was also asked if there could be a ""new dynamic"" to discussions between the UK and EU if Joe Biden was elected the US president, saying it was ""certainly possible"". Mr Biden, who has Irish roots, said in September that he wouldnot allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit""if he was elected president. Mr Byrne said: ""He was very clear in his suggestion and statement on the 16th of September that any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent on respect for the Good Friday Agreement and preventing the return of the hard border.""

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him.

Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president.""

Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader.

The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

Biden: Five decades of ambition," How Joe Biden overcame public and personal adversity By Anthony Zurcher By Anthony Zurcher This article was first published on 18 August, 2020 It was the winter of Joe Biden’s discontent. After a disappointing finish in the Iowa caucuses in February, his support in the upcoming New Hampshire primary was collapsing and his 2020 presidential campaign was in serious jeopardy. He was, for all appearances, a defeated man. The White House hopes Biden had been harbouring during his nearly half-century in public service were slipping away again, perhaps for the last time. At a campaign rally ahead of the New Hampshire vote, Biden was reflective - and at times visibly emotional. He spoke of the death of his son, Beau, almost five years earlier.  He recounted stories from his childhood, of his family’s economic hardships. But he reassured the audience. “There’s always hope,” he said. “There’s always hope.” It wasn’t a typical rally speech – and given his subsequent fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, probably not an effective one. But it offered a glimpse into the psyche, the emotional scar tissue, of a politician who has faced devastating personal, professional and political adversity over the course of his life. “I have an incredibly high regard for fate,” Biden told the National Journal back in 1989. “I have never been able to plan my life. Every time my personal life has been how I wanted it, something has intervened.” Biden has witnessed the untimely deaths of the closest of loved ones. He’s built platforms for his political ambitions, only to watch them crumble, then built them again. His hard-earned rhetorical skills have won him the adoration of crowds, and his propensity for malaprops and gaffes have made him the object of ridicule. Biden frequently says that the main lesson he learned from his father was that the measure of a man isn’t how many times he’s been knocked down, but how quickly he gets back up. After losing in New Hampshire, Biden’s campaign regrouped in the southern states and turned what appeared to be impending defeat into a convincing march to the Democratic nomination. That was only the latest example of Biden facing challenges – some beyond his control, others resulting from his own mistakes and miscalculations – and soldiering on. “We have choices when we suffer like Joe,” says former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, who served with Biden in Congress during the 1990s. “He's a man of faith. He chose not to quit. He chose to keep doing the work, even though he didn't have to.” Biden, if nothing else, is a survivor. Five pivotal days in his life put this in stark relief – days casting shadows that stretched for decades. Joe Biden was in Washington on 18 December, 1972, when the telephone rang. It was his brother Jimmy in Delaware, asking to speak to his sister, Valerie. There had been a “slight accident” involving Biden's family, his sister relayed. “Nothing to be worried about,” she said. “But we ought to go home.” His wife Neilia, he would learn later that day, had been killed, along with their infant daughter, Naomi, when the car she was driving was hit by a lorry. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were also seriously injured. The family had been shopping for a Christmas tree while Biden – who had just been elected to the Senate - was off interviewing staff for his congressional office and finalising the purchase of a new home for the family. Now, that family was shattered. “I could not speak, only felt this hollow core grow in my chest,” Biden wrote in his memoir, “like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole.” He considered giving up the Senate seat he had just won. He contemplated joining the priesthood. He found himself taking evening walks in rough neighbourhoods, looking for a fight. “I had not known I was capable of such rage,” he wrote. “ I felt God had played a horrible trick on me, and I was angry.” Up until that day, Biden’s life had been on a remarkable upward trajectory. Just over a month earlier, the then-29-year-old Democrat had become the second-youngest person elected to the US Senate, defeating a two-term Republican incumbent in a race few thought he had a chance of winning. He was considered a golden boy in a Democratic Party that had been trounced across the nation by Richard Nixon and the Republicans. Biden’s childhood was relatively challenging. While his father had his share of business successes, mostly before Biden was born, the ups were inevitably followed by downs, and young Biden spent much of his youth living with his extended family in a modest home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. “The values that Vice-President Biden was exposed to as a young man were values rooted in the Church, rooted in Catholic education, rooted in the culture we were growing up in, which was Irish-American,” says Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, whose family has lived in Scranton for generations. His biggest childhood challenge was overcoming a speech impediment – a stutter – that afflicted him well into high school. In his memoir, Biden recalls memorising a reading to avoid tripping up during class and, when he once did, how a teacher mocked his disability, calling him “buh-buh-Biden”. That teacher, a Catholic nun, received a tongue-lashing from Biden’s mother, who threatened to “knock your bonnet off your head”, in Biden’s retelling. His high-school classmates gave him nicknames that made references to his stutter. “Even today I can remember the dread, the shame, the absolute rage, as vividly as the day it was happening,” Biden wrote. By the time he finished high school, however, he had overcome the stutter - the result, he says, of months of training himself to relax his face while he practised speaking in front of a mirror. It still reveals itself on occasion, however, when he’s under pressure or fumbling for words. “A stutter does not get worse as a person ages, but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy,” wrote John Hendrickson, in an Atlantic Magazine article about Biden’s stutter. No-one is ever truly cured, he says, they simply find ways around the problem. After high school, Biden went on to attend the University of Delaware and then law school at Syracuse University, in part to be near Neilia, whom he had met during a college holiday. They eventually married, and Biden’s political career began shortly after their return to Wilmington. He briefly practised law at a major firm, but disillusioned with representing the rich and powerful, he switched to being a public defender. From there, he ran for – and won – a seat on the New Castle county council. This became his unlikely springboard to the US Senate after no other Democrat expressed interest in challenging the entrenched Republican incumbent. “Joe Biden looks like the photograph of a great statesman in his youth,” a local newspaper columnist gushed. “His eyes sparkle blue, and his teeth shine when he smiles, his cheeks glow, and his body is still boyishly slim.” Joe Biden, 1972 Joe Biden, 1972 The article concluded on a surprisingly sombre note, however: “He had the look – both triumphant and sad – of a young man who believes the world is his, and knows he is yet to be tested.” Those tests would come – none more daunting than the one on that December day, just a few years later. Biden would ultimately accept his Senate seat, taking the oath of office from the Delaware hospital where his two sons were recovering. It marked the beginning of 44 consecutive years in national politics – a stretch that ended, as it began, with the untimely death of a child. In May 2015 Beau Biden died of brain cancer at the age of 46. Like his father, Beau had pursued a career in politics, serving as Delaware’s attorney general, with the prospect of higher offices to come. “He had all the best of me, but with the bugs and flaws engineered out,"" Biden wrote of Beau in his 2017 book about his son’s illness. Biden details how close he came to announcing his own presidential bid in 2015, but that the rawness of his son’s death – and the toll a campaign might take on his family – pushed him to stay out. “I wasn’t sure if I would be able to find the emotional energy, and I knew from previous experience that grief is a process that respects no schedule and no timetable,” he wrote. A lifetime of loss was something Biden learned to live with and overcome, like his stutter - a piece of himself that he found a way to build on. “It's my belief that your empathy is informed by your experience, but you're either born with that sense or you're not,” Senator Casey says. “In Biden’s case, it was both a quality he was born with but also one that was informed by his own personal tragedies that gave him an insight into loss and tragedy and pain that a lot of people never fully understand.” Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009 Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009  On 23 September 1987, Joe Biden stood before a crowd of reporters and announced that he was abandoning the presidential bid he had launched just three months earlier. “I’m angry with myself for having been put in this position – for having put myself in this position of having to make this choice,” he said. “And I am no less frustrated at the environment of presidential politics that makes it so difficult to let the American people measure the whole Joe Biden and not just misstatements that I have made.” It was an ignominious end to Biden’s first attempt at the White House, after his campaign ran aground amid charges of plagiarism and dishonesty. It was a particularly bitter pill to swallow for a man who liked to offer his “word as a Biden” as an iron-clad guarantee of honesty and trustworthiness. The first blow came in a debate in Iowa where Biden, in his closing statement, recited – nearly word for word – a passage from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock’s speech about his working-class upbringing. Although he frequently quoted those lines with attribution, this time Biden didn’t – and an operative from a rival Democratic campaign took note. A plagiarism charge against Biden for a law school paper also resurfaced. He explained that it was the result of an improper citation, but combined with the Kinnock mistake and further allegations of unattributed speech quotes, it cemented for many the perception that there was no substance beneath Biden’s style. “Here I was, getting out of the race with my integrity being questioned,” Biden would later tell his biographer, Jules Witcover.  “It really ate me up. It was the core of who I thought I was, who I know I am, actually.” During his first 14 years in Washington, Biden rebuilt his personal life after the deaths of his wife and daughter. He committed to giving his two living children some semblance of a normal life, and commuted each day from their home in Delaware to Washington. He eventually remarried, to a schoolteacher named Jill Jacobs, with whom he had a child, Ashley. He established himself on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and began to build a national presence. After entertaining a run in 1984, he took the plunge four years later, with a campaign that played heavily on Kennedy-esque themes of generation change. “We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference,” he said at his campaign kick-off. “The clarion call for my generation is not, ‘It’s our turn,’ but rather, ‘It’s our moment of obligation and opportunity’.” The plagiarism row ensured this wouldn’t be Biden’s moment. At the same time he was attempting to keep his presidential campaign afloat, Biden was also chairing Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for a conservative Supreme Court nominee, Robert Bork – a high-profile battle over the ideological direction of the nation’s highest court. It was after a morning session of these hearings in Washington that Biden announced the end to his campaign. The decision turned out to be somewhat of a blessing, however, as a few months later – the night of the Iowa caucuses – he collapsed in a hotel room in Rochester, New York, the result of an intracranial aneurism. For the next six months, he was in and out of hospital. For a time, doctors feared he would have lasting brain damage. It would be 20 years before Biden ran for president again – this time as an elder statesman, not a fresh face. He promised to run the 2008 race on his own terms, after concluding that his 1987 campaign was too heavy on rhetorical flourishes and image-consultants. It was almost as if he was trying to right the wrongs of 20 years earlier. “Any of you who take a look at my life will not be able to conclude that I am not an honourable man,” he said at an Iowa campaign rally in June. “And that’s why I wasn’t afraid to get back into this thing.” The end result – defeat – was the same, however. And right out of the gate, it was Biden’s tongue that betrayed him. The day before he formally announced his candidacy, Biden told a New York Observer reporter that one of his opponents, Barack Obama, was “the first mainstream African American, who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy”. Biden was quickly forced to explain that he did not mean to disparage previous black presidential candidates or belittle Obama personally. It was cited as yet another of Biden’s propensity for gaffes – off-the-cuff remarks that would embarrass or distract from his intended message – which would bedevil his national efforts throughout his career. Although Biden eventually steadied his campaign, he never broke into the top tier. The Democratic race boiled down to a two-way battle between Obama and Hillary Clinton. A riveted US public watched on 11 October, 1991, as Anita Hill, then a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, testified before Joe Biden’s Senate Judiciary Committee that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her on multiple occasions when they both worked for the Reagan administration. Hill accused Thomas of repeatedly making “ugly”, “disgusting”, “dirty” comments to her, creating an intolerable workplace. Thomas, in his testimony, accused his critics of engaging in a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” - alluding to a term that has historicalracist connotations. “Unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you,” he said. “You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the US Senate rather than hung from a tree.” Biden chairs the Clarence Thomas hearings, 1991 Biden, as chair, presided over this spectacle – trying to provide what he described as a fair hearing for both sides. The committee had already voted once on Thomas’s nomination, during which Biden objected to Thomas on ideological grounds. This, however, was different. As the committee reopened its inquiry, the issue was Thomas’ moral character – and two distinct and conflicting accounts of what had taken place a decade earlier. Biden was conscious that he and his fellow senators – all men, all white - were open to charges of racism against only the second black nominee to the Supreme Court, and charges of sexism if they didn’t give Hill’s allegations a full airing. “The Democrats were deathly afraid of seeming to gang up on a black Supreme Court nominee, there's no doubt about that,” says journalist Jill Abramson, who covered the hearings for the Wall Street Journal and co-wrote a book, Strange Justice, on the topic. Instead of being fair, Abramson says, Biden and the Democrats allowed themselves to be “woefully outmanoeuvred” by the committee’s Republican minority, leaving many liberal supporters feeling betrayed. “As the Democrats are wont to do, they wanted to be seen as playing fair,” she says. “But it wasn't playing fair, it was two days of hearings where Anita Hill was trashed by the Republicans who portrayed her as a fantaciser or an erotomaniac.” If Biden was trying to find balance on issues of race and sex during the hearings, it’s a challenge he’s faced throughout his career, with varying levels of success. When Biden first ran for the Senate, he presented himself as an advocate of the civil rights movement. He recalled how, as a teenage volunteer at a swimming centre in a predominantly black neighbourhood of Wilmington, he learned about the unfair treatment ethnic minority groups frequently received in the US. “Every day, it seemed to me, black people got subtle and not-so-subtle reminders that they didn’t quite belong in America,” Biden wrote in his memoir. One of Biden’s first high-profile political battles upon entering the Senate, however, was fought alongside pro-segregation southerners in opposition of the court-ordered practice of transporting students to schools in different neighbourhoods in an effort to address racial segregation. It was a subject that would open Biden to attacks during his run for the 2020 Democratic nomination. “Biden at one time called the issue of bussing a ‘domestic Vietnam’,” says Jason Sokol, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire. “He meant that it was an issue that was tearing the country apart culturally. That's why he shied away from taking a strong stance against integration at that point. He saw that this politically was not a smart thing to do.” While Biden fought conservative judicial and executive appointees he thought were insufficiently dedicated to civil rights, he viewed the role of government as preventing discrimination in the current era, not offering remedies for past wrongs. “I do not buy the concept, popular in the ‘60s which said: ‘We have suppressed the black man for 300 years, and the white man is now far ahead in the ‘race’ for everything our society offers,” he told a newspaper interviewer in 1975. “In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a ‘head start’ or even hold the white man back to even the ‘race’. I don’t buy that."" Biden’s record on crime and law-enforcement issues also opened him up to accusations that he supported policies - designed to address a spike in violent crime and drug offences in the 1980s and early 1990s - that disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups. Sokol says Biden has spent his career inhabiting a “very conflicted, messy middle ground” on racial issues, where he weighed in angering some of his white constituents against ”honouring claims for racial justice”. In 1988, Biden enthusiastically backed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which established tougher mandatory sentences for narcotics like crack cocaine that were more frequently used by ethnic minority groups. He was the architect of a 1994 anti-crime bill that expanded mandatory minimum sentences and greatly increased federal funding for police departments and prisons – a push that since has been seen as a contributing factor in the US having one of the world’s largest incarcerated populations. According to Bob Kerrey, who was one of the 95 senators who voted for the crime bill, being labelled “soft on crime” was politically dangerous in the 1990s. Joe Biden speaks about crime and ""predators on our streets"", 1993 “I didn't know how controversial the crime bill would become,” he says. “The problem with that crime bill is it worked - crime went down. The larger problem is we tolerated racist attitudes of police forces way too long.” Attached to that 1994 crime bill was one of Biden’s most cherished legislative accomplishments - the Violence Against Women Act. The topic of domestic abuse - and how to address it on a federal level – was always among Biden’s top of priorities. “We ripped the Band-Aid off a shameful secret and exposed the ugly truth of domestic violence to the public eye,”Biden told the Huffington Post in 2019. While Biden has offered his legislative efforts as evidence of his support for women’s issues, it has been his personal conduct that has drawn the sharpest attacks. In the days before the formal launch of his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden was accused by a number of women of unwanted physical contact. “I had never experienced anything so blatantly inappropriate and unnerving before,” wrote Lucy Flores, a Nevada Democratic politician, of an encounter she had with Biden in 2014. “The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends, family or romantic partners -and I felt powerless to do anything about it.” While not admitting to any specific misconduct, Biden released a video in which he said he would be “more mindful and respectful” of future conduct that might make women uncomfortable. Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 In March, one of the women who accused Biden of misconduct, Tara Reade, expanded her allegation to sexual assault, saying the then-senator had attacked her in an empty hallway when she worked in his office in 1993. Acquaintances of Reade said she told them about the alleged incident at the time. Two months later, Biden directly addressed the accusation, referencing his support for the Violence Against Women Act. “I recognise my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished,” he said. “So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago. They aren't true.” Reade called on Biden to quit the race.Subsequent investigations by journalists, including aNew York Times report, found inconsistencies in Reade’s accounts. The episode, however, raised uncomfortable issues for Democrats, especially women in the party who had backed the rallying cry of the #MeToo movement, Believe Women. It also drew parallels to the doubts and aspersions directed at Anita Hill decades earlier In recent years – and in light of the Me Too movement that has increased awareness of sexual harassment and assault - Biden has expressed regret over his handling of the Hill episode. “To this day, I regret that I could not come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us,” Biden said during a speech in March 2019. He later directly expressed this to Hill in a phone call. But for her, it was not enough. “He needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw,” she told the New York Times. “There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.” It was deja vu for Joe Biden. On 11 October, 2002, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations committee was once again deciding whether to authorise a Republican president to go to war with Iraq. Eleven years earlier, on the eve of the Gulf War, Biden had voted against giving President George HW Bush the approval to use force against Saddam Hussein’s military. “Before we ask Americans to die for the liberation of Kuwait, I would like to be sure we have tried every possible alternative,” he said during a Foreign Relations committee hearing. “So far, this has not been the case.” Despite Biden’s warning that there could be tens of thousands of US casualties, the resolution passed 52-47 - and the Gulf War ended quickly, with only a handful of American deaths. US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 Biden, along with other Democrats who opposed the war, were frequently branded as “doves” who were soft on national defence. Robert Gates, defence secretary under George W Bush, typified these kind of attacks when he wrote in his 2014 memoir that Biden was “wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". He listed Biden’s support for withdrawal from South Vietnam, opposition to Ronald Reagan’s defence build-up and that fateful vote against the Gulf War resolution, among others. In the years after that vote, Biden staked out more hawkish positions on international affairs, including backing US involvement in the Balkan civil wars, bombing in Iraq and the invasion of Afghanistan. When President George W Bush began moving toward a new war with Iraq, alleging it possessed weapons of mass destruction, Biden was a vocal supporter. “I do not believe this is a rush to war,” he said. “I believe it’s a march to peace and security.” Biden was among the 77 senators to vote for that Iraq War resolution – joining numerous other Democrats with presidential ambitions, including John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Biden speaks at the Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on Iraq, 2002 “It was kind of a simple calculation,” says Mark Weisbrot, who directed a documentary on Biden’s Iraq War support. “They knew there was a risk that if you were against the war and the war turned out to be a ‘success’ you could lose some swing votes. But if you voted for the war, and it turned out to be a disaster, which it did, you really didn't lose much because your base didn't have anywhere to go.” As the war dragged on, however, Biden’s war vote did become a political liability – this time with Democratic voters who increasingly saw the US occupation as a quagmire. Biden, after initially defending his vote, began to back away. He deals with this episode in a chapter on the Iraq War - titled “My Mistake” - in his 2007 memoir. Writing about those in the Bush administration who pushed for war, he wrote: “I vastly underestimated their disingenuousness and incompetence”. If Biden in the years after his Gulf War vote tried to compensate for his perceived error by moving to the right, he moved left after the Iraq War. He opposed a surge of US forces in Iraq, calling for US withdrawal and partitioning of the nation. As vice-president, he counselled against an increase in US forces in Afghanistan and advised against the Osama bin Laden raid. Shortly after announcing his 2020 presidential bid, Biden advocated ending US support for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen civil war. During the Obama presidency, Biden had an active role in carrying out the administration’s foreign policy objectives. Senator Casey recalls meeting the vice-president during a visit to Iraq, where they discussed his efforts to work with the leaders of the various governing factions. “I could tell by listening to his recitations from the interactions that he had learned a lot about these people as personalities,” Casey says. “It was a really valuable lesson in diplomacy. It wasn't just learning the substance of a white paper about a particular country or a particular foreign policy issue, but you literally have to get to know the individuals.” Biden’s other responsibilities included pressuring Congress to back nuclear negotiations with Iran, building international support for the Paris climate accords, representing US interests in China and encouraging democratic reforms in Ukraine. These last two areas – China and Ukraine – have become a focus for attacks from Donald Trump and Republicans, who have criticised Biden for being too close to China, and attempted to make a case that Biden’s Ukraine activities were to protect his son, Hunter, who had business ties to the nation. Last year, Hunter insisted he had done ""nothing wrong"" but admitted to ""poor judgment"",leaving him open to political attacks. Biden’s Iraq War vote again came up in the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, but nearly two decades later it lacked the political punch it once had. At the end of Biden’s 2008 presidential run, it seemed the senator would return to Washington and finish his career in Congress or, perhaps, as an official in a future Democratic administration. On 23 August, however, Barack Obama selected him as his vice-presidential running mate. The choice surprised many. Biden’s home state, Delaware, was not an electoral battleground. With more than three decades in Washington, he wasn’t the kind of outsider who fitted with Obama’s message of change. “There was this sense that they were very, very different,” says Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and author of a book on the vice-presidency. “Obama was very thoughtful and careful choosing his words, and Biden was always sticking his foot in his mouth. The one thing Biden told Obama when he agreed to do the job was that he wasn't going to change his brand. He said, ‘I am what I am’.” According to former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who ran for president in 2008 and was also on Obama’s vice-presidential short list, Obama and Biden developed a rapport on the Democratic primary campaign trail. “I knew in the debates they had a personal chemistry,” Richardson says. “Obama needed a senior foreign policy person on the ticket, but also I could tell they liked each other a lot.” A few hours after announcing his pick, Obama took the stage in Springfield, Illinois to introduce Biden to the gathered crowd. Biden is announced as Obama's running mate, 2008 “Joe Biden is that rare mix – for decades he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn’t changed him,” he said. “He is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track.” Obama would tick through the pivotal moments of Biden’s life – his stutter, the death of his wife and child, his brain aneurysm, the 1994 crime bill and his involvement in negotiating an end to the Balkan civil war – all in support of his choice. In the early days of the Obama presidency Biden frequently chafed at the White House’s directions. For more than 30 years, Biden – as a senator – ran his own political fiefdom. Now he was required to do someone else’s bidding. “It was galling for him at first,” says Bower. “It was this kind of a push-and-pull relationship.” There were moments when Biden broke from administration policy, most notably when he announced his support for gay marriage in 2012, frustrating a White House intent on message control. At other times Obama tasked Biden with important duties – shepherding the 2009 stimulus bill through Congress and overseeing the drawdown of US troops in Iraq. By the time Biden finished his eight years in the vice-presidency, he and Obama had formed a strong friendship. Bower recounts an interview she had with Biden during which Biden became visibly emotional when talking about Obama speaking at Beau’s funeral. “They were kind of, as hokey as it sounds, like a family during those eight years,” says Bower. “It was kind of a father-son relationship, too, because of their age difference.” In a surprise ceremony in the final days of his presidency, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest civilian honour. After joking about their “bromance”, Obama turned serious. “To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretence, services without self-regard and to live life fully,” he said. The speech had the tenor of a benediction, marking the end of a long career in public service. A year and a half earlier, Obama pressured Biden not to challenge Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination. “The president was convinced I could not beat Hillary,” Biden wrote in his 2017 memoir, “and he worried that a long primary fight would split the party and leave the Democratic nominee vulnerable in the general election.” The Democrats had a long and acrimonious primary fight anyway – between Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And a vulnerable Clinton lost the general election. Four years later, Biden dispatched Sanders more easily than Clinton had and the former vice-president finally secured the Democratic nomination. His success was due, in no small part, to his service as a dutiful deputy to Obama, which won him overwhelming support among black Democrats. “Let me explain something to you about Joe Biden,” writes Laurie Goff in a Facebook post that captured this sentiment. “This old rich white man played second fiddle to a black man. Not just any black man but a younger black man, a smart black man. Not just for a day. Not one, not two but eight years.” “This is what showing up and being an ally looks like,” she concludes. “When black people say they know Joe,this is how we know.” In what could be seen as an acknowledgement of this support, Biden selected a former presidential rival, Kamala Harris, to be his vice-presidential running mate, giving a black woman the kind of stepping stone to the presidency that Obama had provided him eight years earlier. Once again the Democrats had a multi-generational, multi-ethnic presidential ticket. As Obama’s “wingman”, Biden was able to get a foothold in the White House. His third try for the top office, after more than 40 years of political ambition buffeted by public and personal adversity, was his last shot at the prize.

UK bans Denmark visitors over mink Covid-19 fears,"The UK has imposed a ban on non-UK citizens coming from Denmark amid concerns over a new coronavirus strain that has spread from mink to humans. UK citizens can return from Denmark - but will have to isolate along with all members of their household for 14 days. Cabin crew are also no longer exempt from the rules, which Ryanair described as a ""bizarre and baseless"" move. The transport secretary announced the changes less than two hours before they took effect on Saturday. Writing on Twitter, Grant Shapps said:,external""This decision to act quickly follows on from health authorities in Denmark reporting widespread outbreaks of coronavirus in mink farms. Keeping the UK public safe remains our top priority."" Meanwhile, a further 413 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according tothe latest daily figures from the government,external. It brings the overall UK death toll, by this measure, to 48,888. Denmark's Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod called Mr Shapps' travel announcement a ""very drastic step"" and said he had discussed them with UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Saturday. Mr Kofod said Danish health authorities were ""working closely"" with international health organisations to share information and ""reaching out"" to ensure any ""relevant knowledge"" is passed to UK officials. Officials will contact anyone in the UK who has been in Denmark in the last fortnight to make sure they also self-isolate. The Department for Health and Social Care estimates that between 300 and 500 people have arrived in the UK from Denmark in the last 14 days. Denmark had been taken off theUK coronavirus travel corridors list,externalon Friday after it first became apparent the mutated form of coronavirus was present in the country. It meant any passengers arriving in the UK from Denmark would need to self-isolate after their arrival. Coronavirus: Can I still go on holiday? What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? The latest rules, which took effect at 04:00 GMT on Saturday, ban foreign visitors who have been in or transited through Denmark and also expand the self-isolation requirements for returning Britons and residents to include all members of their households. The changes also mean any cabin crew and pilots in Denmark are no longer exempt from quarantine rules, and must self-isolate along with the rest of their household for 14 days. Crew who were in Denmark before the deadline in the last seven days are not legally required to self-isolate, but the DfT is strongly recommending they do so. Ryanair said the quarantine for cabin crew was ""bizarre and baseless"", in part because crew members ""never leave the aircraft during their 25-minute turnaround on the ground in Copenhagen airport"". In a statement the airline said it had no choice but to cancel all flights to and from Denmark while the rules remain in place, and urged Mr Shapps to reverse the decision. Scottish airline Loganair said that due to government restrictionsit has suspended flights between Scotland and Denmark,externalfrom 9 to 22 November. On Sunday morning, the government told lorry drivers and freight handlers returning to the UK from Denmark that they must also self-isolate for two weeks. All direct passenger flights and ships carrying freight (as well as passengers) from Denmark have also been stopped. Denmark was the UK's 23rd largest export market in 2019, worth Â£6.8bn for goods and services. A mutated strain of coronavirus that has spread to humans has triggered culls of millions of mink across Denmark and a lockdown in some parts of the country. More than 200 people have been infected with strains related to mink, according to reports. Mink kept in large numbers on farms have caught the virus from infected workers. And, in a small number of cases, the virus has crossed back from mink to humans, picking up genetic changes on the way. Mutations in some of the strains, which have infected a small number of people, are reported to involve the spike protein of the virus, which is targeted by some, but not all, vaccines being developed. The coronavirus, like all viruses, mutates over time, but there is no evidence that any of the mutations pose an increased danger to people. The World Health Organization has said it is too early to jump to conclusions. You can read more from Helenhere. The Denmark travel ban and new requirements will be reviewed after a week, the DfT said. A DfT spokeswoman said the government was working closely with international partners to understand the changes in the virus that have been reported in Denmark and conducting a programme of further research in the UK ""to inform our risk assessments"". This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Mink-related mutations of the Covid have been detected in 200 people in Denmark, most of them are connected to farms in Denmark's North Jutland region. The Danish authorities have described the situation as very serious - and haveordered the cull of all mink in the country- thought to number around 17 million. Danish authorities have said a lockdown will be introduced in some areas over the coronavirus mutation. Leaving home to go on holiday is currently banned for most people in the UK.

Biden supporters have been gathering in the streets on New York and other cities to celebrate victory. Mr Trump has drawn more than 70 million, the second-highest tally in history. President Trump had falsely declared himself the winner of the election when vote counting was unfinished. He has since alleged irregularities in counting, but has not presented any evidence of election fraud. After Mr Biden was projected to win he remained defiant, saying Mr Biden was ""falsely posing as the winner"" and insisting the election was ""far from over"". His campaign has filed a barrage of lawsuits in various states. This video can not be played Donald Trump is seen playing golf as Joe Biden's win was announced The response from senior Republicans has been muted. Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted that ""the media doesn't decide who wins elections, voters do"". But Senator Mitt Romney, a critic of Mr Trump, congratulated Mr Biden and Ms Harris. He said he and his wife ""know both of them as people of good will and admirable character"". 'Let's work together!' - How world reacted to Biden win The election was fought as coronavirus cases and deaths continued to rise across the United States, with President Trump arguing a Biden presidency would result in lockdowns and economic gloom. Joe Biden accused the president of failing to impose sufficient measures to control the spread of Covid-19. At the age of 78, Mr Biden will be the oldest president in American history. Joe Biden's projected victory after four days of painstaking vote-counting is the denouement of an extraordinary campaign, conducted during a devastating pandemic and widespread social unrest, and against a most unconventional of incumbents. In his third try for the presidency, Mr Biden found a way to navigate the political obstacles and claim a win that, while perhaps narrow in the electoral college tally, is projected to surpass Mr Trump's overall national total by at least four million votes. With his projected victory, Joe Biden becomes the oldest man ever elected to the White House. He brings with him the first woman vice-president, whose multi-ethnic heritage carries with it numerous other firsts. Mr Biden can now begin the arduous task of planning the transition to his new administration. He will have just under three months to assemble a cabinet, determine policy priorities and prepare to govern a nation facing numerous crises and sharply divided along partisan lines. Joe Biden has been dreaming of the White House for most of his 50 years in the public arena. With this prize of a lifetime, however, come the challenges of a lifetime. Usually the losing candidate concedes but Mr Trump has vowed to contest the election results on several fronts. A recount will be held in Georgia, where the margins are tight, and Mr Trump wants the same in Wisconsin. He has also vowed to take legal action to the Supreme Court, alleging voting fraud without evidence. If the election result is challenged, it would require legal teams to challenge this in the state courts. State judges would then need to uphold the challenge and order a recount, and Supreme Court justices could then be asked to overturn a ruling. Read more: Could the election be decided in courts? Meanwhile, votes in some states are continuing to be counted and results are never official until final certification, which occurs in each state in the weeks following the election. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? This must be done before 538 chosen officials (electors) from the Electoral College - which officially decides who wins the election - meet in their state capitals to vote on 14 December. The electors' votes usually mirror the popular vote in each state. However, in some states this is not a formal requirement. The new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January after a transition period to give them time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans. The handover of power takes place at a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC. After the ceremony, the new president makes their way to the White House to begin their four-year term in office. Mr Biden ran for the White House twice before. In 1988 he withdrew from the race after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British Labour Party, Neil Kinnock. In 2008, he tried again to get the Democratic nomination before dropping out and joining Barack Obama's ticket. His eight years as vice-president allowed him to lay claim to much of Mr Obama's legacy, including passage of the Affordable Care Act. In 1974, Biden was the youngest US senator The six-term senator from Delaware was first elected in 1972. Early in his career, he sided with southern segregationists in opposing court-ordered school bussing to racially integrate public schools. He was also a fierce advocate of a 1994 anti-crime bill that many on the left now say encouraged lengthy sentences and mass incarceration. Joe Biden lost his son Beau (left) in 2015 Most Americans know that Joe Biden's life has been marked by personal tragedy - experiences he often refers to. In 1972, he lost his first wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident. He famously took the oath of office for his first Senate term from the hospital room of his toddler sons Beau and Hunter, who both survived the accident. In 2015, Beau died of brain cancer at the age of 46, and Joe Biden said this played a role in his decision not run for president in 2016. Watch the moment BBC projects Biden victory What happens now?

What's the science of mink and coronavirus?,"Mink outbreaks are a ""spillover"" from the human pandemic Mutations in coronavirus have triggered culls of millions of farmed mink in Denmark. Part of the country has been put under lockdown after Danish authorities found genetic changes they say might undermine the effectiveness of future Covid-19 vaccines. More than 200 people have been infected with mink-related coronavirus. And the UK has imposed an immediate ban on all visitors from Denmark amid concerns about the new strain. Covid travel ban for visitors to UK from Denmark. Danish scientists are particularly concerned about one mink-related strain of the virus, found in 12 people, which they say is less sensitive to protective antibodies, raising concerns about vaccine development. The World Health Organization has said the reports are concerning, but further studies are needed to understand the implications for treatments and vaccines. ""We need to wait and see what the implications are but I don't think we should come to any conclusions about whether this  particular mutation is going to impact vaccine efficacy,"" said chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan. Officials arrive at a mink farm to put down the animals The coronavirus, like all viruses, mutates over time and there is no evidence that any of the mutations found in Denmark pose an increased danger to people. Dr Marisa Peyre, an epidemiologist from the French research institute Cirad, said the development was ""worrying"", but we don't yet know the full picture. ""Every time the virus spreads between animals it changes, and if it changes too much from the one that is circulating within humans at the moment, that might mean that any vaccine or treatment that will be produced soon might not work as well as it should do,"" she explained. Covid: Denmark removed from UK's travel corridor list Coronavirus: Denmark imposes lockdowns amid mink covid fears Coronavirus: Denmark to cull millions of mink Mink, like their relatives, ferrets, are susceptible to respiratory viruses This is a very unusual chain of events: a virus that originally came from a wild animal, probably a bat, jumped into humans, possibly via an unknown animal host, sparking a pandemic. Coronavirus: This is not the last pandemic Coronavirus: The race to find the source in wildlife Coronavirus: Calls to shut down 'dirty fur trade'. Mink kept in large numbers on mink farms have caught the virus from infected workers. And, in a small number of cases, the virus has ""spilled back"" from mink to humans, picking up genetic changes on the way. Mutations in some mink-related strains involve the spike protein of the virus, which is targeted by some vaccines being developed. ""If the mutation is on a specific protein that is being currently targeted by the vaccine developers to trigger an immune response in humans then it means that if this new virus strain comes out of the mink back into the humans, even with vaccination, the humans will start spreading it and the vaccine will not protect,"" Dr Peyre told BBC News. More than 50 million mink a year are bred for their fur, mainly in China, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland. Outbreaks have been reported on fur farms in the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Italy and the US, and millions of animals have had to be culled. Millions of mink are being culled in Denmark Mink, like their close relatives, ferrets, are known to be susceptible to coronavirus, and like humans, they can show a range of symptoms, from no signs of illness at all to severe problems, such as pneumonia. Scientists suspect the virus spreads in mink farms through infectious droplets, on feed or bedding, or in dust containing droppings. Mink have caught the virus from humans, but genetic detective work has shown that in a small number of cases the virus seems to have passed the other way, with the virus spreading from mink back to humans. Mink have become ""reservoirs for the virus"" and surveillance is required in other wild and domestic animals that may be susceptible, said Prof Joanne Santini of University College London. ""Mink is the extreme but it could be happening out there and we just don't know about it and that's something we need to be checking,"" she told BBC News. ""What we do know is that the mink are picking up the virus from people; they can be infected and they are spreading it between themselves and it's come back to humans."" This video can not be played Scientists believe another pandemic will happen during our lifetime Scientists in Denmark are carrying out genetic studies on mink-related strains, and the genetic data has been shared with other researchers, to allow further investigation. ""We need to find out where these mutations are and we need to see what effect that has on transmission of the virus and how infectious it is, because if it is changing and being more infectious or having a broader host range, then that's really quite scary but it might not be, because we don't know,"" said Prof Santini. Some scientists have called for new restrictions on mink production, saying mink farming ""impedes our response and recovery from the pandemic"". In a recent letter tothe journal, Science,external, three scientists, from Denmark, China and Malaysia, wrote: ""It is urgent to monitor, restrict, and - where possible - ban mink production."" The WHO has called on all countries to step up surveillance and tighten biosecurity measures around mink farms. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

How would Biden change US foreign policy?,"The world according to President Trump has been one of ""America First"" nationalism, ditching international agreements that he believed gave the US a raw deal. It was transactional, disruptive and unilateralist. It was also personal and erratic, shaped by his gut feelings and relationships with leaders, and driven by his Twitter feed. The world according to Joe Biden is a much more traditional take on America's role and interests, grounded in international institutions established after World War Two, and based on shared western democratic values. It is one of global alliances in which America leads free nations in combating transnational threats. How Trump can still win the election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? What could change under Biden? A few things stand out - the approach to allies, to climate change, and to the Middle East. DEALING WITH ALLIES President Trump has praised autocrats and insulted allies. At the top of Joe Biden's to-do list is repairing strained relationships, especially in Nato, and rejoining global alliances. A Biden administration would also return to the World Health Organization and seek to lead an international coronavirus response. Democratic challenger Joe Biden is expected to reach out to global institutions Mr Biden's campaign framed this as a major reset to rescue America's damaged image and to rally democracies against what it sees as a rising tide of authoritarianism. Why US election matters so much to Germans But it might be more style than substance, counters Danielle Pletka of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. She argues that the Trump administration has achieved a lot on the global stage, just with sharp elbows. ""Have we lost friends to go to parties with? You bet,"" she says. ""Nobody wants to go to parties with Donald Trump. Have we lost power and influence on the metrics that actually have mattered for the last 70 years? No."" CLIMATE CHANGE Speaking of substance, Joe Biden says he will make fighting climate change a priority and rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, which is one of the international accords that Donald Trump dumped. President Donald Trump has used ""sharp elbows"" on the global stage On this issue the two men are polar opposites. Mr Trump sees tackling global warming as a threat to the economy. He has promoted fossil fuels and rolled back scores of environmental protections and climate regulations. Five things Trump has said about the environment What does Trump actually believe on climate change? Mr Biden is promoting an ambitious $2 trillion dollar plan to achieve goals for cutting emissions. He says he would do this by building a clean energy economy, creating millions of jobs in the process. IRAN Joe Biden says he's prepared to rejoin another international accord abandoned by President Trump - the deal that gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for scaling down its nuclear programme. The Trump administration withdrew in 2018, saying the arms control agreement was too narrow to cope with the threats posed by Iran, and too weak in its limits on nuclear activity, which expire over time. It re-imposed sanctions and continues to pile on economic pressure, recently blacklisting almost all of Iran's financial sector. In response Iran has stopped observing some of the restrictions on its nuclear activity. Iran nuclear deal: Dead or just dying? Mr Biden says this ""maximum pressure"" policy has failed, emphasising that it led to a significant escalation in tensions, that allies have rejected it, and that Iran is now closer to a nuclear weapon than it was when Trump came to office. He says he will rejoin the nuclear accord if Iran returns to strict compliance - but he wouldn't lift sanctions until then. Mr Biden would then negotiate to address concerns he shares with the president. YEMEN Mr Biden would also end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The high civilian death toll has built strong opposition to US involvement from the left wing of the party and a growing number of lawmakers in Congress. Saudi Arabia is a close US ally Saudi Arabia is President Trump's closest Arab ally, a cornerstone of the anti-Iran alliance. Analysts see Mr Biden stepping back from Mr Trump's largely uncritical embrace of the Gulf monarchy. Yemen crisis: Why is there a war? ""I do think that on the Middle East, there will be a sea change,"" says Ms Pletka, ""a more pro-Iran policy and a less pro-Saudi policy, for sure."" ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT Joe Biden welcomed President Trump's agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Like the Democratic old guard, Mr Biden is a staunch supporter and long-time defender of Israel - the word occupation is not included in the party's foreign policy platform. But he is unlikely to adopt the Trump administration's policies towards the occupied West Bank. These include a declaration that Israeli settlements do not violate international law, and tolerance of - if not enthusiasm for - Israeli plans to unilaterally annex parts of the territory. Israel's borders explained in maps The Democratic Party's left wing, which has a much more developed and assertive foreign policy coalition than in previous years, is pushing for greater action on Palestinian rights. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is a defender of Israel, but his policy on the West Bank is likely to differ from the current one ""I think we've had much stronger engagement from Palestinian rights advocates, Palestinian Americans, Arab Americans,"" says Matt Duss, a foreign policy adviser to Mr Biden's one-time rival, Bernie Sanders, ""but also a number of Jewish American groups who understand that ending the occupation is a key issue for United States foreign policy."" So that's something to watch. A simple guide to the US election Who will be the next US president? You decide Why we might not get a result on election night Has Trump delivered on his promises? Full coverage of the US election Like President Trump, Mr Biden wants to end the forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, although he would keep a small troop presence in both to help battle terrorism. Nor would he slash the Pentagon budget or suspend drone strikes, despite pressure from the left. And when it comes to geopolitical adversaries, there may be less of a difference than you'd expect. RUSSIA The relationship at the top would certainly change. President Trump often seemed ready to personally forgive Vladimir Putin for behaviour that violated international norms. But the Trump administration has been pretty tough on Russia, punishing it with sanctions. That would probably continue under a Biden presidency, without the mixed messaging. There could be little change in America's nation-to-nation relationship with Russia The former vice-president bluntly told CNN he believed Russia was ""an opponent."" He's promised a forceful response for election interference, and for alleged bounty payments to the Taliban to target American troops in Afghanistan, something Mr Trump hasn't addressed. At the same time Mr Biden has made clear that he wants to work with Moscow to preserve what's left of the arms control treaties constraining their nuclear arsenals. President Trump has pulled out of two, accusing Russia of cheating, and is trying to negotiate the extension of a third  which expires in February. Biden has committed to extending it without conditions if he's elected. CHINA In 2017, Mr Trump described how he and Xi Jinping bonded over chocolate cake. But since then MR Trump has traded his friendship with the Chinese president for accusations about spreading the coronavirus, for harsh measures and a new Cold War rhetoric. In fact there is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues. The question is about tactics. Mr Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices,"" but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals. Who Russia, China and Iran want to win US election The sharp elbows of the Trump administration have been successful in winning global support for a boycott of Chinese communications technology. That's part of a serious escalation in US efforts to push back against Beijing on many fronts, which has brought relations to their lowest point in decades. This campaign is led by Trump's China hawks - strategic competition they call it, but strategic confrontation is how some analysts describe it. Joe Biden would more actively seek areas of cooperation with a rising China. He says he wants to revive American leadership. But the world has also changed in the past four years, with the robust return of great power competition and recent polls showing America's reputation has plummeted even amongst staunch allies, those Mr Biden would aspire to lead.

Coronavirus: Denmark to cull millions of mink,"There are more than 1,000 mink farms in Denmark Denmark will cull all its mink - as many as 17 million - after a mutated form of coronavirus that can spread to humans was found on mink farms. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the mutated virus posed a ""risk to the effectiveness"" of a future Covid-19 vaccine. Denmark is the world's biggest producer of mink fur and its main export markets are China and Hong Kong. The culling began late last month, after many mink cases were detected. Warning: you may find a picture of dead mink lower down disturbing Coronavirus cases have also been detected in farmed mink in the Netherlands and Spain since the pandemic began in Europe. But cases are spreading fast in Denmark - 207 mink farms in Jutland are affected - and at least five cases of the new virus strain were found. Twelve people had become infected, the authorities said. Coronavirus: A hunt for the 'missing link' species Prime Minister Frederiksen described the situation as ""very, very serious"". Danish police and army personnel will help to carry out the mass cull. Ms Frederiksen cited a government report which said the mutated virus had been found to weaken the body's ability to form antibodies, potentially making the current vaccines under development for Covid-19 ineffective. ""We have a great responsibility towards our own population, but with the mutation that has now been found, we have an even greater responsibility for the rest of the world as well,"" she told a news conference. Since the start of the pandemic Denmark has reported 52,265 human cases of Covid-19 and 733 deaths, data from Johns Hopkins University shows. By BBC Environment correspondent Helen Briggs More than 50 million mink a year are bred for their fur, mainly in China, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland. Outbreaks have been reported in fur farms in the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Sweden and the US, and millions of animals have had to be culled. Mink, like their close relatives ferrets, are known to be susceptible to coronavirus, and like humans, they can show a range of symptoms, from no signs of illness at all, to severe problems, such as pneumonia. Mink become infected through catching the virus from humans. But genetic detective work has shown that in a small number of cases, in the Netherlands and now Denmark, the virus seems to have passed the other way, from mink to humans. The big public health concern is that any mutation to the coronavirus as it passes between mink and humans might be enough to stop human vaccines working, if and when they become available. Some scientists are now calling for a complete ban on mink production, saying it impedes our response and recovery from the pandemic. Coronavirus: Calls to shut down 'dirty fur trade' Denmark began culling last month when mink were found to have the virus Teams in protective kit for the cull - usually mink are gassed with carbon monoxide Mink at more than 1,000 Danish farms are to be culled. The World Health Organization says it is discussing the outbreak with the Danish authorities. Spain culled 100,000 mink in July after cases were detected at a farm in AragÃ³n province, and tens of thousands of the animals were slaughtered in the Netherlands following outbreaks on farms there. Studies are under way to find out how and why mink have been able to catch and spread the infection.

UK bans Denmark visitors over mink Covid-19 fearsAnd UK citizens returning from the country must isolate with all other household members for 14 days.UK,"The UK has imposed a ban on non-UK citizens coming from Denmark amid concerns over a new coronavirus strain that has spread from mink to humans. UK citizens can return from Denmark - but will have to isolate along with all members of their household for 14 days. Cabin crew are also no longer exempt from the rules, which Ryanair described as a ""bizarre and baseless"" move. The transport secretary announced the changes less than two hours before they took effect on Saturday. Writing on Twitter, Grant Shapps said:,external""This decision to act quickly follows on from health authorities in Denmark reporting widespread outbreaks of coronavirus in mink farms. Keeping the UK public safe remains our top priority."" Meanwhile, a further 413 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according tothe latest daily figures from the government,external. It brings the overall UK death toll, by this measure, to 48,888. Denmark's Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod called Mr Shapps' travel announcement a ""very drastic step"" and said he had discussed them with UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Saturday. Mr Kofod said Danish health authorities were ""working closely"" with international health organisations to share information and ""reaching out"" to ensure any ""relevant knowledge"" is passed to UK officials. Officials will contact anyone in the UK who has been in Denmark in the last fortnight to make sure they also self-isolate. The Department for Health and Social Care estimates that between 300 and 500 people have arrived in the UK from Denmark in the last 14 days. Denmark had been taken off theUK coronavirus travel corridors list,externalon Friday after it first became apparent the mutated form of coronavirus was present in the country. It meant any passengers arriving in the UK from Denmark would need to self-isolate after their arrival. Coronavirus: Can I still go on holiday? What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? The latest rules, which took effect at 04:00 GMT on Saturday, ban foreign visitors who have been in or transited through Denmark and also expand the self-isolation requirements for returning Britons and residents to include all members of their households. The changes also mean any cabin crew and pilots in Denmark are no longer exempt from quarantine rules, and must self-isolate along with the rest of their household for 14 days. Crew who were in Denmark before the deadline in the last seven days are not legally required to self-isolate, but the DfT is strongly recommending they do so. Ryanair said the quarantine for cabin crew was ""bizarre and baseless"", in part because crew members ""never leave the aircraft during their 25-minute turnaround on the ground in Copenhagen airport"". In a statement the airline said it had no choice but to cancel all flights to and from Denmark while the rules remain in place, and urged Mr Shapps to reverse the decision. Scottish airline Loganair said that due to government restrictionsit has suspended flights between Scotland and Denmark,externalfrom 9 to 22 November. On Sunday morning, the government told lorry drivers and freight handlers returning to the UK from Denmark that they must also self-isolate for two weeks. All direct passenger flights and ships carrying freight (as well as passengers) from Denmark have also been stopped. Denmark was the UK's 23rd largest export market in 2019, worth Â£6.8bn for goods and services. A mutated strain of coronavirus that has spread to humans has triggered culls of millions of mink across Denmark and a lockdown in some parts of the country. More than 200 people have been infected with strains related to mink, according to reports. Mink kept in large numbers on farms have caught the virus from infected workers. And, in a small number of cases, the virus has crossed back from mink to humans, picking up genetic changes on the way. Mutations in some of the strains, which have infected a small number of people, are reported to involve the spike protein of the virus, which is targeted by some, but not all, vaccines being developed. The coronavirus, like all viruses, mutates over time, but there is no evidence that any of the mutations pose an increased danger to people. The World Health Organization has said it is too early to jump to conclusions. You can read more from Helenhere. The Denmark travel ban and new requirements will be reviewed after a week, the DfT said. A DfT spokeswoman said the government was working closely with international partners to understand the changes in the virus that have been reported in Denmark and conducting a programme of further research in the UK ""to inform our risk assessments"". This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Mink-related mutations of the Covid have been detected in 200 people in Denmark, most of them are connected to farms in Denmark's North Jutland region. The Danish authorities have described the situation as very serious - and haveordered the cull of all mink in the country- thought to number around 17 million. Danish authorities have said a lockdown will be introduced in some areas over the coronavirus mutation. Leaving home to go on holiday is currently banned for most people in the UK. In England, where a new national lockdown came into force on Thursday, people are still allowed to travel overseas for work or education trips.

"Mass moo returns to town for second lockdownBovine bellowing will return on the doorsteps of residents in Belper, Derbyshire, for four weeks.","Jasper Ward came up with the idea in March for people to moo in unison from their homes and gardens A town's mass moo to bring positivity and fight boredom during the first lockdown has made a comeback. For 83 days from March, hundreds of residents in Belper, Derbyshire gathered on doorsteps and leant out windows at 18:30 for a two-minute moo. For the next four weeks, bellow organiser, Jasper Ward said they had vowed to return. He said it would ""give people something to look forward to in these long dark nights"". The chorus which became known as The Belper Moo ended on June 14, the night before non-essential shops reopened in England. This video can not be played The bovine bellowing went global ""Back then it was all very novel, the sun was shining and the togetherness was very intoxicating,"" said Mr Ward. ""We were all cheering Captain Tom and applauding the NHS, but eight months on everyone's stamina has been really tested and we are all a bit worn out with it, but it's defiance in the face of that overbearing gloom."" The original concept of the moo was to have fun and be silly but Mr Ward said it had brought the town together. ""It's good fun to be moo-ing again but I really wished we weren't,"" he added. ""Once the weather really turns there is every chance that some people behind closed doors won't interact with another person that day or step out the house, so if nothing else, it gives them a reason to open a window and let off some steam or connect with a neighbour for a few seconds."" A Facebook page has been used to share photos and videos of the moo-ing Belper, which also boasts a quirkyMr Potato Head statue, even saw people in Australia, Japan and the US joining them with the moo. Mr Ward said: ""You can't see people but last night a man who lives opposite came out. I recognised his moo through the darkness."" Back in April, resident Isabel Kennedy said the moo had become ""the highlight of my day."" ""It brought our little four house, Quarry Road comoo-nity together in a way that sustained beyond lockdown and is tighter than ever now.""

Johnson congratulates Biden on US election win,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is among politicians to have congratulated Joe Biden on his US election win. He said he looked forward to ""working closely"" with the new president-elect. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer praised Mr Biden's campaign of ""decency, integrity, compassion and strength"". Former Home Secretary Sajid Javid said Biden's win was ""good news"" for the UK in terms of closer co-operation on climate change, free trade and fighting the Covid pandemic. He told Sky News' Ridge on Sunday that Mr Johnson's closeness to Donald Trump had been ""overstated"" and the Conservative government actually had more in common, in terms of policy, with his Democratic rival. Biden wins â BBC projects White House victory Follow all the latest live updates Why does the US election matter to people in UK? What Biden's victory means for rest of world Vote counting continues after Tuesday's election, but the BBC projected on Saturday thatMr Biden has surpassed 270 electoral college votes - the threshold required to win. Donald Trump's campaign has indicated the incumbent president does not plan to concede. Mr Johnson said in a statement on Twitter on Saturday,external: ""The US is our important ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security."" Mr Johnson, who has yet to meet Mr Biden, also congratulated the president-elect's running mate, Kamala Harris, on ""her historic achievement"". She will be the country's first female vice-president. Foreign SecretaryDominic Raab said,externalMr Trump had ""fought hard"" but that he was looking forward to working with the new administration. ""The UK-US friendship has always been a force for good in the world,"" he added. They won't be seen as natural allies: Joe Biden, the seasoned Democrat, and Boris Johnson, the enthusiastic Brexiteer. In looking at how their future relationship might work, it's worth considering the past. Specifically that seminal year, 2016, when Donald Trump won the White House and the UK voted to leave the EU. Both Mr Biden and his boss at the time, Barack Obama, made no secret they preferred another outcome on Brexit. The UK government's recent manoeuvres in relation to Brexit have not gone down well with key Democrats and the Irish lobby, including the US president-elect. Mr Biden said he would not allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit"" if elected - stating that any future US-UK trade deal would be contingent upon respecting the Good Friday Agreement. The ""special relationship"" could, feasibly, face a downgrade. However, the two men may yet find some common ground. Read more: What Biden's victory means for rest of world The leader of the Liberal Democrats,Sir Ed Davey, said,externalthe result was ""a great victory for social justice, climate action and democracy"". First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon also shared her congratulations, while SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the win ""gives great hope to progressives here in Scotland and around the world"". First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford tweeted,externalthat he was looking forward to working with Mr Biden ""to build on the strong links between Wales and USA"". The UK is currently in trade talks with both the US and the EU. During the campaign, Mr Biden warned that he would not accept any agreement that imperilled the Good Friday Agreement and peace in Northern Ireland. While vice-president, he signalled his opposition to Brexit. Shadow international development secretary Emily Thornberry told Sky News that it would ""very difficult but not impossible"" for a government led by staunch Brexiteer Mr Johnson to develop a close relationship with the president-elect. Joe Biden visited the UK as vice-president in 2013, when David Cameron was prime minister She told Ridge on Sunday the UK's primary focus must be on completing an agreement with the EU. ""The reality is getting an all-singing, all-dancing trade deal is something that takes many years and is quite complex,"" she said. ""Let's make sure we have a proper deal with the EU...and that we are not undermining the Good Friday Agreement and then we could move to work with the US in other areas where we could increase trade."" The BBC's projection of Mr Biden's victory is based on the unofficial results from states that have already finished counting their votes, and the expected results from states like Wisconsin where the count is continuing. Mr Biden has won more than 73 million votes so far, the most ever for a US presidential candidate. Mr Trump has drawn almost 70 million, the second-highest tally in history.

"Time for US to unite, President-elect Biden saysThe BBC projects he has beaten Donald Trump to the White House after winning Pennsylvania.US Election 2020","This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Joe Biden has won the race to become the next US president, defeating Donald Trump following a cliff-hanger vote count after Tuesday's election. The BBC projects that Mr Biden has won the key battleground of Pennsylvania, propelling him over the 270 electoral college vote threshold required to clinch the White House. The Trump campaign has indicated their candidate does not plan to concede. Mr Biden said it was now time for America to ""unite and heal"". ""With the campaign over, it's time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation,"" he said. Record turnout in the face of ""unprecedented obstacles"", he said, showed democracy ""beats deep in the heart of America"". This video can not be played How voters in the US responded to Joe Biden's defeat of Donald Trump in the US election His running mate, Kamala Harris, is set to become the first woman vice-president. The result makes Mr Trump the first one-term president since the 1990s. Five questions for Biden on the economy Follow all the latest live updates Joe Biden and a life in politics US election results in maps and charts Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? The BBC's projection of Mr Biden's victory is based on the unofficial results from states that have already finished counting their votes, and the expected results from states like Wisconsin where the count is continuing. His projected wins in Pennsylvania and now also Nevada take him to 279 electoral college votes. The election has seen the highest turnout since 1900. Mr Biden has won more than 74 million votes so far, the most ever for a US presidential candidate. Mr Trump returning to the White House after Mr Biden was projected to win Offering his congratulations, former President Barack Obama, with whom Mr Biden served two terms as vice-president, said: ""I know he'll do the job with the best interests of every American at heart, whether or not he had their vote."" Biden supporters have been gathering in the streets on New York and other cities to celebrate victory. Mr Trump has drawn more than 70 million, the second-highest tally in history. President Trump had falsely declared himself the winner of the election when vote counting was unfinished. He has since alleged irregularities in counting, but has not presented any evidence of election fraud. After Mr Biden was projected to win he remained defiant, saying Mr Biden was ""falsely posing as the winner"" and insisting the election was ""far from over"". His campaign has filed a barrage of lawsuits in various states. This video can not be played Donald Trump is seen playing golf as Joe Biden's win was announced The response from senior Republicans has been muted. Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted that ""the media doesn't decide who wins elections, voters do"". But Senator Mitt Romney, a critic of Mr Trump, congratulated Mr Biden and Ms Harris. He said he and his wife ""know both of them as people of good will and admirable character"". 'Let's work together!' - How world reacted to Biden win The election was fought as coronavirus cases and deaths continued to rise across the United States, with President Trump arguing a Biden presidency would result in lockdowns and economic gloom. Joe Biden accused the president of failing to impose sufficient measures to control the spread of Covid-19. At the age of 78, Mr Biden will be the oldest president in American history. Joe Biden's projected victory after four days of painstaking vote-counting is the denouement of an extraordinary campaign, conducted during a devastating pandemic and widespread social unrest, and against a most unconventional of incumbents. In his third try for the presidency, Mr Biden found a way to navigate the political obstacles and claim a win that, while perhaps narrow in the electoral college tally, is projected to surpass Mr Trump's overall national total by at least four million votes. With his projected victory, Joe Biden becomes the oldest man ever elected to the White House. He brings with him the first woman vice-president, whose multi-ethnic heritage carries with it numerous other firsts. Mr Biden can now begin the arduous task of planning the transition to his new administration. He will have just under three months to assemble a cabinet, determine policy priorities and prepare to govern a nation facing numerous crises and sharply divided along partisan lines. Joe Biden has been dreaming of the White House for most of his 50 years in the public arena. With this prize of a lifetime, however, come the challenges of a lifetime. Usually the losing candidate concedes but Mr Trump has vowed to contest the election results on several fronts. A recount will be held in Georgia, where the margins are tight, and Mr Trump wants the same in Wisconsin. He has also vowed to take legal action to the Supreme Court, alleging voting fraud without evidence. If the election result is challenged, it would require legal teams to challenge this in the state courts. State judges would then need to uphold the challenge and order a recount, and Supreme Court justices could then be asked to overturn a ruling. Read more: Could the election be decided in courts? Meanwhile, votes in some states are continuing to be counted and results are never official until final certification, which occurs in each state in the weeks following the election. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? This must be done before 538 chosen officials (electors) from the Electoral College - which officially decides who wins the election - meet in their state capitals to vote on 14 December. The electors' votes usually mirror the popular vote in each state. However, in some states this is not a formal requirement. The new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January after a transition period to give them time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans. The handover of power takes place at a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC. After the ceremony, the new president makes their way to the White House to begin their four-year term in office. Mr Biden ran for the White House twice before. In 1988 he withdrew from the race after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British Labour Party, Neil Kinnock. In 2008, he tried again to get the Democratic nomination before dropping out and joining Barack Obama's ticket. His eight years as vice-president allowed him to lay claim to much of Mr Obama's legacy, including passage of the Affordable Care Act. In 1974, Biden was the youngest US senator The six-term senator from Delaware was first elected in 1972. Early in his career, he sided with southern segregationists in opposing court-ordered school bussing to racially integrate public schools. He was also a fierce advocate of a 1994 anti-crime bill that many on the left now say encouraged lengthy sentences and mass incarceration. Joe Biden lost his son Beau (left) in 2015 Most Americans know that Joe Biden's life has been marked by personal tragedy - experiences he often refers to. In 1972, he lost his first wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident. He famously took the oath of office for his first Senate term from the hospital room of his toddler sons Beau and Hunter, who both survived the accident. In 2015, Beau died of brain cancer at the age of 46, and Joe Biden said this played a role in his decision not run for president in 2016. Watch the moment BBC projects Biden victory What happens now?

"How to survive a winter lockdown, from those who've done itTips on lockdown life in cold weather - from sub-zero coffee meet-ups to watching films in the bath.","Winter lockdowns: Five women share their tips for getting through winter weather It's hard to stay positive during lockdown, particularly in the winter months. You might be feeling just as frosty, gloomy and miserable as the UK's weather forecasts. But last year, millions of people across the world experienced coronavirus lockdowns in snowy and sometimes sub-zero conditions - so what can we learn from them? Lockdown began in January 2020 in Wuhan, when the city saw lows of -3.6C and a top temperature of 14C. Yilang Zengexperienced the first city-wide lockdown of the pandemic after travelling to visit her parents in Wuhan for Chinese New Year in January. Yilang Zeng enjoyed spending time with her parents during lockdown in Wuhan but won't miss giving home haircuts: ""Luckily my dad cannot see from the back"" The Emirates airline cabin crew member, aged 28, relished the extended ""holiday"" with her parents, because she had been living in Dubai, since 2016. Yilang says the cold and wet Wuhan weather made it tempting to leave the heating on all day - but she suggests putting on a jumper and throwing open a window, to get some fresh air inside. And while the two-month lockdown meant Yilang could really settle into family time, she also made a point of bringing her cabin crew etiquette home with her. ""Always compliment the one who cooks,"" she says, because otherwise, ""it might be the longest holiday together with your family"". Yilang'stop winter lockdown tips: Apply hand cream straight after using hand sanitiser, to protect your skin from drying out in the cold Wear lots of clothes rather than putting the heating on - it also saves money Buy fruit and vegetables with a long shelf life to cut down on chilly trips to the supermarket Lockdown in Russiabegan in March 2020. In the city of Murmansk, in the far north-west of the country, temperatures can drop well below -10C at that time of year. ""Remote learning"" takes on whole new levels of meaning for teacherAnna Turkinaand her family, who spent last March's lockdown deep in the Arctic Circle in Murmansk - almost 2,000km (1,200 miles) north of Moscow. Anna Turkina and her family loved baking - and eating - bread together during lockdown in their home in the Arctic Circle For Anna, 36, the stay-at-home order to curb coronavirus infections meant being cooped up in her flat with her husband and two children, then aged four and 11. She would wrap the children up warm and persuade them to go out and play on the small balcony to breathe the ""really fresh and very nice air"" - but only for 15 minutes at a time. ""We have really severe winters and it was -15C,"" she adds. The nippy playtimes were part of Anna's strict schedule, which she says must be kept to to avoid ""going mad in such hard times"". Anna's top tips: Buy some houseplants - they look nice and make the air fresher Learn a new skill - we love baking bread together Air your home once an hour (no matter how cold the outside air!) Lockdown in TromsÃ¸began in March 2020, when the average temperature was-1.1C, with lows of -8.9C,external. It rained or snowed almost every day. Ida Solhaugsays coping with a winter lockdown is all about mindset. Ida Solhaug says going outside during lockdown is important, and even Norway's sub-zero temperatures are manageable if you have enough clothes The mindfulness researcher at the University of TromsÃ¸ says my line of questioning - about how to ""get through"" the cold months-is a big part of the problem. She says Brits often see winter as ""something to endure"" rather than ""really embracing winter for what it's worth"". She says adopting a ""positive winter mindset,external"" could help us cope with the stresses of a lockdown at this time of year. For example, instead of moaning about not being able to meet up in big groups, be grateful that we can wrap up warm and go on a winter walk with one person from another household, Ida says. Cycling to work in the snow or meeting friends outside (at -8C) with a flask of coffee were two ways Ida coped with ""the long Covid winter"" - but she says people in the UK can do far less extreme things to enjoy winter during lockdown. Ida's top tips: Get a winter wardrobe (she says British rain coats aren't enough, so layer up!) Light candles to give yourself a comforting break from the darkness outside Try to take notice of nature and small things around you, like a tree or a ray of sunshine Melbourne entered a three-month lockdown during Australian winter in July 2020, when temperatures reachedlows of 3.1C,externaland highs of 17.4C,external. The luxury of a hot bath helpedRowan Bruceto face the mental pressures of a 112-day lockdown in Melbourne. Bubbles in the bath: Rowan enjoying his top tipple Rowan found that running a bath, pouring a glass of wine and watching a film or TV programme - all at the same time - became one of the highlights of his week. He particularly enjoyed watching travel shows presented by the celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain: ""If I can't travel, I'll travel with him instead."" ""It's something I'd never really done before, and now it's my favourite thing to do every Saturday,"" says Rowan, 36, who works at a local brewery. ""It's got to the point where everyone knows that between 3:30pm and 4:30pm every Saturday, I'm probably in the tub."" He says the ritual provided structure to his day and became the perfect way to spend a cold afternoon in lockdown. Rowan's friend,Gillian Nix, agrees routine is important - such as dragging her young children out for a daily morning walk - but she says trying to think of fun activities to fill the time can lead to burnout. Gillian Nix (right) says she and her husband Chris (left) have felt ""pure fatigue"" when trying to think of fun indoor activities with their children while in lockdown in Melbourne Gillian says she and her husband, Chris, were full of energy and ideas at the beginning of lockdown. They would organise ""country days"" with their children Alice, six, and Otis, three, where they cooked food, dressed up, and watched films from a different country each week. But the couple began to feel exhausted by thinking of new things to do. In her lowest moments in lockdown, Gillian, 39, said it was important to be kind to herself. ""Allowing yourself to have a bad hour where you just put on kids' TV or YouTube or whatever, that's fine. This isn't your normal parenting style. ""Before lockdown we would go on day trips, to the beach, or to art galleries, and go out, [but] you can't judge yourself on now because it's not the normal thing. So take it hour by hour."" Gillian and Rowan's top tips: Make winter treats (like hot baths and pizza nights) part of your weekly routine Don't be too hard on yourself Take the kids out for walks (whatever the weather) Toronto's average temperature in March 2020, when people were first urged to stay at home due to Covid, was4.0C, with lows of -7.7C,external. Snow lay on the ground most days. ""I think it's important not to pressure yourself with the notion of going outside,"" saysAshwini Selvakumaran. Ashwini Selvakumaran after an online Zumba session at her parents' home in Milton, Ontario When Canada's prime minister urged people to stay inside and the country went into lockdown, the third-year student at the University of Toronto decided to move out of her flat in the city to stay with her parents in the nearby town of Milton. Ashwini's parents repeatedly encouraged her to go for runs in the bracing cold, but she shrank away from the cold air and snow. ""I love dancing and moving my body to music, and online there were so many videos and free Zumba tutorials and I just did those,"" the 20-year-old says. ""Not only did it increase my ability to be active inside the house, but it also made me feel happy just being able to relate back to that passion that I love.""

Joe Biden: Key moments that shaped five decades of ambition," How Joe Biden overcame public and personal adversity By Anthony Zurcher By Anthony Zurcher This article was first published on 18 August, 2020 It was the winter of Joe Biden’s discontent. After a disappointing finish in the Iowa caucuses in February, his support in the upcoming New Hampshire primary was collapsing and his 2020 presidential campaign was in serious jeopardy. He was, for all appearances, a defeated man. The White House hopes Biden had been harbouring during his nearly half-century in public service were slipping away again, perhaps for the last time. At a campaign rally ahead of the New Hampshire vote, Biden was reflective - and at times visibly emotional. He spoke of the death of his son, Beau, almost five years earlier.  He recounted stories from his childhood, of his family’s economic hardships. But he reassured the audience. “There’s always hope,” he said. “There’s always hope.” It wasn’t a typical rally speech – and given his subsequent fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, probably not an effective one. But it offered a glimpse into the psyche, the emotional scar tissue, of a politician who has faced devastating personal, professional and political adversity over the course of his life. “I have an incredibly high regard for fate,” Biden told the National Journal back in 1989. “I have never been able to plan my life. Every time my personal life has been how I wanted it, something has intervened.” Biden has witnessed the untimely deaths of the closest of loved ones. He’s built platforms for his political ambitions, only to watch them crumble, then built them again. His hard-earned rhetorical skills have won him the adoration of crowds, and his propensity for malaprops and gaffes have made him the object of ridicule. Biden frequently says that the main lesson he learned from his father was that the measure of a man isn’t how many times he’s been knocked down, but how quickly he gets back up. After losing in New Hampshire, Biden’s campaign regrouped in the southern states and turned what appeared to be impending defeat into a convincing march to the Democratic nomination. That was only the latest example of Biden facing challenges – some beyond his control, others resulting from his own mistakes and miscalculations – and soldiering on. “We have choices when we suffer like Joe,” says former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, who served with Biden in Congress during the 1990s. “He's a man of faith. He chose not to quit. He chose to keep doing the work, even though he didn't have to.” Biden, if nothing else, is a survivor. Five pivotal days in his life put this in stark relief – days casting shadows that stretched for decades. Joe Biden was in Washington on 18 December, 1972, when the telephone rang. It was his brother Jimmy in Delaware, asking to speak to his sister, Valerie. There had been a “slight accident” involving Biden's family, his sister relayed. “Nothing to be worried about,” she said. “But we ought to go home.” His wife Neilia, he would learn later that day, had been killed, along with their infant daughter, Naomi, when the car she was driving was hit by a lorry. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were also seriously injured. The family had been shopping for a Christmas tree while Biden – who had just been elected to the Senate - was off interviewing staff for his congressional office and finalising the purchase of a new home for the family. Now, that family was shattered. “I could not speak, only felt this hollow core grow in my chest,” Biden wrote in his memoir, “like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole.” He considered giving up the Senate seat he had just won. He contemplated joining the priesthood. He found himself taking evening walks in rough neighbourhoods, looking for a fight. “I had not known I was capable of such rage,” he wrote. “ I felt God had played a horrible trick on me, and I was angry.” Up until that day, Biden’s life had been on a remarkable upward trajectory. Just over a month earlier, the then-29-year-old Democrat had become the second-youngest person elected to the US Senate, defeating a two-term Republican incumbent in a race few thought he had a chance of winning. He was considered a golden boy in a Democratic Party that had been trounced across the nation by Richard Nixon and the Republicans. Biden’s childhood was relatively challenging. While his father had his share of business successes, mostly before Biden was born, the ups were inevitably followed by downs, and young Biden spent much of his youth living with his extended family in a modest home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. “The values that Vice-President Biden was exposed to as a young man were values rooted in the Church, rooted in Catholic education, rooted in the culture we were growing up in, which was Irish-American,” says Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, whose family has lived in Scranton for generations. His biggest childhood challenge was overcoming a speech impediment – a stutter – that afflicted him well into high school. In his memoir, Biden recalls memorising a reading to avoid tripping up during class and, when he once did, how a teacher mocked his disability, calling him “buh-buh-Biden”. That teacher, a Catholic nun, received a tongue-lashing from Biden’s mother, who threatened to “knock your bonnet off your head”, in Biden’s retelling. His high-school classmates gave him nicknames that made references to his stutter. “Even today I can remember the dread, the shame, the absolute rage, as vividly as the day it was happening,” Biden wrote. By the time he finished high school, however, he had overcome the stutter - the result, he says, of months of training himself to relax his face while he practised speaking in front of a mirror. It still reveals itself on occasion, however, when he’s under pressure or fumbling for words. “A stutter does not get worse as a person ages, but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy,” wrote John Hendrickson, in an Atlantic Magazine article about Biden’s stutter. No-one is ever truly cured, he says, they simply find ways around the problem. After high school, Biden went on to attend the University of Delaware and then law school at Syracuse University, in part to be near Neilia, whom he had met during a college holiday. They eventually married, and Biden’s political career began shortly after their return to Wilmington. He briefly practised law at a major firm, but disillusioned with representing the rich and powerful, he switched to being a public defender. From there, he ran for – and won – a seat on the New Castle county council. This became his unlikely springboard to the US Senate after no other Democrat expressed interest in challenging the entrenched Republican incumbent. “Joe Biden looks like the photograph of a great statesman in his youth,” a local newspaper columnist gushed. “His eyes sparkle blue, and his teeth shine when he smiles, his cheeks glow, and his body is still boyishly slim.” Joe Biden, 1972 Joe Biden, 1972 The article concluded on a surprisingly sombre note, however: “He had the look – both triumphant and sad – of a young man who believes the world is his, and knows he is yet to be tested.” Those tests would come – none more daunting than the one on that December day, just a few years later. Biden would ultimately accept his Senate seat, taking the oath of office from the Delaware hospital where his two sons were recovering. It marked the beginning of 44 consecutive years in national politics – a stretch that ended, as it began, with the untimely death of a child. In May 2015 Beau Biden died of brain cancer at the age of 46. Like his father, Beau had pursued a career in politics, serving as Delaware’s attorney general, with the prospect of higher offices to come. “He had all the best of me, but with the bugs and flaws engineered out,"" Biden wrote of Beau in his 2017 book about his son’s illness. Biden details how close he came to announcing his own presidential bid in 2015, but that the rawness of his son’s death – and the toll a campaign might take on his family – pushed him to stay out. “I wasn’t sure if I would be able to find the emotional energy, and I knew from previous experience that grief is a process that respects no schedule and no timetable,” he wrote. A lifetime of loss was something Biden learned to live with and overcome, like his stutter - a piece of himself that he found a way to build on. “It's my belief that your empathy is informed by your experience, but you're either born with that sense or you're not,” Senator Casey says. “In Biden’s case, it was both a quality he was born with but also one that was informed by his own personal tragedies that gave him an insight into loss and tragedy and pain that a lot of people never fully understand.” Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009 Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009  On 23 September 1987, Joe Biden stood before a crowd of reporters and announced that he was abandoning the presidential bid he had launched just three months earlier. “I’m angry with myself for having been put in this position – for having put myself in this position of having to make this choice,” he said. “And I am no less frustrated at the environment of presidential politics that makes it so difficult to let the American people measure the whole Joe Biden and not just misstatements that I have made.” It was an ignominious end to Biden’s first attempt at the White House, after his campaign ran aground amid charges of plagiarism and dishonesty. It was a particularly bitter pill to swallow for a man who liked to offer his “word as a Biden” as an iron-clad guarantee of honesty and trustworthiness. The first blow came in a debate in Iowa where Biden, in his closing statement, recited – nearly word for word – a passage from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock’s speech about his working-class upbringing. Although he frequently quoted those lines with attribution, this time Biden didn’t – and an operative from a rival Democratic campaign took note. A plagiarism charge against Biden for a law school paper also resurfaced. He explained that it was the result of an improper citation, but combined with the Kinnock mistake and further allegations of unattributed speech quotes, it cemented for many the perception that there was no substance beneath Biden’s style. “Here I was, getting out of the race with my integrity being questioned,” Biden would later tell his biographer, Jules Witcover.  “It really ate me up. It was the core of who I thought I was, who I know I am, actually.” During his first 14 years in Washington, Biden rebuilt his personal life after the deaths of his wife and daughter. He committed to giving his two living children some semblance of a normal life, and commuted each day from their home in Delaware to Washington. He eventually remarried, to a schoolteacher named Jill Jacobs, with whom he had a child, Ashley. He established himself on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and began to build a national presence. After entertaining a run in 1984, he took the plunge four years later, with a campaign that played heavily on Kennedy-esque themes of generation change. “We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference,” he said at his campaign kick-off. “The clarion call for my generation is not, ‘It’s our turn,’ but rather, ‘It’s our moment of obligation and opportunity’.” The plagiarism row ensured this wouldn’t be Biden’s moment. At the same time he was attempting to keep his presidential campaign afloat, Biden was also chairing Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for a conservative Supreme Court nominee, Robert Bork – a high-profile battle over the ideological direction of the nation’s highest court. It was after a morning session of these hearings in Washington that Biden announced the end to his campaign. The decision turned out to be somewhat of a blessing, however, as a few months later – the night of the Iowa caucuses – he collapsed in a hotel room in Rochester, New York, the result of an intracranial aneurism. For the next six months, he was in and out of hospital. For a time, doctors feared he would have lasting brain damage. It would be 20 years before Biden ran for president again – this time as an elder statesman, not a fresh face. He promised to run the 2008 race on his own terms, after concluding that his 1987 campaign was too heavy on rhetorical flourishes and image-consultants. It was almost as if he was trying to right the wrongs of 20 years earlier. “Any of you who take a look at my life will not be able to conclude that I am not an honourable man,” he said at an Iowa campaign rally in June. “And that’s why I wasn’t afraid to get back into this thing.” The end result – defeat – was the same, however. And right out of the gate, it was Biden’s tongue that betrayed him. The day before he formally announced his candidacy, Biden told a New York Observer reporter that one of his opponents, Barack Obama, was “the first mainstream African American, who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy”. Biden was quickly forced to explain that he did not mean to disparage previous black presidential candidates or belittle Obama personally. It was cited as yet another of Biden’s propensity for gaffes – off-the-cuff remarks that would embarrass or distract from his intended message – which would bedevil his national efforts throughout his career. Although Biden eventually steadied his campaign, he never broke into the top tier. The Democratic race boiled down to a two-way battle between Obama and Hillary Clinton. A riveted US public watched on 11 October, 1991, as Anita Hill, then a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, testified before Joe Biden’s Senate Judiciary Committee that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her on multiple occasions when they both worked for the Reagan administration. Hill accused Thomas of repeatedly making “ugly”, “disgusting”, “dirty” comments to her, creating an intolerable workplace. Thomas, in his testimony, accused his critics of engaging in a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” - alluding to a term that has historicalracist connotations. “Unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you,” he said. “You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the US Senate rather than hung from a tree.” Biden chairs the Clarence Thomas hearings, 1991 Biden, as chair, presided over this spectacle – trying to provide what he described as a fair hearing for both sides. The committee had already voted once on Thomas’s nomination, during which Biden objected to Thomas on ideological grounds. This, however, was different. As the committee reopened its inquiry, the issue was Thomas’ moral character – and two distinct and conflicting accounts of what had taken place a decade earlier. Biden was conscious that he and his fellow senators – all men, all white - were open to charges of racism against only the second black nominee to the Supreme Court, and charges of sexism if they didn’t give Hill’s allegations a full airing. “The Democrats were deathly afraid of seeming to gang up on a black Supreme Court nominee, there's no doubt about that,” says journalist Jill Abramson, who covered the hearings for the Wall Street Journal and co-wrote a book, Strange Justice, on the topic. Instead of being fair, Abramson says, Biden and the Democrats allowed themselves to be “woefully outmanoeuvred” by the committee’s Republican minority, leaving many liberal supporters feeling betrayed. “As the Democrats are wont to do, they wanted to be seen as playing fair,” she says. “But it wasn't playing fair, it was two days of hearings where Anita Hill was trashed by the Republicans who portrayed her as a fantaciser or an erotomaniac.” If Biden was trying to find balance on issues of race and sex during the hearings, it’s a challenge he’s faced throughout his career, with varying levels of success. When Biden first ran for the Senate, he presented himself as an advocate of the civil rights movement. He recalled how, as a teenage volunteer at a swimming centre in a predominantly black neighbourhood of Wilmington, he learned about the unfair treatment ethnic minority groups frequently received in the US. “Every day, it seemed to me, black people got subtle and not-so-subtle reminders that they didn’t quite belong in America,” Biden wrote in his memoir. One of Biden’s first high-profile political battles upon entering the Senate, however, was fought alongside pro-segregation southerners in opposition of the court-ordered practice of transporting students to schools in different neighbourhoods in an effort to address racial segregation. It was a subject that would open Biden to attacks during his run for the 2020 Democratic nomination. “Biden at one time called the issue of bussing a ‘domestic Vietnam’,” says Jason Sokol, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire. “He meant that it was an issue that was tearing the country apart culturally. That's why he shied away from taking a strong stance against integration at that point. He saw that this politically was not a smart thing to do.” While Biden fought conservative judicial and executive appointees he thought were insufficiently dedicated to civil rights, he viewed the role of government as preventing discrimination in the current era, not offering remedies for past wrongs. “I do not buy the concept, popular in the ‘60s which said: ‘We have suppressed the black man for 300 years, and the white man is now far ahead in the ‘race’ for everything our society offers,” he told a newspaper interviewer in 1975. “In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a ‘head start’ or even hold the white man back to even the ‘race’. I don’t buy that."" Biden’s record on crime and law-enforcement issues also opened him up to accusations that he supported policies - designed to address a spike in violent crime and drug offences in the 1980s and early 1990s - that disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups. Sokol says Biden has spent his career inhabiting a “very conflicted, messy middle ground” on racial issues, where he weighed in angering some of his white constituents against ”honouring claims for racial justice”. In 1988, Biden enthusiastically backed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which established tougher mandatory sentences for narcotics like crack cocaine that were more frequently used by ethnic minority groups. He was the architect of a 1994 anti-crime bill that expanded mandatory minimum sentences and greatly increased federal funding for police departments and prisons – a push that since has been seen as a contributing factor in the US having one of the world’s largest incarcerated populations. According to Bob Kerrey, who was one of the 95 senators who voted for the crime bill, being labelled “soft on crime” was politically dangerous in the 1990s. Joe Biden speaks about crime and ""predators on our streets"", 1993 “I didn't know how controversial the crime bill would become,” he says. “The problem with that crime bill is it worked - crime went down. The larger problem is we tolerated racist attitudes of police forces way too long.” Attached to that 1994 crime bill was one of Biden’s most cherished legislative accomplishments - the Violence Against Women Act. The topic of domestic abuse - and how to address it on a federal level – was always among Biden’s top of priorities. “We ripped the Band-Aid off a shameful secret and exposed the ugly truth of domestic violence to the public eye,”Biden told the Huffington Post in 2019. While Biden has offered his legislative efforts as evidence of his support for women’s issues, it has been his personal conduct that has drawn the sharpest attacks. In the days before the formal launch of his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden was accused by a number of women of unwanted physical contact. “I had never experienced anything so blatantly inappropriate and unnerving before,” wrote Lucy Flores, a Nevada Democratic politician, of an encounter she had with Biden in 2014. “The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends, family or romantic partners -and I felt powerless to do anything about it.” While not admitting to any specific misconduct, Biden released a video in which he said he would be “more mindful and respectful” of future conduct that might make women uncomfortable. Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 In March, one of the women who accused Biden of misconduct, Tara Reade, expanded her allegation to sexual assault, saying the then-senator had attacked her in an empty hallway when she worked in his office in 1993. Acquaintances of Reade said she told them about the alleged incident at the time. Two months later, Biden directly addressed the accusation, referencing his support for the Violence Against Women Act. “I recognise my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished,” he said. “So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago. They aren't true.” Reade called on Biden to quit the race.Subsequent investigations by journalists, including aNew York Times report, found inconsistencies in Reade’s accounts. The episode, however, raised uncomfortable issues for Democrats, especially women in the party who had backed the rallying cry of the #MeToo movement, Believe Women. It also drew parallels to the doubts and aspersions directed at Anita Hill decades earlier In recent years – and in light of the Me Too movement that has increased awareness of sexual harassment and assault - Biden has expressed regret over his handling of the Hill episode. “To this day, I regret that I could not come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us,” Biden said during a speech in March 2019. He later directly expressed this to Hill in a phone call. But for her, it was not enough. “He needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw,” she told the New York Times. “There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.” It was deja vu for Joe Biden. On 11 October, 2002, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations committee was once again deciding whether to authorise a Republican president to go to war with Iraq. Eleven years earlier, on the eve of the Gulf War, Biden had voted against giving President George HW Bush the approval to use force against Saddam Hussein’s military. “Before we ask Americans to die for the liberation of Kuwait, I would like to be sure we have tried every possible alternative,” he said during a Foreign Relations committee hearing. “So far, this has not been the case.” Despite Biden’s warning that there could be tens of thousands of US casualties, the resolution passed 52-47 - and the Gulf War ended quickly, with only a handful of American deaths. US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 Biden, along with other Democrats who opposed the war, were frequently branded as “doves” who were soft on national defence. Robert Gates, defence secretary under George W Bush, typified these kind of attacks when he wrote in his 2014 memoir that Biden was “wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". He listed Biden’s support for withdrawal from South Vietnam, opposition to Ronald Reagan’s defence build-up and that fateful vote against the Gulf War resolution, among others. In the years after that vote, Biden staked out more hawkish positions on international affairs, including backing US involvement in the Balkan civil wars, bombing in Iraq and the invasion of Afghanistan. When President George W Bush began moving toward a new war with Iraq, alleging it possessed weapons of mass destruction, Biden was a vocal supporter. “I do not believe this is a rush to war,” he said. “I believe it’s a march to peace and security.” Biden was among the 77 senators to vote for that Iraq War resolution – joining numerous other Democrats with presidential ambitions, including John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Biden speaks at the Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on Iraq, 2002 “It was kind of a simple calculation,” says Mark Weisbrot, who directed a documentary on Biden’s Iraq War support. “They knew there was a risk that if you were against the war and the war turned out to be a ‘success’ you could lose some swing votes. But if you voted for the war, and it turned out to be a disaster, which it did, you really didn't lose much because your base didn't have anywhere to go.” As the war dragged on, however, Biden’s war vote did become a political liability – this time with Democratic voters who increasingly saw the US occupation as a quagmire. Biden, after initially defending his vote, began to back away. He deals with this episode in a chapter on the Iraq War - titled “My Mistake” - in his 2007 memoir. Writing about those in the Bush administration who pushed for war, he wrote: “I vastly underestimated their disingenuousness and incompetence”. If Biden in the years after his Gulf War vote tried to compensate for his perceived error by moving to the right, he moved left after the Iraq War. He opposed a surge of US forces in Iraq, calling for US withdrawal and partitioning of the nation. As vice-president, he counselled against an increase in US forces in Afghanistan and advised against the Osama bin Laden raid. Shortly after announcing his 2020 presidential bid, Biden advocated ending US support for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen civil war. During the Obama presidency, Biden had an active role in carrying out the administration’s foreign policy objectives. Senator Casey recalls meeting the vice-president during a visit to Iraq, where they discussed his efforts to work with the leaders of the various governing factions. “I could tell by listening to his recitations from the interactions that he had learned a lot about these people as personalities,” Casey says. “It was a really valuable lesson in diplomacy. It wasn't just learning the substance of a white paper about a particular country or a particular foreign policy issue, but you literally have to get to know the individuals.” Biden’s other responsibilities included pressuring Congress to back nuclear negotiations with Iran, building international support for the Paris climate accords, representing US interests in China and encouraging democratic reforms in Ukraine. These last two areas – China and Ukraine – have become a focus for attacks from Donald Trump and Republicans, who have criticised Biden for being too close to China, and attempted to make a case that Biden’s Ukraine activities were to protect his son, Hunter, who had business ties to the nation. Last year, Hunter insisted he had done ""nothing wrong"" but admitted to ""poor judgment"",leaving him open to political attacks. Biden’s Iraq War vote again came up in the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, but nearly two decades later it lacked the political punch it once had. At the end of Biden’s 2008 presidential run, it seemed the senator would return to Washington and finish his career in Congress or, perhaps, as an official in a future Democratic administration. On 23 August, however, Barack Obama selected him as his vice-presidential running mate. The choice surprised many. Biden’s home state, Delaware, was not an electoral battleground. With more than three decades in Washington, he wasn’t the kind of outsider who fitted with Obama’s message of change. “There was this sense that they were very, very different,” says Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and author of a book on the vice-presidency. “Obama was very thoughtful and careful choosing his words, and Biden was always sticking his foot in his mouth. The one thing Biden told Obama when he agreed to do the job was that he wasn't going to change his brand. He said, ‘I am what I am’.” According to former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who ran for president in 2008 and was also on Obama’s vice-presidential short list, Obama and Biden developed a rapport on the Democratic primary campaign trail. “I knew in the debates they had a personal chemistry,” Richardson says. “Obama needed a senior foreign policy person on the ticket, but also I could tell they liked each other a lot.” A few hours after announcing his pick, Obama took the stage in Springfield, Illinois to introduce Biden to the gathered crowd. Biden is announced as Obama's running mate, 2008 “Joe Biden is that rare mix – for decades he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn’t changed him,” he said. “He is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track.” Obama would tick through the pivotal moments of Biden’s life – his stutter, the death of his wife and child, his brain aneurysm, the 1994 crime bill and his involvement in negotiating an end to the Balkan civil war – all in support of his choice. In the early days of the Obama presidency Biden frequently chafed at the White House’s directions. For more than 30 years, Biden – as a senator – ran his own political fiefdom. Now he was required to do someone else’s bidding. “It was galling for him at first,” says Bower. “It was this kind of a push-and-pull relationship.” There were moments when Biden broke from administration policy, most notably when he announced his support for gay marriage in 2012, frustrating a White House intent on message control. At other times Obama tasked Biden with important duties – shepherding the 2009 stimulus bill through Congress and overseeing the drawdown of US troops in Iraq. By the time Biden finished his eight years in the vice-presidency, he and Obama had formed a strong friendship. Bower recounts an interview she had with Biden during which Biden became visibly emotional when talking about Obama speaking at Beau’s funeral. “They were kind of, as hokey as it sounds, like a family during those eight years,” says Bower. “It was kind of a father-son relationship, too, because of their age difference.” In a surprise ceremony in the final days of his presidency, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest civilian honour. After joking about their “bromance”, Obama turned serious. “To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretence, services without self-regard and to live life fully,” he said. The speech had the tenor of a benediction, marking the end of a long career in public service. A year and a half earlier, Obama pressured Biden not to challenge Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination. “The president was convinced I could not beat Hillary,” Biden wrote in his 2017 memoir, “and he worried that a long primary fight would split the party and leave the Democratic nominee vulnerable in the general election.” The Democrats had a long and acrimonious primary fight anyway – between Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And a vulnerable Clinton lost the general election. Four years later, Biden dispatched Sanders more easily than Clinton had and the former vice-president finally secured the Democratic nomination. His success was due, in no small part, to his service as a dutiful deputy to Obama, which won him overwhelming support among black Democrats. “Let me explain something to you about Joe Biden,” writes Laurie Goff in a Facebook post that captured this sentiment. “This old rich white man played second fiddle to a black man. Not just any black man but a younger black man, a smart black man. Not just for a day. Not one, not two but eight years.” “This is what showing up and being an ally looks like,” she concludes. “When black people say they know Joe,this is how we know.” In what could be seen as an acknowledgement of this support, Biden selected a former presidential rival, Kamala Harris, to be his vice-presidential running mate, giving a black woman the kind of stepping stone to the presidency that Obama had provided him eight years earlier. Once again the Democrats had a multi-generational, multi-ethnic presidential ticket. As Obama’s “wingman”, Biden was able to get a foothold in the White House. His third try for the top office, after more than 40 years of political ambition buffeted by public and personal adversity, was his last shot at the prize.

What Joe Biden wants to do,"When he formally announced his entry into the 2020 presidential race, Joe Biden declared that he stood for two things - workers who ""built this country"", and values that can bridge its divisions. As the US faces challenges from coronavirus to racial inequity, his pitch is to create new economic opportunities for workers, restore environmental protections and healthcare rights, and international alliances. With his inauguration less than a day away, here are the president-elect's plans on eight key issues. Mr Biden's approach to tackling coronavirus, the most immediate and obvious challenge facing the country, is to provide free testing for all and hire 100,000 people to set up a national contact-tracing programme. He says he wants to establish at least 10 testing centres in every state, call upon federal agencies to deploy resources and give firmer national guidance through federal experts. He says all governors should mandate wearing masks. Those suspicious of federal authority will see this as overreach, but it lies very much in line with Mr Biden's and Democrats' general view on the role government should play. To address the immediate impact of the coronavirus crisis, Mr Biden has vowed to spend ""whatever it takes"" to extend loans to small businesses and increase direct money payments to families. Among the proposals are an additional $200 in Social Security payments per month, rescinding Trump-era tax cuts and $10,000 of student loan forgiveness for federal loans. Mr Biden's broader economic policies, dubbed his ""Build Back Better"" plan, aim to please two constituencies that traditionally support Democrats - young people and blue collar workers. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour - a measure that is popular among young people and that has become something of a totem figure for the party in 2020, and a sign of its move to the left. He also wants a $2tn investment in green energy, arguing that boosting green manufacturing helps working class union workers, who perform most of those jobs. There is also a $400bn pledge to use federal dollars to buy American goods, alongside a wider commitment to enforce ""Buy American"" laws for new transport projects. Mr Biden was previously criticised for backing the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which critics say shipped jobs overseas. His 2021 plan calls for the federal government to invest $300bn in US-made materials, services, research and technology. In the wake of the race protests that have gripped the US last year, he said he believes that racism exists in the US and must be dealt with through broad economic and social programmes to support minorities. A pillar of his ""build back"" programme is to create business support for minorities through a $30bn investment fund. On criminal justice, he has moved far from his much-criticised ""tough-on-crime"" position of the 1990s. Mr Biden has now proposed policies to reduce incarceration, address race, gender and income-based disparities in the justice system, and rehabilitate released prisoners. He would now create a $20bn grant programme to incentivise states to invest in incarceration reduction efforts, eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, decriminalise marijuana and expunge prior cannabis convictions, and end the death penalty. However, he has rejected calls to defund police, saying resources should instead be tied to maintaining standards. He argues that some funding for police should be redirected to social services like mental health, and calls for a $300m investment into a community policing programme. Mr Biden has called climate change an existential threat, and says he will rally the rest of the world to act more quickly on curbing emissions by rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. The agreement, which Donald Trump withdrew from, committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025, based on 2005 levels. Though he does not embrace the Green New Deal - a climate and jobs package put forward by the left wing of his party - he is proposing a $1.7tn federal investment in green technologies research, some of which overlaps with the funding in his economics plan, to be spent over the next 10 years, and wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050 - a commitment that was made by more than 60 other countries in 2019. China and India, the two other biggest carbon emitters, have yet to join the pledge. The investments dovetail with his economic plan to create jobs in manufacturing ""green energy"" products. Mr Biden wrote that as president, he would focus on national issues first. That said, there is little to suggest that Mr Biden's values on foreign policy have shifted away from multilateralism and engagement on the world stage, in opposition to Mr Trump's unabashedly isolationist one. He has also promised to repair relationships with US allies, particularly with the Nato alliance, which Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to undermine with funding cuts. The former vice-president has said China should be held accountable for unfair environment and trade practices, but instead of unilateral tariffs, he has proposed an international coalition with other democracies that China ""can't afford to ignore"", though he has been vague about what that means. Mr Biden says he will expand the public health insurance scheme passed when he was President Barack Obama's deputy, and implement a plan to insure an estimated 97% of Americans. Though he stops short of the universal health insurance proposal on the wish lists of the more left-wing members of his party, Mr Biden promises to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance option similar to Medicare, which provides medical benefits to the elderly and to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare itself from 65 to 60 years old. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan group, estimates that the total Biden plan would cost $2.25tn over 10 years. In his first 100 days in office, Mr Biden promises to reverse Trump policies that separate parents from their children at the US-Mexican border, rescind limits on the number of applications for asylum and end the bans on travel from several majority-Muslim countries. He also promises to protect the ""Dreamers"" - people brought illegally to the US as children who were permitted to stay under an Obama-era policy - as well as ensure they are eligible for federal student aid. In a notable shift to the left, he has endorsed several big pieces of education policy that have become popular within the party - student loan debt forgiveness, expansion of tuition-free colleges, and universal preschool access.

"How to survive a winter lockdown, from those who've done it","Winter lockdowns: Five women share their tips for getting through winter weather It's hard to stay positive during lockdown, particularly in the winter months. You might be feeling just as frosty, gloomy and miserable as the UK's weather forecasts. But last year, millions of people across the world experienced coronavirus lockdowns in snowy and sometimes sub-zero conditions - so what can we learn from them? Lockdown began in January 2020 in Wuhan, when the city saw lows of -3.6C and a top temperature of 14C. Yilang Zengexperienced the first city-wide lockdown of the pandemic after travelling to visit her parents in Wuhan for Chinese New Year in January. Yilang Zeng enjoyed spending time with her parents during lockdown in Wuhan but won't miss giving home haircuts: ""Luckily my dad cannot see from the back"" The Emirates airline cabin crew member, aged 28, relished the extended ""holiday"" with her parents, because she had been living in Dubai, since 2016. Yilang says the cold and wet Wuhan weather made it tempting to leave the heating on all day - but she suggests putting on a jumper and throwing open a window, to get some fresh air inside. And while the two-month lockdown meant Yilang could really settle into family time, she also made a point of bringing her cabin crew etiquette home with her. ""Always compliment the one who cooks,"" she says, because otherwise, ""it might be the longest holiday together with your family"". Yilang'stop winter lockdown tips: Apply hand cream straight after using hand sanitiser, to protect your skin from drying out in the cold Wear lots of clothes rather than putting the heating on - it also saves money Buy fruit and vegetables with a long shelf life to cut down on chilly trips to the supermarket Lockdown in Russiabegan in March 2020. In the city of Murmansk, in the far north-west of the country, temperatures can drop well below -10C at that time of year. ""Remote learning"" takes on whole new levels of meaning for teacherAnna Turkinaand her family, who spent last March's lockdown deep in the Arctic Circle in Murmansk - almost 2,000km (1,200 miles) north of Moscow. Anna Turkina and her family loved baking - and eating - bread together during lockdown in their home in the Arctic Circle For Anna, 36, the stay-at-home order to curb coronavirus infections meant being cooped up in her flat with her husband and two children, then aged four and 11. She would wrap the children up warm and persuade them to go out and play on the small balcony to breathe the ""really fresh and very nice air"" - but only for 15 minutes at a time. ""We have really severe winters and it was -15C,"" she adds. The nippy playtimes were part of Anna's strict schedule, which she says must be kept to to avoid ""going mad in such hard times"". Anna's top tips: Buy some houseplants - they look nice and make the air fresher Learn a new skill - we love baking bread together Air your home once an hour (no matter how cold the outside air!) Lockdown in TromsÃ¸began in March 2020, when the average temperature was-1.1C, with lows of -8.9C,external. It rained or snowed almost every day. Ida Solhaugsays coping with a winter lockdown is all about mindset. Ida Solhaug says going outside during lockdown is important, and even Norway's sub-zero temperatures are manageable if you have enough clothes The mindfulness researcher at the University of TromsÃ¸ says my line of questioning - about how to ""get through"" the cold months-is a big part of the problem. She says Brits often see winter as ""something to endure"" rather than ""really embracing winter for what it's worth"". She says adopting a ""positive winter mindset,external"" could help us cope with the stresses of a lockdown at this time of year. For example, instead of moaning about not being able to meet up in big groups, be grateful that we can wrap up warm and go on a winter walk with one person from another household, Ida says. Cycling to work in the snow or meeting friends outside (at -8C) with a flask of coffee were two ways Ida coped with ""the long Covid winter"" - but she says people in the UK can do far less extreme things to enjoy winter during lockdown. Ida's top tips: Get a winter wardrobe (she says British rain coats aren't enough, so layer up!) Light candles to give yourself a comforting break from the darkness outside Try to take notice of nature and small things around you, like a tree or a ray of sunshine Melbourne entered a three-month lockdown during Australian winter in July 2020, when temperatures reachedlows of 3.1C,externaland highs of 17.4C,external. The luxury of a hot bath helpedRowan Bruceto face the mental pressures of a 112-day lockdown in Melbourne. Bubbles in the bath: Rowan enjoying his top tipple Rowan found that running a bath, pouring a glass of wine and watching a film or TV programme - all at the same time - became one of the highlights of his week. He particularly enjoyed watching travel shows presented by the celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain: ""If I can't travel, I'll travel with him instead."" ""It's something I'd never really done before, and now it's my favourite thing to do every Saturday,"" says Rowan, 36, who works at a local brewery. ""It's got to the point where everyone knows that between 3:30pm and 4:30pm every Saturday, I'm probably in the tub."" He says the ritual provided structure to his day and became the perfect way to spend a cold afternoon in lockdown. Rowan's friend,Gillian Nix, agrees routine is important - such as dragging her young children out for a daily morning walk - but she says trying to think of fun activities to fill the time can lead to burnout. Gillian Nix (right) says she and her husband Chris (left) have felt ""pure fatigue"" when trying to think of fun indoor activities with their children while in lockdown in Melbourne Gillian says she and her husband, Chris, were full of energy and ideas at the beginning of lockdown. They would organise ""country days"" with their children Alice, six, and Otis, three, where they cooked food, dressed up, and watched films from a different country each week. But the couple began to feel exhausted by thinking of new things to do. In her lowest moments in lockdown, Gillian, 39, said it was important to be kind to herself. ""Allowing yourself to have a bad hour where you just put on kids' TV or YouTube or whatever, that's fine. This isn't your normal parenting style. ""Before lockdown we would go on day trips, to the beach, or to art galleries, and go out, [but] you can't judge yourself on now because it's not the normal thing. So take it hour by hour."" Gillian and Rowan's top tips: Make winter treats (like hot baths and pizza nights) part of your weekly routine Don't be too hard on yourself Take the kids out for walks (whatever the weather) Toronto's average temperature in March 2020, when people were first urged to stay at home due to Covid, was4.0C, with lows of -7.7C,external. Snow lay on the ground most days. ""I think it's important not to pressure yourself with the notion of going outside,"" saysAshwini Selvakumaran. Ashwini Selvakumaran after an online Zumba session at her parents' home in Milton, Ontario When Canada's prime minister urged people to stay inside and the country went into lockdown, the third-year student at the University of Toronto decided to move out of her flat in the city to stay with her parents in the nearby town of Milton. Ashwini's parents repeatedly encouraged her to go for runs in the bracing cold, but she shrank away from the cold air and snow. ""I love dancing and moving my body to music, and online there were so many videos and free Zumba tutorials and I just did those,"" the 20-year-old says. ""Not only did it increase my ability to be active inside the house, but it also made me feel happy just being able to relate back to that passion that I love."" Ashwini's top tips: Don't feel pressured to go outdoors if you have indoor hobbies Don't spend too much time on social media Be kind to other people This piece was first published on 7 November 2020.

'I was refused a home Covid test after credit check',"Laura says she was refused a home test kit for covid because she doesn't have enough credit history to verify her identity, having only arrived from Australia in the last 12 months ""We really couldn't understand why we weren't able to have our identities verified, "" says Laura McCormack about the moment she and her partner, who both had thethree main symptomsof coronavirus, were refused a home test kit. They had logged on to the government website to request one, but were told that because their names and addresses could not be checked, they would have to go to a physical test site instead. With no car and needing to avoid public transport because of their symptoms, it took them five days to get a test site close enough to walk to - one that was 90 minutes away. ""We started Googling and digging around,"" she says. ""We thought it [failing to get their identities verified] might be the fact we are migrant workers."" Because Laura has been in the UK less than a year, she has not built up much of a credit history. ""In the end, it became clear that people with no credit history were having very similar problems. People who haven't taken out loans or don't have phone contracts or credit cards here in the UK,"" she says. ""That's what led us to believe that we actually were being excluded from the process because we don't have a credit history here in the UK."" Most adults in the UK have a significant credit file, so getting a home test kit would be no problem. But research from 2018 suggests there may be up to5.8 million people,externalwith little or no credit history who could have similar problems to Laura, should they need to get one. The Department for Health and Social Care, which is running the test system across the UK, says it uses a credit reference agency, TransUnion, to verify people's identities to ""reduce fraud and prevent multiple testing kits being ordered, diverting capacity from where it is needed most"". TransUnion told Money Box in ""some cases we may not be able to verify the individual's identity - which can happen for a number of reasons"". It refused to explain what those reasons are. While Laura doesn't have much of a credit history, she is on the electoral roll and does have a bank account and utility bills in her name. Laura questions why someone's credit footprint is being used to verify people's identities when there of lots of other ways to do exactly the same thing Anna Miller, from charity Doctors of the World, questioned whether identity verification for home test kits is creating the solution to a problem that doesn't exist - at the expense of people like Laura. ""The types of people affected are anybody who has little to no credit history or credit footprint,"" she says. ""People whose financial situations tend to be organised by other people in a family and women, like elderly people, are likely to be more disproportionally affected. ""Alongside these groups are young adults who've not had much time to build up credit histories, recently arrived migrants in the UK for the same reason and people on low incomes who might not have access to mainstream credit."" Both the government and TransUnion were very clear that people do not have to pass a credit check to get a home test kit. The Department for Health and Social Care also told the BBC: ""Tests can also be booked by calling 119 and people can access testing and in-person testing sites, where a member of staff will confirm their identity in person."" But if an indirect consequence of not being able to verify your identity online is that people with no or limited credit histories are being affected, Laura says the system needs to change. ""The situation seems a bit crazy to me, to be honest. We are guests in the UK, we're trying very hard to keep the population safe by self-isolating and getting tested,"" she says. ""But not being able to verify our identity was very strange. We're both on the electoral roll, we both have bank accounts here, we're on a lease, we both have bills. ""There are many ways the government could have accessed our identity information, so the reason the government has chosen the credit path is a mystery to me.""

Joe Biden and a life in politics,"Democratic President Joe Biden will win a second term in the White House if he can overcome Republican Donald Trump one more time. But his rise to the highest office came despite a series of tragedies in his personal life. The 81-year-old had been in politics for decades before he finally got his chance to do the top job after a bitter election campaign ended in victory in 2020. As he runs again he will point to a roaring US economy which has bounced back well from the pandemic, his mobilising of a coalition to help Ukraine after Russia's invasion and a number of legislative wins. But voters have concerns about his age, rocketing bills for groceries and a crisis on the southern border. Polls suggest he is locked in a dead heat in his race against Mr Trump. Many of the issues Mr Biden has championed as president - reinvigorating US industry, lowering healthcare costs, addressing inequality - are lifelong causes dear to him. And the adversity he has faced on that journey to the top has shaped the man now imploring voters to give him a second term. The eldest child in a working-class, Irish-American family, the young Joseph Robinette Biden Jr used his prowess at sport as a way to distract attention from his stutter. His family had moved from industrial Scranton in Pennsylvania to Wilmington, Delaware, when he was 10 and he prospered in his new surroundings. While at college, a job as a lifeguard at a public swimming school opened his eyes to the racism endured by black Americans, he later recalled. He went to law school and became a public defender with mostly African American clients before going into politics. But in 1972, shortly after he won his first Senate race, he lost his first wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident. He famously took the oath of office for his first Senate term from the hospital room of his toddler sons Beau and Hunter, who both survived the accident. Five days that shaped Joe Biden In his memoir, he describes the pain he felt the day of the crash as rendering him speechless. ""I could not speak, only felt this hollow core grow in my chest, like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole,"" he wrote. In 2015, Beau died of brain cancer at the age of 46. The younger Biden was seen as a rising star of US politics and had intended to run for Delaware state governor in 2016. Joe Biden lost his son Beau (left) in 2015 Mr Biden garnered considerable goodwill following Beau's death, which served to highlight one of Mr Biden's central strengths - a reputation as a kind and relatable family man. This perceived warmth is not without its pitfalls. After entering the 2020 race, he faced accusations of unwelcome physical contact during interactions with female voters - complete with uncomfortable accompanying footage. The avuncular politician responded by saying he was an empathetic person, though he accepted standards had changed. The episode, however, stoked a perception for some that he was out of touch. He has stuck doggedly by his son Hunter who has made headlines for his drug addiction and his business interests, which Republicans say presented his father with a conflict of interest when he was vice-president. The six-term senator ran for president in 1988 but withdrew after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then-leader of the British Labour Party, Neil Kinnock. His lengthy tenure in the nation's capital has given critics ample material for attacks. Early in his career, he sided with southern segregationists in opposing court-ordered school bussing to racially integrate public schools. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career And, as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991, he oversaw Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings and has been sharply criticised for his handling of Anita Hill's allegations that she was sexually harassed by the nominee. Mr Biden was also a fierce advocate of a 1994 anti-crime bill that many on the left now say encouraged lengthy sentences and mass incarceration. He ran for the Democratic 2008 nomination before dropping out and joining the Barack Obama ticket. As a long-time Washington insider, Mr Biden had solid foreign affairs credentials, and helped balance Mr Obama's comparative lack of executive experience. The so-called ""Middle Class Joe"" was also brought on board to help woo the blue-collar white voters who had proved a difficult group for Mr Obama to win over. His eight years in the Obama White House - where he frequently appeared at the president's side - has allowed Mr Biden to lay claim to much of Mr Obama's legacy, including passage of the Affordable Care Act which extended affordable healthcare cover to millions of poor Americans. He made headlines in 2012 by saying he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with same-sex marriage, despite the president having not yet given support for the policy. Mr Obama ultimately did so, just days after Mr Biden. A few years later, Mr Biden was campaigning again for the top job, promising what he described as a return to normalcy after the Trump years and a pledge to get the country through the pandemic. His return to the White House was largely propelled by the support of women, minorities and young people. Just two weeks before his inauguration, supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed Congress in a bid to thwart the certification of Mr Biden's election victory. His new campaign will focus heavily on the fight against the ideology on display during the January 6 riot. The video announcing his re-election bid opened with images of violence from that day. ""Every generation of Americans has faced a moment when they've had to defend democracy,"" he said. ""This is ours. Let's finish the job."" Mr Biden will point to a number of accomplishments during his tenure, including job creation, stimulating an economy rocked by the pandemic and ""once-in-a-generation"" investment in key areas of American life. A succession of bills he signed into law channelled trillions of dollars into improving the country's ailing infrastructure, addressing the challenge of climate change, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and wrestling supremacy for the production of computer chips away from China. But he will face tough questions on his handling of immigration, especially at the US-Mexico border, his unwavering support for Israel as a humanitarian disaster unfolds in Gaza, and his advancing age. It would be unwise to write him off, however worrying he might find the polling. He often refers to his father teaching him that the measure of a man is not how many knocks he receives but how quickly he gets up off the floor after each one.

What Biden's victory means for rest of world,"The knife-edge vote has been closely watched abroad After days of uncertainty, Joe Biden has won the US presidential election, BBC projections show. During Donald Trump's four years in office, America's relationship with the world changed profoundly. BBC reporters across the globe, from Beijing to Berlin, explain how news of Mr Biden's victory is being received and what it could mean for key US relationships. 'Let's work together!' World reacts to Biden win 'We in Africa are proud of her success' Joe Biden's victory offers another challenge for the Chinese system, writesJohn Sudworthin Beijing. You might think Beijing would be glad to see the back of Donald Trump. As China-basher-in-chief he hit them with a trade war, levied a raft of punitive sanctions and badgered and blamed them for the coronavirus pandemic. But some analysts have suggested that the Chinese leadership may now be feeling secretly disappointed. Not because they have any lasting fondness for Mr Trump, but because another four years of him in the White House held out the tantalising prospect of a bigger prize. Divisive at home, isolationist abroad - Mr Trump seemed to Beijing the very embodiment of the long-anticipated and hoped for decline in US power. It was a message rammed home by the country's Communist Party-controlled TV news bulletins. They focused not on the election itself - but on the protests, rancour, and rising US virus infection rates alongside it. China might, of course, try to find advantage in Joe Biden's willingness to seek co-operation on big issues like climate change. But he's also promised to work to repair America's alliances, which may prove to be far more effective in constraining China's superpower ambitions than Trump's go-it-alone approach. And a Biden victory offers another challenge for a Chinese system devoid of democratic control. Far from a decline in American values, the transition of power itself is proof that those values endure. Kamala Harris's roots are a source of pride in India but Narendra Modi may get a more frigid reception from Mr Biden than his predecessor,Rajini Vaidyanathanwrites from Delhi. India has long been an important partner to the US - and the overall direction of travel is unlikely to change under a Biden presidency. South Asia's most populous nation will remain a key ally in America's Indo-Pacific strategy to curtail the rise of China, and in fighting global terrorism. That said, the personal chemistry between Mr Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could be trickier to navigate. Mr Trump has held back from criticising Mr Modi's controversial domestic policies  - which many say discriminate against the country's Muslims. Mr Biden has been far more outspoken. His campaign website called for the restoration of rights for everyone in Kashmir, and criticised the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) - two laws which sparked mass protests. Incoming Vice-President Kamala Harris - half Indian herself - has also spoken out against some of the Hindu nationalist government's policies. But her Indian roots will spark mass celebration in much of the country. That the daughter of an Indian woman who was born and raised in the city of Chennai will soon be second-in-command at the White House is a moment of immense national pride. North Korea once described Mr Biden as a ""rabid dog"" - but now Kim Jong-un will be making careful calculations before trying to provoke the new US president, writesLaura Bickerin Seoul. It's likely Chairman Kim would have preferred another four years of Donald Trump. The leaders' unprecedented meeting and follow-ups made for incredible photo-ops for the history books but very little of substance was signed. Neither side got what they wanted out of these talks: North Korea has continued to build up its nuclear arsenal and the US has continued to enforce strict sanctions. In contrast, Joe Biden has demanded North Korea show that it is willing to abandon its nuclear weapons programme before he holds any meetings with Kim Jong-un. Many analysts believe that unless Mr Biden's team initiates talks with Pyongyang very early on, the days of ""fire and fury"" may return. Mr Kim might want to get Washington's attention with a return to long-range missile tests, but he won't want to increase tensions to the point that the already impoverished state would be hit with even more sanctions. South Korea has already warned the North not to go down a provocative path. Seoul may have struggled to deal with Donald Trump at times - but President Moon is keen to put an end to the 70-year war on the Korean peninsula and he praised Mr Trump for having the ""courage"" to meet with Mr Kim. The South will closely watch for any sign that Mr Biden is willing to do the same. The US and UK's ""special relationship"" may face a downgrade with Joe Biden at the helm, writes political correspondentJessica Parkerin London. They won't be seen as natural allies: Joe Biden, the seasoned Democrat, and Boris Johnson, the bombastic Brexiteer. In looking at how their future relationship might work, it's worth considering the past. Specifically that seminal year, 2016, when Donald Trump won the White House and the UK voted to leave the EU. Both Joe Biden and his boss at the time, Barack Obama, made no secret they preferred another outcome on Brexit. The UK government's recent manoeuvres in relation to Brexit have not gone down well with key Democrats and the Irish lobby, including the US president-elect. Mr Biden said he would not allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit"" if elected - stating that any future US-UK trade deal would be contingent upon respecting the Good Friday Agreement. Remember how Donald Trump once called Boris Johnson ""Britain Trump""? Well, Mr Biden seemingly agreed, once reportedly describing the UK prime minister as Mr Trump's ""physical and emotional clone"". So it's possible Joe Biden may initially be more eager to talk to Brussels, Berlin or Paris than love-bomb London. The ""special relationship"" could, feasibly, face a downgrade. However, the two men may yet find some common ground. The two countries they lead, after all, have long-standing and deep-running diplomatic ties - not least in the areas of security and intelligence. A more predictable administration may be the ""silver lining"" for Russia of Mr Biden's win, writesSteven Rosenbergin Moscow. The Kremlin has an acute sense of hearing. So when Joe Biden recently named Russia as ""the biggest threat"" to America, they heard that loud and clear in Moscow. The Kremlin also has a long memory. In 2011 Vice-President Biden reportedly said that if he were Mr Putin, he wouldn't run again for president: it would be bad for the country and for himself. President Putin won't have forgotten that. Mr Biden and Mr Putin are not a match made in geo-political heaven. Moscow fears the Biden presidency will mean more pressure and more sanctions from Washington. With a Democrat in the White House, could it be payback time for Russia's alleged intervention in the 2016 US election? One Russian newspaper recently claimed that under Mr Trump, US-Russian relations had plunged ""to the seabed"". But it likened Mr Biden to a ""dredger"" who was going to ""dig even deeper"". Little wonder Moscow has that sinking feeling. But for the Kremlin there could be a silver lining. Russian commentators predict a Biden administration will, at least, be more predictable than the Trump team. That might make it easier to reach agreement on pressing issues, like New Start - the crucial US-Russian nuclear arms reduction treaty due to expire next February. Moscow will want to move on from the Trump era and try to build a working relationship with the new White House. There's no guarantee of success. Germans hope for a return to smooth-sailing with their key ally once Donald Trump has departed, writesDamien McGuinnessin Berlin. Germany will breathe a sigh of relief at this result. Only 10% of Germans trust President Trump on foreign policy, according to the Pew Research Centre. He is more unpopular in Germany than in any other country surveyed. Even Russia's Putin and China's Xi Jinping poll better in Germany. President Trump is accused of undermining free trade and dismantling the multinational institutions which Germany relies on economically. His spats with China have rattled German exporters and he has a notoriously poor relationship with Chancellor Angela Merkel â it's hard to imagine two leaders more different in ethos and personality. German politicians and voters have been shocked by his abrasive style, his unconventional approach to facts and his frequent attacks on Germany's car industry. The transatlantic relationship is critical for European security Despite this, the US is Germany's biggest trading partner and the transatlantic relationship is critical for European security. So the Trump presidency has been a rocky ride. German ministers have criticised President Trump's calls for vote-counting to stop and his unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud. Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer called the situation ""explosive"". There is an awareness here that major policy differences between Washington and Berlin will not go away under a Biden presidency. But Berlin is looking forward to working with a president who values multilateral co-operation. A Biden victory could bring Tehran back to the negotiating table, writes BBC Persian Service correspondentKasra Naji. In the weeks before the US election, President Trump said rather optimistically that once re-elected the first telephone call he received would be from Iran's leaders asking to negotiate. That phone call to Mr Trump - if he had won - was never going to happen. Negotiating with the Trump administration would have been impossible for Iran; it would be too humiliating. Under President Trump, US sanctions and a policy of maximum pressure have left Iran reeling on the edge of economic collapse. Mr Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal. Worse still, he ordered the killing of General Qasem Soleimani, a close friend of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Taking revenge for his killing remains near the top of the agenda for hardliners. The election of Joe Biden makes entering negotiations with a US administration far easier for Iran. President-Elect Biden does not have the same baggage. He has said he wants to use diplomacy and return to the nuclear deal with Iran. But Iran's hardliners will not come to the table easily. As Americans went to the polls on 3 November, the Supreme Leader claimed the election would have ""no effect"" on Tehran's policies. ""Iran followed a sensible and calculated policy which cannot be affected by changes of personalities in Washington,"" he said. Millions of Iranians thought differently as they quietly watched the US election unfold on their illegal satellite TV screens, convinced their futures depended on the results and hoping a Biden victory would see sanctions eased. There are expectations of a reset of much of Donald Trump's Middle East policy, writesTom Batemanin Jerusalem. President Trump supercharged the two poles of the Middle East. He sought to reward and consolidate America's traditional regional allies, while isolating its adversaries in Tehran. President-elect Biden will try to rewire US Middle East policy back to the way he left it as Vice-President under Barack Obama: Easing Mr Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran and aiming to re-join the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by the White House two years ago. That prospect horrifies Israel and Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE. One Israeli minister said in response to Mr Biden's likely win that the policy would end with ""a violent Israeli-Iranian confrontation, because we will be forced to act"". The result also dramatically shifts the US approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mr Trump's plan was seen to heavily favour Israel and give it the chance to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. That was shelved in favour of historic deals to establish ties between Israel and several Arab states. This drive to regional ""normalisation"" is likely to continue under Mr Biden, but he may try to slow controversial US weapons sales to the Gulf and would likely seek more Israeli concessions. Annexation now seems definitively off the table and Mr Biden will also object to further Israeli settlement building. But there won't be the ""complete U-turn"" that one Palestinian official demanded this week. The rhetoric will return to the traditional understanding of a ""two-state solution"", but the chances of making much progress in the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process look slim. Hopes are high among activists that the Biden administration will increase pressure on Egypt over human rights, writesSally Nabilin Cairo. Egypt's military-backed President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi enjoyed a very good relationship with Donald Trump. It would have been better for him to keep a friend in the White House, but now he will have to start a fresh chapter with Joe Biden. Critics of President Sisi accused the Trump administration of turning a blind eye to his alleged human rights abuses. Egypt receives $1.3bn in US military aid per year. In 2017, a small tranche of this aid was suspended over human rights concerns but was released the following year. Joe Biden winning the White House is seen as good news by many human rights groups here. Activists hope the new US administration will put pressure on the Egyptian government to change its heavy-handed policies toward the opposition - with tens of thousands of political prisoners reportedly in prison. The Egyptian authorities have always denied jailing any prisoners of conscience, challenging the credibility of critical human rights reports. ""US-Egyptian relations have always been strategic, regardless of who sits in the Oval Office,"" says Ahmed Sayyed Ahmed, a political analyst. ""Partnership will continue, but the Democrats' rhetoric about human rights might not be well received by some Egyptians, who see this as meddling in their country's affairs."" After harsh sanctions, Joe Biden's victory brings relief, writes the BBC's Cuba CorrespondentWill Grant. A Biden presidency is exactly what most Cubans have been hoping for. Indeed, the majority of people on the island would happily see almost anyone in the White House other than Donald Trump. His sanctions have brought real hardship and Cubans are exhausted after four years of unrelenting hostility. Joe Biden, on the other hand, revives memories of the recent highpoint in Cuban-US relations under President Obama. In fact, the former vice-president is said to have been instrumental in making the two years of detente possible. The communist-run government in Havana will no doubt continue to say all US presidents are essentially cut from the same cloth. But among the people queuing for basic goods and struggling to make ends meet, the overriding feeling will nonetheless be one of great relief. The only drawback from Cubans point of view? Mr Biden is now well aware of just how positively President Trump's harsh treatment of Cuba played to voters in the key election battleground of Florida. They fear he may be far less inclined to ease some of Mr Trump's measures than he otherwise might have been. Justin Trudeau will see an ally in his new neighbour, writesJessica Murphyin Toronto. The Canadian prime minister pledged to deepen ties with the US no matter who won the presidential election - but it's likely relief was felt in Ottawa when it became clear Democrat Joe Biden had clinched victory. Canada's relationship with the US has been rocky under President Trump, though not without its accomplishments. They include the successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, along with Mexico. But Justin Trudeau has made clear he felt a political kinship with former President Barack Obama - who endorsed him during the recent Canadian federal election. That feeling of warmth extends to the man who served as Mr Obama's vice-president - Joe Biden. In Mr Biden, Mr Trudeau's Liberal Party will find an ally on issues like climate change and multilateralism. But that doesn't mean there aren't opportunities for friction with his administration. President Trump authorised the construction of the Alberta-to-Texas Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project seen as key to Canada's struggling energy sector - but President-elect Biden opposes the project. And Joe Biden's ""Buy American"" economic plan to revive US industry after the coronavirus pandemic will be a concern given Canada's deep dependence on trade with the US.

Making history - the first woman vice-president,"Kamala Harris savoured the moment she became the first woman, and the first black and Asian American, to be vice-president-elect, with a very hearty laugh. In a video posted to her social media she shares the news with President-elect Joe Biden: ""We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!"" Her words are about him but the history of the moment is hers. Just over a year ago, as the senator from California hoping to win the Democratic nomination for presidency, she launched a potent attack on Joe Biden over race during a debate. Many thought it inflicted a serious blow on his ambitions. But by the end of the year her campaign was dead and it was Mr Biden who returned the 56-year-old to the national spotlight by putting her on his ticket. What happens now? What Biden's victory means for rest of world US election results in maps and charts Election results in full ""It is a big reversal of fortune for Kamala Harris,"" says Gil Duran, a communications director for Ms Harris in 2013 and who has critiqued her run for the presidential nomination. ""Many people didn't think she had the discipline and focus to ascend to a position in the White House so quickly... although people knew she had ambition and star potential. It was always clear that she had the raw talent."" What she has demonstrated from the moment she took the national stage with her pitch for the presidency - is grit. Born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents - an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father - her parents divorced when she was five and she was primarily raised by her Hindu single mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist. Kamala as child with her mother and younger sister Maya She grew up engaged with her Indian heritage, joining her mother on visits to India, but Ms Harris has said that her mother adopted Oakland's black culture, immersing her two daughters - Kamala and her younger sister Maya - within it. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she wrote in her autobiography The Truths We Hold. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Her biracial roots and upbringing mean she embodies and can engage with and appeal to many American identities. Those parts of the country which have seen rapid demographic change, enough change to alter a region's politics, see an aspirational symbol in her. But it was her time at Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life. Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Americast: Kamala Harris makes history Profile: Kamala Harris (audio) Lita Rosario-Richardson met Kamala Harris while at Howard in the 1980s when students would gather in the Yard area of the campus to hang out and discuss politics, fashion and gossip. ""I noticed she had a keen sense of argumentation."" They bonded over an aptitude for energetic debate with campus Republicans, their experience growing up with single mothers, even just both being the Libra star sign. It was a formative era politically too. ""Reagan was president at the time and it was the apartheid era and there was a lot of talk about divestiture with 'trans Africa"" and the Martin Luther King  holiday issue,"" Ms Rosario-Richardson says. ""We know that, being descendants of enslaved people and people of colour coming out of colonisation, that we have a special role and having an education gives us a special position in society to help effect change,"" she explains - it was a philosophy and a call to action that was part of the university experience Ms Harris lived. She returned to address students at Howard in 2017 and  took them on a journey from the Ferguson race protests of 2014 to the halls of Capitol Hill in just one sentence: ""You students have joined the fight for justice - you protested. From the streets of Ferguson to the halls of the United States Congress, you have lived the words of James Baldwin, 'There is never a time in the future in which we will work out our salvation. The challenge is in the moment, the time is always now.'"" But Ms Harris also operates with ease in predominantly white communities. Her early years included a brief period in Canada. When Ms Gopalan Harris took a job teaching at McGill University, Ms Harris and her younger sister Maya went with her, attending school in Montreal for five years. Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as an ""American"". Shetold the Washington Post,externalin 2019, that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. ""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said. In 2014, Senator Harris married lawyer Doug Emhoff - now a fixture at her campaign stops - and became stepmother to his two children. Last year shewrote an article for Elle magazine,externalabout the experience of becoming a stepmother and unveiled the name that would then come to dominate many headlines that followed. ""When Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom'. Instead they came up with the name 'Momala'."" They were portrayed as the epitome of modern American ""blended"" family, an image the media took to and one that occupied many column inches about how we talk about female politicians. On becoming vice-president-elect, she is unlikely to lose this nickname but many argue she should also be seen and recognised as the descendant of another kind of family and that is the inheritor of generations of black female activists. ""She is heir to a legacy of grassroots organisers, elected officials, and unsuccessful candidates who paved this path to the White House. Black women are seen as a political force of nature in democratic politics and the Democratic party,"" Nadia Brown, associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, told the BBC. Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Septima Clark are some of the names she follows in the footsteps of, Ms Brown argues. ""Her win is historic but it is not hers alone. It is shared with countless black women who made this day possible."" But from the very earliest, as her friend Ms Rosario-Richardson attests, she showed the skills that allowed her to be one of few women to break through barriers. ""That is what attracted me to get her to join debate team [at Howard University], a fearlessness."" Wit and humour is part of that armoury. The laugh she greeted the president-elect with, when making that first momentous phone call, was one her friend recognised immediately and intimately. ""It clearly shows her personality, even in the short time she has been on the campaign trail."" ""She has always had that laugh, she has always had a sense of humour too, she had a sense of wit - even in the context of a university debate -  to get those points across."" The ability to deliver zingers to her opponents in live debate was very much part of the momentum behind the start of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.  She wasn't afraid of confrontation as in this Twitter exchange with Donald Trump Jr last October. ""Why is @KamalaHarris the only person that laughs at her jokes... always way to long and way too hard?"" Mr Trump's son asked. ""You wouldn't know a joke if one raised you,"" she wrote back. A simple burn on social media, but a popular shorthand for the kind of skills that meant a career in law and politics was a natural fit. Although her career as a prosecutor is what made her a politician, it brought with it political benefits and risks. She began work in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office and became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first black person to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. She gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her election as California's junior US senator in 2017. Harris began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office in Oakland, California. But straddling the line between pleasing left-leaning California Democrats and being a politician for a nation where the left does not decide who gets to be president has been hard. She gained favour among progressives for her acerbic questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, but as a presidential candidate for the Democratic Party her adept debate performances were not enough to compensate for poorly articulated policies. Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris? When Harris could draw a crowd of 20,000 Walking the fine line between the progressive and moderate wings of her party, she ended up appealing to neither. Despite leftward leanings on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, she faced repeated attacks for not really being progressive enough. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record ""Kamala is a cop"" became a common refrain on the campaign trail. But those same law enforcement credentials proved beneficial on the national stage when Democrats needed to win over more moderate voters and independents. She was ""someone with a law enforcement background, and perceived in her own state as being insufficiently progressive... and trying to project an inauthentic self"", Mr Duran says, but adds ""that looks very different in a vice-presidential slot"". As the US grapples with an ongoing racial reckoning and there is scrutiny over police brutality, Ms Harris has taken a front row seat, using her sizable microphone. Kamala Harris endorsed Joe Biden two months after quitting the race Majority of Americans don't support 'defunding' the police On talk shows she calls for changes to police practices across the US, on Twitter she calls for the arrests of the police officers who killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African-American woman from Kentucky, and she speaks frequently about the need to dismantle systemic racism. She has the law enforcement background but she has often said that her identity makes her uniquely suited to represent those on the margins. Now she has the chance to do just that and from inside the White House. The US state looking to take down Trump Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris?

Trump's 17-minute speech fact-checked,"President Trump spoke early on Friday about the US election count, making a number of accusations of fraud for which he did not provide evidence. We've fact-checked some of his claims. US election 2020 live results Mr Trump has posted more than 70 tweets casting doubt on mail-in voting, referencing voter fraud or ""rigged"" elections since April. But there is no evidence the system is corrupt. Electoral fraud is very rare in the United States - the rate is less than 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice. There's no evidence to suggest it's been a major issue at this election either. The president himself has voted by post in the past. He lived outside the state he was registered in, Florida, and requested a postal vote. This is known as an absentee ballot, which Mr Trump has said he is in favour of because he believes it has better safeguards. But he has made a distinction with other forms of mail-in voting, such as when states automatically send out ballots to all registered voters. Oregon and Utah have done so successfully in previous elections. Registered voters in nine states (plus Washington DC) were automatically sent mail-in ballots without having to ask for them. Five of these states introduced this measure because of the coronavirus pandemic. But eight of the nine states - Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, Washington, California, New Jersey, and Vermont - are not currently in contention. All forms of postal voting have safeguards - such as authorities checking that ballots have come from a voter's registered address and requiring signatures on envelopes. Voting by mail is not new - it has been used for many elections. President Trump has repeatedly criticised plans to expand postal voting, saying - without real evidence - it was open to ""tremendous fraud."" He urged Republican voters to turn up on the day, rather than using mail-in ballots. There's evidence from the vote count that this is what has happened - Democratic voters favoured voting by post and Republicans voted on the day in person. The count is not finished but in Pennsylvania, one estimate is that of more than 2.5 million postal votes received,nearly three times as many came from registered Democrats than from Republicans.,external That's not true. The pipe burst at State Farm Arena and affected a room where absentee ballots were being tabulated. Here is thepress release,externalput out by the staff at the arena. That's not true ""in all cases"". In Georgia, which is yet to be decided, the governor and both houses of the legislature are Republican-controlled. The secretary of state, who is in charge of the administration of the election, is Brad Raffensperger who is a Republican. Here is a tweet from 2018 where Donald Trump endorses him.

To take another example, Nevada has a Republican secretary of state overseeing its election. President Trump is talking about poll watchers. These are people inside polling stations who observe the counting of votes, with the aim of ensuring transparency. These are allowed in most states, but they have to be registered before election day, usually affiliated with a party or a candidate, although rules vary from state to state. President Trump has taken issue with a perceived lack of access for Republican observers in certain Democrat-run cities, such as Philadelphia and Detroit. But poll watchers were allowed to observe the count in both cities. A poll watcher in Philadelphia observing the counting The number of poll watchers allowed at a counting facility varies depending on its size. These limits are set out before election day. In some areas numbers were restricted, in part to limit capacity due to coronavirus. There are also limits set to avoid intimidation. In Detroit, more than 130 observers representing both the Democrats and Republicans were allowed inside the convention site. The City Clerk Janice Winfrey said she wasn't aware of Republican observers being removed. In Philadelphia, there was a viral video showing a certified poll watcher being turned away from a polling station, butas we reported, this was due to confusion over the rules and he was later allowed in. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar has said: ""Every candidate and every political party is allowed to have an authorised representative in the room observing the process. Some jurisdictions including Philly are also livestreaming, so you can literally watch their counting process."" President Trump is suggesting counting postal votes which arrive after election day is ""illegal"". But late postal ballots can be counted in around half of US states - as long as they are postmarked by 3 November. This includes the key states of Pennsylvania, Nevada and North Carolina where a winner is yet to be projected. The deadlines for how late a postal ballot can arrive varies from state to state. Other states, such as Georgia and Arizona, don't count postal votes which arrive after election day. In his speech, President Trump said in Pennsylvania late postal ballots were being counted ""without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever"". The state's Supreme Court ruled late ballots with missing or illegible postmarks would be counted unless sufficient evidence ""demonstrates that it was mailed after election day"". Every postal ballot goes through several steps to be verified, such as a signature and address check. Mr Trump is referring to the TFC Center in Detroit, Michigan - a battleground state. On Wednesday, there were chaotic scenes when poll watchers claimed they were being blocked from the counting hall as windows were covered. The City of Detroit's principal attorney, Lawrence Garcia, said in a statement: ""Some - but not all - windows were covered, because poll workers seated just inside those windows expressed concerns about people outside the center photographing and filming them and their work."" Windows at the TFC Center being boarded up There were in fact hundreds of poll watchers - from both parties - inside the count. Officials prevented more poll watchers coming in because it was already over-capacity.

Liverpool doubles city-wide testing trial sites,"Long queues built up on Friday after mass testing started in Liverpool The number of coronavirus testing sites in Liverpool has doubled after ""really good interest"" in the scheme, its public health director has said. Matthew Ashton said a total of up to 12,000 people weretested at six centres on Fridayas England's first trial of city-wide testing began. Mr Ashton said a further eight sites were brought in on Saturday. The city council said it could extend the two-week pilot scheme as more opened. All residents and workers in Liverpool - the first area to be placed under England's tier three restrictions - have been offered regular tests, regardless of whether they display symptoms. Officials say this is in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. Healthcare, education and other key workers, along with students, have been particularly encouraged to take a test. UK bans Denmark visitors over mink Covid-19 fears Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? What I bought before the shops closed Mr Ashton told BBC Radio 4 Today: ""We are still working on the numbers but we think (there were) about 1,500-2,000 people per testing centre. ""So really good numbers and lots of interest, so it was very encouraging. ""For the most part, it ran very smoothly. It was good, it wasn't perfect but we'll improve it"". City mayor Joe Anderson said: ""The people of Liverpool did not let us down on the first day and I am delighted that so many people turned out for a test. ""This is a huge logistical exercise the likes of which has not been tried before, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank people for their patience and understanding as I know many had to queue for a while for a test."" Residents are urged to book tests online or by phone, and not to turn up without an appointment. People with symptoms have been told to not attend the mass testing centres but instead arrange a test at one of the mobile testing units in the city. Some health experts have criticised the trial, with Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, warning that plans to test asymptomatic people went against advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to prioritise tests for those displaying symptoms. The military has been drafted in to help the NHS Mr Ashton said he thought the nationwide lockdown, which started in England on Thursday, was necessary because tier three rules had not been successful in limiting transmission. He said the summer exit from the first national lockdown occurred when Liverpool ""still had levels of the virus in our community"". ""They weren't high but they were still very present and it was higher than other parts of the country, and I think that's what drove the big increases in the north west [â¦] so we were first to have the second wave,"" he said. By cutting social contact, he said, the new lockdown measures would ""absolutely help"" to bring transmission down. ""The big question is will they cut them enough, will it take the levels of the virus low enough?"" As of Friday, 58 deaths were reported in the city during the past week, according to data. Overall, Liverpool recorded 1,501 coronavirus cases in the seven days to 3 November, compared with 2,074 cases in the previous week. This means the rate had dropped from 416 per 100,000 people to 301 per 100,000. Across England overall, the rate was 240 per 100,000.

Scotland becomes first part of UK to ban smacking,"Backers of the bill rallied outside Holyrood on the morning of the vote Scotland's ban on parents smacking their children has become law, making it the first part of the UK to outlaw physical punishment of under-16s. Parents and carers were previously allowed to use physical force to discipline their children if it was considered ""reasonable chastisement"". The new law means that the so-called ""justifiable assault"" defence is no longer available. It seeks to give children the same protection from assault as adults. Sweden was the first country in the world to ban smacking in the home when it outlawed corporal punishment in 1979. Scotland has now become the 58th to do so. Scotland becomes first UK country to ban smacking Wales to bring in smacking ban after assembly vote In January, Wales was the second part of the UK to pass a law banning people from smacking their children. It will begin in 2022. There are not currently any plans for England or Northern Ireland to follow suit. Children's charity the NSPCC said Scotland's ban was a ""common sense"" move. The charity's Joanna Barrett said: ""This law sets out in clear terms that physical punishment should no longer be part of childhood in Scotland and it marks a momentous step in making it a country where children's rights are truly recognised, respected and fulfilled."" The smacking ban bill was introduced to the Scottish Parliament by Scottish Greens MSP John Finnie, a former police officer, who won the support of the SNP, Labour and Lib Dems as well as his own party and many children's charities. Mr Finnie said smacking teaches children that ""might is right"", and that the ban would ""send a strong message that violence is never acceptable in any setting"". Children's Minister Maree Todd said: ""This outdated defence has no place in a modern Scotland. It can never be reasonable to strike a child."" Opponents argued the changes were ""unnecessary"" as existing laws already protected children from abuse at the hands of adults. They said the changes would do nothing to help vulnerable children who were the victims of serious physical abuse, but could cause traumatic interventions in ""good"" families, who use discipline such as a smack on the bottom. Opponents of the ban say mild smacking does no long-term harm to a child Previously, when deciding whether the chastisement of a child under 16 was reasonable, the courts took into account factors such as the nature of the punishment, its duration and frequency, the age of the child and the effect - both physical and mental - it had on them. In practice, this generally meant parents were allowed to smack their children on the body - but blows to the head, shaking or the use of an implement were illegal. All physical punishment in schools and other education settings was already completely banned. The bill will end the defence of ""reasonable chastisement"", meaning parents could face prosecution for any use of physical punishment on their children. The act uses the same definition of physical punishment, sometimes referred to as corporal punishment, used by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. It includes hitting such as smacking, slapping and smacking with a hand or an implement, as well as kicking, shaking or throwing children, scratching, pinching, biting, pulling hair or boxing ears, forcing children to stay in uncomfortable positions, burning, scalding or forced ingestion. A reportpublished by a group of Scottish children's charities,externalin 2015 found that the physical punishment of children was more common in the UK than in similar countries such as the US, Canada, Italy, Germany and Sweden. The researchers estimated that between 70% and 80% of parents in the UK had used physical punishment, with children aged between three and seven the most likely to be smacked. They also found that many parents did not view smacking as a ""good thing"", but believed that sometimes it was the ""only thing that will work"". The researchers also said the use of physical chastisement had declined over the years, alongside a shift in public attitudes, with ""convincing evidence"" that the decline had been steeper in the more than 50 countries around the world that had already banned smacking. Research examining the views of children on smacking has suggested that it hurts and upsets them, and does not always stop bad behaviour. A campaign against the ban was led by the Be Reasonable Scotland group, which called the legislation ""draconian"" and argued it could do more harm than good. The group argues that the existing law only allowed parents to use ""very mild discipline"" such as a smack on the hand or bottom - which could become a criminal offence in the future. A spokesman said: ""In the years ahead, loving parents who have had no contact with the authorities previously and who present no risk to their children will face stressful intervention, blacklisting on police databases and even criminal records for smacking. The majority of Scots see this as an injustice, not a positive change."" They urged the government to instead invest in social work and other services to improve their ability to identify and tackle genuine abuse. Parents in England and Wales can currently face criminal charges if they hit a child so hard that it leaves a mark, or causes bruising, swelling, cuts, grazes or scratches. However, Wales has now passed an outright ban that will remove the defence of ""reasonable punishment"" that has been in force since Victorian times in England and Wales. There have been calls for England to follow suit, with the Association of Educational Psychologists saying last year thatsmacking is harmful to children's mental healthand should be banned. Northern Ireland has similar legal provisions to those in England and Wales, while Ireland banned smacking in 2015.

US election results in maps and chartsCould the election be decided in courts?VideoVideo'It blows my mind people don't like President Trump'VideoVideoFive new faces making US political historyJoe Biden and a life in politics,"Joe Biden has been elected president of the United States, after his projected victory in Pennsylvania took him over the winning line. With all states now projected, President-elect Biden has 306 electoral college votes and Donald Trump has 232. A candidate needs 270 or more to win. Mr Biden will become the 46th president in January, pending the outcome of any legal challenges. There is still a recount to come inGeorgia, but Mr Biden has a lead of almost 15,000 votes and the 16 electoral college votes are not enough to overturn his overall victory. Mr Biden's running mate,Kamala Harris, will make history as the first woman vice-president, as well as the first black and the first Asian American vice-president. Click or tap on the map below to get detailed results. For full results click or tap here,external This map shows where either the Republicans (red arrows) or Democrats (blue arrows) have performed better than in 2016. It is far from a consistent picture, with both parties gaining in some areas and losing support in others. Narrow gains for Mr Biden inGeorgia,Arizona,Michigan,Wisconsinand, crucially,Pennsylvania, were enough for him to flip those states and win the presidency. Unfortunately for Mr Trump, his gains were concentrated in states he already won last time around - for example strongholds such asIdaho,Utah,ArkansasandTennessee. US election results in maps and charts With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Mr Biden has been projected to overturn Mr Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. A strengthening of support in some areas where the Democrats also did well in 2016 - particularly around Philadelphia in the south east corner - has been enough to generate this result. As well as Pennsylvania, Mr Biden also managed to flip four other states that Mr Trump won in 2016 -Wisconsin,Michigan,ArizonaandGeorgia. The first three had been Democrat strongholds for decades before favouring Mr Trump over Hillary Clinton four years ago. Arizona has not been won by a Democrat since Bill Clinton's second term 24 years ago, and Georgia not since Mr Clinton's first win in 1992. In the US electoral system, the results in each state have a widely varying impact on the final result, with states that have larger populations given more say than those with smaller populations. The map below represents each state and the District of Columbia as a square, with its area corresponding to the number of votes its representatives will cast in the electoral college that ultimately decides whether Mr Biden or Mr Trump has won the presidency. It shows that both the Republicans and the Democrats have won their share of larger and smaller states, but Mr Biden has now picked up states worth more than the 270 he needed to win the presidency. Mr Trump managed to hold off challenges from Mr Biden in three of the four biggest battleground states -Texas,FloridaandOhio. But the wins in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania - worth 73 electoral college votes altogether - have been enough for Mr Biden to win the presidency. Preliminary figures show the highest turnout since 1900, with 66.4% of eligible voters turning out compared with 60.1% in 2016. As Mr Biden also leads the national popular vote on 50.8% to Mr Trump's 47.4% - a lead of over five million votes - this boost in participation means that the president-elect has already received more votes than any candidate in US electoral history - close to 78 million so far, with the count continuing in some states. Mr Trump has also increased his vote tally compared with 2016 by more than 9 million votes, to over 72 million this year. Despite being projected to lose the election, this figure gives him the second-highest number of votes of any US presidential candidate. Mr Trump has been projected to win the closely-fought state of Florida, with 51% of the vote compared with Mr Biden's 48%. Despite taking what is typically a bellwether state, Mr Trump failed to win a second term in the White House. Exit poll estimates put Mr Trump on a 61% share of the white vote in Florida. Mr Biden appears to have made up ground on Hillary Clinton's performance with this demographic in 2016. However, Mr Trump is also estimated to have gained 12 points among Latino voters, bringing him nearly level with Mr Biden. Here's how the map coloured up, from the first states to be projected on election night, to Pennsylvania on Saturday. This interactive can only be visible with Javascript enabled. Although the Democrats have made a net gain of one seat in the race for the Senate, the Republicans remain ahead, on 50 seats to the Democrats' 48. Both of the Georgia senate races have gone to a run-off after no candidate secured more than 50% of the votes. There will now be another vote, on 5 January 2021, to separate the two top candidates in each race and determine which party controls the legislature's upper chamber. In the House, despite losing five seats the Democrats have now crossed the winning line of 218 and will retain their majority. There are still 13 seats to declare so the exact size of the majority is still to be determined. Exit poll data from across the United States gives a glimpse into voters' priorities and an indication of how different demographic groups cast their ballots. The figures suggest the proportion of total voters who are white has fallen by six percentage points on 2016, while remaining the largest group by ethnicity. The proportion of white voters backing Mr Biden has risen by five points on Hillary Clinton's figure at the last election, but Mr Trump still takes the largest share of this group, the preliminary polling suggests. Meanwhile, Mr Biden appears to have gained support among under 30s and the middle-aged. The exit polls are carried out across the US by Edison Research and are a combination of election day interviews and telephone polling, designed to reach early and absentee voters. Nationally, more than a third of voters said the economy was the most important issue in deciding who to choose as president, with a further 20% naming racial inequality and 17% saying the coronavirus pandemic. However the issues were split along partisan lines with more than four times as many Trump voters saying the economy was the deciding factor, and Biden voters answering racial inequality and the virus. Voters were evenly split on how the US economy was faring, with 48% saying it was in ""excellent or good"" condition and 50% saying it was ""not so good or poor"". Similarly, 50% said that the US was doing ""somewhat or very badly"" at containing the pandemic and 48% thought the country was doing ""somewhat or very well"". The possibility of voter fraud has been raised repeatedly by the Trump campaign but a large majority of voters (87%) told the researchers they were confident that votes in their state would be counted accurately. The exit polls are made up of a national exit poll and 22 state exit polls which are carried out by Edison Research for the National Election Pool (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC). For the national poll, a total of 15,590 voters who cast ballots on Election Day were interviewed at 115 polling places as they exited the polling places.  This survey also includes 4,919 absentee and/or early voters interviewed by telephone. The data is then weighted to be representative of the population and are adjusted further as votes are counted. All samples are approximations and are subject to a margin of error which will be wider for small sub-groups such as smaller ethnic groups.

Valleys' social distancing 'like changing DNA',"Merthyr Tydfil in lockdown: It has been among the worst-hit areas of the UK for case rates for several days ""The nature of the people in the valleys is to be close, we need to be close...you are trying to change a culture that has been in the DNA for centuries."" Merthyr Tydfil has one of the worst case rates for Covid-19 in the UK, and the highest rate of infections in the whole of Wales. But with people in the county having been living under lockdown for almost six weeks, why is this Valley's county being hit so hard by the virus? Is Wales coming out of lockdown too early? Has the firebreak lockdown had an impact? Thirteen more Covid deaths reported in Wales Front-line medical staff have spoken of families across the county being destroyed by the virus, homelessness is on the rise, and people are turning to foodbanks. But while community spirit remains strong, with more people volunteering to help those isolating and vulnerable, and neighbours checking on each other, there are fears the friendliness of the valleys could be a major part of the problem. The tightly-packed terraced streets are being blamed for the rise in the virus, with people living on top of each other Why the cases in Merthyr are so high is a complex picture. Those in charge of the pandemic's response point to an array of issues, from outright rule breaking, to ""lockdown fatigue"", workplace transmissions, and people having no choice but to break the rules in order to earn a living, feed their families and survive. But while much is being made of those having house parties and having bonfires, officials are keen to point out the reason why Merthyr is struggling is not about blame, but about people's sense of community. ""There is no more non-compliance in Merthyr than anywhere else in Wales, the majority of people are trying to be really responsible, they are doing what they can to protect each other,"" said Public Health Wales' Heather Lewis. Before the Wales-wide ""firebreak"" lockdown began on 23 October,people living in the county had already been under local lockdown restrictions for a month. While people have been banned from mixing with others outside their household outdoors, and are being told to only travel for essential reasons, cases continue to rise. Mrs Lewis, consultant in health protection for Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board, said it was mostly due to people chatting indoors, which is why the message has been to stay at home and limit physical contact. ""You are more likely to get Covid from someone you know than a random person in a supermarket, people are fantastic with social distancing in work, but when they go to someone's house, they relax,"" she said. Many on the ground say it is hard to stem the spread in estates, towns and villages across the valleys, as many live close to their extended families, and popping round to check on relatives, neighbours and friends is a way of life. This video can not be played Dr Chris Williams said even sitting across a table from someone else could lead to transmission of the virus Across Wales, areas classed as the some of the most deprived, with highest rates of unemployment and in-work poverty, appear to have been the hardest hit. In Merthyr Tydfil, figures show that one of those worst affected areas in the county is the Gurnos, one of the most deprived places in Wales, where about 5,000 people live. ""You are all condensed into one community, there's one shop, and one place that everyone goes to, it's always going to be quite difficult in these communities,"" said Lee Davies, a councillor for the Gurnos. ""People are living on top of each other. They are really friendly, they talk to each other in the street, they're calling in each other's houses, to make sure they're OK."" He said he was on the estate last week to talk to someone who'd had issues with anti social behaviour and was invited in, but said he could not due to the rules. ""Two minutes later, she said 'I'm glad you didn't come in, I've got Covid',"" he said. He said many people there were out of work or feared losing their jobs if they had to self-isolate. It's a message repeated by many working in communities, where people in casual and zero-hour contract jobs face not being paid if they stay at home. ""I'm really concerned for people's mental health, people losing their jobs, not being able to afford their bills and food,"" said Mr Davies. ""There is support out there, the community support has been incredible, but people are proud, they don't want to ask for support, but it is hard. One family in Dowlais... all four of them have got it, and they're not getting paid because they are not working."" Has the firebreak had an impact? Mr Davies, also runs the Gurnos Men's Project, a group which aims to help build confidence and skills in the community in a bid to get them into work, and said, while they had met on Zoom, not being able to see each other in person was a problem. ""People are frustrated, people are struggling with their mental health, not seeing friends and family, some people are disregarding rules, there's lots of families that have lost work and they're struggling,"" he said. Shoppers got out and about before lockdown forced non-essential stores to close On Wednesday, Merthyr Tydfil got the title no-one wantsand became the place with the worst case rate in the UK, with 741 cases per 100,000 people. While this has now fallen, with figures published on Friday showing a drop to 639.9, it remains the worst-hit area in Wales. All three areas with the highest Covid-19 rates lie in the valleys, with Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent also both having rates in excess of 500 per 100,000 of the population. Heather Lewis said the issue in the valleys came down to the geography - such as the narrow terraced streets and tightly packed communities - and also the culture. While clusters exist in workplaces, and cases in care homes are increasing, the majority of transmissions are happening in people's homes and social networks, with cases not confined to one area, but spread across communities. ""In places like Powys and rural areas, people often have to get in the car to see their friends and family, and that can make them stop and think, but in these communities people tend to live close to their extended families, and are just popping round next door,"" she said. ""It is such a community, there is such a sense of togetherness. It would be lovely in normal circumstances, but in covid it is a massive problem. ""People are used to being in these close-knit communities, popping round to their mum's, having a cup of tea, we are asking people to change behaviour which has built up over decades, which is difficult."" Officials are calling for hope not blame within the communities hit hardest by the pandemic During the most recent lockdown, as community centres, pubs, hair salons and leisure centres closed, Merthyr Tydfil council leader, Councillor Kevin O'Neill said he had made sure parks and cemeteries remained open. ""We're hemmed in,"" he said, pointing to the vast open space of the Brecon Beacons just out of reach during lockdown. People on the border in a 'difficult situation' ""If you close these things, where do the people go then? They clearly go to their friends' houses to congregate, or they might go to the local shop,"" he said. ""This is the problem we are up against, particularly in Merthyr Tydfil, when you shut down the pubs and community centres - there's nowhere to go, it's pushing people back to drinking at home."" Merthyr council leader Kevin O'Neill said it was not a community specific problem but the nature of valleys people to want to see each other Mr O'Neill said during the last lockdown many abided by the rules, but that had now been replaced by a ""weariness"", and even ""reasonable people"" were now fed up and breaking rules - and there were still those who believed the virus was a hoax. But he said for many the sacrifices had now just become too much - with people unable to be at births, deaths, marriages, and funerals - and some elderly had been left wondering ""how many year's have I got left?"" ""I think people have done so much, they really have, it's heart-breaking, that's why you have to have some sympathy for people who say, 'we've had enough'."" Local Member of the Senedd Dawn Bowden said people were having to make really hard choices Many working with communities point to cases where people faced stark choices. Mr O'Neill said some employers had threatened staff, not wanting them to be tested, or telling them they would lose their jobs or not be paid if they self-isolated, and ordering them to switch off the tracking on their phones. He said the numbers on benefits had gone up by at least 10%. Meanwhile, Member of the Senedd Dawn Bowden said there were also cases of people spending money to get to work, only to be told they weren't needed and sent home. She said people were having to make really hard choices, with it being particularly hard on those relying on family members for support, but she  added that many people who contacted her, despite their worries, were supportive of the measures. ""The most complaints I get is about other people not abiding by the rules, and there's not a crackdown on them. That's the reality,"" she said. Laura Mochan said she was remaining hopeful for the future but it was hard when people were falling ill and businesses were struggling Charity worker Laura Mochan, who lives in the community, said she believed the high level of cases boiled down to a ""mixture of confusion and fear"", and the different messages in different parts of the UK. ""It is my opinion that those refusing to adhere are doing so out of fear of the other factors involved, such as the increase in suicides, job losses and loss of close contact with family members,"" she said. ""It is taking its toll on us all in different ways. The tragedies reach beyond the virus and its direct affect on people."" Ms Mochan said she she felt more apprehensive than before and worried lockdown may be ending too soon, with people not taking the rules seriously enough. But she said, while it was tough, she felt hopeful that cases would fall, people would stop dying and the businesses would survive. But Mr O'Neill said, while cases were higher in some communities, the areas were not problematic, and repeated that it was the ""togetherness"" and ""closeness"" which sadly was causing the spread. With the national lockdown coming to an end on Monday, there are concerns, but Mr O'Neill said that he believed the majority of people would do their best and stick to the new rules after weeks in lockdown. ""Someone needs to let the pressure out, we need to have a graduated return to normality, but normality will never be what it's been,"" he said. He said that the key message is that people needed to think with every action, if it would put their loved-ones at risk, but what was needed was a ""message of hope"". ""What makes us so strong is that we are communities, we are together, and we will recover, we will go on, nothing will break us down,"" he said. Down the road, in Rhondda Cynon Taf, a chip shop owner says the rules are being adhered to (picture taken before the pandemic) As figures suggest case rates are beginning to fall in valleys hotspots, down the road in Hirwaun, in Rhondda Cynon Taf, there is hope the message is getting through. At Penaluna's Fish and Chip Shop, owner Lee Penaluna, said the pandemic had hit his business hard but he had adapted and he now felt positive people were listening to the rules in the area. Q&A: What can you do after Wales' firebreak ends? ""On the Friday we locked down it was mental, but on the Saturday we were down about 60%,"" he said, adding they had seen a huge uptake in click and collect. ""I've had to take a few customers out of the shop and say, 'you can't come in here, you're not following the rules', but 99.9% of people have been excellent and respected them."" Mrs Lewis said one day the pandemic would come to an end and that people needed to change behaviours and continue to make sacrifices, in the hope there would be some sense of normality at Christmas. ""People are saying this is never-ending, but what we are hoping to see is a slight levelling off in infections in coming days, as the actions of the firebreak come in,"" she said, adding the outcome of measures would not be seen for weeks. ""We need to renew our efforts, and stick with it, however heart-breaking it may feel."" Is Wales coming out of lockdown too early?

How close are we now?,"It's been three days since the US election. You might have reasonably expected to have some kind of clue about the results by now. We still cannot say, because not enough votes have been counted for either Donald Trump or Joe Biden to claim victory. But the moment we will be able to tell you someone has won does seem to be getting much closer. And results are still coming in. The huge number of postal votes cast during this pandemic election, and different states' laws about how to count them, meant this always was going to take longer if the race was tight. Yes, so far, and by a big margin, but that's not what decides who gets to be president. Instead, a candidate has to win the majority in a system called the electoral college, where each state gets a certain number of votes or ""electors"" roughly in proportion to its population. If you win a state, you win all its votes (except Nebraska and Maine, but that's complicated). There are 538 state votes and the person who gets 270 wins the prize. Mr Biden is on 253 electoral college votes to Mr Trump's 214. There are several ways each of them could reach 270. If Mr Biden gets Pennsylvania, that's all he needs - he is over the line. Georgia and any of Nevada, Arizona or North Carolina works for him too. Mr Trump would need Pennsylvania's votes and to win three states out of Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada or Arizona. So how are they doing in these states? Georgia (16 votes):The story here is about how Mr Biden ate into Mr Trump's lead in a solid Republican state as postal votes and tallies from more Democratic counties came in. Mr Biden has taken a very slim lead in the state and there are still votes to be counted, such as military and overseas votes.  But because the margin is so tight, there is going to be a recount. Pennsylvania (20 votes):There are fewer than 115,000 mail ballots left to count,external, and Mr Biden has now taken the lead. As mail ballots in most places tend to go Democratic, analysts are watching to see how wide this lead gets. Nevada (6 votes):Mr Biden has pulled ahead in Nevada. About 150,000 ballots are yet to be counted, many of them from Clark county, which leans Democratic. Arizona (11 votes):Joe Biden has a lead that is narrowing. Many of those votes still to be counted are from Maricopa County, home to 60% of the state's population - and Mr Trump has been catching up a bit as these votes get counted. Donald Trump has done better than expected and Joe Biden has failed to win those battleground states which count votes quickly, but the Democrat is closing the gap in crucial states as votes get counted. How close are we to knowing the winner? Who has lead in states still counting? How Americans are coping with the long wait What happens if there is a tie, and other questions Election results in full Each state has its own laws and systems for counting votes. Individual states are also in charge of the order in which they count different types of votes - for example postal votes are often counted last. So that makes a difference when Republicans tend to vote in person on the day and postal votes tend to skew Democratic. As there were so many postal votes cast during this pandemic election, this is why we have seen such late dramatic shifts in who leads a race. Another thing to be aware of is that different news outlets have different tallies for each candidate dependingon where they get election data from.So some outlets have called Arizona for Mr Biden, but the BBC thinks it's still not decided. Mr Trump has launched some legal challenges, but analysts suggest most of these challengesconcern small numbers of ballots that might not make a difference in the end,with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Supreme Court previously hinted it could revisit the rules about deadlines for accepting postal votes. Poll officials in Michigan - now projected for Biden - work to tally ballots It now looks like polling data ahead of the election didn't tell us the whole story about the American public. Many observers didn't realise the race would be so tight. Robert Cuffe, the BBC's head of statistics, says it's still too early to say whether this election has been a pollster's nightmare. Final national polls showed Mr Biden leading Mr Trump by about eight points. In battleground states Mr Biden also polled in the lead, but by a much slimmer margin. Currently Mr Biden leads Mr Trump in the share of the popular vote by about three percentage points. Some experts suspect there's a part of the American public which won't even participate in polls because they don't trust institutions - they're more likely to vote for Mr Trump. Voter priorities may have also been slightly misjudged. While the coronavirus pandemic has dominated headlines, a survey conducted by Edison Research found that more voters (a third in total) listed the economy as their key issue - it was a core Trump message. Mr Trump's vote also looks a little bit more diverse than many might have assumed. You can read more about the resultshere.

But the moment we will be able to tell you someone has won does seem to be getting much closer. And results are still coming in. The huge number of postal votes cast during this pandemic election, and different states' laws about how to count them, meant this always was going to take longer if the race was tight. Yes, so far, and by a big margin, but that's not what decides who gets to be president. Instead, a candidate has to win the majority in a system called the electoral college, where each state gets a certain number of votes or ""electors"" roughly in proportion to its population. If you win a state, you win all its votes (except Nebraska and Maine, but that's complicated). There are 538 state votes and the person who gets 270 wins the prize. Mr Biden is on 253 electoral college votes to Mr Trump's 214. There are several ways each of them could reach 270. If Mr Biden gets Pennsylvania, that's all he needs - he is over the line. Georgia and any of Nevada, Arizona or North Carolina works for him too. Mr Trump would need Pennsylvania's votes and to win three states out of Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada or Arizona. So how are they doing in these states? Georgia (16 votes):The story here is about how Mr Biden ate into Mr Trump's lead in a solid Republican state as postal votes and tallies from more Democratic counties came in. Mr Biden has taken a very slim lead in the state and there are still votes to be counted, such as military and overseas votes.  But because the margin is so tight, there is going to be a recount. Pennsylvania (20 votes):There are fewer than 115,000 mail ballots left to count,external, and Mr Biden has now taken the lead. As mail ballots in most places tend to go Democratic, analysts are watching to see how wide this lead gets. Nevada (6 votes):Mr Biden has pulled ahead in Nevada. About 150,000 ballots are yet to be counted, many of them from Clark county, which leans Democratic. Arizona (11 votes):Joe Biden has a lead that is narrowing. Many of those votes still to be counted are from Maricopa County, home to 60% of the state's population - and Mr Trump has been catching up a bit as these votes get counted. Donald Trump has done better than expected and Joe Biden has failed to win those battleground states which count votes quickly, but the Democrat is closing the gap in crucial states as votes get counted. How close are we to knowing the winner? Who has lead in states still counting? How Americans are coping with the long wait What happens if there is a tie, and other questions Election results in full Each state has its own laws and systems for counting votes. Individual states are also in charge of the order in which they count different types of votes - for example postal votes are often counted last. So that makes a difference when Republicans tend to vote in person on the day and postal votes tend to skew Democratic. As there were so many postal votes cast during this pandemic election, this is why we have seen such late dramatic shifts in who leads a race. Another thing to be aware of is that different news outlets have different tallies for each candidate dependingon where they get election data from.So some outlets have called Arizona for Mr Biden, but the BBC thinks it's still not decided. Mr Trump has launched some legal challenges, but analysts suggest most of these challengesconcern small numbers of ballots that might not make a difference in the end,with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Supreme Court previously hinted it could revisit the rules about deadlines for accepting postal votes. Poll officials in Michigan - now projected for Biden - work to tally ballots It now looks like polling data ahead of the election didn't tell us the whole story about the American public. Many observers didn't realise the race would be so tight. Robert Cuffe, the BBC's head of statistics, says it's still too early to say whether this election has been a pollster's nightmare. Final national polls showed Mr Biden leading Mr Trump by about eight points. In battleground states Mr Biden also polled in the lead, but by a much slimmer margin. Currently Mr Biden leads Mr Trump in the share of the popular vote by about three percentage points. Some experts suspect there's a part of the American public which won't even participate in polls because they don't trust institutions - they're more likely to vote for Mr Trump. Voter priorities may have also been slightly misjudged. While the coronavirus pandemic has dominated headlines, a survey conducted by Edison Research found that more voters (a third in total) listed the economy as their key issue - it was a core Trump message. Mr Trump's vote also looks a little bit more diverse than many might have assumed. You can read more about the resultshere.

Biden predicts victory as counts head in his favourJoe Biden says he is confident of winning the US election as his lead grows in key states.,"This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'We're going to win this race' Joe Biden has again said he is confident of victory as he inches closer to beating Donald Trump after Tuesday's US presidential election. The Democratic challenger now has 253 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to clinch the White House under the state-by-state US voting system. Mr Biden leads vote counts in the battlegrounds of Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Arizona. A Biden win would see Mr Trump leave office in January after four years. As counting enters its fifth day, it is still unclear when the contest will end. Officials are tallying up record numbers of postal votes due to the coronavirus pandemic, causing the longest delay to a presidential election result in 20 years. ""We're going to win this race,"" Mr Biden told supporters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Friday night, striking a confident tone. He was joined by his running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris. Latest updates: 'We will win' says Biden US election results in maps and charts When will we know who has won? He said he was on track to win more than 300 Electoral College votes and pointed out that more people had voted for his campaign - over 74 million people - than any US presidential candidate in history. Mr Biden said Americans had given him a mandate to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, the struggling economy, climate change and systemic racism. On Friday for the third straight day the US set a fresh record for new Covid-19 cases, with more than 127,000 infections. The Democrat - presenting himself as the candidate of unity after a bitterly fought campaign - said it was time to ""get the vitriol out of our politics"" and ""be civil to one another"". ""We may be opponents but we're not enemies, we're Americans,"" said Mr Biden, who did not mention his Republican opponent, Mr Trump. Mr Biden's appearance had originally been planned as a victory speech, but he opted instead to give a general update on the state of the race as US TV networks cautiously held off declaring him the winner. The Democrat said he hoped to address the nation again on Saturday. Joe Biden delivered a holding speech rather than a victory speech, but he hit all the familiar themes that will no doubt feature if and when he addresses the nation as president-elect. He's been remarkably consistent throughout the campaign - that's part of his appeal in these chaotic times. He hailed the election results so far as a broad mandate for change, although they're not the resounding repudiation of President Trump for which the Democrats had hoped. Once again he presented himself as a leader who believes in America, who could unify the bitterly divided country - ""the purpose of politics isn't total unrelenting warfare"" he said. In the same breath he nodded to his own impatience for an outcome, and presented a stark contrast to President Trump's false claims of voter fraud. Watching the ballot tallies is ""slow and numbing"" he said, but they represent people who ""exercise the fundamental right to have their voices heard."" Mr Biden - who ran twice previously for the White House, in 1988 and 2008, without success - would be the oldest president ever inaugurated at 78. If he is declared the victor this weekend, his team is expected to begin its transition process on Monday. The New York Times reports Mr Biden could announce the first senior officials in his potential administration as early as next week. The Secret Service has sent reinforcements to Delaware to beef up Mr Biden's security detail. The Federal Aviation Administration has restricted flights over Wilmington's airspace. However, there is no indication Mr Trump will concede to his opponent in the short term. This video can not be played ""Happy day"" for Nancy Pelosi, but Lindsey Graham says Trump should ""fight hard"" ""Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President,"" he tweeted on Friday afternoon. ""I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!"" Mr Trump has been making unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, spurring some fellow Republicans to speak up that the rhetoric should be toned down. Since at least 1896 every defeated presidential candidate has conceded defeat to the winner. But there is no law or constitutional requirement to do so. The constitution does however state that a new elected president will automatically take office at noon on 20 January following an election. President Trump is angry and disappointed that more of his allies are not rallying to his side on television or in the streets, according to White House officials on Friday. On Saturday he wrote a series of tweets making unsubstantiated allegations of illegality in the voting process - all of which were labelled as disputed and potentially misleading by Twitter. He also insisted he had won the election ""by a lot"". He has been watching television, making phone calls to on-the-ground campaign offices, and dividing his time between the Oval Office and the residence. This video can not be played Speaking from the White House, Donald Trump slammed the electoral process Several aides did not show up for work on Friday and the White House was described as ""very empty"" with a sombre mood. Adding to the bad news, it was reported on Friday night that White House Chief of StaffMark Meadows, 61, had tested positive for coronavirus. Trump's 17-minute speech fact-checked Tables turned as Trump voters start to worry The president has indicated to senior advisers that he will forge ahead with legal challenges to the results, although there is still no firm strategy for such litigation. One senior outside adviser to the president described his mood on Friday as ""somewhere between sullen and hopeful"". The source added that Mr Trump ""was the last one to think he could win in 2016"", despite his top aides telling him that he would. Mr Biden is leading Mr Trump by more than 4 million votes out of a record 145 million cast. But US presidential election results are decided on a state-by-state basis in the Electoral College, and the contest is much closer in the key battlegrounds. Mr Biden has 253 Electoral College votes, while Mr Trump has 214. To win the White House, a candidate needs 270. In Pennsylvania, where Mr Biden was born, he is ahead by nearly 29,000 votes, with 99% counted. If he takes that state along with its 20 Electoral College votes, he will win the election. Officials released a statement on Friday,externalsaying that the ""overwhelming majority"" of postal and absentee votes had now been tallied, and they were now beginning to count provisional ballots. However they did not say when the count will be complete. This video can not be played 'All of a sudden Trump's losing? Come on' The Rust Belt state voted Democratic in six consecutive White House races before it swung to Mr Trump in 2016. In Georgia, Mr Biden is currently leading with more than 7,000 votes, and 99% of the ballots counted. Georgia's secretary of state said there would be a recount because the margin was so small. Georgia (16 electoral votes) is a traditionally Republican state and has not been won by a Democrat in a presidential race since 1992. Mr Biden leads by more than 22,000 votes in Nevada (six electoral votes) and by fewer than 30,000 in Arizona (11 electoral votes). Mr Trump leads in North Carolina (15 electoral votes) by more than 76,000 ballots. Who will be the next US president?

Boy made poppies to bring 'happiness in sad times',"Harry drew each of the handmade poppies An eight-year-old boy who wanted to make people ""happy in these sad times"", has raised more than Â£1,000 for the Poppy Appeal. Harry Fletcher from Hartlepool began making poppies to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day during the first coronavirus lockdown in May. Unable to take part in the remembrance parade on Sunday, he decided to sell handmade poppies for Â£1 each for the Royal British Legion. His target of Â£20 has reached Â£1,137. He said: ""I struggled in the first lockdown and when mam told me we couldn't do the remembrance parade with my Cubs I said we should sell the poppies to raise money for the British Legion."" Harry drew each and laminated each poppy Harry said he ""really enjoyed making the poppies"" but when too many orders came in he had to think of how to make them quicker so he came up with the idea of printing them. ""I said to my mam they will make people happy in these sad times. ""It makes me feel very happy that the money raised will help a lot of people who used to be in the Army,"" he added. The JustGiving page has raised more than Â£1,000 for the Royal British Legion and cash donations of Â£302 will given to the Hartlepool Legion. Orders came from as far as Scunthorpe and Florida Harry's family safely delivered the poppies to neighbours and the local community before lockdown. His father Stephen said: ""It made us feel very proud that he wanted to help other people. ""Seeing the poppies in windows around the neighbourhood makes us realise that in times of need we do all come together, Harry's donations have come from as far as Florida and California which he found amazing.

US hits record daily case rise three days running,"The US reported a third straight daily record for new coronavirus cases on Friday, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 127,000 infections were reported in 24 hours, as well as 1,149 deaths. The news comes as officials announced that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had also tested positive for the virus. He is the latest Trump administration official to contract the disease. The US is the worst affected nation in the world by Covid-19, with more than 9.7 million confirmed cases and a death toll of more than 230,000. Tracking the global pandemic Why are infections rising again in US? It was not immediately clear how Mr Meadows - who has often appeared at public events without a face mask - was infected. According to the New York Times,externalhe first tested positive on Wednesday. Trump election campaign adviser Nick Trainer also has the virus, the paper said. Mr Meadows travelled with the president on the final days of campaigning and was at an election night party attended by dozens of Trump supporters at the White House. The country's coronavirus outbreak was a key policy battleground in the run-up to the 3 November election, and contributed to a surge in postal and early in-person voting. Mr Meadows seen with President Trump at a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina last month In late October, Mr Meadows said in an interview with CNN thatthe US was ""not going to control the pandemic"", saying that Covid-19 could only be defeated by ""mitigation areas"" like vaccines and therapeutics. President Trump and his wife Melania and son Barron all contracted and recovered from Covid-19 - as did national security adviser Robert O'Brien, senior advisor Stephen Miller and White House counsellor Hope Hicks. How US news reacted to the president's positive test Four Covid rules broken by Trump and the White House A ceremony at the White House on 26 Septembercame into focus after the president contracted the virus. More than a dozen reporters, guests and officials at the crowded Rose Garden event - where Mr Trump formally announced Amy Coney Barrett as his pick for the Supreme Court - contracted the virus. Footage captured attendees standing close together without masks. Some shook hands, bumped fists and even hugged.

Indian actor Milind Soman charged over nude photoSoman was reprimanded for sharing an image of him running naked down a beach in the city of Goa.India,"Milind Soman is a keen sportsman as well as an actor and model Indian actor and model Milind Soman has been charged by police after he shared a naked picture of himself on Instagram. Soman posted the image on Wednesday, showing him sprinting nude down a Goa beach, with the caption ""Happy Birthday to me!"".Â It attracted over 147,000 likes and thousands of comments. But police were called to action following a complaint by political party Goa Suraksha Manch. The party said Soman had indulged in public obscenity, and tainted Goa's image. Police charged him on Friday with public obscenity and sharing lewd images online. In an interview with the Bombay Times, his wife Ankita Konwar, who took the photo, said it ""sends out a very positive message on body positivity and being free and happy with who you are. Indian couple bullied over wedding photoshoot ""I think anyone who accepts themselves for who they are has this incredible light and energy around them, and people start liking their presence,"" she added. ""Milind's always been like that. Always himself."" Sameer Khutwalker, president of Goa Suraksha Manch, told the Indian Express newspaper he was happy Soman had been charged. ""He has used Goa for cheap publicity and acted foolishly on a public beach,"" said Mr Khutwalker. ""When these things become public, people will imagine that 'anything is possible in Goa,"" he added. ""When will all this stop?"" It is the second time Soman has been booked for charges of obscenity. In 1995, he and model Madhu Sapre were charged for appearing nude in an advertising campaign, wearing only a pair of shoes and a python wrapped around them. Earlier this year, Soman posted the picture on his social media, with the caption ""What the reaction would have been if it had been released todayâ¦"". The latest charge also comes days after actor and model Poonam Pandey, and her husband, were arrested for allegedly trespassing on government property and shooting an ""objectionable"" video at a dam in Goa.

Mass moo returns to town for second lockdown,"Jasper Ward came up with the idea in March for people to moo in unison from their homes and gardens A town's mass moo to bring positivity and fight boredom during the first lockdown has made a comeback. For 83 days from March, hundreds of residents in Belper, Derbyshire gathered on doorsteps and leant out windows at 18:30 for a two-minute moo. For the next four weeks, bellow organiser, Jasper Ward said they had vowed to return. He said it would ""give people something to look forward to in these long dark nights"". The chorus which became known as The Belper Moo ended on June 14, the night before non-essential shops reopened in England. This video can not be played The bovine bellowing went global ""Back then it was all very novel, the sun was shining and the togetherness was very intoxicating,"" said Mr Ward. ""We were all cheering Captain Tom and applauding the NHS, but eight months on everyone's stamina has been really tested and we are all a bit worn out with it, but it's defiance in the face of that overbearing gloom."" The original concept of the moo was to have fun and be silly but Mr Ward said it had brought the town together. ""It's good fun to be moo-ing again but I really wished we weren't,"" he added. ""Once the weather really turns there is every chance that some people behind closed doors won't interact with another person that day or step out the house, so if nothing else, it gives them a reason to open a window and let off some steam or connect with a neighbour for a few seconds."" A Facebook page has been used to share photos and videos of the moo-ing Belper, which also boasts a quirkyMr Potato Head statue, even saw people in Australia, Japan and the US joining them with the moo. Mr Ward said: ""You can't see people but last night a man who lives opposite came out. I recognised his moo through the darkness."" Back in April, resident Isabel Kennedy said the moo had become ""the highlight of my day."" ""It brought our little four house, Quarry Road comoo-nity together in a way that sustained beyond lockdown and is tighter than ever now.""

Indian actor Milind Soman charged over nude photo,"Milind Soman is a keen sportsman as well as an actor and model Indian actor and model Milind Soman has been charged by police after he shared a naked picture of himself on Instagram. Soman posted the image on Wednesday, showing him sprinting nude down a Goa beach, with the caption ""Happy Birthday to me!"".Â It attracted over 147,000 likes and thousands of comments. But police were called to action following a complaint by political party Goa Suraksha Manch. The party said Soman had indulged in public obscenity, and tainted Goa's image. Police charged him on Friday with public obscenity and sharing lewd images online. In an interview with the Bombay Times, his wife Ankita Konwar, who took the photo, said it ""sends out a very positive message on body positivity and being free and happy with who you are. Indian couple bullied over wedding photoshoot ""I think anyone who accepts themselves for who they are has this incredible light and energy around them, and people start liking their presence,"" she added. ""Milind's always been like that. Always himself."" Sameer Khutwalker, president of Goa Suraksha Manch, told the Indian Express newspaper he was happy Soman had been charged. ""He has used Goa for cheap publicity and acted foolishly on a public beach,"" said Mr Khutwalker. ""When these things become public, people will imagine that 'anything is possible in Goa,"" he added. ""When will all this stop?"" It is the second time Soman has been booked for charges of obscenity. In 1995, he and model Madhu Sapre were charged for appearing nude in an advertising campaign, wearing only a pair of shoes and a python wrapped around them. Earlier this year, Soman posted the picture on his social media, with the caption ""What the reaction would have been if it had been released todayâ¦"". The latest charge also comes days after actor and model Poonam Pandey, and her husband, were arrested for allegedly trespassing on government property and shooting an ""objectionable"" video at a dam in Goa. The pair have since been released on bail.

Biden predicts victory as counts head in his favour,"This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'We're going to win this race' Joe Biden has again said he is confident of victory as he inches closer to beating Donald Trump after Tuesday's US presidential election. The Democratic challenger now has 253 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to clinch the White House under the state-by-state US voting system. Mr Biden leads vote counts in the battlegrounds of Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Arizona. A Biden win would see Mr Trump leave office in January after four years. As counting enters its fifth day, it is still unclear when the contest will end. Officials are tallying up record numbers of postal votes due to the coronavirus pandemic, causing the longest delay to a presidential election result in 20 years. ""We're going to win this race,"" Mr Biden told supporters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Friday night, striking a confident tone. He was joined by his running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris. Latest updates: 'We will win' says Biden US election results in maps and charts When will we know who has won? He said he was on track to win more than 300 Electoral College votes and pointed out that more people had voted for his campaign - over 74 million people - than any US presidential candidate in history. Mr Biden said Americans had given him a mandate to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, the struggling economy, climate change and systemic racism. On Friday for the third straight day the US set a fresh record for new Covid-19 cases, with more than 127,000 infections. The Democrat - presenting himself as the candidate of unity after a bitterly fought campaign - said it was time to ""get the vitriol out of our politics"" and ""be civil to one another"". ""We may be opponents but we're not enemies, we're Americans,"" said Mr Biden, who did not mention his Republican opponent, Mr Trump. Mr Biden's appearance had originally been planned as a victory speech, but he opted instead to give a general update on the state of the race as US TV networks cautiously held off declaring him the winner. The Democrat said he hoped to address the nation again on Saturday. Joe Biden delivered a holding speech rather than a victory speech, but he hit all the familiar themes that will no doubt feature if and when he addresses the nation as president-elect. He's been remarkably consistent throughout the campaign - that's part of his appeal in these chaotic times. He hailed the election results so far as a broad mandate for change, although they're not the resounding repudiation of President Trump for which the Democrats had hoped. Once again he presented himself as a leader who believes in America, who could unify the bitterly divided country - ""the purpose of politics isn't total unrelenting warfare"" he said. In the same breath he nodded to his own impatience for an outcome, and presented a stark contrast to President Trump's false claims of voter fraud. Watching the ballot tallies is ""slow and numbing"" he said, but they represent people who ""exercise the fundamental right to have their voices heard."" Mr Biden - who ran twice previously for the White House, in 1988 and 2008, without success - would be the oldest president ever inaugurated at 78. If he is declared the victor this weekend, his team is expected to begin its transition process on Monday. The New York Times reports Mr Biden could announce the first senior officials in his potential administration as early as next week. The Secret Service has sent reinforcements to Delaware to beef up Mr Biden's security detail. The Federal Aviation Administration has restricted flights over Wilmington's airspace. However, there is no indication Mr Trump will concede to his opponent in the short term. This video can not be played ""Happy day"" for Nancy Pelosi, but Lindsey Graham says Trump should ""fight hard"" ""Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President,"" he tweeted on Friday afternoon. ""I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!"" Mr Trump has been making unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, spurring some fellow Republicans to speak up that the rhetoric should be toned down. Since at least 1896 every defeated presidential candidate has conceded defeat to the winner. But there is no law or constitutional requirement to do so. The constitution does however state that a new elected president will automatically take office at noon on 20 January following an election. President Trump is angry and disappointed that more of his allies are not rallying to his side on television or in the streets, according to White House officials on Friday. On Saturday he wrote a series of tweets making unsubstantiated allegations of illegality in the voting process - all of which were labelled as disputed and potentially misleading by Twitter. He also insisted he had won the election ""by a lot"". He has been watching television, making phone calls to on-the-ground campaign offices, and dividing his time between the Oval Office and the residence. This video can not be played Speaking from the White House, Donald Trump slammed the electoral process Several aides did not show up for work on Friday and the White House was described as ""very empty"" with a sombre mood. Adding to the bad news, it was reported on Friday night that White House Chief of StaffMark Meadows, 61, had tested positive for coronavirus. Trump's 17-minute speech fact-checked Tables turned as Trump voters start to worry The president has indicated to senior advisers that he will forge ahead with legal challenges to the results, although there is still no firm strategy for such litigation. One senior outside adviser to the president described his mood on Friday as ""somewhere between sullen and hopeful"". The source added that Mr Trump ""was the last one to think he could win in 2016"", despite his top aides telling him that he would. Mr Biden is leading Mr Trump by more than 4 million votes out of a record 145 million cast. But US presidential election results are decided on a state-by-state basis in the Electoral College, and the contest is much closer in the key battlegrounds. Mr Biden has 253 Electoral College votes, while Mr Trump has 214. To win the White House, a candidate needs 270. In Pennsylvania, where Mr Biden was born, he is ahead by nearly 29,000 votes, with 99% counted. If he takes that state along with its 20 Electoral College votes, he will win the election. Officials released a statement on Friday,externalsaying that the ""overwhelming majority"" of postal and absentee votes had now been tallied, and they were now beginning to count provisional ballots. However they did not say when the count will be complete. This video can not be played 'All of a sudden Trump's losing? Come on' The Rust Belt state voted Democratic in six consecutive White House races before it swung to Mr Trump in 2016. In Georgia, Mr Biden is currently leading with more than 7,000 votes, and 99% of the ballots counted. Georgia's secretary of state said there would be a recount because the margin was so small. Georgia (16 electoral votes) is a traditionally Republican state and has not been won by a Democrat in a presidential race since 1992. Mr Biden leads by more than 22,000 votes in Nevada (six electoral votes) and by fewer than 30,000 in Arizona (11 electoral votes). Mr Trump leads in North Carolina (15 electoral votes) by more than 76,000 ballots. Who will be the next US president?

Post-Brexit EU trade talks 'could go either way',"Mr Johnson believes there is 'a deal to be done' ""Significant differences"" between the UK and the EU remain, as negotiations for a post-Brexit trade deal continue, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday, the PM said progress had been made but there were still issues around the ""level playing field"" and fishing. Both parties agreed negotiating teams would resume talks in London on Monday. They also agreed to remain ""in close contact"" over the coming days. A statement from Downing Street on Saturday said: ""Prime Minister Boris Johnson today spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a stock take on the progress in the negotiations between the UK and the EU. ""The prime minister set out that, while some progress had been made in recent discussions, significant differences remain in a number of areas, including the so-called level playing field and fish. ""The prime minister and president agreed that their negotiating teams would continue talks in London next week, beginning on Monday, in order to redouble efforts to reach a deal. ""They agreed to remain in personal contact about the negotiations,"" the statement said. Echoing Mr Johnson, Ms von der Leyen acknowledged ""some progress had been made, but large differences remain"". ""Our teams will continue working hard next week,"" she wrote on Twitter.

The prime minister has said he believes there is ""a deal to be done"" and ""very much hopes"" to come to an agreement, but he has insisted the country was ""very well prepared"" to move on should the two parties not be able to agree a deal. Meanwhile, the National Audit Office has warned of ""significant disruption"" when the Brexit transition period ends. 'Differences remain' after Brexit trade talks Trade talks are back on - but what's changed? Brexit: What is a level playing field? The UK left the EU on 31 January and entered the transition period - continuing to follow many EU rules - while a trade deal was negotiated. But while both sides said a deal needed to be done in October, they have yet to come to an agreement, and talks between the negotiating teams have intensified. The transition period is due to come to an end on 31 December, meaning the UK would trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules - meaning tariffs are imposed - if a deal is not in place. Critics say this could cause damage to the UK economy, but the government insists the country will prosper with or without a deal. Earlier this week, both the UK and EU's chief trade negotiatorswarned of ""wide"" and ""serious divergences"" between the two sides. Sticking points include fishing rights, competition rules and how a deal would be enforced. Asked on Friday if the UK could get a deal in the next 10 days, Mr Johnson said: ""I very much hope that we will, but obviously that depends on our friends and partners across the Channel. ""I think there is a deal to be done, if they want to do it. ""If not, the country is, of course, very well prepared. As I have said before, we can do very well with on Australian terms [without a deal], if that is what we have to go for."" Thomas Byrne, Ireland's minister for European affairs, said the talks up to this point between the EU and UK's negotiators, Michel Barnier and David Frost, had been ""difficult"", with ""big issues"" still remaining. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I personally don't expect that there would me major progress today, but at the same time I think it's very good that they are talking - I think that's really positive. But I'm not sure that we would expect a moment at this point."" Has US election slowed down Brexit negotiations? Mr Byrne was also asked if there could be a ""new dynamic"" to discussions between the UK and EU if Joe Biden was elected the US president, saying it was ""certainly possible"". Mr Biden, who has Irish roots, said in September that he wouldnot allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit""if he was elected president. Mr Byrne said: ""He was very clear in his suggestion and statement on the 16th of September that any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent on respect for the Good Friday Agreement and preventing the return of the hard border.""

"Scotland becomes first part of UK to ban smackingScotland is the 58th country to ban smacking in the home, giving children the same rights as adults.","Backers of the bill rallied outside Holyrood on the morning of the vote Scotland's ban on parents smacking their children has become law, making it the first part of the UK to outlaw physical punishment of under-16s. Parents and carers were previously allowed to use physical force to discipline their children if it was considered ""reasonable chastisement"". The new law means that the so-called ""justifiable assault"" defence is no longer available. It seeks to give children the same protection from assault as adults. Sweden was the first country in the world to ban smacking in the home when it outlawed corporal punishment in 1979. Scotland has now become the 58th to do so. Scotland becomes first UK country to ban smacking Wales to bring in smacking ban after assembly vote In January, Wales was the second part of the UK to pass a law banning people from smacking their children. It will begin in 2022. There are not currently any plans for England or Northern Ireland to follow suit. Children's charity the NSPCC said Scotland's ban was a ""common sense"" move. The charity's Joanna Barrett said: ""This law sets out in clear terms that physical punishment should no longer be part of childhood in Scotland and it marks a momentous step in making it a country where children's rights are truly recognised, respected and fulfilled."" The smacking ban bill was introduced to the Scottish Parliament by Scottish Greens MSP John Finnie, a former police officer, who won the support of the SNP, Labour and Lib Dems as well as his own party and many children's charities. Mr Finnie said smacking teaches children that ""might is right"", and that the ban would ""send a strong message that violence is never acceptable in any setting"". Children's Minister Maree Todd said: ""This outdated defence has no place in a modern Scotland. It can never be reasonable to strike a child."" Opponents argued the changes were ""unnecessary"" as existing laws already protected children from abuse at the hands of adults. They said the changes would do nothing to help vulnerable children who were the victims of serious physical abuse, but could cause traumatic interventions in ""good"" families, who use discipline such as a smack on the bottom. Opponents of the ban say mild smacking does no long-term harm to a child Previously, when deciding whether the chastisement of a child under 16 was reasonable, the courts took into account factors such as the nature of the punishment, its duration and frequency, the age of the child and the effect - both physical and mental - it had on them. In practice, this generally meant parents were allowed to smack their children on the body - but blows to the head, shaking or the use of an implement were illegal. All physical punishment in schools and other education settings was already completely banned. The bill will end the defence of ""reasonable chastisement"", meaning parents could face prosecution for any use of physical punishment on their children. The act uses the same definition of physical punishment, sometimes referred to as corporal punishment, used by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. It includes hitting such as smacking, slapping and smacking with a hand or an implement, as well as kicking, shaking or throwing children, scratching, pinching, biting, pulling hair or boxing ears, forcing children to stay in uncomfortable positions, burning, scalding or forced ingestion. A reportpublished by a group of Scottish children's charities,externalin 2015 found that the physical punishment of children was more common in the UK than in similar countries such as the US, Canada, Italy, Germany and Sweden. The researchers estimated that between 70% and 80% of parents in the UK had used physical punishment, with children aged between three and seven the most likely to be smacked. They also found that many parents did not view smacking as a ""good thing"", but believed that sometimes it was the ""only thing that will work"". The researchers also said the use of physical chastisement had declined over the years, alongside a shift in public attitudes, with ""convincing evidence"" that the decline had been steeper in the more than 50 countries around the world that had already banned smacking. Research examining the views of children on smacking has suggested that it hurts and upsets them, and does not always stop bad behaviour. A campaign against the ban was led by the Be Reasonable Scotland group, which called the legislation ""draconian"" and argued it could do more harm than good. The group argues that the existing law only allowed parents to use ""very mild discipline"" such as a smack on the hand or bottom - which could become a criminal offence in the future. A spokesman said: ""In the years ahead, loving parents who have had no contact with the authorities previously and who present no risk to their children will face stressful intervention, blacklisting on police databases and even criminal records for smacking. The majority of Scots see this as an injustice, not a positive change."" They urged the government to instead invest in social work and other services to improve their ability to identify and tackle genuine abuse. Parents in England and Wales can currently face criminal charges if they hit a child so hard that it leaves a mark, or causes bruising, swelling, cuts, grazes or scratches. However, Wales has now passed an outright ban that will remove the defence of ""reasonable punishment"" that has been in force since Victorian times in England and Wales. There have been calls for England to follow suit, with the Association of Educational Psychologists saying last year thatsmacking is harmful to children's mental healthand should be banned. Northern Ireland has similar legal provisions to those in England and Wales, while Ireland banned smacking in 2015.

"Boy made poppies to bring 'happiness in sad times'An eight-year-old boy raises more than Â£1,000 for the Poppy Appeal by selling handmade poppies.","Harry drew each of the handmade poppies An eight-year-old boy who wanted to make people ""happy in these sad times"", has raised more than Â£1,000 for the Poppy Appeal. Harry Fletcher from Hartlepool began making poppies to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day during the first coronavirus lockdown in May. Unable to take part in the remembrance parade on Sunday, he decided to sell handmade poppies for Â£1 each for the Royal British Legion. His target of Â£20 has reached Â£1,137. He said: ""I struggled in the first lockdown and when mam told me we couldn't do the remembrance parade with my Cubs I said we should sell the poppies to raise money for the British Legion."" Harry drew each and laminated each poppy Harry said he ""really enjoyed making the poppies"" but when too many orders came in he had to think of how to make them quicker so he came up with the idea of printing them. ""I said to my mam they will make people happy in these sad times. ""It makes me feel very happy that the money raised will help a lot of people who used to be in the Army,"" he added. The JustGiving page has raised more than Â£1,000 for the Royal British Legion and cash donations of Â£302 will given to the Hartlepool Legion. Orders came from as far as Scunthorpe and Florida Harry's family safely delivered the poppies to neighbours and the local community before lockdown. His father Stephen said: ""It made us feel very proud that he wanted to help other people. ""Seeing the poppies in windows around the neighbourhood makes us realise that in times of need we do all come together, Harry's donations have come from as far as Florida and California which he found amazing.

Blitzed cities still deprived 75 years after war,"Cities that faced great damage in wartime show a consistent pattern of disadvantage decades later Towns and cities in England which suffered high casualty rates from World War Two air raids are now likely to be places with high levels of child deprivation, say researchers. They examined how well today's youngsters are faring in places that had faced the brunt of wartime bombing, such as Hull, Portsmouth and Coventry. A consistent pattern of disadvantage was found, 75 years after the war. This included high levels of hardship and poor results in education. Coventry Cathedral badly damaged by bombing Historian and author Professor Pat Thane said these worst-hit places were ""generally working-class areas - and very many of them have stayed that way"". The research, published ahead of Remembrance Sunday, has been carried out by Timo Hannay, whose firm SchoolDash usually carries out data analysis on education. Bomb damage in a street in Liverpool But in this case, he mapped current levels of childhood deprivation, well-being and educational achievement againstplaces which had faced high levels of wartime casualties and destruction,external. ""The results are striking. Today, almost all of these have child poverty rates well above the national average,"" said Dr Hannay, as commemorations mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the war. London was not included - as it is such an outlier in its size and diversity - and these comparisons are for England and not other parts of the UK which also faced wartime bombing. Coventry suffered great damage from the Blitz Researchers looked at what had happened to English towns and cities outside the capital which had been heavily bombed, such as Liverpool, Plymouth, Hull, Portsmouth, Southampton, Bristol, North and South Tyneside, Coventry, Birmingham and Manchester. These were compared against measures of disadvantage, including the ""income deprivation affecting children index"" and eligibility for free school meals. And this revealed a consistent pattern with almost all of these areas having above-average levels of poverty. The aftermath of a bombing raid on Hull In education, primary school tests, GCSE results and university entry levels were below the national average in most of the places that had faced particularly high wartime damage. ""Self-reported life satisfaction also tends to be low. On top of all this, Covid-19 death rates in many of these areas, specifically, those in the midlands and the north - have been much higher than in the country as a whole,"" said Mr Hannay. The Blitz: How the bombing changed Britain Marking the 75th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe The uncanny match between bad transport and poor education ""None of this is to imply a causal link between 1940s bombing raids and current social challenges,"" he says. But he says it does show that many of the areas that suffered the most ""continue to languish in a wide variety of ways"". This year marks the 75th anniversary since the end of the Second World War But if this is not about any long-term economic scarring, then what does it say about what happened to the communities who paid the highest price in wartime losses? Daniel Todman, professor of modern history at Queen Mary, University of London, says this shows a pattern of places that were poor before the war continuing to be poor decades afterwards. A photo montage that mixed wartime damage with how the street looks in modern London He says it is also a reminder of how ""geographically concentrated"" the Blitz was and that the damage was not ""shared out"" across the country, with those in poorer, crowded housing often suffering the most. The disadvantage in such places now, Prof Todman says is not the legacy of the war, but more a sign that the post-war settlement failed to ""bring places up"" and those ""inequalities continue to exist"". There was a strong sense during the war of wanting to create greater fairness, says Prof Todman, but 75 years later, he says it could be seen as ""unfair a society as it was in the 1920s and 1930s"".

UK energy plant to use liquid air,"An artist's impression of Highview's planned energy storage facility Work is beginning on what is thought to be the world's first major plant to store energy in the form of liquid air. It will use surplus electricity from wind farms at night to compress air so hard that it becomes a liquid at -196 Celsius. Then when there is a peak in demand in a day or a month, the liquid air will be warmed so it expands. The resulting rush of air will drive a turbine to make electricity, which can be sold back to the grid. The 50MW facility near Manchester will store enough power for roughly 50,000 homes for five hours. The system was devised by Peter Dearman, a self-taught backyard inventor from Hertfordshire, and it has been taken to commercial scale with a Â£10m grant from the UK government. ""It's very exciting,"" he told BBC News. ""We need many different forms of energy storage - and I'm confident liquid air will be one of them."" The energy plant will use surplus electricity from wind farms at night Mr Dearman said his invention was 60-70% efficient, depending how it is used. That is less efficient than batteries, but he said the advantage of liquid air is the low cost of the storage tanks - so it can easily be scaled up. Also, unlike batteries, liquid air storage does not create a demand for minerals which may become increasingly scarce as the world moves towards power systems based on variable renewable electricity. ""Batteries are really great for short-term storage,"" Mr Dearman said. ""But they are too expensive to do long-term energy storage. That's where liquid air comes in."" Mr Dearman had been developing a car run on similar principles with liquid hydrogen when he saw the potential for applying the technology to electricity storage. He is now a passive shareholder in Highview, one of the firms building the 50MW plant. Prof John Loughhead, from the government's business and energy department, has previously praised the technology. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin You've got cheap data, how about cheap power too?

Union fears nursing shortage as winter looms,"Widespread nursing shortages across the NHS could lead to staff burnout and risk patient safety this winter, the Royal College of Nursing has warned. The nursing union said a combination of staff absence due to the pandemic, and around 40,000 registered nursing vacancies in England was putting too much strain on the remaining workforce. The government says more than 13,000 nurses have been recruited this year. It has committed to 50,000 more nurses by 2025. It also hopes England's four-week lockdown will ease pressure on the NHS. The RCN has expressed concern that staff shortages are affecting every area of nursing, from critical care and cancer services to community nursing, which provides care to people in their own homes. The union said it was worried the extra responsibility and pressure placed on senior nurses could lead to staff ""burnout"", as hospitals struggle to clear the backlog of cancelled operations from the first wave of coronavirus and cope with rising numbers of new Covid patients, as well as the annual pressures that winter typically brings. The boss of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, told a Downing Street press conference on Thursday that flu and other winter conditions usually brought in 3,000 additional patients to hospitals, but there were already more than 10,000 coronavirus patients in England before winter pressures have even arrived. The latest government figures show there were more than 12,000 Covid patients in hospital in the UK on 3 November. Sir Simon said some staff had been trained and redeployed to help bolster care for Covid patients in ICU, but the RCN said it may not be enough to cope with a surge in demand and has called on the government to think carefully about which services can be safely maintained, without spreading staff ""too thinly"". TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:What is the job support scheme? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? GLOBAL TRACKER:Where are the virus hotspots? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries Mike Adams, RCN England Director, said: ""The NHS is now at its highest level of preparedness as it faces the prospect of an extremely challenging winter.â¯ ""We already know that frontline nurses - in hospitals, communities and care homes - are under huge strain. Anecdotally we're hearing that in some hospitals they [nurses] are becoming increasingly thinly spread on the ground, as staff become unwell or have to isolate, at the same time as demand on services continues to increase. ""The government says nurses have been given extra training to provide more critical care staff to treat Covid-19 patients, but there simply aren't enough to go around. There are around 40,000 registered nursing vacancies across the NHS in England alone.â¯ ""It is essential that learning is applied to planning for this winter, including what services can be delivered safely with the workforce available.""

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him.

Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president.""

The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

Fact-checking US vote claims,"Ballots being collated for counting in Philadelphia With no result yet in a tightly-contested US election, claims which can be misleading are circulating on social media about voting and counting in key states. The count is still going on in the battleground state of Pennsylvania - we've looked at some of the most widely shared claims about the situation there. One viral video showed a poll watcher being denied entry to a Philadelphia polling station. It has had almost two million views on Twitter, and was shared by multiple pro-Trump accounts, saying Republican poll watchers were being banned. The man in the video, Gary Feldman, a local Republican, was asked to wait outside by officials - with a woman telling him that his ""city-wide"" poll watching certificate was not valid in that particular polling station. The video was authentic, and the man was being stopped from entering, but it turns out there was confusion over the rules. Poll watchers used to only be allowed in a certain station, but they can now visit multiple sites across Philadelphia. Philadelphia city commissioners said the man was later allowed into the station and received an apology. A tweet shared by Mike Roman, who worked for the Trump election campaign, claimed that a Democratic poster was a ""violation in sight"" for being in close proximity to a polling station. His tweet referred to ""bad things"" happening. Election rules in Pennsylvania prohibit campaign materials, signs, banners and literature being within 10 feet of a polling station. The post that Mr Roman originally amplified - now labelled as violating Twitter rules - gained significant traction online, but was rebutted by the Philadelphia District Attorney's office. They said they had investigated the claim and found that the actual polling place was ""located in an interior room and the sign in question was further than 10 feet from it"". So, that's not violating the election rules as they are in that area. This false claim appeared on Instagram, saying that an election worker in Erie County, Pennsylvania had thrown out more than 100 votes for President Trump. It was shared as a screenshot by businessman Mike Coudrey, who then deleted the tweet, although it had been re-tweeted more than 6,000 times by then. Screenshots have also been shared on Facebook by various pro-Trump and other groups, but some have been deleted. The election board for Erie Countyhas rejected the claim,external, calling it ""false"". It said in a statement: ""The person making the statements [about throwing out ballots] does not work in any way with Erie County or have any part of Erie County's election process. In fact, the individual is not a registered voter and is not believed to be a resident of Erie County."" A claim that election workers in the city of Philadelphia were no longer counting ballots has been circulating, and was picked up by President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Allow Twitter content?

"So how many votes did Kanye West get?VideoVideo'Look at us, we matterâUS election results in maps and chartsWhen will we know who has won?","Will we be seeing a President Kanye? We don't know - still - who the next US president will be, but we do know who it won't be - Kanye West. The 43-year-old rapper has conceded after his self-styled ""Birthday Party"" collected just 60,000 votes out of an estimated total of 160 million. Another independent, Libertarian Jo Jorgensen, made a much stronger showing - claiming more than 1.5 million votes. But West's political career may not be over yet. He tweeted ""Kanye 2024"" this week, signalling another bid to come. Here's what President Kanye would do The other 1,214 candidates running for president What to say - and not to say - about Kanye West In this first presidential attempt, West appeared on the ballot in 12 states, missing the filing deadline in most others. He gathered the most votes - 10,188 - in Tennessee, a state that typically favours Republican candidates. When he announced his candidacy in July, West had said that his platform was modelled off Wakanda, the fictional kingdom from Black Panther. Ending police brutality was a priority, he told Forbes in an interview, as was cleaning up chemicals ""in our deodorant, in our toothpaste"", and was focused on protecting America with its ""great military"".

""Because when we win, it's everybody's birthday party,"" he said. But West's candidacy was the subject of much criticism - and concern about his health. At a rally in Charleston, South Carolina, meant to officially launch his campaign, the star made several bewildering rants, at one point saying that 19th century abolitionist Harriet Tubman ""never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go to work for other white people"". West later began crying when talking about abortion, saying that his parents almost aborted him, and that he had previously wanted to abort his daughter. The rapper disclosed last year that he had bipolar disorder and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, posted on social media amid his run asking for ""compassion and empathy"" for West whose ""words sometimes do not align with his intentions"". And posts on Twitter by West urging followers to write-in his name on ballots for president incited criticism that he was effectively siphoning votes away from legitimate candidates. Ms Jorgensen, on the other hand, staged a more conventional independent campaign, making stops across the country to rally supporters, seeking endorsements and pushing a platform guided by Libertarian principles - small government and individual freedom. Ms Jorgensen is the first female Libertarian nominee The 63-year-old psychology lecturer at Clemson University was the first female Libertarian nominee for president and earned the second most votes of any Libertarian nominee in history, according to the Associated Press. ""The Libertarian Party's baseline votes will continue to grow,"" Ms Jorgensen said in a statement. ""The only way Democrats and Republicans can keep us down is by adopting our libertarian policies."" The Libertarian party formed in the US in the 1970s but its nominee has never won the presidency. Of the independent candidates, Green Party nominee Howie Hawkins came in second behind Ms Jorgensen, earning more than 339,000 votes nationwide. But these three candidates were not the only ones with long-shot bids for 2020 - not even close. They joinedmore than 1,200 candidates to file a presidential runwith the Federal Election Commission this year. Do celebrities help or hinder Joe Biden?

US election results in maps and chartsWhen will we know who has won?,"Joe Biden has been elected president of the United States, after his projected victory in Pennsylvania took him over the winning line. With all states now projected, President-elect Biden has 306 electoral college votes and Donald Trump has 232. A candidate needs 270 or more to win. Mr Biden will become the 46th president in January, pending the outcome of any legal challenges. There is still a recount to come inGeorgia, but Mr Biden has a lead of almost 15,000 votes and the 16 electoral college votes are not enough to overturn his overall victory. Mr Biden's running mate,Kamala Harris, will make history as the first woman vice-president, as well as the first black and the first Asian American vice-president. Click or tap on the map below to get detailed results. For full results click or tap here,external This map shows where either the Republicans (red arrows) or Democrats (blue arrows) have performed better than in 2016. It is far from a consistent picture, with both parties gaining in some areas and losing support in others. Narrow gains for Mr Biden inGeorgia,Arizona,Michigan,Wisconsinand, crucially,Pennsylvania, were enough for him to flip those states and win the presidency. Unfortunately for Mr Trump, his gains were concentrated in states he already won last time around - for example strongholds such asIdaho,Utah,ArkansasandTennessee. US election results in maps and charts With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Mr Biden has been projected to overturn Mr Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. A strengthening of support in some areas where the Democrats also did well in 2016 - particularly around Philadelphia in the south east corner - has been enough to generate this result. As well as Pennsylvania, Mr Biden also managed to flip four other states that Mr Trump won in 2016 -Wisconsin,Michigan,ArizonaandGeorgia. The first three had been Democrat strongholds for decades before favouring Mr Trump over Hillary Clinton four years ago. Arizona has not been won by a Democrat since Bill Clinton's second term 24 years ago, and Georgia not since Mr Clinton's first win in 1992. In the US electoral system, the results in each state have a widely varying impact on the final result, with states that have larger populations given more say than those with smaller populations. The map below represents each state and the District of Columbia as a square, with its area corresponding to the number of votes its representatives will cast in the electoral college that ultimately decides whether Mr Biden or Mr Trump has won the presidency. It shows that both the Republicans and the Democrats have won their share of larger and smaller states, but Mr Biden has now picked up states worth more than the 270 he needed to win the presidency. Mr Trump managed to hold off challenges from Mr Biden in three of the four biggest battleground states -Texas,FloridaandOhio. But the wins in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania - worth 73 electoral college votes altogether - have been enough for Mr Biden to win the presidency. Preliminary figures show the highest turnout since 1900, with 66.4% of eligible voters turning out compared with 60.1% in 2016. As Mr Biden also leads the national popular vote on 50.8% to Mr Trump's 47.4% - a lead of over five million votes - this boost in participation means that the president-elect has already received more votes than any candidate in US electoral history - close to 78 million so far, with the count continuing in some states. Mr Trump has also increased his vote tally compared with 2016 by more than 9 million votes, to over 72 million this year. Despite being projected to lose the election, this figure gives him the second-highest number of votes of any US presidential candidate. Mr Trump has been projected to win the closely-fought state of Florida, with 51% of the vote compared with Mr Biden's 48%. Despite taking what is typically a bellwether state, Mr Trump failed to win a second term in the White House. Exit poll estimates put Mr Trump on a 61% share of the white vote in Florida. Mr Biden appears to have made up ground on Hillary Clinton's performance with this demographic in 2016. However, Mr Trump is also estimated to have gained 12 points among Latino voters, bringing him nearly level with Mr Biden. Here's how the map coloured up, from the first states to be projected on election night, to Pennsylvania on Saturday. This interactive can only be visible with Javascript enabled. Although the Democrats have made a net gain of one seat in the race for the Senate, the Republicans remain ahead, on 50 seats to the Democrats' 48. Both of the Georgia senate races have gone to a run-off after no candidate secured more than 50% of the votes. There will now be another vote, on 5 January 2021, to separate the two top candidates in each race and determine which party controls the legislature's upper chamber. In the House, despite losing five seats the Democrats have now crossed the winning line of 218 and will retain their majority. There are still 13 seats to declare so the exact size of the majority is still to be determined. Exit poll data from across the United States gives a glimpse into voters' priorities and an indication of how different demographic groups cast their ballots. The figures suggest the proportion of total voters who are white has fallen by six percentage points on 2016, while remaining the largest group by ethnicity. The proportion of white voters backing Mr Biden has risen by five points on Hillary Clinton's figure at the last election, but Mr Trump still takes the largest share of this group, the preliminary polling suggests. Meanwhile, Mr Biden appears to have gained support among under 30s and the middle-aged. The exit polls are carried out across the US by Edison Research and are a combination of election day interviews and telephone polling, designed to reach early and absentee voters. Nationally, more than a third of voters said the economy was the most important issue in deciding who to choose as president, with a further 20% naming racial inequality and 17% saying the coronavirus pandemic. However the issues were split along partisan lines with more than four times as many Trump voters saying the economy was the deciding factor, and Biden voters answering racial inequality and the virus. Voters were evenly split on how the US economy was faring, with 48% saying it was in ""excellent or good"" condition and 50% saying it was ""not so good or poor"". Similarly, 50% said that the US was doing ""somewhat or very badly"" at containing the pandemic and 48% thought the country was doing ""somewhat or very well"". The possibility of voter fraud has been raised repeatedly by the Trump campaign but a large majority of voters (87%) told the researchers they were confident that votes in their state would be counted accurately. The exit polls are made up of a national exit poll and 22 state exit polls which are carried out by Edison Research for the National Election Pool (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC). For the national poll, a total of 15,590 voters who cast ballots on Election Day were interviewed at 115 polling places as they exited the polling places.  This survey also includes 4,919 absentee and/or early voters interviewed by telephone. The data is then weighted to be representative of the population and are adjusted further as votes are counted. All samples are approximations and are subject to a margin of error which will be wider for small sub-groups such as smaller ethnic groups.

How a misleading post made it to Trump's Twitter,"How did a misleading post travel from the fringes of the internet to the president's Twitter account? In the early hours of Wednesday, a post erroneously alleging voter fraud was posted on an extreme message board. In a matter of hours, it went viral and reached President Trump's Twitter feed. Here's how it happened. A map of voting in battleground state Michigan wrongly showed an increase of over 138,000 votes for Joe Biden, and at the same time no additional votes for President Trump. The screenshot was real - but it contained incorrect information. Simply put, it was a data entry error. Decision Desk, the election data company which posted the map, said: ""It was a simple error from a file created by the state that we ingestedâ¦ the state noticed the error and produced an updated count."" Even though the error was corrected, it provided fertile social media content in an environment where unfounded allegations of voter fraud were gaining traction. 8kun is a message board with extreme content and language founded by Jim Watkins after its predecessor 8chan went offline The earliest trace we found of the map being used to allege some type of fraud was on the website 8kun at 10:37 GMT on Wednesday 4 November. 8kun is a message board filled with extreme language and views, and contains violence and extreme sexual content. It's popular with far-right activists and believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory -a belief system which says that Trump is waging a secret war against satanic elitist paedophiles. Less than half an hour later, at 10:56 GMT, the map found its way onto Twitter. It was posted by an profile with a Pepe The Frog image - a meme popular among far-right and alt-right accounts. Again, the post strongly hinted that some kind of fraud or trick was to blame rather than a data entry error. The first tweet we found on Twitter promoting the image Shortly thereafter, a series of anonymous accounts began promoting the image, gaining significant numbers of shares. And around the same time, the image was being shared on platforms such as Parler, along with online forums popular with far-right groups. Shortly after 14:00 GMT, it was retweeted by conservative Matt Mackowiak, who shared it to his 36,000 followers (he later deleted the post and apologised). A number of right-wing influencers also promoted the screenshots. ""I don't know what 8kun is,"" Mr Mackowiak told the BBC, adding that he saw the map promoted by an account associated with The Federalist, a conservative news outlet. ""I thought it was an anomaly. Never seen an update go 100% for one candidate,"" Mr Mackowiak told us via Twitter. ""Corrected immediately when I learned one county found the error."" It was already well on its way towards going viral. Another conservative writer, Matt Walsh, retweeted Mr Mackowiak's post to his more than 500,000 followers. Then at 15:35 Wednesday, President Trump retweeted Mr Walsh, adding: ""WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?"". Cindy Otis, vice-president of analysis at the Alethea Group, which investigates disinformation and social media manipulation, confirmed the path of the post and noted that it wasn't the first time material from the fringes of the internet have turned up on high profile accounts. ""This is yet another instance in which false content and conspiracies have been seeded on the fringe platform 8kun, made its way onto mainstream social media platforms, and eventually into the talking points of elected leaders in the US, including the president himself,"" Ms Otis says. ""The vast majority of false information we are seeing about the election, including false claims of fraud, is based on a lack of understanding of how the electoral process and things like vote counting work,"" she adds. Despite many major media outlets and fact-checkers pointing out the error, pictures and screenshots of it have continued to spread online. Twitter added labels and restricted sharing of some of the most viral tweets containing the image and allegations. So far, it has garnered tens of thousands shares across Twitter and Facebook alone. Images have also emerged on Instagram and Reddit and have even crossed into multiple languages, including German, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.

How does the extended furlough scheme work?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant?

So how many votes did Kanye West get?,"Will we be seeing a President Kanye? We don't know - still - who the next US president will be, but we do know who it won't be - Kanye West. The 43-year-old rapper has conceded after his self-styled ""Birthday Party"" collected just 60,000 votes out of an estimated total of 160 million. Another independent, Libertarian Jo Jorgensen, made a much stronger showing - claiming more than 1.5 million votes. But West's political career may not be over yet. He tweeted ""Kanye 2024"" this week, signalling another bid to come. Here's what President Kanye would do The other 1,214 candidates running for president What to say - and not to say - about Kanye West In this first presidential attempt, West appeared on the ballot in 12 states, missing the filing deadline in most others. He gathered the most votes - 10,188 - in Tennessee, a state that typically favours Republican candidates. When he announced his candidacy in July, West had said that his platform was modelled off Wakanda, the fictional kingdom from Black Panther. Ending police brutality was a priority, he told Forbes in an interview, as was cleaning up chemicals ""in our deodorant, in our toothpaste"", and was focused on protecting America with its ""great military"".

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. And why the party name? ""Because when we win, it's everybody's birthday party,"" he said. But West's candidacy was the subject of much criticism - and concern about his health. At a rally in Charleston, South Carolina, meant to officially launch his campaign, the star made several bewildering rants, at one point saying that 19th century abolitionist Harriet Tubman ""never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go to work for other white people"". West later began crying when talking about abortion, saying that his parents almost aborted him, and that he had previously wanted to abort his daughter. The rapper disclosed last year that he had bipolar disorder and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, posted on social media amid his run asking for ""compassion and empathy"" for West whose ""words sometimes do not align with his intentions"". And posts on Twitter by West urging followers to write-in his name on ballots for president incited criticism that he was effectively siphoning votes away from legitimate candidates. Ms Jorgensen, on the other hand, staged a more conventional independent campaign, making stops across the country to rally supporters, seeking endorsements and pushing a platform guided by Libertarian principles - small government and individual freedom. Ms Jorgensen is the first female Libertarian nominee The 63-year-old psychology lecturer at Clemson University was the first female Libertarian nominee for president and earned the second most votes of any Libertarian nominee in history, according to the Associated Press. ""The Libertarian Party's baseline votes will continue to grow,"" Ms Jorgensen said in a statement. ""The only way Democrats and Republicans can keep us down is by adopting our libertarian policies."" The Libertarian party formed in the US in the 1970s but its nominee has never won the presidency. Of the independent candidates, Green Party nominee Howie Hawkins came in second behind Ms Jorgensen, earning more than 339,000 votes nationwide. But these three candidates were not the only ones with long-shot bids for 2020 - not even close. They joinedmore than 1,200 candidates to file a presidential runwith the Federal Election Commission this year. Do celebrities help or hinder Joe Biden?

Covid travel ban for visitors to UK from Denmark,"The UK has imposed a ban on non-UK citizens coming from Denmark amid concerns over a new coronavirus strain that has spread from mink to humans. UK citizens can return from Denmark - but will have to isolate along with all members of their household for 14 days. Cabin crew are also no longer exempt from the rules, which Ryanair described as a ""bizarre and baseless"" move. The transport secretary announced the changes less than two hours before they took effect on Saturday. Writing on Twitter, Grant Shapps said:,external""This decision to act quickly follows on from health authorities in Denmark reporting widespread outbreaks of coronavirus in mink farms. Keeping the UK public safe remains our top priority."" Meanwhile, a further 413 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according tothe latest daily figures from the government,external. It brings the overall UK death toll, by this measure, to 48,888. Denmark's Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod called Mr Shapps' travel announcement a ""very drastic step"" and said he had discussed them with UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Saturday. Mr Kofod said Danish health authorities were ""working closely"" with international health organisations to share information and ""reaching out"" to ensure any ""relevant knowledge"" is passed to UK officials. Officials will contact anyone in the UK who has been in Denmark in the last fortnight to make sure they also self-isolate. The Department for Health and Social Care estimates that between 300 and 500 people have arrived in the UK from Denmark in the last 14 days. Denmark had been taken off theUK coronavirus travel corridors list,externalon Friday after it first became apparent the mutated form of coronavirus was present in the country. It meant any passengers arriving in the UK from Denmark would need to self-isolate after their arrival. Coronavirus: Can I still go on holiday? What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? The latest rules, which took effect at 04:00 GMT on Saturday, ban foreign visitors who have been in or transited through Denmark and also expand the self-isolation requirements for returning Britons and residents to include all members of their households. The changes also mean any cabin crew and pilots in Denmark are no longer exempt from quarantine rules, and must self-isolate along with the rest of their household for 14 days. Crew who were in Denmark before the deadline in the last seven days are not legally required to self-isolate, but the DfT is strongly recommending they do so. Ryanair said the quarantine for cabin crew was ""bizarre and baseless"", in part because crew members ""never leave the aircraft during their 25-minute turnaround on the ground in Copenhagen airport"". In a statement the airline said it had no choice but to cancel all flights to and from Denmark while the rules remain in place, and urged Mr Shapps to reverse the decision. Scottish airline Loganair said that due to government restrictionsit has suspended flights between Scotland and Denmark,externalfrom 9 to 22 November. On Sunday morning, the government told lorry drivers and freight handlers returning to the UK from Denmark that they must also self-isolate for two weeks. All direct passenger flights and ships carrying freight (as well as passengers) from Denmark have also been stopped. Denmark was the UK's 23rd largest export market in 2019, worth Â£6.8bn for goods and services. A mutated strain of coronavirus that has spread to humans has triggered culls of millions of mink across Denmark and a lockdown in some parts of the country. More than 200 people have been infected with strains related to mink, according to reports. Mink kept in large numbers on farms have caught the virus from infected workers. And, in a small number of cases, the virus has crossed back from mink to humans, picking up genetic changes on the way. Mutations in some of the strains, which have infected a small number of people, are reported to involve the spike protein of the virus, which is targeted by some, but not all, vaccines being developed. The coronavirus, like all viruses, mutates over time, but there is no evidence that any of the mutations pose an increased danger to people. The World Health Organization has said it is too early to jump to conclusions. You can read more from Helenhere. The Denmark travel ban and new requirements will be reviewed after a week, the DfT said. A DfT spokeswoman said the government was working closely with international partners to understand the changes in the virus that have been reported in Denmark and conducting a programme of further research in the UK ""to inform our risk assessments"". This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Mink-related mutations of the Covid have been detected in 200 people in Denmark, most of them are connected to farms in Denmark's North Jutland region. The Danish authorities have described the situation as very serious - and haveordered the cull of all mink in the country- thought to number around 17 million. Danish authorities have said a lockdown will be introduced in some areas over the coronavirus mutation. Leaving home to go on holiday is currently banned for most people in the UK. In England, where a new national lockdown came into force on Thursday, people are still allowed to travel overseas for work or education trips.

Lockdown 'a unique opportunity' to fix roadsThe AA urges councils in England to deal with potholes and junctions while fewer cars are in use.UK Politics,"Councils in England have a ""unique opportunity"" to fix potholes, road junctions and roadside drainage during lockdown, the AA has said. It urged local authorities to ask drivers to move their vehicles to car parks near disused shops, pubs and restaurants while repairs take place. Reduced traffic means work could happen safely and without causing congestion, AA president Edmund King said. Councils said Â£10bn was needed to bring roads ""up to scratch"". The government said it had already committed Â£2.5bn for repairs ""as part of the biggest nationwide programme ever announced"". Tough fines for lockdown offenders, minister warns Traffic levels 'now double the lockdown low' Is our pothole problem getting worse? The lockdown in England is scheduled to last until 2 December. Pubs, restaurants, gyms and non-essential shops are closed, while people are being told not to travel unless it is necessary. Mr King told the BBC: ""Lower traffic levels during lockdown give highway authorities a unique opportunity to fill potholes, improve junctions and road drainage, safely and without causing congestion. ""If this can be done before the colder weather kicks in, it will help prevent further road degradation and all road users, whether on two wheels or four, will benefit."" Main roads in England are maintained by Highways England, while councils are responsible for the upkeep of local, usually more minor roads. Mr King said: ""In residential areas where parked cars are an obstacle, the local authority should seek permission for drivers to park in car parks of the pubs, restaurants, shops or businesses that have been forced to close."" Councils say the number of roads in ""poor condition"" has increased According to the Asphalt Industry Alliance's survey of councils, the proportion of England's roads in ""poor condition"" increased from 18% in 2017/18 to 21% in 2019/20. David Renard, transport spokesman for the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, said it would take almost Â£10bn to bring local roads ""up to scratch"". He called on the government to provide the funding needed ""to tackle the growing backlog of repairs"" in its one-year spending review later this month. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We know that people want to see potholes repaired and roads improved, which is why we've committed Â£2.5bn for repairs as part of the biggest nationwide programme ever announced. ""The government has set out that construction can continue during the national restrictions, with employers following Covid-secure guidelines, meaning highways authorities are able to take advantage of the quieter roads to maintain and improve the network."" During the previous lockdown, ""quieter roads enabled more highway maintenance works to take place, leading to over 319 miles of resurfacing"", they added. In April, recorded traffic in Great Britain fell to 1950s levels, before steadily rising as restrictions eased. Experts predict road use will decline again this time around but, with schools and universities staying open, the effect is not expected to be as dramatic as before.

"White House chief of staff has Covid-19Mark Meadows, who has often been seen without a mask, is the latest Trump aide to be infected.","The US reported a third straight daily record for new coronavirus cases on Friday, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 127,000 infections were reported in 24 hours, as well as 1,149 deaths. The news comes as officials announced that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had also tested positive for the virus. He is the latest Trump administration official to contract the disease.

Mr Meadows travelled with the president on the final days of campaigning and was at an election night party attended by dozens of Trump supporters at the White House.

Kylie Minogue reveals her favourite Kylie era,"The pop star has reinvented her image and her sound dozens of times over the last four decades Kylie Minogue is in perpetual motion. Ever since her first TV appearance on Aussie soap The Sullivans at the age of 10, she's evolved from actress to pop star to fashion icon, children's author, talent show judge and even a successful designer of home furnishings. Her career is defined by an inquisitive restlessness. Even in music, the area where she's most famous, the star has balanced mega-pop hits likeBetter The Devil You Know,externalandCan't Get You Out Of My Head,externalwith more experimental tracks like the sultry electro potboilerSlow,externalor the glitchy, atmosphericCherry Bomb,external. But through it all, Kylie's strong suit has been joyous, escapist disco. It's the first music that she fell in love with, as a child in mid-1970s Melbourne, long before she harboured ideas of becoming a pop star in her own right. ""When I was eight or nine I used to have pretend Abba concerts in my bedroom with my friends,"" she told Smash Hits magazine in 1988. ""We'd put on dresses and pretend to be Abba and we'd prance about the bedroom or the lounge singing into hairbrushes. I was always the blonde one."" After a dalliance with country music on her last album, Golden, Kylie has rekindled her love affair with the dancefloor for her 15th record - the appositely-titled Disco. BBC iPlayer: Kylie in concert Kylie is most-watched Glastonbury moment Kylie Minogue: 'I earned my stripes' Although she started writing it last year, the record was far from finished when lockdown struck in March. Suddenly, the star had to turn her London flat into a DIY studio, surrounding herself with blankets, duvets and even clothes racks so she could record her vocals in isolation. But for someone who's in perpetual motion, who once professed ""I'm either moving around, or I'm asleep"", quarantine was heavy going. ""It's hard to dig deep and stay positive,"" she says, ""and I had a moment like that, during the first lockdown where I had to confess to someone else that I was struggling,"" she says. ""And actually, if I wasn't able to work on the album, I perhaps would have gone the other way."" The pop star is challenging Little Mix for next week's number one album Of course, Disco isn't a sombre reflection on the fallout of a global pandemic. Like Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga, who released disco-centric albums earlier this year, Kylie is prescribing her fans 40 minutes of joyous escapism. ""So much of this year has been about connection, or lack of connection, that to be making something whose purpose is just to reach people really gave me motivation,"" she says. Speaking from her London home two days before the record's release, Kylie also talked about the ""overwhelming"" experience of playing Glastonbury, her abandoned career as a flautist, and which Kylie era is her favourite. Disco is something you've referenced all through your career, going right back toStep Back In Time,external. What do you feel when you step on a dance floor? Depends on which dance floor and which night. At the moment it's a kitchen disco so it requires a bit of imagination! But I think disco is a place of expression and a place of losing yourself or finding yourself. When you shine a light on a mirror ball, the light is infinite. It colours you and it affects your being in that moment of time. And the night might not last forever, but I think the notion of disco as a place of escape and abandon is something that most of us have got somewhere within us. You've written some philosophical lyrics this time around. What inspired the line: ""We're all just trying to find ourselves in the storms that we chase""? A lot of that song, Say Something, was a stream of consciousness - but I do believe [that lyric].  Sometimes you wonder, ""Why am I doing this? Why am I putting myself through this?"" Or ""this might not be the safest road to take,"" but I think it's through adversity that we find ourselves. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

When have you taken risks where you've worried about the outcome? Oh, all the time! It might sound like a superficial way but things like not getting a proper job when I left school and having the dream of acting. I signed up for the dole but I actually never got a cheque because I got an acting job, and then leaving the number one show [TV soap opera Neighbours] to pursue music, and to try different genres within my pop world. Fashion faux pas - there's certainly been plenty of those. They're maybe not risks with a whole lot of depth or gravitas - but they're risks all the same, that change the course of your life. The singer played a special set at the BBC Radio Theatre earlier this week for Zoe Ball's Radio 2 Breakfast Show The last track on the album, Celebrate You, is all about leaning on friends for support. Was that inspired by lockdown? That song was written a handful of days before lockdown so we knew that something was coming. You know, there was a kind of unsettling feeling in the air and we were conscious - the other writers and I - of the emotion creeping in, and wanting to take care of each other. The lyrics are addressed to someone called Mary. Is she someone from your life? That actually came from ""mumble-singing"" to find a melody. But Mary is all of us. She's anyone who needs a cuddle and some reassurance. I always picture that song as last call at the pub. All the family are there and maybe Aunty Mary's had one too many. The truths are coming out, there's been some tears, lots of hugs. Everyone's danced, everyone's partied - and this is the wind-down, back to Earth kind of song. Kylie on lockdown: ""We've just got to be strong together and hope for the best hope for better days."" It's nice to hear you talk about the writing process like this because you don't get recognised for it. Maybe that's because those early hits came from the Stock Aitken Waterman hit factory - but on this album you have a co-writing credit on every song. Is it important to you to be in the mix? For myself, yeah. I don't need to be recognised for it - but I absolutely love the writing process. To me it's like magic: You go into a session with nothing and you come out with a song. And because I don't play instruments, I do melody and lyrics. I need to do that with other people. Don't you play piano and flute, though? You entered competitions when you were younger... I did! You know what? I still have my original flute from high school. It was a very handy instrument - you can just put it in your bag - but I didn't carry on with that. Then I played piano for a number of years and I always learned by ear, so I can only read music very slowly. So as much as I can't play, I have a sense of musicality. The star's set included hits like Spinning Around, Shocked, Confide In Me and I Should Be So Lucky When you played Glastonbury last year, it became the festival'smost-watched performance of all time. What went through your head as you walked onto the stage? I suppose the overriding thought was, 'Wow'. I was blown away. In the dressing room, there's this swarming team of people - dancers and musicians and friends and family -  but the moment that you step onto the stage you're suddenly alone. I mean, you've got your band and dancers but in a sense I am no longer moored at the port. You're going out to sea and you're not quite sure what's going to happen. But by the time I was in position on that set and it spun around.... There'sa shot that became a gif,externalor a meme and that encapsulates better than I can what was going through my mind - because I just, I shook my head, I smiled. It was wild to see that many people, and tofeelthat many people. Kylie's tears of joy as she finally plays Glastonbury Kylie: How our obsession is driving her success After that performance, you said you didn't want to become a tribute act to yourself and that Glastonbury was an opportunity to ""wipe the slate clean,external"". What did you mean by that? I suppose I didn't want to feel like that was it. I felt like there was more music and more new experiences [to come]. And in a way I feel that there was a line drawn - but I didn't want the line to beaboveme. I wanted it to be a line acknowledging that I did it, I made it that far. I wanted to be able to use [Glastonbury] to propel me to go even further. Not to erase any of the past - that show was a celebration triumphs and a celebration of getting through the difficulties, and to have that history, that 30-plus year history with so many people is a glorious thing. Kylie's Glastonbury set came 14 years after she was forced to pull out of a headline slot following a breast cancer diagnosis I'm thinking about that history and all of those songs and all of the looks you've had over the years. I know fans debate furiously about their favourite Kylie era... but what's yours? Oh. Ooh. You're an awful person to ask me that! There's so many and they all represent something different... I'm really, really trying to commit to one - but as soon as my mind thinks of one era, another one will tap me on the shoulder and say, ""Wait, wait. What about this one?"" Iguesssssone of the eras that really seemed to be galactic in its own way was the Fever era [Can't Get You Out Of My Head, Love At First Sight]. It was just one of those moments where the planets are aligned and everything worked - the songs, the imagery, the moment. So I don't know that I would call it my favourite because I can find something to appreciate in all of them, but I'm going to choose that one, just because it did so well. Allow YouTube content?

EU slaps sanctions on Belarus leader Lukashenko,"Mr Lukashenko's security forces have a reputation for brutality The EU has added Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko and his son Viktor to its sanctions blacklist of Belarus officials, bringing the total to 59. The15 added on Friday,externalalso include KGB secret police chief Ivan Tertel and President Lukashenko's chief of staff Igor Sergeenko. The EU rejects Mr Lukashenko's claim to have won re-election on 9 August and deplores his crackdown on opponents. His son Viktor, 44, is a national security adviser. Protests have swept the country since its long-time leader said he had won the vote, which was widely viewed as rigged. The main opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, said she had attracted between 60 to 70% of the vote and was forced into exile in neighbouring Lithuania immediately after the election. The election-monitoring organisation, OSCE, said on Thursday thathuman rights abuses since the vote ""were found to be massive,externaland systematic and proven beyond doubt"", and called for the official result handing Mr Lukashenko victory to be annulled ""due to irregularities at all stages of the process"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the OSCE report had ""exposed the fraud at the heart of the presidential elections"" and he called for ""new elections which are free and fair"". The EU's latest sanctions block travel visas for the named officials and freeze any assets they may have in EU member states. In addition, EU citizens and companies are forbidden from lending to them. Alexander Lukashenko's tough leadership style harks back to Soviet times The KGB police chief is accused of leading the state crackdown, involving ""arbitrary arrests and illâtreatment, including torture, of peaceful demonstrators as well as intimidation and violence against journalists"". The decision in principle to add Alexander Lukashenko and his son was made by EU foreign ministers on 12 October. Europe's longest-serving ruler under fire In September, the UK imposed sanctions on Alexander Lukashenko, his son and other senior Belarusian officials, under the UK's new human rights sanctions regime. The UK foreign secretary called Mr Lukashenko's actions ""despicable"". What's happening in Belarus? Kremlin looks to keep Belarus in Moscow's orbit 'If you croak we don't care': Brutality in Belarus Russian President Vladimir Putin however is backing Mr Lukashenko, reinforcing an alliance that goes back decades. This video can not be played Police attacked protesters with stun grenades last month The Belarus opposition has organised huge demonstrations every Sunday since the election, usually with more than 100,000 people thronging the capital Minsk. The EU and US government agree with the opposition that the August election was rigged, with brutality meted out to Mr Lukashenko's opponents. The EU has told the Belarus authorities that they must stop the police violence and release those detained during weeks of mass protests, including all political prisoners. Mr Lukashenko has ignored repeated opposition calls for negotiations to re-run the election under free and fair conditions, to end police brutality and release political prisoners.

UK coronavirus infections may be 'stabilising',"The increase in coronavirus infections appears to be slowing around the UK, latestdata from the Office for National Statistics,externalshow. Although the number of people with Covid continues to rise, the growth is levelling off. In the week to 30 October, ONS says new daily infections in England stabilised at around 50,000. That means around one person in every 90 in England has Covid. In Wales and Scotland the figure is slightly lower. There, one in 110 people are testing positive for the virus. In Northern Ireland it is one in 75 - and it is too soon to say if rates are levelling off there, say experts. The ONS data looks at Covid-19 infections in the community, and does not include cases in hospitals, care homes or other institutional settings. It shows: There have been increases in infection rates in every region in England apart from the North East over the last two weeks The North West and Yorkshire and the Humber continue to have the highest infection rates With much of the UK in lockdown, experts hope the number of new infections can reduce in coming weeks. In Liverpool, city-widemass testingfor Covid has begun. Everyone living or working in the region will be offered repeat tests, whether or not they have symptoms, as part of a two-week pilot. TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:What is the job support scheme? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? GLOBAL TRACKER:Where are the virus hotspots? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries Meanwhile,data from the Covid Symptom Study app,external- based on a million people logging symptoms and 13,000 recent swab test results - suggests 42,049 people are developing Covid symptoms every day in the UK. The R number remains the same as last week, at between 1.1 and 1.3, which means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people and the outbreak is growing. Ruth Studley from the ONS said: ""At a national level we are seeing infections slow across England and Wales but they are still increasing. ""The level of infection in young adults and older teenagers appears to have levelled off recently. However, they continue to be the most likely to be infected despite increases in all other age groups."" Prof James Naismith from Oxford University said the findings were ""encouraging"" and suggested that the spread of the virus was slowing. ""This is evidence that the social restrictions prior to lockdown have had a real impact. ""Should next week's data show a similar stabilisation or reduction, then we can be confident that the second wave has for now stabilised. The national lockdown will not begin to show up in ONS figures for another two weeks, but we would expect it to bring a rapid decrease in the number of new infections. ""If we can contain the virus until the new year, mass testing, vaccines and new medicines will transform our outlook."" A Birmingham hospital haspostponed all its non-emergency proceduresbecause of an increase in the number of Covid-19 patients. Queen Elizabeth Hospital is currently treating 389 patients who have tested positive, with 36 in its Intensive Care Unit (ICU). That compares with 60 in-patients a month ago, and just five in ICU.
