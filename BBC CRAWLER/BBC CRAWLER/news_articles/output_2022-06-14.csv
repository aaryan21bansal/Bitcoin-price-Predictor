High Street pharmacists to make cancer referrals,"People with a worrying cough, problems swallowing or blood in their urine will soon be able to be referred for scans and checks by a pharmacist, rather than having to wait to see their GP. The new pilot scheme, in England, aims to diagnose more cancers early, when there is a better chance of a cure. High Street pharmacies will be funded to refer customers for the checks. The NHS will also send out more ""roaming trucks"" to perform on-the-spot scans in the community. Lung-scanner vans driven to locations, including supermarket car parks and football stadiums, have already resulted in more people having checks. Now, some liver lorries will join them. About 6,100 people a year are diagnosed with liver cancer - the number has doubled over the past decade and is expected to continue to rise. About half of all cancers are diagnosed early - but the NHS wants this to be at least three-quarters. It also plans to offer Jewish people genetic screening - as up to one in 40 has Brca mutations, linked to a higher risk of breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, compared with one in 400 in the general population. NHS England boss Amanda Pritchard will tell the NHS ConfedExpo conference, in Liverpool: ""We want to make it as easy as possible for those most at risk to get vital, lifesaving tests. ""These plans have the power to truly transform the way we find and treat cancer - and ultimately spare thousands of patients and their families from avoidable pain and loss."" Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Ensuring patients can access diagnosis and treatment easily in their communities and on High Streets is a fundamental part of our 10-Year Cancer Plan."" Dr Anthony Cunliffe, national clinical adviser for primary care, at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""Doctors and nurses are working tirelessly to diagnose and treat the tens of thousands of people entering a very busy cancer care system. ""This pilot will give people the opportunity to access more trained professionals in their community to get symptoms investigated."" Michelle Mitchell, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""By changing the way people engage with the health service, we have the potential to help diagnose more cancers at an earlier, more treatable stage. ""We look forward to seeing how these efforts will support the NHS's ambitious early diagnosis targets.""

Truss urges DUP to return to power sharing,"Northern Ireland's political parties should return to power sharing ""as soon as possible"", the UK foreign secretary has said. Liz Truss urged the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to ""get on with it"". But DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said that would depend on whether Parliament backed a planto get rid of parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MichÃ©al Martin said the plan was ""dispiriting"" and ""an assault on an international agreement"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Michelle O'Neill urged the DUP to stop blocking the formation of a Stormont Executive. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. It prevents a hard border with the Republic of Ireland, but it means checks on some goods arriving into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK - a situation opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland who argue it creates a trade border in the Irish Sea. The DUP has refused to form a new power-sharing executive until its concerns about the protocol are addressed. How will government's NI Protocol plans affect businesses? But Ms O'Neill accused the Prime Minister of ""pandering"" to the DUP at Westminster. She said there should be no further delay on forming an executive and called for both sides to find an agreed way forward on the protocol. ""Society and the people should not be held to ransom while that work continues,"" she said. ""What we want is an executive formed today; we're ready to be there today."" However, the DUP leader said there was ""a stark choice here for Parliament"". ""TheNorthern Ireland ProtocolandGood Friday Agreementcannot exist together,"" he said. ""One seriously harms the other."" He said the protocol undermined the ""cross-community consensus on which the political institutions operate"". ""Parliament can either choose to go forward with the [Good Friday] Agreement and the political institutions and stability in Northern Ireland, or the protocol, but it can't have both,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. Sir Jeffrey said the consent of unionists was required On Monday, the UK governmentpublished the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, to be debated and voted on by Parliament. At the centre of the government's plan to ease the impact on businesses is the concept of green lanes and red lanes for trade. This would mean: Goods coming from Great Britain (GB) into Northern Ireland (NI) and which are staying would use the green lane. This means there would be no checks and paperwork would be minimal. GB goods moving through NI into Ireland or the wider European Union would use the red lane and continue to be checked at NI ports. London also wants any trade disputes resolved by ""independent arbitration"", not by the European Court of Justice, and Northern Ireland to benefit from the same tax breaks as elsewhere in the UK. Sir Jeffrey said that without the support and consent of unionists, the Stormont institutions could not operate. His party, which won the second-most seats in the recent Northern Ireland Assembly elections, argues it creates a divide that could lead to the break-up of the UK. It is refusing to set up a new Northern Ireland executive with Sinn FÃ©in - which won the most seats in the election - and other parties, until changes are made to it. A majority of MLAs in the Stormont Assembly signed a joint letter to the prime minister stating their opposition to the proposed legislation to amend the protocol. It was signed by 52 of the 90 assembly members (MLAs) representing Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party. UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal What is the Northern Ireland Protocol row about? ""People deserve to have a government. We have published this bill which does deliver for all the communities of Northern Ireland,"" Ms Truss told the programme. She said that triggering Article 16 ""wouldn't have resolved tax issue and custom issues"" and instead would merely have ""kicked the can down the road"". ""If I could get negotiated solution with EU that would be my first preference. ""I have looked at all the options this is the only option that creates the long term, durable solution that the people of NI deserve,"" she added. MicheÃ¡l Martin warned that there was an issue around trust Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin described as ""reckless""  the UK government's decision to proceed unilaterally in dealing with the Northern Ireland Protocol. Speaking in the DÃ¡il (lower house of parliament) on Tuesday, Mr Martin said the British government was not acting in good faith. The taoiseach said the London move had the potential to destabilise politics in Northern Ireland and had to be seen in the context of internal British politics. He said business leaders in Northern Ireland supported the protocol and whatever problems there were could be sorted through negotiation with the EU. There has been a mixed reaction from businesses in Northern Ireland to the government's plans. Manufacturing NI said thatwhile the protocol needed reformed it did not need a ""wrecking ball"".

William and Kate attend Grenfell memorial service,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had earlier met those affected by the disaster in a private meeting The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have joined bereaved families and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire to mark its fifth anniversary. Seventy-two people were killed by the blaze in North Kensington, west London, on 14 June 2017. The couple joined mourners at the base of the tower for a special service having earlier met several during a private meeting. A 72-second silence was observed by attendees, concluding with applause. The couple placed a wreath during the service The attendance of the duke and duchess was ""huge"" for the community, a local resident said. Muna Hussain, whose children went to the same school as five of those who died, said: ""I was glad to see at least they know how we are feeling as a community and they shared that feeling. ""It makes me very happy. It's massive, it's huge for us. It makes you feel better."" Stormzy - who has long offered his support to those affected by the disaster - was also at the event Some watched the service on big screens A silent two-mile march was held after the service During the service, actor Tim Downie said: ""At today's service we honour the 72 innocent men, women and children, mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters, sisters, brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces and friends who needlessly lost their lives. ""We must never forget them and carry them with us forever in our hearts."" Many mourners wore green scarves and clothing to match the green hearts that adorn the wall below the tower and which have become a symbol of the tragedy. Floral tributes and personal notes have been left beside the wall, including a ""72"" made of white flowers. Afterwards, several hundred people carried out a two-mile walk around the area. Dozens of firefighters lined the streets, with many holding green hearts reading ""Grenfell"", and onlookers applauded as the mourners passed. WatchGrenfell: Has Anything Changed?on iPlayer. A memorial service for the 72 people killed in the fire took place at 11:00 at Westminster Abbey Earlier, a multi-faith memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It began with the names of the victims being read out followed by a reply of ""forever in our hearts"" from the congregation. Former prime minister Theresa May, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Housing Secretary Michael Gove were among those in the congregation. People placed white roses in memory of the victims Theresa May, who was prime minister when the fire happened, spoke to volunteers ahead of the memorial service Journalist Jon Snow, who was invited to speak at the service, said: ""Grenfell, set in the richest borough in Britain, speaks to the grotesque inequality with which our society has been riven. ""We must now confront the issues raised by the Grenfell disaster."" Lawyer Imran Khan, who also addressed the congregation, said: ""For the residents of Grenfell, their home wasn't their castle, it was their deathbed."" The names of each of the 72 victims of the Grenfell Tower fire were read out BBC News correspondent Nick Johnson From scarves and flowers, to altar cloths and decorations, Westminster Abbey was adorned in green as hundreds gathered for this memorial service to remember those who lost their lives on this day five years ago. At the very heart of the service was a sense of unity and remembrance. Members of the congregation held hands, comforting those who were weeping, as the names of each of the 72 victims were read out. We heard from Marlene Anderson. Her father Ray ""Moses"" Bernard lost his life in the fire. His daughter spoke of her trauma and how she and other family members often relive that night. Perhaps the loudest round of applause came after lawyer Imran Khan's speech. He spoke of his disbelief over a lack of criminal charges and described the public inquiry into the fire as ineffective. As the congregation filed out of the Abbey, 72 candles were left flickering on the altar, a reminder that the Grenfell victims will never be forgotten. Elsewhere in the capital, a 72-second silence was observed at 14:00 at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush. People observed a 72-second silence at the Grenfell memorial wall in the nearby Westfield shopping centre Firefighters will provide a guard of honour as survivors and the bereaved walk from Grenfell Tower Natasha Elcock, chairwoman of campaign group Grenfell United, said this week would be difficult for all of those affected.

While a criminal investigation into the disaster is under way, the Met Police has said no prosecutions will be brought until thepublic inquiry,externalis finished and its findings are published. So far, fewer than half of the recommendations from the inquiry have been adopted into law, according to the Home Office. Survivors and bereaved families and friends have held a campaign for criminal proceedings to be sped up Earlier this month,the government imposed a total ban on the specific type of claddingthat allowed the blaze to spread so rapidly. Previously, the ban appliedonly to buildings higher than 11m (36ft). The government first received data demonstrating thedanger of polyethylene-cored cladding in 2002. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) said it was taking steps to ensure buildings were safer.

"Monkeypox to get a new name, says WHO","Monkeypox virus particle The World Health Organization says it is working with experts to come up with a new name for monkeypox. It comes after more than30 scientists wrote last week,externalabout the ""urgent need for a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising"" name for the virus and the disease it causes. Continued reference to the virus as African is both inaccurate and discriminatory, they said. Some 1,600 cases of the disease have been recorded globally in recent weeks. While 72 deaths have been reported in countries where monkeypox was already endemic, none have been seen in the newly affected 32 countries, such as the UK. At the latest count, as of 12 June, there were 452 confirmed cases in England, 12 in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland and 4 in Wales. WatchWhat Is Monkeypox?on BBC iPlayer. The World Health Organization says it will hold an emergency meeting next week to determine whether to classify the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern - the highest alarm the UN agency can sound. The only other diseases this has happened for in the past are Swine flu, polio, Ebola, Zika and Covid. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""The outbreak of monkeypox is unusual and concerning. ""For that reason I have decided to convene the Emergency Committee under the international health regulations next week, to assess whether this outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern."" What is monkeypox? Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe. One new name for it that's been suggested by scientists is hMPXV, but we'll need to wait to hear what the WHO thinks of that. Infections are usually mild and the risk to the general population is low, but the UK government has bought stocks of smallpox vaccine to guard against more cases. The virus has been spreading in an unusual manner around the world in recent months. Previous outbreaks have been mainly confined to parts of Africa where rodents - not monkeys - are thought to be the main animal host. The infectioncauses a rashthat looks a bit like chickenpox. The virus can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. It has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by close contact. Anyone with the virus should abstain from sex while they have symptoms. Monkeypox: Handing out health advice without stigma What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?

Sturgeon unveils case for Scottish independence,"This video can not be played Scotland must ""forge a way forward"" to a referendum, without section 30 order ""if necessary"", Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has unveiled what she called a ""refreshed"" case for independence. She told a press conference in Edinburgh that her government had an ""indisputable mandate"" for a second independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon was launchingthe first of a series of papers setting out the case to break away from the UK,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the 2014 referendum result should be respected. And opposition parties accused the Scottish government of being obsessed with independence. The first minister said it was now time to set out ""a different and better vision"" for Scotland. Look back at Nicola Sturgeon's campaign launch Will there be a Scottish independence referendum? At a glance: Scottish government independence paper She said it was time to talk abut independence and then to make that choice. Ms Sturgeon insisted she won last May's election with a ""clear commitment to give the people of Scotland the choice of becoming an independent country"", and that Holyrood had a ""decisive majority"" of MSPs in favour of independence. ""The Scottish Parliament therefore has an indisputable democratic mandate,"" she added. Nicola Sturgeon and Patrick Harvie at the launch of the new paper However, she conceded that a future referendum faced challenges, including what she described as an issue of process. She said Holyrood's power to hold a vote was ""contested"". If a referendum bill was introduced without Westminster agreement it could be challenged in the courts. Before the 2014 referendum, the Scottish government struck an agreement with the UK government which transferred authority on a temporary basis to Holyrood. This was called a section 30 order. The UK government has so far shown no indication that it would be willing to do so again. Ms Sturgeon said any referendum ""must be lawful"", and that only parties opposed to independence would benefit from doubt about the process. ""If this UK government had any respect at all for democracy, the issue of legality would be put beyond doubt, as in 2014,"" she added. An agreement was reached between the Scottish and UK governments ahead of the 2014 referendum, She said she had made clear to Boris Johnson that she was ""ready to discuss the terms of such an order at any time"". The first minister said her government had a mandate for another referendum, adding: ""If we are to uphold democracy here in Scotland, we must forge a way forward if necessary without a section 30 order."" An update on the Scottish government's plans for holding a referendum would follow soon, she added. Ms Sturgeon said the independence papers would set the scene for the debate about Scotland's future in the UK. She said they would cover how Scotland can benefit from the ""massive opportunities"" independence would present, but also address the challenges and not shy away from tough questions. She said independence would put ""the levers that determine success into our own hands"", and away from Westminster - which was taking Scotland ""in the wrong direction"". The first paper - calledIndependence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?,external- makes comparisons between Scotland and other European countries - all of which Ms Sturgeon said were independent, wealthier and fairer than the UK. Subsequent papers will look at a areas including currency, tax and spend, defence, social security and pensions, and EU membership and trade. Ms Sturgeon was joined at the press conference by Patrick Harvie, the co-leader of the Scottish Green Party and a member of the Scottish cabinet. The SNP and the Greens are both pro-independence and struck a power sharing arrangement at Holyrood after last year's election. Mr Harvie said Scotland ""could chart a different future"" with independence and set out a vision for a greener, fairer and more prosperous Scotland. Boris Johnson said the 2014 result should be respected. He said the UK government should focus on the economy and Covid recovery, adding: ""That's the focus of the government. We're working with our friends in the Scottish government, in the Scottish administration, on those issues."" At Holyrood, the presiding officer stopped a minister from making a statement to MSPson Tuesday afternoon because the details had already been released to the media. Alison Johnstone said the ""benefits of independence"" announcement should have been made in the chamber first ""as a matter of courtesy and respect to the parliament"". She skipped instead to response from Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who said energy was being wasted on the wrong priorities. He said: ""Pushing for another divisive referendum... is the wrong priority, at the worst possible time."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said Ms Sturgeon's speech was ""a disappointing return to the politics of the past"", adding that the majority were opposed to independence. He said the first minister should not ""turn her back"" on important issues in order to ""focus on her own obsession"" with independence. Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said the first minister ""must be wired to the moon if she thinks that breaking up the UK is the priority for people"". Why is this renewed push for independence happening?The answer is simple. The people of Scotland voted for it. Of course there is plenty of opposition to, and concern about, a second independence referendum but it remains an inescapable fact that in last year's elections to the Scottish Parliament voters returned a majority of MSPs, both SNP and Green, who had pledged to hold one. When this happened in 2011, there was a referendum. If that was the accepted trigger then, why is it not the trigger now? That is primarily a question for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The SNP's argument is that if his Conservative Party previously regarded a majority at Holyrood as a mandate for a poll, why is he thwarting the will of Scotland's voters now? Today the SNP leader did not or could not detail the alternative path she intends to follow if Mr Johnson persists in his refusal. There are also difficult questions for both Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson about the ""why"" as well as the ""how"" of independence. Read more from James Independence is never far from the surface in Scottish politics.It is the principle fault line. The great divide. The question will persist unless and until a) independence actually happens or b) the public tire of the political parties that promote it. Neither of those possibilities seem very likely anytime soon and so the debate continues. It was largely put on hold during the pandemic but when the SNP won the Holyrood election in 2021, they did so having promised another referendum. Together with the Scottish Greens who share power with them in the Scottish government, they have a majority in parliament for indyref2. What they do not have is the explicit power to hold a vote.

People in Pakistan urged to drink fewer cups of tea,"The average person in Pakistan consumes 1kg of tea each year, according to estimates People in Pakistan have been asked to reduce the amount of tea they drink to keep the country's economy afloat. Sipping fewer cups a day would cut Pakistan's high import bills, senior minister Ahsan Iqbal said. The country's low foreign currency reserves - currently enough for fewer than two months of all imports - have left it in urgent need of funds. Pakistan is the world's largest importer of tea, buying in more than $600m (Â£501m) worth last year. ""I appeal to the nation to cut down the consumption of tea by one to two cups because we import tea on loan,"" Mr Iqbal said, according to Pakistani media. Business traders could also close their market stalls at 20:30 to save electricity, he suggested. The plea came as Pakistan's foreign currency reserves continue to fall rapidly - putting pressure on the government to cut high import costs and keep funds in the country. The request to reduce tea drinking has gone viral on social media, with many doubting the country's serious financial problems can be addressed by cutting out the caffeinated beverage. Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves dropped from around $16bn (Â£13.4bn) in February to less than $10bn (Â£8.3bn) in the first week of June, barely enough to cover the cost of two months of all its imports. Last month officials in Islamabad restricted the import of dozens of non-essential luxury items as part of their bid to protect funds. The economic crisis is a major test for the government of Shehbaz Sharif, who replaced Imran Khan as Pakistan's prime minister in aparliamentary votein April. Shortly after being sworn in, Mr Sharif accused Imran Khan's outgoing government of mismanaging the economy and said putting it back on track would be a huge challenge. Last week his cabinet unveiled a fresh $47bn (Â£39bn) budget aimed at convincing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to restart a stalled $6bn (Â£5bn) bailout programme. The IMF deal wasnegotiated in 2019to ease an economic crisis created by low foreign currency reserve supplies and years of stagnating growth - but was later paused after lenders questioned Pakistan's finances.

PM praises Falklands veterans on 40th anniversary,"Mr Johnson looks at names of British personnel who lost their lives in the Falklands Commemorations have taken place to mark the 40th anniversary of the end of the Falklands War. Boris Johnson joined veterans, bereaved family members and senior defence figures at a service at Staffordshire's National Memorial Arboretum. Mr Johnson praised the ""incredible daring and bravery"" of Falklands veterans. Some 255 British troops, 649 Argentine military personnel and three Falkland islanders died during the conflict. The 10-week war began in April 1982, when troops from Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, a British colony in the south Atlantic ocean. Argentina said it had inherited the islands from Spain in the 1800s and wanted to reclaim them. The British had ruled the islands for 150 years and sent armed forces by sea to take the islands back. Argentina's troops surrendered on 14 June. How soldiers felt at the end of the Falklands War On Tuesday, veterans, civilians and bereaved family members attended a service hosted by the Royal British Legion at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas to remember the end of the conflict. At the same time a service was held at Port Stanley, the Falklands capital. Mr Johnson - who laid a wreath at the service - told journalists afterwards: ""The first thing is to remember what an incredible thing it was that they achieved back in 1982 to make an opposed landing, to take back territory in the way that they did. ""The incredible daring and bravery of those young men and women. And we salute that - we remember that today."" He added that the ""greatest tribute"" to those who had laid down their lives was that the Falklands Islands had since ""thrived in peace and freedom"". Wreaths were laid by military personnel as well as Mr Johnson At the scene: Stanley remembers lives lost By Ollie Peart The city of Stanley on the Falkland Islands struck a sombre tone on Tuesday's morning under a grey winter drizzle. Hundreds turned out to watch the band parade along the harbour front to the city's monument, where islanders paid their respects and to those who lost their lives in the conflict 40 years ago. Soon after the memorial was over, the mood changed to celebration. This is a defiant nation and one that wants the world to know it takes its freedom seriously, not taking a moment of it for granted. The festivities will continue long into the night, a momentary breath of fresh air away from the dark cloud that continues to hang over these islands 40 years on, that of Argentina. A military band also performed at the service Events have also been taking elsewhere in the country,including at Portsmouth and Southampton,where ships departed for the islands, as well wreath-laying services in Dorset. One survivor of HMS Coventry, which was bombed during the war,shared his memories with the BBC,saying: ""I think about it nearly every day and you know it is part of my life and it is part of this nation's heritage."" ""I remember my lost friends every year and sadly there is additions because we are all getting older,"" said Mick Kerry, from Warwickshire, who was a 21-year-old marine engineer on the Royal Navy destroyer when it was bombed. Mick Kerry said he thinks about the Falklands conflict ""nearly every day"" A parade was also held at Invicta Park Barracks in Maidstone, Kent Elsewhere, a woman who was born in the Falkland Islands three months before the warhas been telling the BBC howshe became a soldier to repay a debt of gratitude she felt towards the soldiers who fought in the conflict. Sara Halford, who joined the British Army aged 17 and serves with 16 Medical Regiment in Colchester, said islanders would be ""forever grateful"". Meanwhile, a collection of portraits of seven veterans from across Scotland have been revealed as part of a virtual exhibition by Glasgow photographer Wattie Cheung. On Saturday, a national remembrance parade and service will be held in Edinburgh, where hundreds of current and former servicemen and women are expected to take part. This video can not be played Although the war had ended, some of the veterans found the celebrations back at home difficult On Sunday, members of the Tumbledown Veterans and Families Association marched to the cenotaph on Blackpool promenade. Nine men died at the Battle of Mount Tumbledown, overlooking Port Stanley, in the final days of the conflict. LIQUID DIET:Are meal replacement drinks good for you?

At a glance: Scottish government independence paper,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has launched the first in a series of papers which she says willset out and debate the case for Scotland's independence. The first paper is entitled:""Independence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external It looks at 10 ""comparator countries"" - Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands - and compares the UK's performance across a range of economic and social indicators. Ms Sturgeon said these independent countries were a similar size to Scotland but were wealthier, fairer and more productive than the UK. The paper says all the comparator countries are wealthier than the UK, as measured by GDP per head of the population, and the gap has been maintained over the long term. Income inequality is lower in the comparator countries and poverty rates are lower. Most of the comparator countries have a smaller gender pay gap and all have more social mobility. They also have higher productivity and most spend more on research and development. It says the comparator countries have achieved lower debt and deficits but notes the global financial crisis had a more severe impact in some countries than others. Ireland and Iceland faced massive fiscal challenges in the wake of the global financial crisis, but recovered more rapidly than was widely predicted. The second section of the Scottish government paper seeks to highlight some of the factors that help explain the better performance of the comparator countries relative to the UK. Benefits: It says a key aspect of the comparator countries is the relative generosity of out-of-work benefits Tax and public spending:  The structure of taxation across countries varies significantly. Ireland and Switzerland, where tax and spending are relatively low, have chosen developmental paths quite distinct from the higher spending, higher tax Nordic nations. Evidence suggests that higher confidence in government is correlated with higher levels of willingness to comply with taxes. Labour market policies: The paper says Denmark's 'flexicurity' labour market has often been held up as a model for Scotland. It has a very high spend on labour market policies - government programmes that intervene in the labour market to help the unemployed find work. All the other comparator nations spend significantly more than the UK where spend is exceptionally low. The paper also looks at Sweden's job security councils and the Danish disruption council as well as social partnership models The paper says commentators have attributed the UK's relatively weak productivity and relatively high income inequality to the short-termism resulting from the UK's distinct approach to ownership and governance, the failure to develop effective institutions, and a lack of commitment to industrial strategy. The paper says the UK has a very distinct approach to ownership and corporate governance. The UK is much more open to foreign buyouts, has a low prevalence of public ownership and a particularly active market for corporate control. The UK has more fragmented shareholding and a low prevalence of large family-owned firms. It says that financial market pressure for short-term returns to shareholders had been an obstacle to investment The UK's labour and product markets are among the most deregulated in the advanced world. The paper says it has been argued that this encourages firms to adopt ""low road"" approaches to competitiveness through cost minimisation and work intensification rather than ""high road"" approaches based on patient investment and greater focus on skills. The Scottish government's paper acknowledges that an independent Scotland could not be transformed to match the success of the comparator countries overnight. But it says the comparator country models - especially the Nordic countries - illustrate the range of choices that would be available to an independent Scotland able to pursue different policies from those adopted by Westminster over many years. Independence by itself will not guarantee improved performance, it says. The government says it welcomes a national debate about how an independent country can create a wealthier, happier and fairer Scotland.

Why is Scottish independence back in the spotlight?,"Independence is never far from the surface in Scottish politics. It is the principle fault line. The great divide. The question will persist unless and until a) independence actually happens or b) the public tire of the political parties that promote it. Neither of those possibilities seem very likely anytime soon and so the debate continues. It was largely put on hold during the pandemic but when the SNP won the Holyrood election in 2021, they did so having promised another referendum. Together with the Scottish Greens who share power with them in the Scottish government, they have a majority in parliament for indyref2. Sturgeon unveils case for Scottish independence Scotland can navigate a legal independence vote - Sturgeon What they do not have is the explicit power to hold a vote. That was overcome in 2014 through an agreement with the UK government, which transferred authority on a temporary basis to Holyrood. It did so throughwhat's known as a section 30 order. The first minister has not yet formally asked for one of those this time, although UK ministers including Boris Johnson have made clear it would not be forthcoming. Nicola Sturgeon's predecessor Alex Salmondseems to think she should make the request and use the rejection as a basis for her campaign. She seems more cautious about giving the prime minister a formal opportunity to spurn indyref2. The alternative, asset out in the SNP's previously published plan, is to test Holyrood's powers by introducing a referendum bill without UK agreement. In 2014, Alex Salmond and David Cameron struck an agreement for power to hold a referendum to be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood This approach anticipates that the bill would face challenge in the UK Supreme Court and that the Scottish government would argue its case there. It would then be for judges to decide if Holyrood can hold a referendum or not. On one side, the argument that there is no legal barrier to Holyrood consulting the public on any given issue and that a vote on independence would not be binding. On the other, the argument that a ""yes"" vote would create the expectation that Scotland would become independent, fundamentally altering the UK constitution over which decision-making is specifically reserved to Westminster. If the judges said no, the referendum would not go ahead because Nicola Sturgeon has specifically ruled out an illegal vote in the Catalan-style. If the judges said yes, things could still get messy with the ""no"" side potentially boycotting a referendum on the basis that the process had not been agreed. In reality, the only way to have a successful referendum is by agreement and at this stage there is not even consensus on the circumstances in which that should happen. So, however certain Nicola Sturgeon says she is about indyref2 happening before the end of 2023, the basis for her confidence is not clear. If she has some new initiative to break the deadlock, it remains well hidden. The first minister has saidshe will make a statement to MSPs, probably this month, on how she plans to secure a referendum. This week, for her, is less about the process and more about the principles behind her argument for independence. The whys rather than the hows. It is a signal to her supporters that she means business and an effort to persuade others and build public pressure for another referendum. There is no doubt that Brexit has fundamentally changed the circumstances in which Scotland voted back in 2014. However, the upheaval leaving the EU has caused is - for some - an argument not to consider the bigger constitutional change that independence would bring. To pro-UK parties like the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, independence is a massive distraction from challenges like Covid recovery and the cost of living crisis. To independence supporting parties, like the SNP and the Greens it is an opportunity for Scotland to decide how best to tackle these and other problems. This is the beginning of a new phase of campaigning for and against independence and another referendum, rather than the start of a 2014-style referendum campaign. Calling for a referendum does not mean it is actually going to happen but it does ensure the independence debate endures.

Snapchat Ecstasy dealer guilty of killing teenager,"Cerys Reeve died after taking the drug during a sleepover at a friend's house A teenage drug dealer has been convicted of killing a 14-year-old girl after he supplied her with the drug Ecstasy. James McCairn, 18, sold crystal MDMA to Cerys Reeve after advertising his illegal trade on Snapchat. The young dancer died after taking the drug during a sleepover at a friend's house in Greenock in July 2020. First offender McCairn was found guilty of culpable homicide following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Prosecutors said he had ""recklessly and unlawfully"" given the deadly class A drug to Cerys at his home in Greenock. McCairn was also found guilty of supplying Ecstasy to other young people in the town between November 2019 and July 2020. James McCairn advertised his illegal trade on Snapchat His QC had asked for McCairn, who was only 16 at the time of the death, to remain on bail pending sentencing next month. But judge John McCormick remanded him custody, saying his commercial drug dealing had resulted in tragic consequences. The trial heard how McCairn had been advertising pills for sale on the morning of 13 July 2020. Cerys had been at a friend's house before going to McCairn's to purchase MDMA. She returned and mixed the powder into a cup of juice before taking it. When her friend came back into the room after making a toastie, Cerys was described as ""acting really weird"". This initially included her not being able to control her arms and kicking items off a window ledge. The witness went on to describe Cerys as grunting, sweating and falling off the bed, which woke the girl's mother. She then started burning up and suffered a seizure. A 999 call was immediately made and the teenager was taken to Inverclyde Royal Hospital. Cerys was described as ""rigid all over"" and put on a ventilator. The talented dancer never recovered and was pronounced dead at 0808. The cause of death was ""MDMA toxicity"". In his closing speech to the jury, prosecutor Graeme Jessop said: ""McCairn just did not care about Cerys's age or vulnerability. ""All he cared about at the time was selling his drugs for profit regardless of the circumstances."" After the verdict, Mr Jessop told Judge McCormick of the heartbreak Cerys's family had suffered. The advocate depute added: ""As we have heard, Cerys Reeve was 14 and lived in Port Glasgow with her parents. ""She was the only child to her mother. She has an older half sister. ""She was at school in Port Glasgow and was due to start fourth year when she died. ""Her parents elected not to attend court proceedings due to the upset and distress at their daughter's death.""

How Wales plans to end new HIV cases by 2030,"Fast Track chair Gian Molinu wants people to get HIV tested early to improve outcomes of those living with the virus Better access to condoms, preventative drugs and specific lessons in schools are among proposals to end new cases of HIV in Wales within eight years. Allowing doctors and chemists to give HIV drugs and improving online testing are part of a 26-point Welsh government plan to be announced on Tuesday. Wales was the first UK nation to pledge to stop new HIV cases by 2030. ""There is no place for ignorance or intolerance in modern Wales,"" said Health Minister Eluned Morgan. ""We have come a long way since the dark days of the 1980s - so memorably depicted last year inChannel 4's It's a Sin- when ignorance and cruelty towards people with HIV was rife."" The hit Channel 4 drama It's A Sin sparked a spike in HIV tests in Wales Tests for HIV spiked in Wales when It's A Sin,Welsh screenwriter Russell T Davies' record-breaking dramathat followed a group of friends during the 1980s Aids crisis, first hit TV screens in early 2021. England,externalhas already revealed its strategy to ""eliminate"" new HIV cases by 2030 and now the Welsh government has announced how it aims to improve quality of life for those living with the virus and end stigma by the start of the next decade. It's A Sin: HIV diagnosis at 16 was like 'a wake-up call' 'My story helped inspire hit TV show It's A Sin' Watch rugby star Gareth Thomas' BBC documentary 'HIV and Me' UN figures suggested in 2020 that about 38 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 700,000 died from Aids-related illnesses, which can be the result of HIV going untreated. A Cardiff project to reduce stigma and improve care for people living with HIV is set to be extended across Wales It was estimated more than105,000 people were living with HIV,externalin the UK, according to the latest data from National Aids Trust, with nearly 2,800 of those having HIV care in Wales. The Welsh government-led plan is to improve access to PrEP and allow GPs and community pharmacies in all parts of Wales, especially in rural areas and underserved communities, to be able to give out the HIV prevention drug. PrEP - or pre-exposure prophylaxis - is a pill taken daily, or on demand prior to having sex, to prevent HIV infection If taken consistently, when a condom is not worn and someone comes into contact with HIV, it protects cells in the body and disables the virus to stop it multiplying A UK Medical Research Council-run study comparing gay men on PrEP against non-users found an 86% fall in new HIV infections in PrEP users This video can not be played 'People think using PrEP means you put it about' Many in the sexual health sector say PrEP, when taken correctly, is almost 100% effective It is aimed at men who have sex with men without a condom as well as others at high risk, including HIV-negative partners of individuals with HIV that is not virally suppressed Researchers are assessing demand for the drug and its effect on the number of new HIV infections Testing for HIV could be made ""more accessible"" and ""promoted more widely to tackle inequalities"" with ""texting for testing,external"" pilots extended and rapid test click and collect options available after Â£3.9m investment from Welsh government. Latest statistics also showed there were more than 4,000 new people infected with HIV every year in the UK, with48 people newly diagnosed,externalin Wales in 2021. This video can not be played Former Wales rugby player Gareth Thomas revealed he has HIV so he could ""empower people"" Wales has seen a 75% decline in new HIV infections between 2015 and 2021, according to figures from Public Health Wales. 'My HIV got my daughter kicked out of school' 'By 25, I'd lost 50 friends to Aids' 'We were all Aids deniers - then it got real' Tackling late diagnosis will be made a ""priority"" in the new Welsh plan and any late HIV diagnoses should be ""investigated and reported"" by health boards. Marlon Van Der Mark posts videos on social media to help dispel HIV myths and break its stigma Marlon Van Der Mark had HIV for two years before he felt able to tell family and a few close friends. ""I never knew HIV existed really, I never got taught about it so I was very naive to the whole thing,"" said the 24-year-old from Cardiff. ""So when I ended up catching it, I was in complete shock. It was the most horrifying moment of my life. Marlon has been immortalised in wall art aiming to encourage people to get tested for HIV ""I thought that coming out as gay was hard, but this was like way beyond because no-one talked about it. Then for a long time I called it the forbidden subject. ""Then if you did look online and someone had spoken about it, it was spoken about negatively so that just encouraged my fear even more. I lived most of my few years when I first got diagnosed in denial."" Now Marlon, who was diagnosed with HIV aged 20, posts videos on social media to help dispel HIV myths and break its stigma. Marlon welcomes the Welsh government's approach but thinks zero new HIV infections by 2030 is tough The Welsh government-led plan wants to use the curriculum to ""effectively address HIV, PrEP and stigma"" to school children as well as help support those those living with HIV to ""live better lives"". ""We have made huge progress in improving access to testing and treatment in Wales and we're proud of the significant reduction in new diagnoses of HIV,"" Ms Morgan said. ""There is, however, more to be done and by accepting and implementing these actions, we will make a massive difference to the lives of people living with HIV and in protecting current and future generations from the virus."" The Terrence Higgins Trust praised Wales for making PrEP available quickly and without a cap on numbers The UK's leading HIV and sexual health charity has welcomed Wales' ""ambitious commitment"" for something it said could be life-changing. ""Wales has been a trailblazer in the fight against HIV as shown in its fast action to make prevention drug PrEP available quickly and without a cap on numbers,"" said Terrence Higgins Trust chief executive Ian Green. 'By 25, I'd lost 50 friends to Aids' You can't catch HIV from hugging me - Gareth Thomas Game-changer: 'I didn't know HIV drug existed' ""We have all the tools necessary to end new HIV cases in Wales by 2030 and that's why we need to urgently utilise each of them in order to do just that."" A 12-week consultation period has started for people and organisations to comment on the plan that will be run by Welsh government, health boards, local councils, charities and community groups. ""As a nation, we are not very good at talking about these things, certainly not about HIV,"" said Gian Molinu, chair ofFast Track,external, a project in Cardiff helping people with HIV and tacking stigma. ""I know for a certain generation, you say HIV and you immediately think Aids and those horrendous adverts from the 80s where they said 'Aids is death, stay away, stay away'. ""That's not the case.

"People in Pakistan urged to drink fewer cups of teaReducing consumption by one to two cups every day would help the economy, a senior minister says.","The average person in Pakistan consumes 1kg of tea each year, according to estimates People in Pakistan have been asked to reduce the amount of tea they drink to keep the country's economy afloat. Sipping fewer cups a day would cut Pakistan's high import bills, senior minister Ahsan Iqbal said. The country's low foreign currency reserves - currently enough for fewer than two months of all imports - have left it in urgent need of funds. Pakistan is the world's largest importer of tea, buying in more than $600m (Â£501m) worth last year. ""I appeal to the nation to cut down the consumption of tea by one to two cups because we import tea on loan,"" Mr Iqbal said, according to Pakistani media. Business traders could also close their market stalls at 20:30 to save electricity, he suggested. The plea came as Pakistan's foreign currency reserves continue to fall rapidly - putting pressure on the government to cut high import costs and keep funds in the country. The request to reduce tea drinking has gone viral on social media, with many doubting the country's serious financial problems can be addressed by cutting out the caffeinated beverage. Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves dropped from around $16bn (Â£13.4bn) in February to less than $10bn (Â£8.3bn) in the first week of June, barely enough to cover the cost of two months of all its imports. Last month officials in Islamabad restricted the import of dozens of non-essential luxury items as part of their bid to protect funds. The economic crisis is a major test for the government of Shehbaz Sharif, who replaced Imran Khan as Pakistan's prime minister in aparliamentary votein April. Shortly after being sworn in, Mr Sharif accused Imran Khan's outgoing government of mismanaging the economy and said putting it back on track would be a huge challenge. Last week his cabinet unveiled a fresh $47bn (Â£39bn) budget aimed at convincing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to restart a stalled $6bn (Â£5bn) bailout programme. The IMF deal wasnegotiated in 2019to ease an economic crisis created by low foreign currency reserve supplies and years of stagnating growth - but was later paused after lenders questioned Pakistan's finances.

Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports.

In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Monkeypox to get a new name, says WHOThere is an urgent need for a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising name, scientists agree.Health","Monkeypox virus particle The World Health Organization says it is working with experts to come up with a new name for monkeypox. It comes after more than30 scientists wrote last week,externalabout the ""urgent need for a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising"" name for the virus and the disease it causes. Continued reference to the virus as African is both inaccurate and discriminatory, they said. Some 1,600 cases of the disease have been recorded globally in recent weeks. While 72 deaths have been reported in countries where monkeypox was already endemic, none have been seen in the newly affected 32 countries, such as the UK. At the latest count, as of 12 June, there were 452 confirmed cases in England, 12 in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland and 4 in Wales. WatchWhat Is Monkeypox?on BBC iPlayer. The World Health Organization says it will hold an emergency meeting next week to determine whether to classify the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern - the highest alarm the UN agency can sound. The only other diseases this has happened for in the past are Swine flu, polio, Ebola, Zika and Covid. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""The outbreak of monkeypox is unusual and concerning. ""For that reason I have decided to convene the Emergency Committee under the international health regulations next week, to assess whether this outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern."" What is monkeypox? Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe. One new name for it that's been suggested by scientists is hMPXV, but we'll need to wait to hear what the WHO thinks of that. Infections are usually mild and the risk to the general population is low, but the UK government has bought stocks of smallpox vaccine to guard against more cases. The virus has been spreading in an unusual manner around the world in recent months. Previous outbreaks have been mainly confined to parts of Africa where rodents - not monkeys - are thought to be the main animal host. The infectioncauses a rashthat looks a bit like chickenpox. The virus can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. It has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by close contact. Anyone with the virus should abstain from sex while they have symptoms. Monkeypox: Handing out health advice without stigma What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?

President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"".

""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"".

Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

This video can not be played EU leaders support Ukraine's membership bid European Union leaders have publicly backed Ukraine's ""immediate"" candidate status to join the bloc, following Russia's invasion of the country. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities.""

French city challenges ban on burkini in top court,"Campaigners persuaded Grenoble's city authority to allow burkinis in public pools last month (file pic) The city of Grenoble has gone to France's highest administrative court to challenge a ban imposed on a new city rule allowing full-body ""burkini"" swimsuits in public pools. Grenoble's decision to authorise all swimwear, including burkinis, sparked a legal battle with the government. Burkinis are worn largely by Muslim women, as a way of preserving modesty and upholding their faith. But religious expression in public life in France can be divisive. Ahead of Tuesday's court case, Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin described Grenoble city council's swimwear policy as an ""unacceptable provocation"" that was contrary to French secular values. Last month, a local court in Grenoble suspended the policy on the grounds that it seriously undermined the principle of neutrality in public services. The ban on burkinis in state-run pools is also advocated for reasons of hygiene. Men are normally obliged to wear tight-fitting swimming trunks - another rule that Grenoble has decided to overturn. The city council has also permitted men to use Bermuda shorts, which are not usually allowed. A burkini is a full-body swimsuit that covers everything except the face, hands and feet The name is a mix of the words ""burka"" and ""bikini"" Unlike burkas, burkinis leave the face free Burkinis are marketed to Muslim women as a way for them to swim in public while adhering to strict modesty edicts French opposition to the burkini stretches as far back as 2016, when several local municipalities attempted to outlaw it on beaches for violating the country's strict separation between religion and the state. State officials are not allowed to wear religious emblems at work, but the mayor of Grenoble, Eric Piolle, argues that this should not stop users of public services, such as swimming pools, from dressing as they wish. His administration's moves to relax the swimwear rules are opposed by the national government, which has invoked a law passed last year to combat ""Islamist separatism"". The row has now reached the Council of State, which has previouslyruled against a burkini banelsewhere in France. Critics of the burkini see it as offering a separatist vision of French society and argue that allowing it also puts pressure on Muslim women to wear it. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has condemned the burkini as ""clothing of Islamist propaganda"". However, those in favour of allowing it say women should have the choice to keep their bodies covered if they want to and that this does not imply religious extremism. The court is due to deliver its ruling in the coming days.

Warning air travel staff issues to last for summer,"UK airlines have been told to cancel flights they can't deliver this summer to stop a rerun of May's travel chaos. The government and the aviation regulator wrote to carriers on Tuesday telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable"". They added that earlier cancellations were ""better"" than axing flights at the last minute. It comes after tens of thousands of passengers have been affected by cancellations and delays at airports. The problem was particularly bad during Easter and last month's half-term school holiday, and British Airways, TUI and Easyjet have apologised. Why are so many flights being cancelled? Cancelled flights fuel summer holiday fears Children and teachers stuck abroad as term starts Staff shortages have been blamed, after thousands of airline jobs were cut during the pandemic and have yet to be replaced despite a spike in post-pandemic travel demand. In their joint letter, the Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority set out five ""specific expectations"" for the sector. They wrote: ""We think it's important that each airline reviews afresh its plans for the remainder of the summer season until the end of September to develop a schedule that is deliverable. ""Your schedules must be based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available, and should be resilient for the unplanned and inevitable operational challenges that you will face. ""While cancellations at any time are a regrettable inconvenience to passengers, it is our view that cancellations at the earliest possibility to deliver a more robust schedule are better for consumers than late notice on-the-day cancellations."" EasyJet is one of the airlines to have cancelled flights The letter stated that airlines must ""keep consumers informed"" about their rights during disruption, such as having ""sufficiently staffed call centres and user-friendly digital channels"". It also urged airlines, ground handlers, air traffic control and the Border Force work more closely to try to prevent problems. Airlines and unions told MPs on the Commons Business Committee on Tuesday that the staffing shortages blighting the industry were likely to persist this summer. Oliver Richardson, national officer for civil air transport at the Unite union, told MPs it was unlikely the situation would be fixed ""unless we work together"". Representatives from BA, Easyjet and ground handling firm Swissport said they also faced long delays to get security clearance for new staff. Swissport's UK boss, Jude Winstanley, said it had hired 3,000 people since the start of the year, but it was taking up to 90 days to get them a full airside pass due to the referencing process. According to the CAA, up to 4% of UK flights were cancelled during half term and the Platinum Jubilee weekend - up from the usual rate of 1%. Boss Richard Moriarty called the situation distressing and unacceptable, adding that the industry needed to get a grip - although he said it was ""not solely a UK specific issue"". There have been calls for EU aviation workers to be added to the government's shortage occupation list, but aviation minister Robert Courts denied this would help. He told the committee that EU HGV drivers - another industry facing shortages - had been offered up to 5,000 visas to fill gaps in the UK, and only 27 had come forward. ""If there were spare workers in Europe they would be in Schiphol [Amsterdam airport],"" he said. Do you work in the aviation industry? Are you a passenger affected?

Dealer guilty of killing teen after Ecstasy saleJames McCairn sold crystal MDMA to 14-year-old Cerys Reeve after advertising on Snapchat.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Cerys Reeve died after taking the drug during a sleepover at a friend's house A teenage drug dealer has been convicted of killing a 14-year-old girl after he supplied her with the drug Ecstasy. James McCairn, 18, sold crystal MDMA to Cerys Reeve after advertising his illegal trade on Snapchat. The young dancer died after taking the drug during a sleepover at a friend's house in Greenock in July 2020. First offender McCairn was found guilty of culpable homicide following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Prosecutors said he had ""recklessly and unlawfully"" given the deadly class A drug to Cerys at his home in Greenock. McCairn was also found guilty of supplying Ecstasy to other young people in the town between November 2019 and July 2020. James McCairn advertised his illegal trade on Snapchat His QC had asked for McCairn, who was only 16 at the time of the death, to remain on bail pending sentencing next month. But judge John McCormick remanded him custody, saying his commercial drug dealing had resulted in tragic consequences. The trial heard how McCairn had been advertising pills for sale on the morning of 13 July 2020. Cerys had been at a friend's house before going to McCairn's to purchase MDMA. She returned and mixed the powder into a cup of juice before taking it. When her friend came back into the room after making a toastie, Cerys was described as ""acting really weird"". This initially included her not being able to control her arms and kicking items off a window ledge. The witness went on to describe Cerys as grunting, sweating and falling off the bed, which woke the girl's mother. She then started burning up and suffered a seizure. A 999 call was immediately made and the teenager was taken to Inverclyde Royal Hospital. Cerys was described as ""rigid all over"" and put on a ventilator. The talented dancer never recovered and was pronounced dead at 0808. The cause of death was ""MDMA toxicity"". In his closing speech to the jury, prosecutor Graeme Jessop said: ""McCairn just did not care about Cerys's age or vulnerability. ""All he cared about at the time was selling his drugs for profit regardless of the circumstances."" After the verdict, Mr Jessop told Judge McCormick of the heartbreak Cerys's family had suffered. The advocate depute added: ""As we have heard, Cerys Reeve was 14 and lived in Port Glasgow with her parents. ""She was the only child to her mother. She has an older half sister. ""She was at school in Port Glasgow and was due to start fourth year when she died. ""Her parents elected not to attend court proceedings due to the upset and distress at their daughter's death.""

Backlash after electric car grants axed,"Motoring and car industry groups have criticised the government's decision to end grants worth Â£1,500 towards buying electric cars. The Department for Transport said the plug-in subsidy scheme was being closed with immediate effect. It said funding would now be ""refocussed"" towards improving electric vehicle charging. But the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the move ""sends the wrong message"". The RAC motoring group also warned the decision could ""stifle"" the ambition to shift most people into electric cars. Motoring groups criticise electric car grant cut Should I buy an electric vehicle? Fee to use electric car charging points considered The grant scheme, which first started in 2011, was designed to make buying new electric vehicles more affordable by providing a discount. The amount that drivers could claimwas reduced from Â£2,500 to Â£1,500 in December. Electric cars priced under Â£32,000 were eligible. The scheme has been used to buy nearly 500,000 cars over the past decade. The Department for Transport said funding would now be ""refocussed"" towards the main barriers to the electric vehicle transition, such as public charging, and supporting the purchase of electric vans, taxis and motorcycles. Transport Minister Trudy Harrison said:â¯""Having successfully kickstarted the electric car market, we now want to use Plug-in Grants to match that success across other vehicle types, from taxis to delivery vans and everything in between, to help make the switch to zero emission travel cheaper and easier.""â¯ The UK is due to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, which represents carmakers, said the decision to scrap the grant ""sends the wrong message to motorists and to an industry which remains committed to government's net zero ambition"". He said the government's continued support for new electric van, taxi and adapted vehicle buyers was welcome, but the UK was ""now the only major European market to have zero upfront purchase incentives for EV car buyers yet the most ambitious plans for uptake"". Mr Hawes also said that the decision came at the worst possible time because the sector was not yet in recovery, and all manufacturers were ""about to be mandated to sell significantly more EVs than current demand indicates"". He called for the government to compel massive investment in the charging network quickly, at a scale beyond anything so far announced, if targets were to be hit. If you want to change the behaviour of businesses or consumers, you can offer them a carrot - or beat them with a stick. In the past, the government has used a carrot to promote the sale of electric cars. The plug-in grant was meant to bring the price of an EV or plug-in hybrid closer to that of a conventional car. As EV sales have grown, the government has brought the value of the grant down, and limited its scope. Now it will no longer be available for cars at all - though sales of electric vans, taxis and motorbikes will be subsidised. Electric company cars will still have tax benefits as well. Now, here comes the stick: the government is currently preparing plans to bring in a ""zero emissions vehicle mandate"". It will in effect force manufacturers to ensure that a set proportion of the cars they sell are electric. If they fail, they will be fined. So rather than subsidising electric car sales, the government will be penalising carmakers who don't sell enough of them. This will put the responsibility for expanding EV sales firmly on the shoulders of the industry. Right now, EV sales offer a glimmer of light for a sector that is in the throes of a deep crisis. Small wonder the removal of the grant has prompted groans of frustration from the industry. The RAC's head of policy, Nicholas Lyes, said: ""We're disappointed the government has chosen to end the grant at this point. If costs remain too high, the ambition of getting most people into electric cars will be stifled."" AA president Edmund King said the plug-in grant had been essential for many drivers making the switch from petrol and diesel. ""The plug has been pulled at the wrong time on this important grant before many users, still waiting for delayed EVs due to global shortages, have made the change,"" he said. ""With record prices at the pumps and households budgets already stretched, removing the last incentive to go electric could stall this important move to electrification."" However, the Clean Cities Campaign welcomed the move. ""We don't need to subsidise industry any longer on this, they know what to do,"" said its UK head, Oliver Lord. ""Build electric cars competitively or fade away. Public money should instead be put towards a scrappage scheme to help people on low incomes switch out of polluting vehicles, whether going electric or car free."" The Department for Transport said all existing applications for the plug-in grant would continue to be honoured. Where a car has been sold in the two working days prior to the announcement, but an application for the grant from dealerships has not yet been made, the sale will also still qualify for the grant.â¯ Motoring groups criticise electric car grant cut Should I buy an electric vehicle?

"EU set for legal action over UK Brexit deal changesBrussels says altering the Northern Ireland Protocol breaks international law, but the UK disputes this.UK PoliticsComments","The EU is expected to launch legal action against the UK government on Wednesday over its decision to scrap some post-Brexit trade arrangements. Ministers insist current checks on some goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland must end to avoid harm to the peace process. They published a parliamentary bill on Monday aimed at overriding parts of the deal signed with the EU in 2020. But Brussels says going back on the arrangement breaks international law. The Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. This prevents a hard border with the Republic of Ireland - including checks there on the movement of people and goods - which both the UK and EU want to avoid in order to ensure peace is maintained. UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Europe is prepping for a trade war no-one wants But instead it means checks on some goods arriving into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK. That is opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland who argue it creates a trade border in the Irish Sea and could lead to the break-up of the UK. Followingelections in Northern Ireland last month, the Democratic Unionist Party is refusing to serve in a power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein until the protocol is changed. But other parties in Northern Ireland - including Sinn Fein, the Alliance Party and the SDLP - accept the deal as it stands. The UK government says it would prefer to agree changes with the EU, rather than act alone in making changes to the protocol. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We've been acting in good faith in these negotiations, but the fundamental issues that are affecting political stability in Northern Ireland are in the text of the protocol and what we need is the EU to agree to change the text of the protocol. ""Otherwise the negotiations won't succeed. We've reached a dead end, because we can't change those core issues around customs and around VAT that are losing us the consent of the unionist community in Northern Ireland."" At the centre of the UK government's plan are measures they say would ease the impact on businesses - set out in the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill - including the concept of ""green lanes"" and ""red lanes"" for trade. This would involve: Goods coming from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) into Northern Ireland and which are staying there using the green lane - meaning no checks and minimal paperwork Goods moving from Great Britain through Northern into Ireland or the wider European Union would using the red lane - that is, continuing to be checked at ports in Northern Ireland. The UK also wants the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ) to have no future role in deciding disputes involving the protocol, with an independent arbiter overseeing sitting in judgement instead. In response, the EU has indicated it will restartlegal action it began in March last year,,externalwhen it accused the UK of delaying, without consultation, the enforcement of parts of the protocol relating to customs checks. It could go further by taking the UK to the ECJ over claims it did too little to set up border control posts and share data with the EU. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol row about? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed The European Commission is expected to sign off the next legal steps at its meeting on Wednesday, while many senior EU figures have spoken out against the UK's plan to rewrite parts of the protocol. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Today: ""This is not consistent with international law and the British government's obligations under international law, and that will be shown in time."" He added that ""effectively what they will be doing is collapsing the protocol"" and removing protections against ""the severe disruption of Brexit on the island of Ireland"". ""Britain has taken a very regrettable decision that goes against all the agreements between the EU and Britain,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. ""It is also unjustified because the European Commission made many pragmatic proposals."" Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Boris Johnson's government to ""continue negotiations with the EU in good faith"". Businesses which import Great Britain goods to Northern Ireland have experienced difficulties with the protocol as the checks and controls add cost and complexity. Food and horticulture importers have faced the greatest problems, as those goods face the most onerous controls. However, exporters have benefited because unlike other parts of the UK they have maintained frictionless access to EU markets.

Grenfell victims remembered at memorial service,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had earlier met those affected by the disaster in a private meeting The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have joined bereaved families and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire to mark its fifth anniversary. Seventy-two people were killed by the blaze in North Kensington, west London, on 14 June 2017. The couple joined mourners at the base of the tower for a special service having earlier met several during a private meeting. A 72-second silence was observed by attendees, concluding with applause. The couple placed a wreath during the service The attendance of the duke and duchess was ""huge"" for the community, a local resident said. Muna Hussain, whose children went to the same school as five of those who died, said: ""I was glad to see at least they know how we are feeling as a community and they shared that feeling. ""It makes me very happy. It's massive, it's huge for us. It makes you feel better."" Stormzy - who has long offered his support to those affected by the disaster - was also at the event Some watched the service on big screens A silent two-mile march was held after the service During the service, actor Tim Downie said: ""At today's service we honour the 72 innocent men, women and children, mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters, sisters, brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces and friends who needlessly lost their lives. ""We must never forget them and carry them with us forever in our hearts."" Many mourners wore green scarves and clothing to match the green hearts that adorn the wall below the tower and which have become a symbol of the tragedy. Floral tributes and personal notes have been left beside the wall, including a ""72"" made of white flowers. Afterwards, several hundred people carried out a two-mile walk around the area. Dozens of firefighters lined the streets, with many holding green hearts reading ""Grenfell"", and onlookers applauded as the mourners passed. WatchGrenfell: Has Anything Changed?on iPlayer. A memorial service for the 72 people killed in the fire took place at 11:00 at Westminster Abbey Earlier, a multi-faith memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It began with the names of the victims being read out followed by a reply of ""forever in our hearts"" from the congregation. Former prime minister Theresa May, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Housing Secretary Michael Gove were among those in the congregation. People placed white roses in memory of the victims Theresa May, who was prime minister when the fire happened, spoke to volunteers ahead of the memorial service Journalist Jon Snow, who was invited to speak at the service, said: ""Grenfell, set in the richest borough in Britain, speaks to the grotesque inequality with which our society has been riven. ""We must now confront the issues raised by the Grenfell disaster."" Lawyer Imran Khan, who also addressed the congregation, said: ""For the residents of Grenfell, their home wasn't their castle, it was their deathbed."" The names of each of the 72 victims of the Grenfell Tower fire were read out BBC News correspondent Nick Johnson From scarves and flowers, to altar cloths and decorations, Westminster Abbey was adorned in green as hundreds gathered for this memorial service to remember those who lost their lives on this day five years ago. At the very heart of the service was a sense of unity and remembrance. Members of the congregation held hands, comforting those who were weeping, as the names of each of the 72 victims were read out. We heard from Marlene Anderson. Her father Ray ""Moses"" Bernard lost his life in the fire. His daughter spoke of her trauma and how she and other family members often relive that night. Perhaps the loudest round of applause came after lawyer Imran Khan's speech. He spoke of his disbelief over a lack of criminal charges and described the public inquiry into the fire as ineffective. As the congregation filed out of the Abbey, 72 candles were left flickering on the altar, a reminder that the Grenfell victims will never be forgotten. Elsewhere in the capital, a 72-second silence was observed at 14:00 at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush. People observed a 72-second silence at the Grenfell memorial wall in the nearby Westfield shopping centre Firefighters will provide a guard of honour as survivors and the bereaved walk from Grenfell Tower Natasha Elcock, chairwoman of campaign group Grenfell United, said this week would be difficult for all of those affected. ""For many of us the events five years ago are still so raw in our minds and our losses remain heavy in our hearts,"" she said. Grenfell: Why are families still waiting for justice?

""We don't want them to just say 'Never forget', we want it cemented in some way,"" she added.

While a criminal investigation into the disaster is under way, the Met Police has said no prosecutions will be brought until thepublic inquiry,externalis finished and its findings are published. So far, fewer than half of the recommendations from the inquiry have been adopted into law, according to the Home Office.

Previously, the ban appliedonly to buildings higher than 11m (36ft). The government first received data demonstrating thedanger of polyethylene-cored cladding in 2002. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) said it was taking steps to ensure buildings were safer.

"Aviation staff shortages set to continue, MPs told","UK airlines have been told to cancel flights they can't deliver this summer to stop a rerun of May's travel chaos. The government and the aviation regulator wrote to carriers on Tuesday telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable"". They added that earlier cancellations were ""better"" than axing flights at the last minute. It comes after tens of thousands of passengers have been affected by cancellations and delays at airports. The problem was particularly bad during Easter and last month's half-term school holiday, and British Airways, TUI and Easyjet have apologised. Why are so many flights being cancelled? Cancelled flights fuel summer holiday fears Children and teachers stuck abroad as term starts Staff shortages have been blamed, after thousands of airline jobs were cut during the pandemic and have yet to be replaced despite a spike in post-pandemic travel demand. In their joint letter, the Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority set out five ""specific expectations"" for the sector. They wrote: ""We think it's important that each airline reviews afresh its plans for the remainder of the summer season until the end of September to develop a schedule that is deliverable. ""Your schedules must be based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available, and should be resilient for the unplanned and inevitable operational challenges that you will face. ""While cancellations at any time are a regrettable inconvenience to passengers, it is our view that cancellations at the earliest possibility to deliver a more robust schedule are better for consumers than late notice on-the-day cancellations."" EasyJet is one of the airlines to have cancelled flights The letter stated that airlines must ""keep consumers informed"" about their rights during disruption, such as having ""sufficiently staffed call centres and user-friendly digital channels"". It also urged airlines, ground handlers, air traffic control and the Border Force work more closely to try to prevent problems. Airlines and unions told MPs on the Commons Business Committee on Tuesday that the staffing shortages blighting the industry were likely to persist this summer. Oliver Richardson, national officer for civil air transport at the Unite union, told MPs it was unlikely the situation would be fixed ""unless we work together"". Representatives from BA, Easyjet and ground handling firm Swissport said they also faced long delays to get security clearance for new staff. Swissport's UK boss, Jude Winstanley, said it had hired 3,000 people since the start of the year, but it was taking up to 90 days to get them a full airside pass due to the referencing process. According to the CAA, up to 4% of UK flights were cancelled during half term and the Platinum Jubilee weekend - up from the usual rate of 1%. Boss Richard Moriarty called the situation distressing and unacceptable, adding that the industry needed to get a grip - although he said it was ""not solely a UK specific issue"". There have been calls for EU aviation workers to be added to the government's shortage occupation list, but aviation minister Robert Courts denied this would help. He told the committee that EU HGV drivers - another industry facing shortages - had been offered up to 5,000 visas to fill gaps in the UK, and only 27 had come forward. ""If there were spare workers in Europe they would be in Schiphol [Amsterdam airport],"" he said. Do you work in the aviation industry? Are you a passenger affected?

LiveLiveScotland can navigate a legal independence vote - Sturgeon19 minutes ago,"Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon launches a fresh independence campaign and says she ""stands ready"" to negotiate with PM Boris Johnson to hold a second referendum When the country held the first vote in 2014 its go-ahead was possible because the UK government granted the necessary power, called a Section 30 order However, in the near eight years that have passed two Conservative prime ministers - Theresa May and Mr Johnson - have refused to give that order a second time Ms Sturgeon now says she is confident that Scotland can navigate towards a legal independence vote and the detail of how that could be done would be presented to the Scottish Parliament ""very soon"" In response to the new campaign, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""The UK government's position is that now is not the time to be talking about another referendum."" Supporters of the Union have accused the Scottish government of being obsessed with independence BBC Scotland News Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That's all from our live page team today. Have a lovely afternoon. Professor Sir John Curtice Professor Sir John Curtice tells BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme: ""If you take the last half dozen polls, they on average point to Yes 48, No 52."" The political scientist says the polls have pointed to 50:50 with ""Yes"" or ""No"" slightly ahead since the Spring of 2019. We've now had about three years of Scotland basically being divided down the middle."" John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Things seem narrower now than in 2014, he says. He explains that those in favour of independence want a referendum before 2026 although not all would move as fast as as that. Both sides need to campaign, because at the moment neither side in the argument can be sure of winning."" John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Having released the first of six papers on the new independence push -""Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external- Ms Sturgeon says there is no schedule for when the other papers will be published ""We haven't determined or decided yet the precise order and sequencing and dates for the subsequent papers,"" she says. The papers will be released ""fairly steadily"" over the months in the latter part of this year, Ms Sturgeon adds. The other papers are expected to look at a number of areas including:  In response to a question about where oil will feature in the campaign Ms Sturgeon points out the importance of a just transition from oil and gas. Ms Sturgeon explains the joint position of herself and Patrick Harvie which is ""we have to accelerate the move away from fossil fuels"". ""There are massive economic advantages in that transition,"" she adds. Patrick Harvie says the position of the Scottish government has changed since 2014. The reality of how fast the transition must be undertaken has become clear, he adds. ""We can make that change in a fair as well as a fast way."" Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond were on the campaign trail together in 2014 The first minister tells the press conference that the campaign for independence will be a broad church and ""that is one of it's strengths"" because independence is about democracy. Asked if she would share a platform with former first minister Alex Salmond, she said: ""That probably qualifies as one of the least important questions of the entire independence debate. ""It's not about me, it's not about Alex Salmond. With the greatest of respect, it is not even about Patrick Harvie - it's about the future of Scotland."" Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond together led the last independence campaign in 2014 but they fell out after sexual misconduct allegations were made against the former first minister. Mr Salmond strongly denied the allegations and was cleared of 13 charges in court. Conclusion The Scottish government's paper concludes with an acknowledgement that an independent Scotland could not be transformed to match the success of the comparator countries overnight. But it says the comparator country models - especially the Nordic countries - illustrate the range of choices that would be available to an independent Scotland able to pursue different policies from those adopted by Westminster over many years. Independence by itself will not guarantee improved performance, it says. It adds that it welcomes a national debate about how an independent country can create a wealthier, happier and fairer Scotland. Read it in full,external UK model The Scottish government paper goes on to say that commentators have attributed the UK's relatively weak productivity and relatively high income inequality to the short-termism resulting from the UK's distinct approach to ownership and governance, the failure to develop effective institutions and lack of commitment to industrial strategy. Different models The second section of the Scottish government paper seeks to highlight some of the factors that help explain the better performance of the comparator countries relative to the UK. Asked by the Financial Times whether losing an independence referendum would write off any prospect of a split in the union forever, Ms Sturgeon laughs and says the moral of the story is that ""we don't lose it, and we don't intend to"". ""I am as certain as it is possible to be that at the next time of asking people in Scotland will not miss the opportunity to vote for independence,"" the first minister says. She adds that polls showing a 50/50 split in support were a ""very, very good starting point"" for the campaign. First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has launched the first in a series of papers which she says will set
out and debate the case for Scotland's independence. The first paper is entitled:""Independence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external It looks at 10 comparator countries - Denmark, Sweden, Finland,
Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands -
and compares the UK's performance across a range of economic and social
indicators. Ms Sturgeon said these independent countries were a similar size
to Scotland but were wealthier, fairer and more productive than the UK. Comparisons
to the UK Asked by a reporter from Sky News why voters should believe there would be any better outcomes for people in an independent Scotland, the first minister said Scotland was ""seeing real progress, coupled with real challenge, across a range of the responsibilities we have under our control right now"". People have to decide whether they trust a democratically elected government in Scotland, of whatever party, over a UK government to make decisions for them, Ms Sturgeon says. ""Scrutiny is not something that has not been something that has been in short supply in Scotland,"" she adds.

Of course there is plenty of opposition to, and concern about, a second independence referendum but it remains an inescapable fact that in last year's elections to the Scottish Parliament voters returned a majority of MSPs, both SNP and Green, who had pledged to hold one. When this happened in 2011, there was a referendum. If that was the accepted trigger then, why is it not the trigger now?
That is primarily a question for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The SNPâs argument is that if his Conservative party previously regarded a majority at Holyrood as a mandate for a poll, why is he thwarting the will of Scotlandâs voters now? Having said that, First Minister
Nicola Sturgeon must operate in the world as she finds it not as she wants it
to be and at todayâs news conference the SNP leader simply did not or could not
detail the alternative path she intends to follow if Mr Johnson persists in his
refusal. There are also difficult questions
for both Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson about the ""why"" as well as the
""how"" of independence. Among those for supporters of
independence, is it sensible to ditch nuclear weapons with a belligerent Russia
at large? Can green energy really replace oil as the engine of the Scottish
economy? If leaving the European Union has damaged the UK, why wouldnât leaving
an even older and more entrenched union be much worse for Scotland? For supporters of the union,
arenât the comparisons with other small European nations set out in todayâs
paper an indictment of British failure? Why has the UK, and Scotland within it,
performed so poorly on GDP, income inequality, poverty, productivity and other
indicators set out in the 71-page document? In 2014 the prospectus for an
independent Scotland was subject to rigorous and detailed scrutiny. Ms
Sturgeonâs aim with these papers is to ensure the same scrutiny is applied to
the UK. In response to the launch of the new independence campaign, Downing Street has again rejected the case for another referendum. The prime minister's official spokesman told Press Association: ""The UK government's position is that now is not the time to be talking about another referendum. """"We are confident that the people of Scotland want and expect their governments to be working together to focus on issues like the global cost-of-living challenges, like war in Europe and the issues that matter to their families and their communities."" Ciaran Jenkins, the Scotland correspondent for Channel 4 News, says the first minister wants to be in the EU. He asks if Ms Sturgeon agrees with every reputable expert who says there will be checks on goods going from England and Wales to Scotland and there will be a trade border between England and Scotland. The first minister says if Scotland is in the single market there will be issues, there will be regulatory and customs requirements. She says these challenges can be managed in a way that does not affect our businesses and the benefits outweigh them. The first minister is asked about the ""inevitable"" hard border between Scotland and England, should an independent Scotland join the EU. She says she will ""confront the implications of Brexit"" in another of the six papers they are releasing. ""The UK government is in a deep mess over the Northern Ireland protocol,"" she add. Scotland would remain within the common travel area but would have to work out how to operate within the market in a way that isn't damaging to the south of Scotland or businesses, she adds. The first minister says they want to avoid replicating the UK's difficulties caused by a ""lack of being honest"" and lack of planning.

"Sturgeon unveils case for Scottish independenceScotland's first minister says her government has an ""indisputable mandate"" for another referendum.","This video can not be played Scotland must ""forge a way forward"" to a referendum, without section 30 order ""if necessary"", Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has unveiled what she called a ""refreshed"" case for independence. She told a press conference in Edinburgh that her government had an ""indisputable mandate"" for a second independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon was launchingthe first of a series of papers setting out the case to break away from the UK,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the 2014 referendum result should be respected. And opposition parties accused the Scottish government of being obsessed with independence. The first minister said it was now time to set out ""a different and better vision"" for Scotland. Look back at Nicola Sturgeon's campaign launch Will there be a Scottish independence referendum? At a glance: Scottish government independence paper She said it was time to talk abut independence and then to make that choice. Ms Sturgeon insisted she won last May's election with a ""clear commitment to give the people of Scotland the choice of becoming an independent country"", and that Holyrood had a ""decisive majority"" of MSPs in favour of independence. ""The Scottish Parliament therefore has an indisputable democratic mandate,"" she added. Nicola Sturgeon and Patrick Harvie at the launch of the new paper However, she conceded that a future referendum faced challenges, including what she described as an issue of process. She said Holyrood's power to hold a vote was ""contested"". If a referendum bill was introduced without Westminster agreement it could be challenged in the courts. Before the 2014 referendum, the Scottish government struck an agreement with the UK government which transferred authority on a temporary basis to Holyrood. This was called a section 30 order. The UK government has so far shown no indication that it would be willing to do so again. Ms Sturgeon said any referendum ""must be lawful"", and that only parties opposed to independence would benefit from doubt about the process. ""If this UK government had any respect at all for democracy, the issue of legality would be put beyond doubt, as in 2014,"" she added. An agreement was reached between the Scottish and UK governments ahead of the 2014 referendum, She said she had made clear to Boris Johnson that she was ""ready to discuss the terms of such an order at any time"". The first minister said her government had a mandate for another referendum, adding: ""If we are to uphold democracy here in Scotland, we must forge a way forward if necessary without a section 30 order."" An update on the Scottish government's plans for holding a referendum would follow soon, she added. Ms Sturgeon said the independence papers would set the scene for the debate about Scotland's future in the UK. She said they would cover how Scotland can benefit from the ""massive opportunities"" independence would present, but also address the challenges and not shy away from tough questions. She said independence would put ""the levers that determine success into our own hands"", and away from Westminster - which was taking Scotland ""in the wrong direction"". The first paper - calledIndependence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?,external- makes comparisons between Scotland and other European countries - all of which Ms Sturgeon said were independent, wealthier and fairer than the UK. Subsequent papers will look at a areas including currency, tax and spend, defence, social security and pensions, and EU membership and trade. Ms Sturgeon was joined at the press conference by Patrick Harvie, the co-leader of the Scottish Green Party and a member of the Scottish cabinet. The SNP and the Greens are both pro-independence and struck a power sharing arrangement at Holyrood after last year's election. Mr Harvie said Scotland ""could chart a different future"" with independence and set out a vision for a greener, fairer and more prosperous Scotland. Boris Johnson said the 2014 result should be respected. He said the UK government should focus on the economy and Covid recovery, adding: ""That's the focus of the government. We're working with our friends in the Scottish government, in the Scottish administration, on those issues."" At Holyrood, the presiding officer stopped a minister from making a statement to MSPson Tuesday afternoon because the details had already been released to the media. Alison Johnstone said the ""benefits of independence"" announcement should have been made in the chamber first ""as a matter of courtesy and respect to the parliament"". She skipped instead to response from Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who said energy was being wasted on the wrong priorities. He said: ""Pushing for another divisive referendum... is the wrong priority, at the worst possible time."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said Ms Sturgeon's speech was ""a disappointing return to the politics of the past"", adding that the majority were opposed to independence. He said the first minister should not ""turn her back"" on important issues in order to ""focus on her own obsession"" with independence. Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said the first minister ""must be wired to the moon if she thinks that breaking up the UK is the priority for people"". Why is this renewed push for independence happening?The answer is simple. The people of Scotland voted for it. Of course there is plenty of opposition to, and concern about, a second independence referendum but it remains an inescapable fact that in last year's elections to the Scottish Parliament voters returned a majority of MSPs, both SNP and Green, who had pledged to hold one.

The question will persist unless and until a) independence actually happens or b) the public tire of the political parties that promote it. Neither of those possibilities seem very likely anytime soon and so the debate continues. It was largely put on hold during the pandemic but when the SNP won the Holyrood election in 2021, they did so having promised another referendum.

John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Having released the first of six papers on the new independence push -""Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external- Ms Sturgeon says there is no schedule for when the other papers will be published ""We haven't determined or decided yet the precise order and sequencing and dates for the subsequent papers,"" she says. The papers will be released ""fairly steadily"" over the months in the latter part of this year, Ms Sturgeon adds. The other papers are expected to look at a number of areas including:  In response to a question about where oil will feature in the campaign Ms Sturgeon points out the importance of a just transition from oil and gas. Ms Sturgeon explains the joint position of herself and Patrick Harvie which is ""we have to accelerate the move away from fossil fuels"". ""There are massive economic advantages in that transition,"" she adds. Patrick Harvie says the position of the Scottish government has changed since 2014. The reality of how fast the transition must be undertaken has become clear, he adds. ""We can make that change in a fair as well as a fast way."" Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond were on the campaign trail together in 2014 The first minister tells the press conference that the campaign for independence will be a broad church and ""that is one of it's strengths"" because independence is about democracy. Asked if she would share a platform with former first minister Alex Salmond, she said: ""That probably qualifies as one of the least important questions of the entire independence debate. ""It's not about me, it's not about Alex Salmond. With the greatest of respect, it is not even about Patrick Harvie - it's about the future of Scotland."" Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond together led the last independence campaign in 2014 but they fell out after sexual misconduct allegations were made against the former first minister. Mr Salmond strongly denied the allegations and was cleared of 13 charges in court. Conclusion The Scottish government's paper concludes with an acknowledgement that an independent Scotland could not be transformed to match the success of the comparator countries overnight. But it says the comparator country models - especially the Nordic countries - illustrate the range of choices that would be available to an independent Scotland able to pursue different policies from those adopted by Westminster over many years. Independence by itself will not guarantee improved performance, it says. It adds that it welcomes a national debate about how an independent country can create a wealthier, happier and fairer Scotland. Read it in full,external UK model The Scottish government paper goes on to say that commentators have attributed the UK's relatively weak productivity and relatively high income inequality to the short-termism resulting from the UK's distinct approach to ownership and governance, the failure to develop effective institutions and lack of commitment to industrial strategy. Different models The second section of the Scottish government paper seeks to highlight some of the factors that help explain the better performance of the comparator countries relative to the UK. Asked by the Financial Times whether losing an independence referendum would write off any prospect of a split in the union forever, Ms Sturgeon laughs and says the moral of the story is that ""we don't lose it, and we don't intend to"". ""I am as certain as it is possible to be that at the next time of asking people in Scotland will not miss the opportunity to vote for independence,"" the first minister says. She adds that polls showing a 50/50 split in support were a ""very, very good starting point"" for the campaign. First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has launched the first in a series of papers which she says will set
out and debate the case for Scotland's independence. The first paper is entitled:""Independence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external It looks at 10 comparator countries - Denmark, Sweden, Finland,
Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands -
and compares the UK's performance across a range of economic and social
indicators. Ms Sturgeon said these independent countries were a similar size
to Scotland but were wealthier, fairer and more productive than the UK. Comparisons
to the UK Asked by a reporter from Sky News why voters should believe there would be any better outcomes for people in an independent Scotland, the first minister said Scotland was ""seeing real progress, coupled with real challenge, across a range of the responsibilities we have under our control right now"". People have to decide whether they trust a democratically elected government in Scotland, of whatever party, over a UK government to make decisions for them, Ms Sturgeon says. ""Scrutiny is not something that has not been something that has been in short supply in Scotland,"" she adds. ""I've been first minister for less than eight years, I've fought eight elections in that time and my party has won all of them. ""The trust in the party that leads the Scottish government has been demonstrated.""

Backlash after electric car grants axedMotoring and car industry groups criticise the government's decision to end the plug-in subsidy scheme.,"Motoring and car industry groups have criticised the government's decision to end grants worth Â£1,500 towards buying electric cars. The Department for Transport said the plug-in subsidy scheme was being closed with immediate effect. It said funding would now be ""refocussed"" towards improving electric vehicle charging. But the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the move ""sends the wrong message"". The RAC motoring group also warned the decision could ""stifle"" the ambition to shift most people into electric cars. Motoring groups criticise electric car grant cut Should I buy an electric vehicle? Fee to use electric car charging points considered The grant scheme, which first started in 2011, was designed to make buying new electric vehicles more affordable by providing a discount. The amount that drivers could claimwas reduced from Â£2,500 to Â£1,500 in December. Electric cars priced under Â£32,000 were eligible. The scheme has been used to buy nearly 500,000 cars over the past decade. The Department for Transport said funding would now be ""refocussed"" towards the main barriers to the electric vehicle transition, such as public charging, and supporting the purchase of electric vans, taxis and motorcycles. Transport Minister Trudy Harrison said:â¯""Having successfully kickstarted the electric car market, we now want to use Plug-in Grants to match that success across other vehicle types, from taxis to delivery vans and everything in between, to help make the switch to zero emission travel cheaper and easier.""â¯ The UK is due to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, which represents carmakers, said the decision to scrap the grant ""sends the wrong message to motorists and to an industry which remains committed to government's net zero ambition"". He said the government's continued support for new electric van, taxi and adapted vehicle buyers was welcome, but the UK was ""now the only major European market to have zero upfront purchase incentives for EV car buyers yet the most ambitious plans for uptake"". Mr Hawes also said that the decision came at the worst possible time because the sector was not yet in recovery, and all manufacturers were ""about to be mandated to sell significantly more EVs than current demand indicates"". He called for the government to compel massive investment in the charging network quickly, at a scale beyond anything so far announced, if targets were to be hit. If you want to change the behaviour of businesses or consumers, you can offer them a carrot - or beat them with a stick. In the past, the government has used a carrot to promote the sale of electric cars. The plug-in grant was meant to bring the price of an EV or plug-in hybrid closer to that of a conventional car. As EV sales have grown, the government has brought the value of the grant down, and limited its scope. Now it will no longer be available for cars at all - though sales of electric vans, taxis and motorbikes will be subsidised. Electric company cars will still have tax benefits as well. Now, here comes the stick: the government is currently preparing plans to bring in a ""zero emissions vehicle mandate"". It will in effect force manufacturers to ensure that a set proportion of the cars they sell are electric. If they fail, they will be fined. So rather than subsidising electric car sales, the government will be penalising carmakers who don't sell enough of them. This will put the responsibility for expanding EV sales firmly on the shoulders of the industry. Right now, EV sales offer a glimmer of light for a sector that is in the throes of a deep crisis. Small wonder the removal of the grant has prompted groans of frustration from the industry. The RAC's head of policy, Nicholas Lyes, said: ""We're disappointed the government has chosen to end the grant at this point. If costs remain too high, the ambition of getting most people into electric cars will be stifled."" AA president Edmund King said the plug-in grant had been essential for many drivers making the switch from petrol and diesel. ""The plug has been pulled at the wrong time on this important grant before many users, still waiting for delayed EVs due to global shortages, have made the change,"" he said. ""With record prices at the pumps and households budgets already stretched, removing the last incentive to go electric could stall this important move to electrification."" However, the Clean Cities Campaign welcomed the move. ""We don't need to subsidise industry any longer on this, they know what to do,"" said its UK head, Oliver Lord. ""Build electric cars competitively or fade away. Public money should instead be put towards a scrappage scheme to help people on low incomes switch out of polluting vehicles, whether going electric or car free."" The Department for Transport said all existing applications for the plug-in grant would continue to be honoured. Where a car has been sold in the two working days prior to the announcement, but an application for the grant from dealerships has not yet been made, the sale will also still qualify for the grant.â¯ Motoring groups criticise electric car grant cut Should I buy an electric vehicle?

"Rwanda asylum flight will take off, Truss insists","More than 10,000 people have made the dangerous journey across the Channel this year The first flight taking asylum seekers to Rwanda will take off and people who are not removed on Tuesday will be on subsequent flights, Liz Truss has said. The foreign secretary said it would ""establish the principle"" and break people traffickers' business models. Seven or eight people are due to be removed on Tuesday, after dozens won legal cases to be taken off. But more legal challenges are set to be heard. Church of England leaders described the plan as an ""immoral policy"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the government will not be ""deterred or abashed"" by criticism of the plan. Four more legal challenges from people set to be flown to the east African nation's capital Kigali are expected to be heard in the courts before the flight departs, after a last-ditch attempt to block the flight altogether was rejected by the Court of Appeal on Monday. Court allows Rwanda asylum flight to go ahead How many asylum seekers could be sent to Rwanda? Is Rwanda a land of safety or fear? On Monday 138 people reached the UK in three boats, with more than 10,000 migrants making the dangerous journey so far this year. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Truss confirmed the flight will depart as scheduled even if only a small number of people were on board, describing it as a ""key part of our strategy for tacking the appalling people smugglers who are trading in people's hopes and dreams"". She said: ""If people aren't on the flight today, they will be on subsequent flights to Rwanda."" Ms Truss added the government was prepared to ""face down"" future legal challenges to its plans, adding: ""It's about making sure that people have a safe future in Rwanda and we're determined to follow through on it"". Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if the plane would take off even if no one was on board, Ms Truss said she was confident there will people on the flight - but added she was not able to say how many it would be. However, she said the numbers of people being sent to Rwanda by the end of the year ""will be significant"". She also declined to say how much the flight would cost, but argued the cost of human trafficking and illegal immigration was ""huge"" to the taxpayer. The charter flight will be operated by airline Privilege Style The flight on Tuesday evening was originally due to carry dozens of passengers, but most succeeded in their individual appeals against removal. It is not clear exactly how many will leave on the flight: on Monday night, the Home Office said it was eight, while the charity Care4Calais said the number had fallen to seven. Ina letter to the Times,external, senior Church of England leaders described the plan as an ""immoral policy that shames Britain"". Signed by the archbishops of Canterbury and York and more than 20 other bishops who sit in the House of Lords, the letter said that ""those to be deported to Rwanda have had no chance to appeal, or reunite with family in Britain"". ""They have had no consideration of their asylum claim, recognition of their medical or other needs, or any attempt to understand their predicament."" Speaking in cabinet on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the government were ""going to get on and deliver"" on its plan, despite the ""criticism that is being directed upon this policy, some of it from slightly unexpected quarters"". He told ministers the objective is to ensure there is a ""clear distinction"" between immigration to the UK by safe and legal routes that the government supports and ""dangerous and illegal cross-Channel migration, which we intend to stop"". Tuesday's flight is due to be the first in a five-year trial, in which some asylum seekers deemed to have entered the UK illegally are transported to Rwanda to claim refuge there. They will get accommodation and support while the Rwandan government considers their application, and if they are successful they can stay in the country with up to five years' access to education and support. If their asylum claim is unsuccessful, they will be offered the chance to apply for other immigration routes, but could face deportation from Rwanda. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins onâ¦ The Rwanda asylum seekers plan The letter to The Times, signed by the entire senior leadership of the Church of England, said those being sent to Rwanda have had no chance to reunite with family in Britain. ""Many are desperate people fleeing unspeakable horrors. These are people Jesus had in mind as he said when we offer hospitality to a stranger, we do it for him,"" it says. ""We cannot offer asylum to everyone, but we must not outsource our ethical responsibilities, or discard international law - which protects the right to claim asylum."" It's not the first time the Archbishop of Canterbury has criticised the plan - hedescribed it as ""the opposite of the nature of God"" in his Easter sermon. At the time, the Home Office responded that the UK had a ""proud history"" of supporting those in need. The BBC has contacted the Home Office for a response to the letter. The PM announces the five-year Â£120m trial in which some asylum seekers will get a one-way ticket to Rwanda It faces widespread opposition from more than 160 charities and campaign groups, a small number of which launch a legal challenge Home Office lawyers say the plan is in the public interest - and the High Court agrees Campaigners appeal against the ruling but are unsuccessful Judges will consider whether the policy is lawful next month - this could see some people returned to the UK from Rwanda if it is ruled unlawful On Monday, appeal court judges ruled the first deportation flight could go ahead, agreeing with a previous judgement that it was in the ""public interest"" for the government to carry out its policies. Campaigners had hoped to stop the plane taking off before a full court hearing on whether the policy is lawful next month. Demonstrators opposed to the plans gathered outside the Home Office in central London on Monday evening Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper described the plan as ""profoundly un-British"". But Rwanda's high commissioner Johnston Busingye earlier defended the partnership, tellingthe Daily Telegraph,externalpeople arriving in the country would be treated with ""safety, dignity and respect"".

Professor Sir John Curtice Professor Sir John Curtice tells BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme: ""If you take the last half dozen polls, they on average point to Yes 48, No 52."" The political scientist says the polls have pointed to 50:50 with ""Yes"" or ""No"" slightly ahead since the Spring of 2019. We've now had about three years of Scotland basically being divided down the middle."" John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Things seem narrower now than in 2014, he says. He explains that those in favour of independence want a referendum before 2026 although not all would move as fast as as that. Both sides need to campaign, because at the moment neither side in the argument can be sure of winning."" John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Having released the first of six papers on the new independence push -""Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external- Ms Sturgeon says there is no schedule for when the other papers will be published ""We haven't determined or decided yet the precise order and sequencing and dates for the subsequent papers,"" she says. The papers will be released ""fairly steadily"" over the months in the latter part of this year, Ms Sturgeon adds. The other papers are expected to look at a number of areas including:  In response to a question about where oil will feature in the campaign Ms Sturgeon points out the importance of a just transition from oil and gas. Ms Sturgeon explains the joint position of herself and Patrick Harvie which is ""we have to accelerate the move away from fossil fuels"". ""There are massive economic advantages in that transition,"" she adds. Patrick Harvie says the position of the Scottish government has changed since 2014. The reality of how fast the transition must be undertaken has become clear, he adds. ""We can make that change in a fair as well as a fast way."" Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond were on the campaign trail together in 2014 The first minister tells the press conference that the campaign for independence will be a broad church and ""that is one of it's strengths"" because independence is about democracy. Asked if she would share a platform with former first minister Alex Salmond, she said: ""That probably qualifies as one of the least important questions of the entire independence debate. ""It's not about me, it's not about Alex Salmond. With the greatest of respect, it is not even about Patrick Harvie - it's about the future of Scotland."" Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond together led the last independence campaign in 2014 but they fell out after sexual misconduct allegations were made against the former first minister. Mr Salmond strongly denied the allegations and was cleared of 13 charges in court. Conclusion The Scottish government's paper concludes with an acknowledgement that an independent Scotland could not be transformed to match the success of the comparator countries overnight. But it says the comparator country models - especially the Nordic countries - illustrate the range of choices that would be available to an independent Scotland able to pursue different policies from those adopted by Westminster over many years. Independence by itself will not guarantee improved performance, it says. It adds that it welcomes a national debate about how an independent country can create a wealthier, happier and fairer Scotland. Read it in full,external UK model The Scottish government paper goes on to say that commentators have attributed the UK's relatively weak productivity and relatively high income inequality to the short-termism resulting from the UK's distinct approach to ownership and governance, the failure to develop effective institutions and lack of commitment to industrial strategy. Different models The second section of the Scottish government paper seeks to highlight some of the factors that help explain the better performance of the comparator countries relative to the UK. Asked by the Financial Times whether losing an independence referendum would write off any prospect of a split in the union forever, Ms Sturgeon laughs and says the moral of the story is that ""we don't lose it, and we don't intend to"". ""I am as certain as it is possible to be that at the next time of asking people in Scotland will not miss the opportunity to vote for independence,"" the first minister says. She adds that polls showing a 50/50 split in support were a ""very, very good starting point"" for the campaign. First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has launched the first in a series of papers which she says will set
out and debate the case for Scotland's independence. The first paper is entitled:""Independence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external It looks at 10 comparator countries - Denmark, Sweden, Finland,
Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands -
and compares the UK's performance across a range of economic and social
indicators. Ms Sturgeon said these independent countries were a similar size
to Scotland but were wealthier, fairer and more productive than the UK. Comparisons
to the UK Asked by a reporter from Sky News why voters should believe there would be any better outcomes for people in an independent Scotland, the first minister said Scotland was ""seeing real progress, coupled with real challenge, across a range of the responsibilities we have under our control right now"". People have to decide whether they trust a democratically elected government in Scotland, of whatever party, over a UK government to make decisions for them, Ms Sturgeon says. ""Scrutiny is not something that has not been something that has been in short supply in Scotland,"" she adds. ""I've been first minister for less than eight years, I've fought eight elections in that time and my party has won all of them. ""The trust in the party that leads the Scottish government has been demonstrated."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says the Nicola Sturgeon's speech was a ""disappointing return to the politics of the past - the politics of strife and division"". âThousands of Scots are being forced to choose between
heating and eating and even more are facing sharp bill rises; our NHS is in
disarray with lives being lost as a result and our transport infrastructure is
falling apart before our eyes,"" he said. âFor Nicola Sturgeon to turn her back on the issues facing
the people of Scotland and decide at this point to focus on her own obsession
is a sad example of how out of touch this government are. âNicola Sturgeon has no answer to the vital economic questions
posed by independence, no plan to deliver a referendum and no intention to
listen to the majority of Scots who are opposed to independence. âInstead, the first minister wants to feed off Boris Johnson
and his Tory government to fuel her own political ambitions. âYou cannot play politics while peopleâs lives and
livelihoods are in the balance."" James CookScotland Editor, BBC News Why is this renewed push for independence happening? The answer is simple. The people of Scotland voted for it. Of course there is plenty of opposition to, and concern about, a second independence referendum but it remains an inescapable fact that in last year's elections to the Scottish Parliament voters returned a majority of MSPs, both SNP and Green, who had pledged to hold one. When this happened in 2011, there was a referendum. If that was the accepted trigger then, why is it not the trigger now?
That is primarily a question for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The SNPâs argument is that if his Conservative party previously regarded a majority at Holyrood as a mandate for a poll, why is he thwarting the will of Scotlandâs voters now? Having said that, First Minister
Nicola Sturgeon must operate in the world as she finds it not as she wants it
to be and at todayâs news conference the SNP leader simply did not or could not
detail the alternative path she intends to follow if Mr Johnson persists in his
refusal. There are also difficult questions
for both Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson about the ""why"" as well as the
""how"" of independence. Among those for supporters of
independence, is it sensible to ditch nuclear weapons with a belligerent Russia
at large? Can green energy really replace oil as the engine of the Scottish
economy? If leaving the European Union has damaged the UK, why wouldnât leaving
an even older and more entrenched union be much worse for Scotland? For supporters of the union,
arenât the comparisons with other small European nations set out in todayâs
paper an indictment of British failure? Why has the UK, and Scotland within it,
performed so poorly on GDP, income inequality, poverty, productivity and other
indicators set out in the 71-page document? In 2014 the prospectus for an
independent Scotland was subject to rigorous and detailed scrutiny. Ms
Sturgeonâs aim with these papers is to ensure the same scrutiny is applied to
the UK. In response to the launch of the new independence campaign, Downing Street has again rejected the case for another referendum. The prime minister's official spokesman told Press Association: ""The UK government's position is that now is not the time to be talking about another referendum. """"We are confident that the people of Scotland want and expect their governments to be working together to focus on issues like the global cost-of-living challenges, like war in Europe and the issues that matter to their families and their communities."" Ciaran Jenkins, the Scotland correspondent for Channel 4 News, says the first minister wants to be in the EU. He asks if Ms Sturgeon agrees with every reputable expert who says there will be checks on goods going from England and Wales to Scotland and there will be a trade border between England and Scotland. The first minister says if Scotland is in the single market there will be issues, there will be regulatory and customs requirements. She says these challenges can be managed in a way that does not affect our businesses and the benefits outweigh them. The first minister is asked about the ""inevitable"" hard border between Scotland and England, should an independent Scotland join the EU. She says she will ""confront the implications of Brexit"" in another of the six papers they are releasing. ""The UK government is in a deep mess over the Northern Ireland protocol,"" she add. Scotland would remain within the common travel area but would have to work out how to operate within the market in a way that isn't damaging to the south of Scotland or businesses, she adds. The first minister says they want to avoid replicating the UK's difficulties caused by a ""lack of being honest"" and lack of planning.  This video can not be played Indyref without section 30 'if necessary', but must be lawful - FM Answering a question about moving ahead without a section 30 order, Ms Sturgeon says she cannot discuss it yet. ""We are dealing with a prime minster that doesn't respect democracy, the law or any of the norms that underpin democracies in most other countries,"" she says. ""I believe we can navigate a path forward"", she says, adding that she wants to do it properly. The BBC's James Cook says none of the comparator countries Ms Sturgeon referred to have been embedded in a 300 year old trading and political union with their closest neighbour. Mr Cook asks if leaving the EU has been as disastrous for Scotland why wouldn't leaving this ""far more deeply embedded union be much worse"". Ms Sturgeon says there was no planning or ""basic honesty"" with Brexit and she says today's document has more ""thought, there is more evidence and planning for the way ahead than there was for the entirety of the Brexit campaign"". The first minister adds: ""If all of these countries can be as successful, relative to the UK as they are, then with hard work, with commitment and good planning then why not Scotland?"" ""It will be the people of Scotland that make that choice."" STV's Colin Mackay asks if the first minister has contacted the PM in writing today. Ms Sturgeon ponders whether Boris Johnson will be watching and just in case says to him: ""I stand ready to negotiate a Section 30 order if you now decide you are a democrat."" A Section 30 order would allow a temporary transfer of power to the Scottish Parliament which would allow a referendum to happen. Mr Mackay asks what's going to change in relation to this issue, with two prime ministers having rejected it already. Ms Sturgeon says: ""What's going to change is I will set out a lawful way forward without a Section 30 if that is what is required."" ""We have a UK government that does not respect democracy and does not respect the rule of law."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Rising prices see basic pay fall fastest since 2011,"Regular pay is falling at the fastest rate in more than a decade when taking into account rising prices, the Office for National Statistics has said. Between February and April, pay excluding bonuses was down 2.2% from a year earlier when adjusted for inflation,the ONS said,external. UK household budgets are being squeezed by record fuel and energy costs. However, pay including bonuses is outpacing price rises, rising by 0.4% when taking inflation into account. Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the ONS, said a ""high level of bonuses"" was continuing to ""cushion the effects of rising prices on total earnings for some workers"". ""But if you exclude bonuses, pay in real terms is falling at its fastest rate in over a decade,"" she added. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the UK's jobs market ""remains robust"" with redundancies at an all-time low. ""Helping people into work is the best way to support families in the long term, and we are continuing to support people into new and better jobs,"" he added. But Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said ""millions in work are in poverty"" and accused ministers of showing ""utter complacency about the huge levels of economic inactivity"". When adjusted for inflation, regular pay has fallen roughly by 1.6% for private sector workers and 4.5% for those in the public sector. The ONS noted that the latest wage figures are compared with the same period in 2021 when Covid restrictions were in place and some workers were furloughed. Fears for UK economy grow as higher prices bite Worried households cut back on energy and food The number of job vacancies in the UK rose to a new record of 1.3 million from March to May, the ONS said. The unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in the February to April period, up slightly from last month, while the employment rate was 75.6%, which is still lower than before the pandemic. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said that with record numbers of roles available, ""pay is growing strongly as companies seek to attract people to work for them"". But he warned if ""we don't address the fact that there are not enough people looking for work, this could put another dampener on the UK's economic growth"". Josh Goodall, the co-managing director of building company Elite Building Maintenance in West Yorkshire, told the BBC that trying to recruit experienced tradespeople such as builders, joiners and plasterers was ""an absolute nightmare"" in the current climate. ""We have got a couple of young lads working for us and they are currently getting trained up at the moment, but you can only train so many people and you need experienced workers,"" he said. The latest statistics on job vacancies showed hospitality and healthcare were among the sectors with the highest number of jobs available, with construction and manufacturing also having high vacancy numbers. Jamie Keegan (L) and Joshua Goodall (R) are struggling to recruit experienced tradespeople for their building firm Mr Goodall said that as a result of the tight labour market, he was having to raise wages, with an experienced builder now asking for about Â£250 per day, compared with about Â£150 before the pandemic. This, along with the soaring costs of materials such as timber and cement, has led to the company charging more. ""We are almost apologising [to customers] saying materials have gone up, fuel has gone up, waste costs have gone up,"" said Mr Goodall. ""We feel like it's an expensive price but the amount we are making is less than it was before."" The jobs numbers remain a welcome relief from the stagflation seen elsewhere in the UK figures, but the strength here appears to be peaking. Unemployment remains very low and there was an overall rise in employment over the past three months, though not yet recovering all the lost jobs since before the pandemic. Still there were some signs of a turning point under the hood of these numbers. Unemployment actually edged up a little. And looking at the single month figures for April, when energy bills spiked and taxes went up, unemployment was up to 4.2% and employment notably down. For those with jobs, ordinary pay fell in real terms at the fastest rate for a decade. In the private sector, bonuses are cushioning this for some workers reflecting one-off payments and recruitment into new jobs. Vacancies remain at record levels too, with a worker shortage starting to have visible consequences at airports and in the NHS. But the defining economic question still to be answered is how much wages can compensate for the surge in the rate of price rises. The answer so far is not much, especially in the public sector. The ONS added the the number of ""economically inactive"" people - those without a job and not seeking to work - had fallen slightly in the past three months, but was still higher than before Covid struck. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies,tweeted,externalthat the ""incredibly tight"" labour market reflected a smaller workforce than before the pandemic, with up to one million workers now ""missing"". Ms Beckett from the ONS said that at the start of the pandemic many young people leaving education had ""disengaged"" from looking for work due to most businesses and work places being shut during lockdowns. But she told the BBC's Today programme that the ""story had changed"" more recently with more people over the age of 50 becoming economically inactive by ""retiring early, or just not needing to work, or indeed suffering ill health"". A member of the ""missing million"" is Kevin Butler, who retired from his 17-year career in recruitment to make music. The 54-year-old said the pandemic changed his perspective on work when he was furloughed. ""I'm lucky in that I've worked for a long time and been sensible with money in the past and paid off my mortgage, and those little things that make a difference on an everyday basis,"" he added.

Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years.

In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many

delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and

visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital

"EU set for legal action over UK Brexit deal changesBrussels says altering the Northern Ireland Protocol breaks international law, but the UK disputes this.","The EU is expected to launch legal action against the UK government on Wednesday over its decision to scrap some post-Brexit trade arrangements. Ministers insist current checks on some goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland must end to avoid harm to the peace process. They published a parliamentary bill on Monday aimed at overriding parts of the deal signed with the EU in 2020. But Brussels says going back on the arrangement breaks international law. The Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. This prevents a hard border with the Republic of Ireland - including checks there on the movement of people and goods - which both the UK and EU want to avoid in order to ensure peace is maintained. UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Europe is prepping for a trade war no-one wants But instead it means checks on some goods arriving into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK. That is opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland who argue it creates a trade border in the Irish Sea and could lead to the break-up of the UK. Followingelections in Northern Ireland last month, the Democratic Unionist Party is refusing to serve in a power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein until the protocol is changed. But other parties in Northern Ireland - including Sinn Fein, the Alliance Party and the SDLP - accept the deal as it stands. The UK government says it would prefer to agree changes with the EU, rather than act alone in making changes to the protocol. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We've been acting in good faith in these negotiations, but the fundamental issues that are affecting political stability in Northern Ireland are in the text of the protocol and what we need is the EU to agree to change the text of the protocol. ""Otherwise the negotiations won't succeed. We've reached a dead end, because we can't change those core issues around customs and around VAT that are losing us the consent of the unionist community in Northern Ireland."" At the centre of the UK government's plan are measures they say would ease the impact on businesses - set out in the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill - including the concept of ""green lanes"" and ""red lanes"" for trade. This would involve: Goods coming from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) into Northern Ireland and which are staying there using the green lane - meaning no checks and minimal paperwork Goods moving from Great Britain through Northern into Ireland or the wider European Union would using the red lane - that is, continuing to be checked at ports in Northern Ireland. The UK also wants the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ) to have no future role in deciding disputes involving the protocol, with an independent arbiter overseeing sitting in judgement instead. In response, the EU has indicated it will restartlegal action it began in March last year,,externalwhen it accused the UK of delaying, without consultation, the enforcement of parts of the protocol relating to customs checks. It could go further by taking the UK to the ECJ over claims it did too little to set up border control posts and share data with the EU. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol row about? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed The European Commission is expected to sign off the next legal steps at its meeting on Wednesday, while many senior EU figures have spoken out against the UK's plan to rewrite parts of the protocol. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Today: ""This is not consistent with international law and the British government's obligations under international law, and that will be shown in time."" He added that ""effectively what they will be doing is collapsing the protocol"" and removing protections against ""the severe disruption of Brexit on the island of Ireland"". ""Britain has taken a very regrettable decision that goes against all the agreements between the EU and Britain,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. ""It is also unjustified because the European Commission made many pragmatic proposals."" Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Boris Johnson's government to ""continue negotiations with the EU in good faith"". Businesses which import Great Britain goods to Northern Ireland have experienced difficulties with the protocol as the checks and controls add cost and complexity. Food and horticulture importers have faced the greatest problems, as those goods face the most onerous controls. However, exporters have benefited because unlike other parts of the UK they have maintained frictionless access to EU markets.

UK working 'flat out' to free death sentence Britons,"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was

Scotland can navigate a legal independence vote - Sturgeon,"Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon launches a fresh independence campaign and says she ""stands ready"" to negotiate with PM Boris Johnson to hold a second referendum When the country held the first vote in 2014 its go-ahead was possible because the UK government granted the necessary power, called a Section 30 order However, in the near eight years that have passed two Conservative prime ministers - Theresa May and Mr Johnson - have refused to give that order a second time Ms Sturgeon now says she is confident that Scotland can navigate towards a legal independence vote and the detail of how that could be done would be presented to the Scottish Parliament ""very soon"" In response to the new campaign, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""The UK government's position is that now is not the time to be talking about another referendum.""

Professor Sir John Curtice Professor Sir John Curtice tells BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme: ""If you take the last half dozen polls, they on average point to Yes 48, No 52."" The political scientist says the polls have pointed to 50:50 with ""Yes"" or ""No"" slightly ahead since the Spring of 2019.

John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Things seem narrower now than in 2014, he says. He explains that those in favour of independence want a referendum before 2026 although not all would move as fast as as that. Both sides need to campaign, because at the moment neither side in the argument can be sure of winning."" John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Having released the first of six papers on the new independence push -""Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external- Ms Sturgeon says there is no schedule for when the other papers will be published ""We haven't determined or decided yet the precise order and sequencing and dates for the subsequent papers,"" she says. The papers will be released ""fairly steadily"" over the months in the latter part of this year, Ms Sturgeon adds. The other papers are expected to look at a number of areas including:  In response to a question about where oil will feature in the campaign Ms Sturgeon points out the importance of a just transition from oil and gas. Ms Sturgeon explains the joint position of herself and Patrick Harvie which is ""we have to accelerate the move away from fossil fuels"". ""There are massive economic advantages in that transition,"" she adds. Patrick Harvie says the position of the Scottish government has changed since 2014. The reality of how fast the transition must be undertaken has become clear, he adds. ""We can make that change in a fair as well as a fast way."" Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond were on the campaign trail together in 2014 The first minister tells the press conference that the campaign for independence will be a broad church and ""that is one of it's strengths"" because independence is about democracy. Asked if she would share a platform with former first minister Alex Salmond, she said: ""That probably qualifies as one of the least important questions of the entire independence debate. ""It's not about me, it's not about Alex Salmond. With the greatest of respect, it is not even about Patrick Harvie - it's about the future of Scotland."" Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond together led the last independence campaign in 2014 but they fell out after sexual misconduct allegations were made against the former first minister. Mr Salmond strongly denied the allegations and was cleared of 13 charges in court. Conclusion The Scottish government's paper concludes with an acknowledgement that an independent Scotland could not be transformed to match the success of the comparator countries overnight. But it says the comparator country models - especially the Nordic countries - illustrate the range of choices that would be available to an independent Scotland able to pursue different policies from those adopted by Westminster over many years. Independence by itself will not guarantee improved performance, it says. It adds that it welcomes a national debate about how an independent country can create a wealthier, happier and fairer Scotland. Read it in full,external UK model The Scottish government paper goes on to say that commentators have attributed the UK's relatively weak productivity and relatively high income inequality to the short-termism resulting from the UK's distinct approach to ownership and governance, the failure to develop effective institutions and lack of commitment to industrial strategy. Different models The second section of the Scottish government paper seeks to highlight some of the factors that help explain the better performance of the comparator countries relative to the UK. Asked by the Financial Times whether losing an independence referendum would write off any prospect of a split in the union forever, Ms Sturgeon laughs and says the moral of the story is that ""we don't lose it, and we don't intend to"". ""I am as certain as it is possible to be that at the next time of asking people in Scotland will not miss the opportunity to vote for independence,"" the first minister says. She adds that polls showing a 50/50 split in support were a ""very, very good starting point"" for the campaign. First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has launched the first in a series of papers which she says will set
out and debate the case for Scotland's independence. The first paper is entitled:""Independence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external It looks at 10 comparator countries - Denmark, Sweden, Finland,
Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands -
and compares the UK's performance across a range of economic and social
indicators. Ms Sturgeon said these independent countries were a similar size
to Scotland but were wealthier, fairer and more productive than the UK. Comparisons
to the UK Asked by a reporter from Sky News why voters should believe there would be any better outcomes for people in an independent Scotland, the first minister said Scotland was ""seeing real progress, coupled with real challenge, across a range of the responsibilities we have under our control right now"". People have to decide whether they trust a democratically elected government in Scotland, of whatever party, over a UK government to make decisions for them, Ms Sturgeon says. ""Scrutiny is not something that has not been something that has been in short supply in Scotland,"" she adds. ""I've been first minister for less than eight years, I've fought eight elections in that time and my party has won all of them. ""The trust in the party that leads the Scottish government has been demonstrated."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says the Nicola Sturgeon's speech was a ""disappointing return to the politics of the past - the politics of strife and division"". âThousands of Scots are being forced to choose between
heating and eating and even more are facing sharp bill rises; our NHS is in
disarray with lives being lost as a result and our transport infrastructure is
falling apart before our eyes,"" he said. âFor Nicola Sturgeon to turn her back on the issues facing
the people of Scotland and decide at this point to focus on her own obsession
is a sad example of how out of touch this government are. âNicola Sturgeon has no answer to the vital economic questions
posed by independence, no plan to deliver a referendum and no intention to
listen to the majority of Scots who are opposed to independence. âInstead, the first minister wants to feed off Boris Johnson
and his Tory government to fuel her own political ambitions. âYou cannot play politics while peopleâs lives and
livelihoods are in the balance."" James CookScotland Editor, BBC News Why is this renewed push for independence happening? The answer is simple. The people of Scotland voted for it. Of course there is plenty of opposition to, and concern about, a second independence referendum but it remains an inescapable fact that in last year's elections to the Scottish Parliament voters returned a majority of MSPs, both SNP and Green, who had pledged to hold one. When this happened in 2011, there was a referendum. If that was the accepted trigger then, why is it not the trigger now?
That is primarily a question for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The SNPâs argument is that if his Conservative party previously regarded a majority at Holyrood as a mandate for a poll, why is he thwarting the will of Scotlandâs voters now? Having said that, First Minister
Nicola Sturgeon must operate in the world as she finds it not as she wants it
to be and at todayâs news conference the SNP leader simply did not or could not
detail the alternative path she intends to follow if Mr Johnson persists in his
refusal. There are also difficult questions
for both Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson about the ""why"" as well as the
""how"" of independence. Among those for supporters of
independence, is it sensible to ditch nuclear weapons with a belligerent Russia
at large? Can green energy really replace oil as the engine of the Scottish
economy? If leaving the European Union has damaged the UK, why wouldnât leaving
an even older and more entrenched union be much worse for Scotland? For supporters of the union,
arenât the comparisons with other small European nations set out in todayâs
paper an indictment of British failure? Why has the UK, and Scotland within it,
performed so poorly on GDP, income inequality, poverty, productivity and other
indicators set out in the 71-page document? In 2014 the prospectus for an
independent Scotland was subject to rigorous and detailed scrutiny. Ms
Sturgeonâs aim with these papers is to ensure the same scrutiny is applied to
the UK. In response to the launch of the new independence campaign, Downing Street has again rejected the case for another referendum. The prime minister's official spokesman told Press Association: ""The UK government's position is that now is not the time to be talking about another referendum. """"We are confident that the people of Scotland want and expect their governments to be working together to focus on issues like the global cost-of-living challenges, like war in Europe and the issues that matter to their families and their communities."" Ciaran Jenkins, the Scotland correspondent for Channel 4 News, says the first minister wants to be in the EU. He asks if Ms Sturgeon agrees with every reputable expert who says there will be checks on goods going from England and Wales to Scotland and there will be a trade border between England and Scotland. The first minister says if Scotland is in the single market there will be issues, there will be regulatory and customs requirements. She says these challenges can be managed in a way that does not affect our businesses and the benefits outweigh them. The first minister is asked about the ""inevitable"" hard border between Scotland and England, should an independent Scotland join the EU. She says she will ""confront the implications of Brexit"" in another of the six papers they are releasing. ""The UK government is in a deep mess over the Northern Ireland protocol,"" she add. Scotland would remain within the common travel area but would have to work out how to operate within the market in a way that isn't damaging to the south of Scotland or businesses, she adds. The first minister says they want to avoid replicating the UK's difficulties caused by a ""lack of being honest"" and lack of planning.  This video can not be played Indyref without section 30 'if necessary', but must be lawful - FM Answering a question about moving ahead without a section 30 order, Ms Sturgeon says she cannot discuss it yet. ""We are dealing with a prime minster that doesn't respect democracy, the law or any of the norms that underpin democracies in most other countries,"" she says. ""I believe we can navigate a path forward"", she says, adding that she wants to do it properly. The BBC's James Cook says none of the comparator countries Ms Sturgeon referred to have been embedded in a 300 year old trading and political union with their closest neighbour. Mr Cook asks if leaving the EU has been as disastrous for Scotland why wouldn't leaving this ""far more deeply embedded union be much worse"". Ms Sturgeon says there was no planning or ""basic honesty"" with Brexit and she says today's document has more ""thought, there is more evidence and planning for the way ahead than there was for the entirety of the Brexit campaign"". The first minister adds: ""If all of these countries can be as successful, relative to the UK as they are, then with hard work, with commitment and good planning then why not Scotland?"" ""It will be the people of Scotland that make that choice."" STV's Colin Mackay asks if the first minister has contacted the PM in writing today. Ms Sturgeon ponders whether Boris Johnson will be watching and just in case says to him: ""I stand ready to negotiate a Section 30 order if you now decide you are a democrat."" A Section 30 order would allow a temporary transfer of power to the Scottish Parliament which would allow a referendum to happen. Mr Mackay asks what's going to change in relation to this issue, with two prime ministers having rejected it already. Ms Sturgeon says: ""What's going to change is I will set out a lawful way forward without a Section 30 if that is what is required.""

Grenfell victims remembered at memorial serviceA number of events are taking place across London to mark five years since the disaster.London,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had earlier met those affected by the disaster in a private meeting The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have joined bereaved families and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire to mark its fifth anniversary. Seventy-two people were killed by the blaze in North Kensington, west London, on 14 June 2017. The couple joined mourners at the base of the tower for a special service having earlier met several during a private meeting. A 72-second silence was observed by attendees, concluding with applause. The couple placed a wreath during the service The attendance of the duke and duchess was ""huge"" for the community, a local resident said. Muna Hussain, whose children went to the same school as five of those who died, said: ""I was glad to see at least they know how we are feeling as a community and they shared that feeling. ""It makes me very happy. It's massive, it's huge for us. It makes you feel better."" Stormzy - who has long offered his support to those affected by the disaster - was also at the event Some watched the service on big screens A silent two-mile march was held after the service During the service, actor Tim Downie said: ""At today's service we honour the 72 innocent men, women and children, mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters, sisters, brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces and friends who needlessly lost their lives. ""We must never forget them and carry them with us forever in our hearts."" Many mourners wore green scarves and clothing to match the green hearts that adorn the wall below the tower and which have become a symbol of the tragedy. Floral tributes and personal notes have been left beside the wall, including a ""72"" made of white flowers. Afterwards, several hundred people carried out a two-mile walk around the area. Dozens of firefighters lined the streets, with many holding green hearts reading ""Grenfell"", and onlookers applauded as the mourners passed. WatchGrenfell: Has Anything Changed?on iPlayer. A memorial service for the 72 people killed in the fire took place at 11:00 at Westminster Abbey Earlier, a multi-faith memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It began with the names of the victims being read out followed by a reply of ""forever in our hearts"" from the congregation. Former prime minister Theresa May, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Housing Secretary Michael Gove were among those in the congregation. People placed white roses in memory of the victims Theresa May, who was prime minister when the fire happened, spoke to volunteers ahead of the memorial service Journalist Jon Snow, who was invited to speak at the service, said: ""Grenfell, set in the richest borough in Britain, speaks to the grotesque inequality with which our society has been riven. ""We must now confront the issues raised by the Grenfell disaster."" Lawyer Imran Khan, who also addressed the congregation, said: ""For the residents of Grenfell, their home wasn't their castle, it was their deathbed."" The names of each of the 72 victims of the Grenfell Tower fire were read out BBC News correspondent Nick Johnson From scarves and flowers, to altar cloths and decorations, Westminster Abbey was adorned in green as hundreds gathered for this memorial service to remember those who lost their lives on this day five years ago. At the very heart of the service was a sense of unity and remembrance. Members of the congregation held hands, comforting those who were weeping, as the names of each of the 72 victims were read out. We heard from Marlene Anderson. Her father Ray ""Moses"" Bernard lost his life in the fire. His daughter spoke of her trauma and how she and other family members often relive that night. Perhaps the loudest round of applause came after lawyer Imran Khan's speech. He spoke of his disbelief over a lack of criminal charges and described the public inquiry into the fire as ineffective. As the congregation filed out of the Abbey, 72 candles were left flickering on the altar, a reminder that the Grenfell victims will never be forgotten. Elsewhere in the capital, a 72-second silence was observed at 14:00 at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush. People observed a 72-second silence at the Grenfell memorial wall in the nearby Westfield shopping centre Firefighters will provide a guard of honour as survivors and the bereaved walk from Grenfell Tower Natasha Elcock, chairwoman of campaign group Grenfell United, said this week would be difficult for all of those affected.

"EU set for legal action over UK Brexit deal changesBrussels says altering the Northern Ireland Protocol breaks international law, but the UK disputes this.UK PoliticsCommentsNew lessons 'exciting but a challenge' for schoolsTeachers say changing what and how children learn is welcome - but some schools will struggle.Wales","The EU is expected to launch legal action against the UK government on Wednesday over its decision to scrap some post-Brexit trade arrangements. Ministers insist current checks on some goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland must end to avoid harm to the peace process. They published a parliamentary bill on Monday aimed at overriding parts of the deal signed with the EU in 2020. But Brussels says going back on the arrangement breaks international law. The Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. This prevents a hard border with the Republic of Ireland - including checks there on the movement of people and goods - which both the UK and EU want to avoid in order to ensure peace is maintained. UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Europe is prepping for a trade war no-one wants But instead it means checks on some goods arriving into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK. That is opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland who argue it creates a trade border in the Irish Sea and could lead to the break-up of the UK. Followingelections in Northern Ireland last month, the Democratic Unionist Party is refusing to serve in a power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein until the protocol is changed. But other parties in Northern Ireland - including Sinn Fein, the Alliance Party and the SDLP - accept the deal as it stands. The UK government says it would prefer to agree changes with the EU, rather than act alone in making changes to the protocol. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We've been acting in good faith in these negotiations, but the fundamental issues that are affecting political stability in Northern Ireland are in the text of the protocol and what we need is the EU to agree to change the text of the protocol. ""Otherwise the negotiations won't succeed. We've reached a dead end, because we can't change those core issues around customs and around VAT that are losing us the consent of the unionist community in Northern Ireland."" At the centre of the UK government's plan are measures they say would ease the impact on businesses - set out in the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill - including the concept of ""green lanes"" and ""red lanes"" for trade. This would involve: Goods coming from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) into Northern Ireland and which are staying there using the green lane - meaning no checks and minimal paperwork Goods moving from Great Britain through Northern into Ireland or the wider European Union would using the red lane - that is, continuing to be checked at ports in Northern Ireland. The UK also wants the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ) to have no future role in deciding disputes involving the protocol, with an independent arbiter overseeing sitting in judgement instead. In response, the EU has indicated it will restartlegal action it began in March last year,,externalwhen it accused the UK of delaying, without consultation, the enforcement of parts of the protocol relating to customs checks. It could go further by taking the UK to the ECJ over claims it did too little to set up border control posts and share data with the EU. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol row about? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed The European Commission is expected to sign off the next legal steps at its meeting on Wednesday, while many senior EU figures have spoken out against the UK's plan to rewrite parts of the protocol. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Today: ""This is not consistent with international law and the British government's obligations under international law, and that will be shown in time."" He added that ""effectively what they will be doing is collapsing the protocol"" and removing protections against ""the severe disruption of Brexit on the island of Ireland"". ""Britain has taken a very regrettable decision that goes against all the agreements between the EU and Britain,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. ""It is also unjustified because the European Commission made many pragmatic proposals."" Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Boris Johnson's government to ""continue negotiations with the EU in good faith"". Businesses which import Great Britain goods to Northern Ireland have experienced difficulties with the protocol as the checks and controls add cost and complexity. Food and horticulture importers have faced the greatest problems, as those goods face the most onerous controls. However, exporters have benefited because unlike other parts of the UK they have maintained frictionless access to EU markets.

"Grenfell victims remembered at memorial serviceA number of events are taking place across London to mark five years since the disaster.LondonLack of black people at Glastonbury 'interesting'Sir Lenny Henry says he is ""always surprised by the lack of black and brown faces at festivals"".Somerset","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had earlier met those affected by the disaster in a private meeting The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have joined bereaved families and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire to mark its fifth anniversary. Seventy-two people were killed by the blaze in North Kensington, west London, on 14 June 2017. The couple joined mourners at the base of the tower for a special service having earlier met several during a private meeting. A 72-second silence was observed by attendees, concluding with applause. The couple placed a wreath during the service The attendance of the duke and duchess was ""huge"" for the community, a local resident said. Muna Hussain, whose children went to the same school as five of those who died, said: ""I was glad to see at least they know how we are feeling as a community and they shared that feeling. ""It makes me very happy. It's massive, it's huge for us. It makes you feel better."" Stormzy - who has long offered his support to those affected by the disaster - was also at the event Some watched the service on big screens A silent two-mile march was held after the service During the service, actor Tim Downie said: ""At today's service we honour the 72 innocent men, women and children, mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters, sisters, brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces and friends who needlessly lost their lives. ""We must never forget them and carry them with us forever in our hearts."" Many mourners wore green scarves and clothing to match the green hearts that adorn the wall below the tower and which have become a symbol of the tragedy. Floral tributes and personal notes have been left beside the wall, including a ""72"" made of white flowers. Afterwards, several hundred people carried out a two-mile walk around the area. Dozens of firefighters lined the streets, with many holding green hearts reading ""Grenfell"", and onlookers applauded as the mourners passed. WatchGrenfell: Has Anything Changed?on iPlayer. A memorial service for the 72 people killed in the fire took place at 11:00 at Westminster Abbey Earlier, a multi-faith memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It began with the names of the victims being read out followed by a reply of ""forever in our hearts"" from the congregation. Former prime minister Theresa May, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Housing Secretary Michael Gove were among those in the congregation. People placed white roses in memory of the victims Theresa May, who was prime minister when the fire happened, spoke to volunteers ahead of the memorial service Journalist Jon Snow, who was invited to speak at the service, said: ""Grenfell, set in the richest borough in Britain, speaks to the grotesque inequality with which our society has been riven. ""We must now confront the issues raised by the Grenfell disaster."" Lawyer Imran Khan, who also addressed the congregation, said: ""For the residents of Grenfell, their home wasn't their castle, it was their deathbed."" The names of each of the 72 victims of the Grenfell Tower fire were read out BBC News correspondent Nick Johnson From scarves and flowers, to altar cloths and decorations, Westminster Abbey was adorned in green as hundreds gathered for this memorial service to remember those who lost their lives on this day five years ago. At the very heart of the service was a sense of unity and remembrance. Members of the congregation held hands, comforting those who were weeping, as the names of each of the 72 victims were read out. We heard from Marlene Anderson. Her father Ray ""Moses"" Bernard lost his life in the fire. His daughter spoke of her trauma and how she and other family members often relive that night. Perhaps the loudest round of applause came after lawyer Imran Khan's speech. He spoke of his disbelief over a lack of criminal charges and described the public inquiry into the fire as ineffective. As the congregation filed out of the Abbey, 72 candles were left flickering on the altar, a reminder that the Grenfell victims will never be forgotten. Elsewhere in the capital, a 72-second silence was observed at 14:00 at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush. People observed a 72-second silence at the Grenfell memorial wall in the nearby Westfield shopping centre Firefighters will provide a guard of honour as survivors and the bereaved walk from Grenfell Tower Natasha Elcock, chairwoman of campaign group Grenfell United, said this week would be difficult for all of those affected.

So far, fewer than half of the recommendations from the inquiry have been adopted into law, according to the Home Office.

Previously, the ban appliedonly to buildings higher than 11m (36ft). The government first received data demonstrating thedanger of polyethylene-cored cladding in 2002. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) said it was taking steps to ensure buildings were safer.

LiveLiveUK working 'flat out' to free death sentence Britons11 minutes ago,"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

This video can not be played EU leaders support Ukraine's membership bid European Union leaders have publicly backed Ukraine's ""immediate"" candidate status to join the bloc, following Russia's invasion of the country. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Professor Sir John Curtice Professor Sir John Curtice tells BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme: ""If you take the last half dozen polls, they on average point to Yes 48, No 52."" The political scientist says the polls have pointed to 50:50 with ""Yes"" or ""No"" slightly ahead since the Spring of 2019. We've now had about three years of Scotland basically being divided down the middle."" John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Things seem narrower now than in 2014, he says. He explains that those in favour of independence want a referendum before 2026 although not all would move as fast as as that. Both sides need to campaign, because at the moment neither side in the argument can be sure of winning."" John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Having released the first of six papers on the new independence push -""Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external- Ms Sturgeon says there is no schedule for when the other papers will be published ""We haven't determined or decided yet the precise order and sequencing and dates for the subsequent papers,"" she says. The papers will be released ""fairly steadily"" over the months in the latter part of this year, Ms Sturgeon adds. The other papers are expected to look at a number of areas including:  In response to a question about where oil will feature in the campaign Ms Sturgeon points out the importance of a just transition from oil and gas. Ms Sturgeon explains the joint position of herself and Patrick Harvie which is ""we have to accelerate the move away from fossil fuels"". ""There are massive economic advantages in that transition,"" she adds. Patrick Harvie says the position of the Scottish government has changed since 2014. The reality of how fast the transition must be undertaken has become clear, he adds. ""We can make that change in a fair as well as a fast way."" Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond were on the campaign trail together in 2014 The first minister tells the press conference that the campaign for independence will be a broad church and ""that is one of it's strengths"" because independence is about democracy. Asked if she would share a platform with former first minister Alex Salmond, she said: ""That probably qualifies as one of the least important questions of the entire independence debate. ""It's not about me, it's not about Alex Salmond. With the greatest of respect, it is not even about Patrick Harvie - it's about the future of Scotland."" Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond together led the last independence campaign in 2014 but they fell out after sexual misconduct allegations were made against the former first minister. Mr Salmond strongly denied the allegations and was cleared of 13 charges in court. Conclusion The Scottish government's paper concludes with an acknowledgement that an independent Scotland could not be transformed to match the success of the comparator countries overnight. But it says the comparator country models - especially the Nordic countries - illustrate the range of choices that would be available to an independent Scotland able to pursue different policies from those adopted by Westminster over many years. Independence by itself will not guarantee improved performance, it says. It adds that it welcomes a national debate about how an independent country can create a wealthier, happier and fairer Scotland. Read it in full,external UK model The Scottish government paper goes on to say that commentators have attributed the UK's relatively weak productivity and relatively high income inequality to the short-termism resulting from the UK's distinct approach to ownership and governance, the failure to develop effective institutions and lack of commitment to industrial strategy. Different models The second section of the Scottish government paper seeks to highlight some of the factors that help explain the better performance of the comparator countries relative to the UK. Asked by the Financial Times whether losing an independence referendum would write off any prospect of a split in the union forever, Ms Sturgeon laughs and says the moral of the story is that ""we don't lose it, and we don't intend to"". ""I am as certain as it is possible to be that at the next time of asking people in Scotland will not miss the opportunity to vote for independence,"" the first minister says. She adds that polls showing a 50/50 split in support were a ""very, very good starting point"" for the campaign. First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has launched the first in a series of papers which she says will set
out and debate the case for Scotland's independence. The first paper is entitled:""Independence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external It looks at 10 comparator countries - Denmark, Sweden, Finland,
Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands -
and compares the UK's performance across a range of economic and social
indicators. Ms Sturgeon said these independent countries were a similar size
to Scotland but were wealthier, fairer and more productive than the UK. Comparisons
to the UK Asked by a reporter from Sky News why voters should believe there would be any better outcomes for people in an independent Scotland, the first minister said Scotland was ""seeing real progress, coupled with real challenge, across a range of the responsibilities we have under our control right now"". People have to decide whether they trust a democratically elected government in Scotland, of whatever party, over a UK government to make decisions for them, Ms Sturgeon says. ""Scrutiny is not something that has not been something that has been in short supply in Scotland,"" she adds. ""I've been first minister for less than eight years, I've fought eight elections in that time and my party has won all of them. ""The trust in the party that leads the Scottish government has been demonstrated."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says the Nicola Sturgeon's speech was a ""disappointing return to the politics of the past - the politics of strife and division"". âThousands of Scots are being forced to choose between
heating and eating and even more are facing sharp bill rises; our NHS is in
disarray with lives being lost as a result and our transport infrastructure is
falling apart before our eyes,"" he said. âFor Nicola Sturgeon to turn her back on the issues facing
the people of Scotland and decide at this point to focus on her own obsession
is a sad example of how out of touch this government are. âNicola Sturgeon has no answer to the vital economic questions
posed by independence, no plan to deliver a referendum and no intention to
listen to the majority of Scots who are opposed to independence. âInstead, the first minister wants to feed off Boris Johnson
and his Tory government to fuel her own political ambitions. âYou cannot play politics while peopleâs lives and
livelihoods are in the balance."" James CookScotland Editor, BBC News Why is this renewed push for independence happening? The answer is simple. The people of Scotland voted for it. Of course there is plenty of opposition to, and concern about, a second independence referendum but it remains an inescapable fact that in last year's elections to the Scottish Parliament voters returned a majority of MSPs, both SNP and Green, who had pledged to hold one. When this happened in 2011, there was a referendum. If that was the accepted trigger then, why is it not the trigger now?
That is primarily a question for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The SNPâs argument is that if his Conservative party previously regarded a majority at Holyrood as a mandate for a poll, why is he thwarting the will of Scotlandâs voters now? Having said that, First Minister
Nicola Sturgeon must operate in the world as she finds it not as she wants it
to be and at todayâs news conference the SNP leader simply did not or could not
detail the alternative path she intends to follow if Mr Johnson persists in his
refusal. There are also difficult questions
for both Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson about the ""why"" as well as the
""how"" of independence. Among those for supporters of
independence, is it sensible to ditch nuclear weapons with a belligerent Russia
at large? Can green energy really replace oil as the engine of the Scottish
economy? If leaving the European Union has damaged the UK, why wouldnât leaving
an even older and more entrenched union be much worse for Scotland? For supporters of the union,
arenât the comparisons with other small European nations set out in todayâs
paper an indictment of British failure? Why has the UK, and Scotland within it,
performed so poorly on GDP, income inequality, poverty, productivity and other
indicators set out in the 71-page document? In 2014 the prospectus for an
independent Scotland was subject to rigorous and detailed scrutiny. Ms
Sturgeonâs aim with these papers is to ensure the same scrutiny is applied to
the UK. In response to the launch of the new independence campaign, Downing Street has again rejected the case for another referendum. The prime minister's official spokesman told Press Association: ""The UK government's position is that now is not the time to be talking about another referendum. """"We are confident that the people of Scotland want and expect their governments to be working together to focus on issues like the global cost-of-living challenges, like war in Europe and the issues that matter to their families and their communities."" Ciaran Jenkins, the Scotland correspondent for Channel 4 News, says the first minister wants to be in the EU. He asks if Ms Sturgeon agrees with every reputable expert who says there will be checks on goods going from England and Wales to Scotland and there will be a trade border between England and Scotland. The first minister says if Scotland is in the single market there will be issues, there will be regulatory and customs requirements. She says these challenges can be managed in a way that does not affect our businesses and the benefits outweigh them. The first minister is asked about the ""inevitable"" hard border between Scotland and England, should an independent Scotland join the EU. She says she will ""confront the implications of Brexit"" in another of the six papers they are releasing. ""The UK government is in a deep mess over the Northern Ireland protocol,"" she add. Scotland would remain within the common travel area but would have to work out how to operate within the market in a way that isn't damaging to the south of Scotland or businesses, she adds. The first minister says they want to avoid replicating the UK's difficulties caused by a ""lack of being honest"" and lack of planning.  This video can not be played Indyref without section 30 'if necessary', but must be lawful - FM Answering a question about moving ahead without a section 30 order, Ms Sturgeon says she cannot discuss it yet. ""We are dealing with a prime minster that doesn't respect democracy, the law or any of the norms that underpin democracies in most other countries,"" she says. ""I believe we can navigate a path forward"", she says, adding that she wants to do it properly. The BBC's James Cook says none of the comparator countries Ms Sturgeon referred to have been embedded in a 300 year old trading and political union with their closest neighbour. Mr Cook asks if leaving the EU has been as disastrous for Scotland why wouldn't leaving this ""far more deeply embedded union be much worse"". Ms Sturgeon says there was no planning or ""basic honesty"" with Brexit and she says today's document has more ""thought, there is more evidence and planning for the way ahead than there was for the entirety of the Brexit campaign"". The first minister adds: ""If all of these countries can be as successful, relative to the UK as they are, then with hard work, with commitment and good planning then why not Scotland?"" ""It will be the people of Scotland that make that choice."" STV's Colin Mackay asks if the first minister has contacted the PM in writing today. Ms Sturgeon ponders whether Boris Johnson will be watching and just in case says to him: ""I stand ready to negotiate a Section 30 order if you now decide you are a democrat."" A Section 30 order would allow a temporary transfer of power to the Scottish Parliament which would allow a referendum to happen. Mr Mackay asks what's going to change in relation to this issue, with two prime ministers having rejected it already. Ms Sturgeon says: ""What's going to change is I will set out a lawful way forward without a Section 30 if that is what is required."" ""We have a UK government that does not respect democracy and does not respect the rule of law."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Fossil fuel rush amid Ukraine war 'delusional': UN,"Spending money on new coal, oil and gas as a result of the war in Ukraine is ""delusional"" according to the UN Secretary General. Many countries want to increase their own fossil fuel production in order to depend less on Russian supplies. Mr Guterres says that our global energy mix is broken, and more coal will only reinforce the ""scourge of war, pollution and climate catastrophe."" The UN chief says that renewable energy is the peace plan of the 21st century. World is 'cooked' if we carry on with coal, US says Ukraine war prompts fossil fuel 'gold rush' Microplastics found in fresh Antarctic snow Australia methane emissions hugely under-reported In a video message to the sixth Austrian world summit meeting in Vienna, the UN secretary again took countries to task for their continued reliance on fossil fuels. National plans to reduce carbon emissions were ""simply not good enough,"" Mr Guterres said, pointing to a disconnect between the views of scientists and citizens demanding action and governments that are ""dragging their feet."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has hit out against new fossil fuel investment The war in Ukraine is seeing a renewed focus on fossil fuels by many countries who are worried about energy security in the wake of Russia's invasion. A number of countries have signalled that they will burn more coal in the short term, while others are seeking to boost gas imports. The European Union as a whole is seeking toend reliance on Russian supplies of oil and gasby 2027 but leaders acknowledge this will undoubtedly see more fossil fuel used over the next three years or so. In his speech, Mr Guterresrepeated his viewthat this short-term response might close the window on a key climate goal. In the Paris climate agreement, nations agreed to try to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5C this century, compared to pre-industrial times. But that means that emissions of climate warming gases have to be essentially slashed in half by 2030. There has been a rush to secure new supplies of LNG The war in Ukraine is making that tough target even harder, experts believe. Mr Guterres argues that new exploration for oil and gas and building more infrastructure for fossil fuels is ""delusional."" He re-iterated his previous call for a rapid phase out of coal and a dramatic increase in spending on renewables like wind and solar. ""Had we invested massively in renewable energy in the past, we would not be so dramatically at the mercy of the instability of fossil fuel markets. The dramatic falls seen in the price of renewables over the past decade contrasted strongly with the rising costs of oil and gas, he added. Supporting calls by European leaders, Mr Guterres said thatred tape and bureaucracies,externalshould be rapidly reformed to speed up renewable energy projects. Renewable energy is now far cheaper than it was a decade ago Mr Guterres also called for increased spending on helping poorer countries live with the impacts of climate change. He said efforts to adapt to rising temperatures should be put on an equal footing with plans to cut emissions. Climate diplomats arecurrently meeting in Bonnfor the first major gathering since the COP26 conference last November. There has been much debate on thelack of progressin meeting the goals agreed at the Glasgow climate pact. A lot of attention has focussed on the question of loss and damage, a phrase that essentially means the types of climate impacts that many developing countries are unable to adapt to. The meeting will prepare the ground for the next major conference, COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt later this year. Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

Major tampon makers pledge to tackle US shortages,"Major tampon manufacturers in the United States have pledged to make more of the sanitary products to address shortages in the country. One firm told the BBC the pandemic had caused staff shortages at its plants. Social media users have been posting about their experiences as they struggle to find sanitary products. One Reddit user said they visited eight stores to find tampons with a cardboard applicator, before deciding to buy them online ""at a noticeable mark-up"". It comes as the war in Ukraine is making the raw materials used in sanitary products more costly. The shortage is also adding to concerns that supply chain disruptions could further push up prices for essential goods around the world. A spokesperson for Edgewell Personal Care, which makes Playtex and o.b. tampons, said that its stocks have been ""impacted due to extensive workforce shortages caused by two separate Omicron surges in the US and Canada in late 2021 and early 2022, respectively"". ""We have been operating our manufacturing facilities around the clock to build back inventory and anticipate returning to normal levels in the coming weeks,"" the spokesperson added. Online groups hunt for baby formula during US shortage Student gives period pads to Ukrainian refugees Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble (P&G), the maker of the Tampax tampon brand, said in a statement that it was ""working hard to ramp up production"". ""We can assure you this is a temporary situation,"" said the company, which sells around 4.5bn boxes of tampons globally each year. P&G's chief financial officer, Andre Schulten, said at a recent earnings call that it has been ""costly and highly volatile"" to acquire raw materials such as cotton and plastic for tampons. ""It is so important at this point for people to buy only what they need. I am not a supply chain expert but we know that some of the shortages we all experienced early in the pandemic were due to hoarding,"" Elise Joy, the co-founder and executive director of US charity Girls Helping Girls Period, said. ""Menstrual products are not a luxury item, and if we all take or buy what we need it will go a long way to making sure more people can get basic supplies,"" she added. A spokesperson for the US pharmacy chain Walgreens told the BBC that it was ""experiencing some temporary brand-specific tampon shortage in certain geographies"". ""While we will continue to have products at shelf and online, it may only be in specific brands while we navigate the supply disruption,"" the spokesperson added.

"Rising prices see basic pay fall fastest since 2011Pay excluding bonuses is failing to keep up with the rising cost of living, official statistics show.Business","Regular pay is falling at the fastest rate in more than a decade when taking into account rising prices, the Office for National Statistics has said. Between February and April, pay excluding bonuses was down 2.2% from a year earlier when adjusted for inflation,the ONS said,external. UK household budgets are being squeezed by record fuel and energy costs. However, pay including bonuses is outpacing price rises, rising by 0.4% when taking inflation into account. Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the ONS, said a ""high level of bonuses"" was continuing to ""cushion the effects of rising prices on total earnings for some workers"". ""But if you exclude bonuses, pay in real terms is falling at its fastest rate in over a decade,"" she added. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the UK's jobs market ""remains robust"" with redundancies at an all-time low. ""Helping people into work is the best way to support families in the long term, and we are continuing to support people into new and better jobs,"" he added. But Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said ""millions in work are in poverty"" and accused ministers of showing ""utter complacency about the huge levels of economic inactivity"". When adjusted for inflation, regular pay has fallen roughly by 1.6% for private sector workers and 4.5% for those in the public sector. The ONS noted that the latest wage figures are compared with the same period in 2021 when Covid restrictions were in place and some workers were furloughed. Fears for UK economy grow as higher prices bite Worried households cut back on energy and food The number of job vacancies in the UK rose to a new record of 1.3 million from March to May, the ONS said. The unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in the February to April period, up slightly from last month, while the employment rate was 75.6%, which is still lower than before the pandemic. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said that with record numbers of roles available, ""pay is growing strongly as companies seek to attract people to work for them"". But he warned if ""we don't address the fact that there are not enough people looking for work, this could put another dampener on the UK's economic growth"". Josh Goodall, the co-managing director of building company Elite Building Maintenance in West Yorkshire, told the BBC that trying to recruit experienced tradespeople such as builders, joiners and plasterers was ""an absolute nightmare"" in the current climate. ""We have got a couple of young lads working for us and they are currently getting trained up at the moment, but you can only train so many people and you need experienced workers,"" he said. The latest statistics on job vacancies showed hospitality and healthcare were among the sectors with the highest number of jobs available, with construction and manufacturing also having high vacancy numbers. Jamie Keegan (L) and Joshua Goodall (R) are struggling to recruit experienced tradespeople for their building firm Mr Goodall said that as a result of the tight labour market, he was having to raise wages, with an experienced builder now asking for about Â£250 per day, compared with about Â£150 before the pandemic. This, along with the soaring costs of materials such as timber and cement, has led to the company charging more. ""We are almost apologising [to customers] saying materials have gone up, fuel has gone up, waste costs have gone up,"" said Mr Goodall. ""We feel like it's an expensive price but the amount we are making is less than it was before."" The jobs numbers remain a welcome relief from the stagflation seen elsewhere in the UK figures, but the strength here appears to be peaking. Unemployment remains very low and there was an overall rise in employment over the past three months, though not yet recovering all the lost jobs since before the pandemic. Still there were some signs of a turning point under the hood of these numbers. Unemployment actually edged up a little. And looking at the single month figures for April, when energy bills spiked and taxes went up, unemployment was up to 4.2% and employment notably down. For those with jobs, ordinary pay fell in real terms at the fastest rate for a decade. In the private sector, bonuses are cushioning this for some workers reflecting one-off payments and recruitment into new jobs. Vacancies remain at record levels too, with a worker shortage starting to have visible consequences at airports and in the NHS. But the defining economic question still to be answered is how much wages can compensate for the surge in the rate of price rises. The answer so far is not much, especially in the public sector. The ONS added the the number of ""economically inactive"" people - those without a job and not seeking to work - had fallen slightly in the past three months, but was still higher than before Covid struck. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies,tweeted,externalthat the ""incredibly tight"" labour market reflected a smaller workforce than before the pandemic, with up to one million workers now ""missing"". Ms Beckett from the ONS said that at the start of the pandemic many young people leaving education had ""disengaged"" from looking for work due to most businesses and work places being shut during lockdowns. But she told the BBC's Today programme that the ""story had changed"" more recently with more people over the age of 50 becoming economically inactive by ""retiring early, or just not needing to work, or indeed suffering ill health"". A member of the ""missing million"" is Kevin Butler, who retired from his 17-year career in recruitment to make music. The 54-year-old said the pandemic changed his perspective on work when he was furloughed. ""I'm lucky in that I've worked for a long time and been sensible with money in the past and paid off my mortgage, and those little things that make a difference on an everyday basis,"" he added.

Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Time to talk Scottish independence - Nicola Sturgeon,"Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon launches a fresh independence campaign and says she ""stands ready"" to negotiate with PM Boris Johnson to hold a second referendum When the country held the first vote in 2014 its go-ahead was possible because the UK government granted the necessary power, called a Section 30 order However, in the near eight years that have passed two Conservative prime ministers - Theresa May and Mr Johnson - have refused to give that order a second time Ms Sturgeon now says she is confident that Scotland can navigate towards a legal independence vote and the detail of how that could be done would be presented to the Scottish Parliament ""very soon"" In response to the new campaign, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""The UK government's position is that now is not the time to be talking about another referendum.""

Professor Sir John Curtice Professor Sir John Curtice tells BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme: ""If you take the last half dozen polls, they on average point to Yes 48, No 52."" The political scientist says the polls have pointed to 50:50 with ""Yes"" or ""No"" slightly ahead since the Spring of 2019. We've now had about three years of Scotland basically being divided down the middle."" John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Things seem narrower now than in 2014, he says. He explains that those in favour of independence want a referendum before 2026 although not all would move as fast as as that. Both sides need to campaign, because at the moment neither side in the argument can be sure of winning."" John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Having released the first of six papers on the new independence push -""Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external- Ms Sturgeon says there is no schedule for when the other papers will be published ""We haven't determined or decided yet the precise order and sequencing and dates for the subsequent papers,"" she says. The papers will be released ""fairly steadily"" over the months in the latter part of this year, Ms Sturgeon adds. The other papers are expected to look at a number of areas including:  In response to a question about where oil will feature in the campaign Ms Sturgeon points out the importance of a just transition from oil and gas. Ms Sturgeon explains the joint position of herself and Patrick Harvie which is ""we have to accelerate the move away from fossil fuels"". ""There are massive economic advantages in that transition,"" she adds. Patrick Harvie says the position of the Scottish government has changed since 2014. The reality of how fast the transition must be undertaken has become clear, he adds. ""We can make that change in a fair as well as a fast way."" Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond were on the campaign trail together in 2014 The first minister tells the press conference that the campaign for independence will be a broad church and ""that is one of it's strengths"" because independence is about democracy. Asked if she would share a platform with former first minister Alex Salmond, she said: ""That probably qualifies as one of the least important questions of the entire independence debate. ""It's not about me, it's not about Alex Salmond. With the greatest of respect, it is not even about Patrick Harvie - it's about the future of Scotland."" Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond together led the last independence campaign in 2014 but they fell out after sexual misconduct allegations were made against the former first minister. Mr Salmond strongly denied the allegations and was cleared of 13 charges in court. Conclusion The Scottish government's paper concludes with an acknowledgement that an independent Scotland could not be transformed to match the success of the comparator countries overnight. But it says the comparator country models - especially the Nordic countries - illustrate the range of choices that would be available to an independent Scotland able to pursue different policies from those adopted by Westminster over many years. Independence by itself will not guarantee improved performance, it says. It adds that it welcomes a national debate about how an independent country can create a wealthier, happier and fairer Scotland. Read it in full,external UK model The Scottish government paper goes on to say that commentators have attributed the UK's relatively weak productivity and relatively high income inequality to the short-termism resulting from the UK's distinct approach to ownership and governance, the failure to develop effective institutions and lack of commitment to industrial strategy. Different models The second section of the Scottish government paper seeks to highlight some of the factors that help explain the better performance of the comparator countries relative to the UK. Asked by the Financial Times whether losing an independence referendum would write off any prospect of a split in the union forever, Ms Sturgeon laughs and says the moral of the story is that ""we don't lose it, and we don't intend to"". ""I am as certain as it is possible to be that at the next time of asking people in Scotland will not miss the opportunity to vote for independence,"" the first minister says. She adds that polls showing a 50/50 split in support were a ""very, very good starting point"" for the campaign. First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has launched the first in a series of papers which she says will set
out and debate the case for Scotland's independence. The first paper is entitled:""Independence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external It looks at 10 comparator countries - Denmark, Sweden, Finland,
Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands -
and compares the UK's performance across a range of economic and social
indicators. Ms Sturgeon said these independent countries were a similar size
to Scotland but were wealthier, fairer and more productive than the UK. Comparisons
to the UK Asked by a reporter from Sky News why voters should believe there would be any better outcomes for people in an independent Scotland, the first minister said Scotland was ""seeing real progress, coupled with real challenge, across a range of the responsibilities we have under our control right now"". People have to decide whether they trust a democratically elected government in Scotland, of whatever party, over a UK government to make decisions for them, Ms Sturgeon says. ""Scrutiny is not something that has not been something that has been in short supply in Scotland,"" she adds. ""I've been first minister for less than eight years, I've fought eight elections in that time and my party has won all of them. ""The trust in the party that leads the Scottish government has been demonstrated."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says the Nicola Sturgeon's speech was a ""disappointing return to the politics of the past - the politics of strife and division"". âThousands of Scots are being forced to choose between
heating and eating and even more are facing sharp bill rises; our NHS is in
disarray with lives being lost as a result and our transport infrastructure is
falling apart before our eyes,"" he said. âFor Nicola Sturgeon to turn her back on the issues facing
the people of Scotland and decide at this point to focus on her own obsession
is a sad example of how out of touch this government are. âNicola Sturgeon has no answer to the vital economic questions
posed by independence, no plan to deliver a referendum and no intention to
listen to the majority of Scots who are opposed to independence. âInstead, the first minister wants to feed off Boris Johnson
and his Tory government to fuel her own political ambitions. âYou cannot play politics while peopleâs lives and
livelihoods are in the balance."" James CookScotland Editor, BBC News Why is this renewed push for independence happening? The answer is simple. The people of Scotland voted for it. Of course there is plenty of opposition to, and concern about, a second independence referendum but it remains an inescapable fact that in last year's elections to the Scottish Parliament voters returned a majority of MSPs, both SNP and Green, who had pledged to hold one. When this happened in 2011, there was a referendum. If that was the accepted trigger then, why is it not the trigger now?
That is primarily a question for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The SNPâs argument is that if his Conservative party previously regarded a majority at Holyrood as a mandate for a poll, why is he thwarting the will of Scotlandâs voters now? Having said that, First Minister
Nicola Sturgeon must operate in the world as she finds it not as she wants it
to be and at todayâs news conference the SNP leader simply did not or could not
detail the alternative path she intends to follow if Mr Johnson persists in his
refusal. There are also difficult questions
for both Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson about the ""why"" as well as the
""how"" of independence. Among those for supporters of
independence, is it sensible to ditch nuclear weapons with a belligerent Russia
at large? Can green energy really replace oil as the engine of the Scottish
economy? If leaving the European Union has damaged the UK, why wouldnât leaving
an even older and more entrenched union be much worse for Scotland? For supporters of the union,
arenât the comparisons with other small European nations set out in todayâs
paper an indictment of British failure? Why has the UK, and Scotland within it,
performed so poorly on GDP, income inequality, poverty, productivity and other
indicators set out in the 71-page document? In 2014 the prospectus for an
independent Scotland was subject to rigorous and detailed scrutiny. Ms
Sturgeonâs aim with these papers is to ensure the same scrutiny is applied to
the UK. In response to the launch of the new independence campaign, Downing Street has again rejected the case for another referendum. The prime minister's official spokesman told Press Association: ""The UK government's position is that now is not the time to be talking about another referendum. """"We are confident that the people of Scotland want and expect their governments to be working together to focus on issues like the global cost-of-living challenges, like war in Europe and the issues that matter to their families and their communities."" Ciaran Jenkins, the Scotland correspondent for Channel 4 News, says the first minister wants to be in the EU. He asks if Ms Sturgeon agrees with every reputable expert who says there will be checks on goods going from England and Wales to Scotland and there will be a trade border between England and Scotland. The first minister says if Scotland is in the single market there will be issues, there will be regulatory and customs requirements. She says these challenges can be managed in a way that does not affect our businesses and the benefits outweigh them. The first minister is asked about the ""inevitable"" hard border between Scotland and England, should an independent Scotland join the EU. She says she will ""confront the implications of Brexit"" in another of the six papers they are releasing. ""The UK government is in a deep mess over the Northern Ireland protocol,"" she add. Scotland would remain within the common travel area but would have to work out how to operate within the market in a way that isn't damaging to the south of Scotland or businesses, she adds. The first minister says they want to avoid replicating the UK's difficulties caused by a ""lack of being honest"" and lack of planning.  This video can not be played Indyref without section 30 'if necessary', but must be lawful - FM Answering a question about moving ahead without a section 30 order, Ms Sturgeon says she cannot discuss it yet. ""We are dealing with a prime minster that doesn't respect democracy, the law or any of the norms that underpin democracies in most other countries,"" she says. ""I believe we can navigate a path forward"", she says, adding that she wants to do it properly. The BBC's James Cook says none of the comparator countries Ms Sturgeon referred to have been embedded in a 300 year old trading and political union with their closest neighbour. Mr Cook asks if leaving the EU has been as disastrous for Scotland why wouldn't leaving this ""far more deeply embedded union be much worse"". Ms Sturgeon says there was no planning or ""basic honesty"" with Brexit and she says today's document has more ""thought, there is more evidence and planning for the way ahead than there was for the entirety of the Brexit campaign"". The first minister adds: ""If all of these countries can be as successful, relative to the UK as they are, then with hard work, with commitment and good planning then why not Scotland?"" ""It will be the people of Scotland that make that choice."" STV's Colin Mackay asks if the first minister has contacted the PM in writing today. Ms Sturgeon ponders whether Boris Johnson will be watching and just in case says to him: ""I stand ready to negotiate a Section 30 order if you now decide you are a democrat."" A Section 30 order would allow a temporary transfer of power to the Scottish Parliament which would allow a referendum to happen. Mr Mackay asks what's going to change in relation to this issue, with two prime ministers having rejected it already. Ms Sturgeon says: ""What's going to change is I will set out a lawful way forward without a Section 30 if that is what is required."" ""We have a UK government that does not respect democracy and does not respect the rule of law."" Â© 2025 BBC.

She says these challenges can be managed in a way that does not affect our businesses and the benefits outweigh them.

LiveLiveNew Scottish independence campaign to be launched6 minutes ago,"Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon launches a fresh independence campaign and says she ""stands ready"" to negotiate with PM Boris Johnson to hold a second referendum When the country held the first vote in 2014 its go-ahead was possible because the UK government granted the necessary power, called a Section 30 order However, in the near eight years that have passed two Conservative prime ministers - Theresa May and Mr Johnson - have refused to give that order a second time Ms Sturgeon now says she is confident that Scotland can navigate towards a legal independence vote and the detail of how that could be done would be presented to the Scottish Parliament ""very soon"" In response to the new campaign, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""The UK government's position is that now is not the time to be talking about another referendum.""

Professor Sir John Curtice Professor Sir John Curtice tells BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme: ""If you take the last half dozen polls, they on average point to Yes 48, No 52."" The political scientist says the polls have pointed to 50:50 with ""Yes"" or ""No"" slightly ahead since the Spring of 2019. We've now had about three years of Scotland basically being divided down the middle."" John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Things seem narrower now than in 2014, he says. He explains that those in favour of independence want a referendum before 2026 although not all would move as fast as as that. Both sides need to campaign, because at the moment neither side in the argument can be sure of winning."" John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde Having released the first of six papers on the new independence push -""Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external- Ms Sturgeon says there is no schedule for when the other papers will be published ""We haven't determined or decided yet the precise order and sequencing and dates for the subsequent papers,"" she says. The papers will be released ""fairly steadily"" over the months in the latter part of this year, Ms Sturgeon adds. The other papers are expected to look at a number of areas including:  In response to a question about where oil will feature in the campaign Ms Sturgeon points out the importance of a just transition from oil and gas. Ms Sturgeon explains the joint position of herself and Patrick Harvie which is ""we have to accelerate the move away from fossil fuels"". ""There are massive economic advantages in that transition,"" she adds. Patrick Harvie says the position of the Scottish government has changed since 2014. The reality of how fast the transition must be undertaken has become clear, he adds. ""We can make that change in a fair as well as a fast way."" Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond were on the campaign trail together in 2014 The first minister tells the press conference that the campaign for independence will be a broad church and ""that is one of it's strengths"" because independence is about democracy. Asked if she would share a platform with former first minister Alex Salmond, she said: ""That probably qualifies as one of the least important questions of the entire independence debate. ""It's not about me, it's not about Alex Salmond. With the greatest of respect, it is not even about Patrick Harvie - it's about the future of Scotland."" Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond together led the last independence campaign in 2014 but they fell out after sexual misconduct allegations were made against the former first minister. Mr Salmond strongly denied the allegations and was cleared of 13 charges in court. Conclusion The Scottish government's paper concludes with an acknowledgement that an independent Scotland could not be transformed to match the success of the comparator countries overnight. But it says the comparator country models - especially the Nordic countries - illustrate the range of choices that would be available to an independent Scotland able to pursue different policies from those adopted by Westminster over many years. Independence by itself will not guarantee improved performance, it says. It adds that it welcomes a national debate about how an independent country can create a wealthier, happier and fairer Scotland. Read it in full,external UK model The Scottish government paper goes on to say that commentators have attributed the UK's relatively weak productivity and relatively high income inequality to the short-termism resulting from the UK's distinct approach to ownership and governance, the failure to develop effective institutions and lack of commitment to industrial strategy. Different models The second section of the Scottish government paper seeks to highlight some of the factors that help explain the better performance of the comparator countries relative to the UK. Asked by the Financial Times whether losing an independence referendum would write off any prospect of a split in the union forever, Ms Sturgeon laughs and says the moral of the story is that ""we don't lose it, and we don't intend to"". ""I am as certain as it is possible to be that at the next time of asking people in Scotland will not miss the opportunity to vote for independence,"" the first minister says. She adds that polls showing a 50/50 split in support were a ""very, very good starting point"" for the campaign. First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has launched the first in a series of papers which she says will set
out and debate the case for Scotland's independence. The first paper is entitled:""Independence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"",external It looks at 10 comparator countries - Denmark, Sweden, Finland,
Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands -
and compares the UK's performance across a range of economic and social
indicators. Ms Sturgeon said these independent countries were a similar size
to Scotland but were wealthier, fairer and more productive than the UK. Comparisons
to the UK Asked by a reporter from Sky News why voters should believe there would be any better outcomes for people in an independent Scotland, the first minister said Scotland was ""seeing real progress, coupled with real challenge, across a range of the responsibilities we have under our control right now"". People have to decide whether they trust a democratically elected government in Scotland, of whatever party, over a UK government to make decisions for them, Ms Sturgeon says. ""Scrutiny is not something that has not been something that has been in short supply in Scotland,"" she adds. ""I've been first minister for less than eight years, I've fought eight elections in that time and my party has won all of them. ""The trust in the party that leads the Scottish government has been demonstrated."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says the Nicola Sturgeon's speech was a ""disappointing return to the politics of the past - the politics of strife and division"". âThousands of Scots are being forced to choose between
heating and eating and even more are facing sharp bill rises; our NHS is in
disarray with lives being lost as a result and our transport infrastructure is
falling apart before our eyes,"" he said. âFor Nicola Sturgeon to turn her back on the issues facing
the people of Scotland and decide at this point to focus on her own obsession
is a sad example of how out of touch this government are. âNicola Sturgeon has no answer to the vital economic questions
posed by independence, no plan to deliver a referendum and no intention to
listen to the majority of Scots who are opposed to independence. âInstead, the first minister wants to feed off Boris Johnson
and his Tory government to fuel her own political ambitions. âYou cannot play politics while peopleâs lives and
livelihoods are in the balance."" James CookScotland Editor, BBC News Why is this renewed push for independence happening? The answer is simple. The people of Scotland voted for it. Of course there is plenty of opposition to, and concern about, a second independence referendum but it remains an inescapable fact that in last year's elections to the Scottish Parliament voters returned a majority of MSPs, both SNP and Green, who had pledged to hold one. When this happened in 2011, there was a referendum. If that was the accepted trigger then, why is it not the trigger now?
That is primarily a question for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The SNPâs argument is that if his Conservative party previously regarded a majority at Holyrood as a mandate for a poll, why is he thwarting the will of Scotlandâs voters now? Having said that, First Minister
Nicola Sturgeon must operate in the world as she finds it not as she wants it
to be and at todayâs news conference the SNP leader simply did not or could not
detail the alternative path she intends to follow if Mr Johnson persists in his
refusal. There are also difficult questions
for both Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson about the ""why"" as well as the
""how"" of independence. Among those for supporters of
independence, is it sensible to ditch nuclear weapons with a belligerent Russia
at large? Can green energy really replace oil as the engine of the Scottish
economy? If leaving the European Union has damaged the UK, why wouldnât leaving
an even older and more entrenched union be much worse for Scotland? For supporters of the union,
arenât the comparisons with other small European nations set out in todayâs
paper an indictment of British failure? Why has the UK, and Scotland within it,
performed so poorly on GDP, income inequality, poverty, productivity and other
indicators set out in the 71-page document? In 2014 the prospectus for an
independent Scotland was subject to rigorous and detailed scrutiny. Ms
Sturgeonâs aim with these papers is to ensure the same scrutiny is applied to
the UK. In response to the launch of the new independence campaign, Downing Street has again rejected the case for another referendum. The prime minister's official spokesman told Press Association: ""The UK government's position is that now is not the time to be talking about another referendum. """"We are confident that the people of Scotland want and expect their governments to be working together to focus on issues like the global cost-of-living challenges, like war in Europe and the issues that matter to their families and their communities.""

'How to murder your husband' writer jailed for life,"Murder, she wrote - and for murder, she is going to jail. An Oregon judge has sentenced Nancy Crampton Brophy, a romance author who apparently foretold of her crime in an essay titled ""How to murder your husband"", to life in prison for the shooting death of her late spouse. Crampton Brophy, 71, was found guilty of second degree murder last month. A jury found that she shot her husband of 26 years in 2018 for a $1.5m (Â£1.2m) life insurance pay-out. Before her crime, Crampton Brophy had been a self-published author whose works of steamy romance and suspense include novels such as ""The Wrong Husband"" and ""The Wrong Lover"". Her late husband, Daniel Brophy, was a chef and respected teacher at the Oregon Culinary Institute. He was found shot twice in the kitchen of the Institute in June 2018. His widow was convicted of the murder last month. The case attracted much attention for an essay Crampton Brophy had written years before the crime, titled ""How to murder your husband"". ""The thing I know about murder is that every one of us have it in him/her when pushed far enough,"" she had said in the now-deleted post. She listed a number of ways to commit mariticide, from guns and knives to poison and hitmen before writing ""it is easier to wish people dead than to actually kill them"". She added: ""If the murder is supposed to set me free, I certainly don't want to spend any time in jail"". A judge ruled against admitting the essay as evidence at her trial because it was penned years earlier as part of a writing seminar. But prosecutors did not need the text. They successfully argued that Crampton Brophy had the motive and the means to murder her partner, showing the couple had fallen on hard times financially, and she stood to pocket a hefty insurance pay-out after his death. Daniel Brophy Crampton Brophy was seen driving to and from the Institute at the time of the crime in surveillance footage shown in court. And although police never found the murder weapon, she was shown to have purchased a gun of the same make and model. Taking the stand in her own defence, the author claimed she had a ""memory hole"" from the morning of Brophy's death. She could not however deny it was her driving around the Institute. A jury of 12 found her guilty of second-degree murder after deliberating for less than two days. Her life sentence, handed down on Monday, carries the possibility of parole after 25 years. Her lawyers said they plan to appeal. Ahead of the sentencing, friends and family members of the late chef delivered statements. ""You opted to lie, cheat, steal, defraud and ultimately kill the man that was your biggest fan,"" said Nathaniel Stillwater, Brophy's son from a previous marriage. ""You were - to borrow from your catalogue - the wrong wife.""

Rising prices see regular pay fall fastest since 2011,"Regular pay is falling at the fastest rate in more than a decade when taking into account rising prices, the Office for National Statistics has said. Between February and April, pay excluding bonuses was down 2.2% from a year earlier when adjusted for inflation,the ONS said,external. UK household budgets are being squeezed by record fuel and energy costs. However, pay including bonuses is outpacing price rises, rising by 0.4% when taking inflation into account. Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the ONS, said a ""high level of bonuses"" was continuing to ""cushion the effects of rising prices on total earnings for some workers"". ""But if you exclude bonuses, pay in real terms is falling at its fastest rate in over a decade,"" she added. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the UK's jobs market ""remains robust"" with redundancies at an all-time low. ""Helping people into work is the best way to support families in the long term, and we are continuing to support people into new and better jobs,"" he added. But Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said ""millions in work are in poverty"" and accused ministers of showing ""utter complacency about the huge levels of economic inactivity"". When adjusted for inflation, regular pay has fallen roughly by 1.6% for private sector workers and 4.5% for those in the public sector. The ONS noted that the latest wage figures are compared with the same period in 2021 when Covid restrictions were in place and some workers were furloughed. Fears for UK economy grow as higher prices bite Worried households cut back on energy and food The number of job vacancies in the UK rose to a new record of 1.3 million from March to May, the ONS said. The unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in the February to April period, up slightly from last month, while the employment rate was 75.6%, which is still lower than before the pandemic.

But he warned if ""we don't address the fact that there are not enough people looking for work, this could put another dampener on the UK's economic growth"". Josh Goodall, the co-managing director of building company Elite Building Maintenance in West Yorkshire, told the BBC that trying to recruit experienced tradespeople such as builders, joiners and plasterers was ""an absolute nightmare"" in the current climate. ""We have got a couple of young lads working for us and they are currently getting trained up at the moment, but you can only train so many people and you need experienced workers,"" he said. The latest statistics on job vacancies showed hospitality and healthcare were among the sectors with the highest number of jobs available, with construction and manufacturing also having high vacancy numbers. Jamie Keegan (L) and Joshua Goodall (R) are struggling to recruit experienced tradespeople for their building firm Mr Goodall said that as a result of the tight labour market, he was having to raise wages, with an experienced builder now asking for about Â£250 per day, compared with about Â£150 before the pandemic. This, along with the soaring costs of materials such as timber and cement, has led to the company charging more. ""We are almost apologising [to customers] saying materials have gone up, fuel has gone up, waste costs have gone up,"" said Mr Goodall. ""We feel like it's an expensive price but the amount we are making is less than it was before."" The jobs numbers remain a welcome relief from the stagflation seen elsewhere in the UK figures, but the strength here appears to be peaking. Unemployment remains very low and there was an overall rise in employment over the past three months, though not yet recovering all the lost jobs since before the pandemic. Still there were some signs of a turning point under the hood of these numbers. Unemployment actually edged up a little. And looking at the single month figures for April, when energy bills spiked and taxes went up, unemployment was up to 4.2% and employment notably down. For those with jobs, ordinary pay fell in real terms at the fastest rate for a decade. In the private sector, bonuses are cushioning this for some workers reflecting one-off payments and recruitment into new jobs. Vacancies remain at record levels too, with a worker shortage starting to have visible consequences at airports and in the NHS. But the defining economic question still to be answered is how much wages can compensate for the surge in the rate of price rises. The answer so far is not much, especially in the public sector. The ONS added the the number of ""economically inactive"" people - those without a job and not seeking to work - had fallen slightly in the past three months, but was still higher than before Covid struck. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies,tweeted,externalthat the ""incredibly tight"" labour market reflected a smaller workforce than before the pandemic, with up to one million workers now ""missing"". Ms Beckett from the ONS said that at the start of the pandemic many young people leaving education had ""disengaged"" from looking for work due to most businesses and work places being shut during lockdowns. But she told the BBC's Today programme that the ""story had changed"" more recently with more people over the age of 50 becoming economically inactive by ""retiring early, or just not needing to work, or indeed suffering ill health"". A member of the ""missing million"" is Kevin Butler, who retired from his 17-year career in recruitment to make music.

"Truss urges DUP to return to power sharingThe foreign secretary urges unionists to ""get on with it"" as parliament prepares to vote on a Brexit plan.Northern Ireland","Northern Ireland's political parties should return to power sharing ""as soon as possible"", the UK foreign secretary has said. Liz Truss urged the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to ""get on with it"". But DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said that would depend on whether Parliament backed a planto get rid of parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MichÃ©al Martin said the plan was ""dispiriting"" and ""an assault on an international agreement"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Michelle O'Neill urged the DUP to stop blocking the formation of a Stormont Executive. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. It prevents a hard border with the Republic of Ireland, but it means checks on some goods arriving into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK - a situation opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland who argue it creates a trade border in the Irish Sea. The DUP has refused to form a new power-sharing executive until its concerns about the protocol are addressed. How will government's NI Protocol plans affect businesses? But Ms O'Neill accused the Prime Minister of ""pandering"" to the DUP at Westminster. She said there should be no further delay on forming an executive and called for both sides to find an agreed way forward on the protocol. ""Society and the people should not be held to ransom while that work continues,"" she said. ""What we want is an executive formed today; we're ready to be there today."" However, the DUP leader said there was ""a stark choice here for Parliament"". ""TheNorthern Ireland ProtocolandGood Friday Agreementcannot exist together,"" he said. ""One seriously harms the other."" He said the protocol undermined the ""cross-community consensus on which the political institutions operate"". ""Parliament can either choose to go forward with the [Good Friday] Agreement and the political institutions and stability in Northern Ireland, or the protocol, but it can't have both,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. Sir Jeffrey said the consent of unionists was required On Monday, the UK governmentpublished the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, to be debated and voted on by Parliament. At the centre of the government's plan to ease the impact on businesses is the concept of green lanes and red lanes for trade. This would mean: Goods coming from Great Britain (GB) into Northern Ireland (NI) and which are staying would use the green lane. This means there would be no checks and paperwork would be minimal. GB goods moving through NI into Ireland or the wider European Union would use the red lane and continue to be checked at NI ports. London also wants any trade disputes resolved by ""independent arbitration"", not by the European Court of Justice, and Northern Ireland to benefit from the same tax breaks as elsewhere in the UK. Sir Jeffrey said that without the support and consent of unionists, the Stormont institutions could not operate. His party, which won the second-most seats in the recent Northern Ireland Assembly elections, argues it creates a divide that could lead to the break-up of the UK. It is refusing to set up a new Northern Ireland executive with Sinn FÃ©in - which won the most seats in the election - and other parties, until changes are made to it. A majority of MLAs in the Stormont Assembly signed a joint letter to the prime minister stating their opposition to the proposed legislation to amend the protocol. It was signed by 52 of the 90 assembly members (MLAs) representing Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party. UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal What is the Northern Ireland Protocol row about? ""People deserve to have a government. We have published this bill which does deliver for all the communities of Northern Ireland,"" Ms Truss told the programme. She said that triggering Article 16 ""wouldn't have resolved tax issue and custom issues"" and instead would merely have ""kicked the can down the road"". ""If I could get negotiated solution with EU that would be my first preference. ""I have looked at all the options this is the only option that creates the long term, durable solution that the people of NI deserve,"" she added. MicheÃ¡l Martin warned that there was an issue around trust Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin described as ""reckless""  the UK government's decision to proceed unilaterally in dealing with the Northern Ireland Protocol. Speaking in the DÃ¡il (lower house of parliament) on Tuesday, Mr Martin said the British government was not acting in good faith. The taoiseach said the London move had the potential to destabilise politics in Northern Ireland and had to be seen in the context of internal British politics. He said business leaders in Northern Ireland supported the protocol and whatever problems there were could be sorted through negotiation with the EU. There has been a mixed reaction from businesses in Northern Ireland to the government's plans. Manufacturing NI said thatwhile the protocol needed reformed it did not need a ""wrecking ball"".

UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Liz Truss says the UK government's proposed Northern Ireland Protocol changes are ""within international law"". The UK government has published plans to get rid of parts of the post-Brexit deal it agreed with the EU in 2019. It wants to change the Northern Ireland Protocol to make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. But the EU opposes the move, saying going back on the deal breaches international law. Theprotocolis the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. It prevents a hard border with the Republic of Ireland, but it means checks on some goods arriving into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK - a situation opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland who argue it creates a trade border in the Irish Sea. At the centre of the government's plan to ease the impact on businesses is the concept of green lanes and red lanes for trade. This would mean: Goods coming from Great Britain (GB) into Northern Ireland (NI) and which are staying would use the green lane. This means there would be no checks and paperwork would be minimal. GB goods moving through NI into Ireland or the wider European Union would use the red lane and continue to be checked at NI ports. London also wants any trade disputes resolved by ""independent arbitration"" and not by the European Court of Justice, and Northern Ireland to benefit from the same tax breaks as elsewhere in the UK. The government says there is ""no other way"" of safeguarding essential interests of the UK. It argues the term ""necessity"" is used in international law to justify situations where ""the only way a state can safeguard an essential interest"" is by disapplying - or breaking - another international obligation. It adds that action taken must not ""seriously impair"" essential interests of other states. The alterations are set out in theNorthern Ireland Protocol Bill,external, to be debated and voted on by Parliament. How will NI protocol plans affect businesses? A simple guide to the Brexit border problem How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said it was ""a reasonable, practical solution to the problems facing Northern Ireland"" and that the UK could ""only make progress through negotiations if the EU are willing to change the protocol itself"", adding: ""At the moment they aren't."" ""We are very clear that we're acting in line with the law,"" she said. The government said it would prefer a ""negotiated solution"" with the EU that avoids the need for the bill to become law. There's no  appetite amongst EU leaders for a full-blown trade war with the UK. They have their hands full with the cost of living crisis and the war in Ukraine. So the EU didn't want to overreact to today's UK government legislation proposal - after all it's not law yet - but neither did it want to underreact. Attempting unilaterally to over-ride large parts of the protocol agreed and signed by Boris Johnson is seen as a very big deal in Brussels. As a warning, the EU will look to re-start legal proceedings against the UK for alleged breaches of the protocol - such as failing to carry out certain checks. At the same time, the EU's chief negotiator has implored the UK to come back to the negotiating table. He says the EU will soon publish new proposals to iron out practical problems thrown up by the protocol for people in Northern Ireland. Away from the drama playing out right now, there are clear areas like customs lanes where the EU and the UK government aren't far apart at all. But the mood music is dreadful. Three parties in Northern Ireland - Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP - say the protocol is necessary to mitigate the effects of Brexit in Northern Ireland. However no unionist supports the protocol as it stands. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which won the second-most seats in the recent Northern Ireland Assembly elections, argues it creates a divide that could lead to the break-up of the UK. It is refusing to set up a new ruling Northern Ireland executive with Sinn FÃ©in, which won most seats in the election, until changes are made to it. Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill accused the prime minister of creating more instability and uncertainty in Northern Ireland. ""Boris Johnson's action is illegal, he is in clear breach of international law, regardless of the detail,"" she said. ""He himself signed up to an agreement, he signed on the dotted line and he's now legislating to breach that international agreement."" She added that the protocol was working - and she accused the DUP of blocking the formation of an Executive in Northern Ireland. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: ""I don't believe what the government is proposing is illegal. I believe it is a solution and that is what we need - solutions."" He added: ""We have strong support from across unionism for the stand that we are taking. ""I believe that our pressure is seeing progress being made and we will continue to work with government to ensure that this legislation progresses."" This video can not be played NI Protocol: Sinn FÃ©in and DUP disagree over plan to change NI Protocol The government, in its legal justification for this new bill, has also cited Article 16 - a clause in the NI Protocol that allows either side to take safeguarding measures if applying the protocol leads to serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that restrict trade. The government has argued that maintaining peace in Northern Ireland, protecting the Good Friday Agreement, and preserving economic and social ties between Northern Ireland and Great Britain are ""essential interests"" of the UK. But it says the protocol currently stands as a ""barrier"" to forming a new governing executive in Northern Ireland. It says while the government's preference is a negotiated outcome with the EU, in the meantime the ""strain"" that the protocol is placing on Northern Ireland has reached the point where the government ""has no other way of safeguarding the essential interests at stake"" than this new bill. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said renegotiating the protocol is unrealistic and unilateral action by the UK is ""damaging to mutual trust"". Maros Sefcovic said what the UK was doing was damaging to mutual trust He said the protocol was the ""one and only solution"" to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland, while addressing the challenges created by Brexit. ""It is with significant concern that we take note of today's decision by the UK government to table legislation disapplying core elements of the protocol,"" he said. ""The commission will now assess the UK draft legislation."" The White House press secretary said the US administration recognises ""challenges over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol."" ""We urge the UK and the EU to return to talks to resolve these differences,"" the press secretary said. Businesses which import Great Britain goods to Northern Ireland have experienced difficulties with the protocol as the checks and controls add cost and complexity. Food and horticulture importers have faced the greatest problems, as those goods face the most onerous controls. However, exporters, including food exporters, have benefited because unlike other parts of the UK they have maintained frictionless access to EU markets. Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin called for negotiations between the UK and EU to deal with the impasse. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government's legislation risks a ""deeply damaging"" trade war with the EU. Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it was ""a desperate attempt by Boris Johnson to distract from the drama of his leadership crisis"". Meanwhile, Stuart Anderson from the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industrysaid it was ready to play its part in supporting lasting solutionsthat work for businesses and households. ""While there are attractive elements in today's proposals for consumer facing businesses in particular, a careful balance must be struck to protect gains made to date by our exporters and agri-food sub-sectors,"" he said.

LiveLiveCivilians trapped as last bridge to key city destroyed18 minutes ago,"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

This video can not be played EU leaders support Ukraine's membership bid European Union leaders have publicly backed Ukraine's ""immediate"" candidate status to join the bloc, following Russia's invasion of the country. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Easier condom access in plans to end HIV in Wales,"Fast Track chair Gian Molinu wants people to get HIV tested early to improve outcomes of those living with the virus Better access to condoms, preventative drugs and specific lessons in schools are among proposals to end new cases of HIV in Wales within eight years. Allowing doctors and chemists to give HIV drugs and improving online testing are part of a 26-point Welsh government plan to be announced on Tuesday. Wales was the first UK nation to pledge to stop new HIV cases by 2030. ""There is no place for ignorance or intolerance in modern Wales,"" said Health Minister Eluned Morgan. ""We have come a long way since the dark days of the 1980s - so memorably depicted last year inChannel 4's It's a Sin- when ignorance and cruelty towards people with HIV was rife."" The hit Channel 4 drama It's A Sin sparked a spike in HIV tests in Wales Tests for HIV spiked in Wales when It's A Sin,Welsh screenwriter Russell T Davies' record-breaking dramathat followed a group of friends during the 1980s Aids crisis, first hit TV screens in early 2021. England,externalhas already revealed its strategy to ""eliminate"" new HIV cases by 2030 and now the Welsh government has announced how it aims to improve quality of life for those living with the virus and end stigma by the start of the next decade. It's A Sin: HIV diagnosis at 16 was like 'a wake-up call' 'My story helped inspire hit TV show It's A Sin' Watch rugby star Gareth Thomas' BBC documentary 'HIV and Me' UN figures suggested in 2020 that about 38 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 700,000 died from Aids-related illnesses, which can be the result of HIV going untreated. A Cardiff project to reduce stigma and improve care for people living with HIV is set to be extended across Wales It was estimated more than105,000 people were living with HIV,externalin the UK, according to the latest data from National Aids Trust, with nearly 2,800 of those having HIV care in Wales. The Welsh government-led plan is to improve access to PrEP and allow GPs and community pharmacies in all parts of Wales, especially in rural areas and underserved communities, to be able to give out the HIV prevention drug. PrEP - or pre-exposure prophylaxis - is a pill taken daily, or on demand prior to having sex, to prevent HIV infection If taken consistently, when a condom is not worn and someone comes into contact with HIV, it protects cells in the body and disables the virus to stop it multiplying A UK Medical Research Council-run study comparing gay men on PrEP against non-users found an 86% fall in new HIV infections in PrEP users This video can not be played 'People think using PrEP means you put it about' Many in the sexual health sector say PrEP, when taken correctly, is almost 100% effective It is aimed at men who have sex with men without a condom as well as others at high risk, including HIV-negative partners of individuals with HIV that is not virally suppressed Researchers are assessing demand for the drug and its effect on the number of new HIV infections Testing for HIV could be made ""more accessible"" and ""promoted more widely to tackle inequalities"" with ""texting for testing,external"" pilots extended and rapid test click and collect options available after Â£3.9m investment from Welsh government. Latest statistics also showed there were more than 4,000 new people infected with HIV every year in the UK, with48 people newly diagnosed,externalin Wales in 2021.

'My HIV got my daughter kicked out of school' 'By 25, I'd lost 50 friends to Aids' 'We were all Aids deniers - then it got real' Tackling late diagnosis will be made a ""priority"" in the new Welsh plan and any late HIV diagnoses should be ""investigated and reported"" by health boards. Marlon Van Der Mark posts videos on social media to help dispel HIV myths and break its stigma Marlon Van Der Mark had HIV for two years before he felt able to tell family and a few close friends. ""I never knew HIV existed really, I never got taught about it so I was very naive to the whole thing,"" said the 24-year-old from Cardiff. ""So when I ended up catching it, I was in complete shock. It was the most horrifying moment of my life. Marlon has been immortalised in wall art aiming to encourage people to get tested for HIV ""I thought that coming out as gay was hard, but this was like way beyond because no-one talked about it. Then for a long time I called it the forbidden subject. ""Then if you did look online and someone had spoken about it, it was spoken about negatively so that just encouraged my fear even more. I lived most of my few years when I first got diagnosed in denial."" Now Marlon, who was diagnosed with HIV aged 20, posts videos on social media to help dispel HIV myths and break its stigma. Marlon welcomes the Welsh government's approach but thinks zero new HIV infections by 2030 is tough The Welsh government-led plan wants to use the curriculum to ""effectively address HIV, PrEP and stigma"" to school children as well as help support those those living with HIV to ""live better lives"". ""We have made huge progress in improving access to testing and treatment in Wales and we're proud of the significant reduction in new diagnoses of HIV,"" Ms Morgan said. ""There is, however, more to be done and by accepting and implementing these actions, we will make a massive difference to the lives of people living with HIV and in protecting current and future generations from the virus."" The Terrence Higgins Trust praised Wales for making PrEP available quickly and without a cap on numbers The UK's leading HIV and sexual health charity has welcomed Wales' ""ambitious commitment"" for something it said could be life-changing. ""Wales has been a trailblazer in the fight against HIV as shown in its fast action to make prevention drug PrEP available quickly and without a cap on numbers,"" said Terrence Higgins Trust chief executive Ian Green. 'By 25, I'd lost 50 friends to Aids' You can't catch HIV from hugging me - Gareth Thomas Game-changer: 'I didn't know HIV drug existed' ""We have all the tools necessary to end new HIV cases in Wales by 2030 and that's why we need to urgently utilise each of them in order to do just that."" A 12-week consultation period has started for people and organisations to comment on the plan that will be run by Welsh government, health boards, local councils, charities and community groups. ""As a nation, we are not very good at talking about these things, certainly not about HIV,"" said Gian Molinu, chair ofFast Track,external, a project in Cardiff helping people with HIV and tacking stigma. ""I know for a certain generation, you say HIV and you immediately think Aids and those horrendous adverts from the 80s where they said 'Aids is death, stay away, stay away'. ""That's not the case.

Final legal challenges before Rwanda asylum flight,"More than 10,000 people have made the dangerous journey across the Channel this year The first flight taking asylum seekers to Rwanda will take off and people who are not removed on Tuesday will be on subsequent flights, Liz Truss has said. The foreign secretary said it would ""establish the principle"" and break people traffickers' business models. Seven or eight people are due to be removed on Tuesday, after dozens won legal cases to be taken off. But more legal challenges are set to be heard. Church of England leaders described the plan as an ""immoral policy"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the government will not be ""deterred or abashed"" by criticism of the plan. Four more legal challenges from people set to be flown to the east African nation's capital Kigali are expected to be heard in the courts before the flight departs, after a last-ditch attempt to block the flight altogether was rejected by the Court of Appeal on Monday. Court allows Rwanda asylum flight to go ahead How many asylum seekers could be sent to Rwanda? Is Rwanda a land of safety or fear? On Monday 138 people reached the UK in three boats, with more than 10,000 migrants making the dangerous journey so far this year. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Truss confirmed the flight will depart as scheduled even if only a small number of people were on board, describing it as a ""key part of our strategy for tacking the appalling people smugglers who are trading in people's hopes and dreams"". She said: ""If people aren't on the flight today, they will be on subsequent flights to Rwanda."" Ms Truss added the government was prepared to ""face down"" future legal challenges to its plans, adding: ""It's about making sure that people have a safe future in Rwanda and we're determined to follow through on it"". Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if the plane would take off even if no one was on board, Ms Truss said she was confident there will people on the flight - but added she was not able to say how many it would be. However, she said the numbers of people being sent to Rwanda by the end of the year ""will be significant"". She also declined to say how much the flight would cost, but argued the cost of human trafficking and illegal immigration was ""huge"" to the taxpayer. The charter flight will be operated by airline Privilege Style The flight on Tuesday evening was originally due to carry dozens of passengers, but most succeeded in their individual appeals against removal. It is not clear exactly how many will leave on the flight: on Monday night, the Home Office said it was eight, while the charity Care4Calais said the number had fallen to seven. Ina letter to the Times,external, senior Church of England leaders described the plan as an ""immoral policy that shames Britain"". Signed by the archbishops of Canterbury and York and more than 20 other bishops who sit in the House of Lords, the letter said that ""those to be deported to Rwanda have had no chance to appeal, or reunite with family in Britain"". ""They have had no consideration of their asylum claim, recognition of their medical or other needs, or any attempt to understand their predicament."" Speaking in cabinet on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the government were ""going to get on and deliver"" on its plan, despite the ""criticism that is being directed upon this policy, some of it from slightly unexpected quarters"". He told ministers the objective is to ensure there is a ""clear distinction"" between immigration to the UK by safe and legal routes that the government supports and ""dangerous and illegal cross-Channel migration, which we intend to stop"". Tuesday's flight is due to be the first in a five-year trial, in which some asylum seekers deemed to have entered the UK illegally are transported to Rwanda to claim refuge there. They will get accommodation and support while the Rwandan government considers their application, and if they are successful they can stay in the country with up to five years' access to education and support. If their asylum claim is unsuccessful, they will be offered the chance to apply for other immigration routes, but could face deportation from Rwanda. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins onâ¦ The Rwanda asylum seekers plan The letter to The Times, signed by the entire senior leadership of the Church of England, said those being sent to Rwanda have had no chance to reunite with family in Britain. ""Many are desperate people fleeing unspeakable horrors. These are people Jesus had in mind as he said when we offer hospitality to a stranger, we do it for him,"" it says. ""We cannot offer asylum to everyone, but we must not outsource our ethical responsibilities, or discard international law - which protects the right to claim asylum."" It's not the first time the Archbishop of Canterbury has criticised the plan - hedescribed it as ""the opposite of the nature of God"" in his Easter sermon. At the time, the Home Office responded that the UK had a ""proud history"" of supporting those in need. The BBC has contacted the Home Office for a response to the letter. The PM announces the five-year Â£120m trial in which some asylum seekers will get a one-way ticket to Rwanda It faces widespread opposition from more than 160 charities and campaign groups, a small number of which launch a legal challenge Home Office lawyers say the plan is in the public interest - and the High Court agrees Campaigners appeal against the ruling but are unsuccessful Judges will consider whether the policy is lawful next month - this could see some people returned to the UK from Rwanda if it is ruled unlawful On Monday, appeal court judges ruled the first deportation flight could go ahead, agreeing with a previous judgement that it was in the ""public interest"" for the government to carry out its policies. Campaigners had hoped to stop the plane taking off before a full court hearing on whether the policy is lawful next month. Demonstrators opposed to the plans gathered outside the Home Office in central London on Monday evening Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper described the plan as ""profoundly un-British"". But Rwanda's high commissioner Johnston Busingye earlier defended the partnership, tellingthe Daily Telegraph,externalpeople arriving in the country would be treated with ""safety, dignity and respect"".

Should I really 'stay put' if thereâs a fire in my flats?What happened at Grenfell Tower?Grenfell: Has Anything Changed?Who has to pay to remove unsafe cladding?VideoVideoHow music helps me deal with the Grenfell tragedy,"Emergency services work on Grenfell Tower As Grenfell Tower burned, residents were told to stay in their flats and 72 people died. Five years on, ""stay put"" remains the policy for fires in most high-rise buildings. In the early hours of 14 June 2017 on the 9th floor of Grenfell Tower, Hanan Wahabi's 16-year-old son Zak made a crucial decision. The building had a policy - to ""stay put"" if there was a fire. ""He decided we weren't going to stay put,"" Hanan says. ""He went out, checked that it was safe for us to leave, came back, took his sister and we followed."" She admits she was panicking. Zak became the parent. The family escaped. But on the 21st floor Hanan's brother Abzulaziz had a different view. ""If the emergency services told him to stay put, he'd trust them,"" Hanan says. Abdulaziz, his wife Faouzia and their children Yasin, Nur Huda and Mehdi remained in their flat. They all died. The El-Wahabi family, Faouzia and Abdulaziz and their children Nur Huda, Mehdi and Yasin, died in the fire Stay put was repeatedly criticised at the Grenfell Tower public inquiry as the wrong advice for people in enormous danger. So why, five years on from Grenfell, is it still a policy the government believes is safe? Residential tower blocks are designed so that each flat is a concrete box. If a fire breaks out inside one flat, the theory is the occupants can escape, but their neighbours remain safe, because concrete doesn't burn. Many British blocks only have one staircase. The stay put policy aims to avoid a situation where people trying to escape prevent arriving firefighters reaching the blaze. Fire services don't rely on long ladders when tackling fires in tall buildings. They enter the tower and set up what's called a ""bridgehead"" - a safer area - two floors below the fire. From there they can connect their hoses to the building's internal water pipes, and head upstairs to tackle the flames. Inevitably this means propping open fire doors to the stairwell to run hoses, allowing smoke to spread, making the stairs an even riskier escape route. WatchGrenfell: Has Anything Changed?on iPlayer. But at Grenfell, the fire spread across the outside walls. In the few minutes it took Hanan Wahabi to escape, flames raced from the 9th floor where she lived to the 17th. So one of the disaster's biggest lessons is that sometimes ""stay put"" needs to be ""get out"". Prof Jose Torero, an expert adviser to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, has gone further. This week, he concluded the risk of flames spreading in a fire is too difficult to predict. He said - in the short term at least - abandoning stay put for high rise residential was ""essential"". The hundreds of buildings that still have fire safety defects, or unsafe cladding, now have a policy of ""simultaneous evacuation"" - this is where residents leave as, or ideally before, firefighters arrive. But Grenfell has changed attitudes. Now people in a fire are not prepared to sit it out even if they are told to do so. Fire damage at Michael Rudling's flat in Deptford When flames swept across the top of Michael Rudling's block in Deptford, south-east London, in April, thankfully he wasn't there. But if he had been, he'd have got out, despite the building's stay put policy. ""I would have seen it on Twitter before anything else,"" he says. ""People over the road were showing pictures with a big fire on the roof. If I'd seen that I would have thought, 'I'm not going to hang about.'"" The public inquiry into the Grenfell disaster recommended the government and the fire service come up with strategies, that would apply in England, to handle a simultaneous evacuation. The London Fire Brigade has been practising that scenario. Incident commanders are using new tablets running an app to help them with the mass of information during a major incident. This video can not be played Firefighters practice evacuating tower block residents while fighting a fire But simultaneous evacuation could mean residents have to look after themselves. The average fire service response time is around seven minutes, but lives can still be at risk, according to evacuation expert Elspeth Grant. ""It can take 20 minutes for firefighters to begin systematic rescues in a tower."" Those 20 minutes could be fatal, she says. The inquiry recommended nearly two dozen improvements to firefighting, the management of tall buildings and planning for evacuations. The government has yet to implement many of them, though a fire safety order will be issued this autumn and enacted next year. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower: Nine things we now know about the cladding But in one highly controversial area, ministers say it is not practical to do more. It is a horrifying fact that 15 of the 37 people with disabilities living at Grenfell Tower did not get out. As a result, the public inquiry recommended any vulnerable person living in a tower be assessed and given a personal emergency evacuation plan, or Peep. This can involve safety checks to ensure there are, for example, handrails or that the edges of stairs are clearly marked. Peeps can recommend that an evacuation chair is made available, a specialist device capable of rolling down stairs. They also include designated ""buddies"", either family members or neighbours, to help a vulnerable person in an emergency. Many British tower blocks have only one stairwell which will be used by fire fighters as well as people fleeing Prof Ed Galea, from the Fire Safety Engineering Group, has been studying evacuations for decades, including rail and air disasters, the World Trade Center attack, as well as Grenfell. He is a strong defender of Peeps. He says that for every disabled person in Grenfell Tower, there were five residents who could have provided them with potentially life-saving assistance. ""No-one needed to have died at Grenfell. It's possible to have got every single person out. It's doable, it's achievable."" He believes a close-knit community like Grenfell would have wanted to protect the vulnerable. For Georgie Hulme, who lives in a Manchester tower block with safety issues, her evacuation plan provides ""huge peace of mind"". Without it, Georgie, who uses a wheelchair, says: ""I would need to wait to be rescued by the fire service. Why should disabled people be expected to remain in their flat, whilst their neighbours who can, are told to evacuate immediately?"" Georgie Hulme speaks for people with mobility issues living in high-rise flats But the government says it can't recommend the widespread introduction of Peeps, and it looks likely this recommendation of the Grenfell Inquiry will not be fully delivered. In a statement to the House of Lords, fire safety minister Lord Greenhalgh said: ""How can you evacuate a mobility-impaired person from a tall building before the professionals from the fire and rescue service arrive? ""How much is it reasonable to spend to do this at the same time as we seek to protect residents and taxpayers from excessive costs? ""How can you ensure that an evacuation of mobility-impaired people is carried out in a way that does not hinder others in evacuating, or the fire service in fighting the fire?"" Georgie Hulme's response: ""It felt like a real kick in the teeth."" She and others told the BBC of their outrage after being described as a ""hindrance"" to firefighters. Listen to Access All: ""A lot of disabled people are very frightened"" The government estimates that on average 11 people in each tower block is mobility impaired. It says Peeps are not practical. It believes ""buddies"" could not be relied upon to be there in an emergency and respond adequately. They would need to be trained and there could be legal consequences for their actions, or lack of action, according to a government consultation. They could be held responsible if anything went wrong. It estimates that building owners would end up employing staff to facilitate evacuations. Dozens might be needed, and each could cost up to Â£21,900 per building, per month to provide 24/7 cover. Instead of personalised evacuation plans, the government's proposals are less ambitious. They involve risk assessments for vulnerable people, and providing information to the fire service so that they can be rescued. That has an important implication, highlighted by many critics. Currently the legal onus is on the building owner to keep its residents safe. These changes would subtly move the duty to the fire service to carry out rescues. Disabled residents are now taking legal action against the government. A government spokesperson said: ""Our fire reforms will go further than ever before to protect vulnerable people as we are determined to improve the safety of residents whose ability to self-evacuate may be compromised."" Georgie Hulme's group, Claddag, representing residents living with mobility issues in buildings with safety flaws, has launched a judicial review claiming the government has ignored evidence, as well as equality and human rights legislation. In a legal letter to ministers, shared with the BBC, the group says: ""It is difficult to convey the degree of upset, outrage and betrayal felt by affected disabled persons, bereaved, survivors and residents of Grenfell.""
