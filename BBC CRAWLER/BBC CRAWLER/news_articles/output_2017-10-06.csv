Trump rolls back free birth control,"This video can not be played Will Trump let Obamacare 'implode'? Donald Trump's government has issued a ruling that allows employers to opt out of providing free birth control to millions of Americans. The rule allows employers and insurers to decline to provide birth control if doing so violates their ""religious beliefs"" or ""moral convictions"". Fifty-five million women benefited from the Obama-era rule, which made companies provide free birth control. Before taking office, Mr Trump had pledged to eliminate that requirement. The mandate requiring birth control coverage had been a key feature of so-called Obamacare - President Obama's efforts to overhaul the US healthcare system. But the requirement included a provision that permitted religious institutions to forgo birth control coverage for their employees. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Friday it was important to expand which organisations can opt out and deny free contraceptive coverage. The future of contraception? Four ways it could change The tiny pill which gave birth to an economic revolution ""We should have space for organisations to live out their religious ideas and not face discrimination because of their religious ideas,"" said one HHS official, who did not wish to be named.

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, praised the decision as ""a landmark day for religious liberty"". The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National National Women's Law Center have announced that they will sue the federal government over the decision. In announcing the rule change, HHS officials cited a study claiming that access to contraception encourages ""risky sexual behaviour"". The department disputes reports that millions of women may lose their birth control coverage if they are unable to pay for it themselves. The Swedish physicist revolutionising birth control US inmates choose birth control for shorter jail term Roger Severino, the director of the HHS Office of Civil Rights, argued that only a small percentage of employers will choose to opt out, and therefore only a limited number of women will be affected. But many health policy analysts say employers that do not wish to pay for their employees' contraceptive coverage will now be able to. Will you be affected by this decision? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Diedra from Washington state told the BBC she feared losing access to the birth control she uses to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome. At the moment, the treatment is paid for with partial subsidies through the Affordable Care Act. ""Without the birth control mandate I don't know how much the treatment would cost,"" she said. ""This is definitely an attack on women - if this issue affected men it wouldn't be happening this way."" Protesters outside the Supreme Court in March when lawsuits were filed against the Obama-era rule ByNada Tawfik, BBC News, New York The immediate outcry from the president's detractors has been that this is an attack on women. Birth control is used for a variety of reasons. Preventing unwanted pregnancy is, of course, one of them. But it can also be used to treat medical conditions such as endometriosis or polycystic ovarian syndrome. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists was blunt. They said the decision undermined the best interests of their patients and turned back the clock on women's health. Another women's advocacy organisation, UltraViolet, said employers and insurers now needed to pick a side, asking if they stood ""with Donald Trump and his attacks on women,"" or ""the women who depend on your coverage?"" The administration says only a limited number of women will be affected. Whether or not that is true, the president is being criticized for politicising women's bodies and health to score political points with his base. Nuns and other religious figures protested against the Obamacare mandate ByAnthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The contraceptive coverage mandate had become a hotly contested legal battleground since Obamacare passed in 2009 - with the Democratic administration aggressively pushing back against attempts to carve out sweeping religious exemptions to the women's health provisions of the law. With Donald Trump now in charge, the dynamic has been turned on its head. Now the White House will be much more lenient in granting waivers, and Obamacare's defenders are the ones turning to the courts for a remedy. The move will be celebrated by religious groups and conservatives - a tangible benefit of their presidential victory last year. There's a risk of blowback outside the Republican Party's evangelical base, however. According to some estimates, the contraceptive mandate saved women $1.4bn in its first year in effect. The decision could deal a direct financial blow to women across the US - something they might remember when they head to the polls in 2018. Will you be affected by this decision?

Teacher jailed for sex with pupil,"Alice McBrearty committed ""the grossest breach of trust"", a judge said A teacher who had a ""full-blown sexual relationship"" with a 15-year-old boy has been jailed for 16 months. Alice McBrearty, 23, admitted the four-month relationship with a pupil she taught at an east London school. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard McBrearty kissed the youngster in a classroom, and had sex with him at her parents' home in Wanstead Park, east London. She pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust. Prosecutors said the relationship began when the teacher sent the boy a friend request on Facebook. Barrister Lisa Matthews said the teenager, who cannot be named, ""felt special"" and ""appeared to be besotted"" with McBrearty. The court heard the pair met in several locations, including a hotel room McBrearty had booked, and had sexual contact. Their relationship ended when the boy's father contacted police. McBrearty put her head in her hands and sobbed when she was sentenced by Judge Sheelagh Canavan. The judge described her as a ""bright, intelligent and gifted young woman, who knew right from wrong,"" but who had committed the ""grossest breach of trust"". ""You engaged in a full-blown sexual relationship with a 15-year-old child,"" she said. ""I accept he was consenting - what 15-year-old schoolboy would turn down such an attractive offer? ""I accept you truly believed this was a great romance, you were in love with him and vice versa, and that age didn't matter. But it did. ""You were supposed to keep him safe, to help him make the right decisions. Instead, you helped him make all the wrong ones."" Emma Shafton, defending, said her client, who is no longer a teacher, has had ""a spectacular fall from grace"". ""She has been utterly disgraced by this,"" she added.

Fresh tariffs imposed on Bombardier,"Parts of Bombardier's C-Series planes are made in Belfast The US Department of Commerce has again ruled against aerospace firm Bombardier in its dispute with rival Boeing. A further tariff of 80% has been imposed on the import of Bombardier's C-Series jet to the US for alleged below-cost selling. This is on top of anearlier tariff of 220%which related to subsidies Bombardier got from Canada and the UK. There have been warnings that the import tariffs could threaten Bombardier jobs in Belfast. About 1,000 jobs are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built Â£520m factory in the city. Reaction to Bombardier tax ruling Analysis: Not the end of Bombardier row Why is company so important to NI? Bombardier-Boeing dispute explained A spokesperson for Bombardier said: ""We strongly disagree with the commerce department's preliminary decision."" The firm said the ruling represented an ""egregious overreach and misapplication of U.S. trade laws"". ""The commerce department's approach throughout this investigation has completely ignored aerospace industry realities,"" it said. ""This hypocrisy is appalling, and it should be deeply troubling to any importer of large, complex, and highly engineered products."" The programme is not just important to Bombardier jobs in Belfast, but also to 15 smaller aerospace firms in Northern Ireland - and dozens more across the UK - which make components for the wings. The US Department of Commerce rulings, which could more than triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold into the US, could jeopardise a major order placed last year from US airline Delta. A final ruling in the case is due early next year. Davy Thompson from the Unite union said workers are very concerned. ""It looms very large over these workers and it's time for the British government to actually step up for British workers,"" he said. ""We see the British government being bullied by Boeing. ""The EU needs to step in, because effectively they are being bullied too. It needs to stop and it needs to stop now."" This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland A government spokesperson described the latest development as ""disappointing"", but said it was ""hardly surprising given last week's preliminary ruling sided with Boeing"". ""As with the investigation into subsidies, this is only the first step in the process,"" they added. ""Since the interim finding, we have had further Cabinet level engagement with the US Administration and Canadian government. ""We continue to make all efforts alongside the Canadian government to get Boeing to the table to resolve the case."" In a statement Boeing said: ""Today's decision follows a fact-based investigation by the Commerce Department and it validates Boeing's dumping complaints regarding Bombardier's pricing in the United States. ""This was an avoidable outcome within Bombardier's control. The laws governing global trade are transparent and well known."" US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said: ""The United States is committed to free, fair and reciprocal trade with Canada, but this is not our idea of a properly functioning trading relationship"". ""We will continue to verify the accuracy of this decision, while doing everything in our power to stand up for American companies and their workers."" The Canadian aerospace firm employs more than 4,000 workers across four sites in Northern Ireland. Components of the C-Series jet are manufactured at a purpose-built factory in east Belfast and many other local firms are involved in the supply chain. The punitive tax would significantly raise the price of the jet in the US market, and threaten the future of the product. Boeing took the case after accusing Bombardier of anti-competitive practices. It claimed its rival was selling the C-Series jets below cost price after taking state subsidies from the Canadian and British governments. When the preliminary tax ruling was madelast week, Wilbur Ross said: ""The subsidisation of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump administration takes very seriously."" The US trade commission is due to rule on the Department of Commerce's 220% tax proposal next year, but the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise (ISME) Association said the EU should not wait for the final decision. Its chief executive, Neil McDonnell, said the EU ""should signal right now that it will unconditionally, unequivocally and aggressively oppose protectionist measures by the US with tariffs of like effect"".

Ryanair's top operations boss resigns,"Thousands of travellers had their holiday plans ruined by a Ryanair scheduling mistake Embattled low-cost airline Ryanair said its chief operations officer will depart the company at the end of the month. Michael Hickey will be the first executive to leave the company after a rostering error led to the cancellation of thousands of flights. In his role, Mr Hickey was responsible for scheduling shifts for pilots. Chief executive Michael O'Leary earlier faced calls to resign over his handling of the mishap. Mr O'Leary on Friday said Mr Hickey ""will be a hard act to replace"". Ryanair announced its first wave of 2,100 cancellations in the middle of September, after it rearranged pilots' rosters to comply with new aviation rules requiring a change in how their flying hours are logged. Towards the end of September it announced 18,000 further flights would be cancelled over the winter season. These moves affect more than 700,000 passengers. Ryanair: The 34 routes being suspended Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights? Pilot on why offer is ""too little, too late"" In the airline's first wave of cancellations Ryanair offered affected passengers a Â£40 voucher per cancelled flight as a way to say sorry. This was short of European rules governing flight cancellations and passenger rights, and Ryanair was eventually forced to bow to regulator demands and spell out the options on offer to affected passengers.

'May clings on' and Rooney's 'brush' with law,"Most of the papers reflect on the attempt by Conservative backbenchers, led by ex-party chairman Grant Shapps, to oust Theresa May. The verdict ofthe Daily Express,externalis ""Theresa slaps down rebels"", reporting that the prime minister appears to have secured her position, thanks to a ""ruthless operation"" to discredit those seeking to undermine her. The Daily Mail agrees. Under the headline ""rout of the pygmies"", it says the plot to remove Mrs May ""collapsed into a shambles yesterday"" as MPs and ministers united to condemn what it labels ""the betrayal of rivals seeking revenge."" The paper also offers its readers pen portraits of the ""traitors gallery"" of senior Conservatives it says are part of Mr Shapps' attempted coup. The paper'scolumnist Peter Oborne,externalsays Mrs May must ""destroy her Tory enemies before they destroy her"". However, even if the rebellion has been seen off, doubts about the prime minister most definitely remain for some. ""PM clings to power - for now"" is the i newspaper's take. Meanwhile, the Sun endorses Mrs May, but only because -as its editorial puts it,external- ""there is no obvious replacement"". Until one emerges the Tories must unite behind her, the paper says. The Financial Times,externalurges the PM to sack lacklustre members of the cabinet and bring in new talent. The FT concedes that it is a strategy that carries risk, but, it says, ""she has nothing to lose."" The Daily Mirror,externallaments that at a time when the nation is crying out for strong leadership, it has been left rudderless by a ""top of the flops"" prime minister. ""Britain deserves much better than these incompetent Tories,"" says its leader. The Daily Mirror,externalreports on another beleaguered leader: Ryanair's Michael O'Leary. The paper says it has seen a letter to Mr O'Leary written on behalf of his pilots, responding to his ""grovelling"" pledge to improve their pay and conditions. In it, the pilots accuse their boss of ""considering us nothing more than aircraft parts"". One pilot tells the Mirror that Mr O'Leary's offer was ""the ramblings of a desperate man"". One of the most successful glossy magazines of recent years is ceasing its monthly print edition and going online,the Times reports,external. Glamour's decision to go ""digital first"" is the result of tumbling sales and alarm about the future of beauty and celebrity titles. The Financial Times,externalsays there is in fact a broader challenge to the magazine industry. It says it's partly the result of the ""abundance of free news and entertainment"" available on the internet - and also a ""changing of the guard"" at some of the world's top titles. It cites the retirement of Vanity Fair's longstanding editor, Graydon Carter. The FT quotes the founder of Rolling Stone, which in another sign of the times was recently put up for sale. He says ""publishing is a completely different industry than what it was."" It could be worse, though, as various long-lens photos of Wayne Rooney doing community service at a garden centre attest. It follows his conviction for drink-driving last month. He's been painting park benches at the centre. ""Tired and emulsional"", isthe Sun's headline,external. To avoid the glare of publicity, Wayne Rooney could perhaps have benefited from the new England rugby kit, which,as the Daily Telegraph reports sceptically,external, ""purports to use state of the art camouflage technology to mask player movement"". An expert in visual perception doubts the manufacturer's breathless claim and points out that in any case, any advantage gained from the design is counteracted by the fact the shirts have a large, highly visible advertiser's logo in the middle of them. The Telegraph says fans have grumbled that the replica strip costs Â£95 and it is the eighth new kit in the last three years, meaning that, transparently, it is merely a ""revenue raising stunt.""

US sells $15bn missile defence to Saudi,"The system can destroy incoming missiles at altitudes beyond the Earth's atmosphere The US government has approved the sale to Saudi Arabia of its advanced Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) missile defence system. The State Department said the $15bn (Â£11.5bn) deal furthered US national security and foreign policy interests. It would boost Saudi and Gulf security against Iranian and other regional threats, the state department added. The announcement comes a day after Saudi Arabia agreed to buy air defence systems from Russia. The deal would not alter the military balance in the region, the Pentagon's Defense Security Co-operation Agency said. Thaad systems are being deployed in South Korea to protect against a possible missile attack from North Korea. But many South Koreans have objected, fearing it would become a target and endanger the lives of those who live near its launch sites. China also voiced opposition to the system, saying it would affect the regional security balance. Shoots down short and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase of their flight Uses hit-to-kill technology - where kinetic energy destroys the incoming warhead Has a range of 200km and can reach an altitude of 150km US has previously deployed it in Guam and Hawaii as a measure against potential attacks from North Korea What impact could Thaad have on the Korean peninsula? The system destroys incoming missiles at altitudes beyond the Earth's atmosphere, making it especially useful in countering missiles that might carry a nuclear warhead. The Thaad interceptor is produced by the US company Lockheed Martin. By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs analyst This latest multi-billion-dollar deal will help satisfy the Trump administration's desire to be seen to be protecting and increasing jobs at home. Donald Trump has also made it abundantly clear that he is completely in tune with the Saudi view of Iran as the biggest threat in the region - which is a key rationale behind this new Saudi spending spree. He may be less pleased, though about the arms deal the Saudis agreed with Russia during King Salman's visit to Moscow this week. It showed perhaps how Riyadh is hedging its bets, as US influence has been diminishing in the Middle East. What impact could Thaad have in South Korea?

Single pothole costs council Â£1.8m,"A council paid out more than Â£1.8m in a single compensation claim involving a pothole, it has emerged. Somerset County Council paid out Â£1,836,000 to a third party for ""general damages"" following an accident ""involving a pothole defect"". Details released to theSomerset County Gazette,externalunder aFreedom of Information request,externalalso reveal Â£2.1m was paid in 31 compensation claims in 2016 to 2017. The council said it was unable to give further details for legal reasons. Documents also reveal a rise in the total amount of compensation paid out by the authority. It paid about Â£170,000 to 28 claimants in 2014 to 2015, and almost Â£900,000 to 33 claimants in the following year. This financial year, however, the authority has had to pay out Â£2,137,167, with Â£1.8m of it going to just one person. Across the county, the FoI revealed the most common claim for compensation was for potholes, followed by drains and gullies and then ""erosion of road"".

A spokesman for Somerset County Council said, ""data protection legislation"" meant it could not give ""any further details about individual claims against the local authority"". But he added, to successfully claim compensation claimants would need to prove the council had neglected or breached its ""statutory duty"".

Spain apologises to injured Catalans,"Police moved in to prevent people voting in Sunday's disputed election The Spanish government's representative in Catalonia has apologised to those injured during police efforts to stop Sunday's independence referendum. But Enric Millo blamed the Catalan government for holding an illegal vote. Meanwhile the government in Madrid has issued a decree making it easier for companies to move their headquarters away from Catalonia. A Catalan minister told the BBC his government would go ahead with an independence debate in parliament. ""Parliament will discuss, parliament will meet,"" said Catalan foreign affairs chief RaÃ¼l Romeva. ""Every attempt the Spanish government has used to impede things to happen, they have been demonstrated completely not only useless but counter-productive,"" he told the BBC in English. Spain eases firms' exit from Catalonia Distressed police officer photo goes viral Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? In the first apology by a Spanish government official over the violence on Sunday, which saw hundreds injured as police, trying to enforce a Spanish court ban on the vote, attempted to seize ballot boxes and disperse voters, Mr Millo said he could not help but ""regret it and apologise on behalf of the officers that intervened"". Friday has seen a number of political, business and judicial developments in the unfolding crisis in Catalonia. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont now plans to address the Catalan parliament on Tuesday at 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT), the speaker of the parliament says. Spain's Constitutional Court had earlier suspended the Catalan parliament session that had been planned for Monday. There is speculation that the parliament will declare independence unilaterally at its next sitting, based on last Sunday's disputed vote. The final results from the outlawed poll show 90% of the 2.3m people who voted backed independence. Turnout was 43%. There have been several claims of irregularities, and many ballot boxes were seized by the Spanish police. After a cabinet meeting, the Spanish government spokesman also expressed regret that people had ""suffered consequences"" during Sunday's vote - though he cast doubt on the numbers who had been injured. ÃÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo suggested that new elections in Catalonia might be a way to heal the fracture caused by the disputed referendum. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold Madrid's decree making it easier for companies to relocate their legal base away from Catalonia means such a decision will now not need the prior approval of shareholders. According to media reports, the board of Barcelona-based Gas Natural Fenosa voted on Friday to move its headquarters to Madrid. The multinational utility company supplies gas and electricity to customers in Spain and beyond CaixaBank, a large Barcelona-based institution, has decided to move its headquarters from Barcelona to the city of Valencia. The bank said in a statement that it had taken the decision ""in light of the current political and social situation in Catalonia"" Sabadell, another major Barcelona bank,decided to transfer its legally registered base from Barcelonato the south-eastern Spanish city of Alicante on Thursday. Its HQ and workforce will remain in Barcelona This would ensure the banks remained within the eurozone and under the supervision of the European Central Bank, even if Catalonia broke away from Spain. Catalonia is Spain's richest region and accounts for 19% of Spain's GDP. Meanwhile, the Catalan chief of police, Josep Lluis Trapero, has appeared before a judge in a national criminal court in Madrid on suspicion of sedition against the state. His Mossos d'Esquadra force is accused of failing to help Guardia Civil police tackle thousands of pro-independence protesters outside the Catalan Economy Department in Barcelona on 20 September during the run up to the referendum. The Guardia Civil submitted an official accusation against the Mossos. In a statement, the Mossos said Mr Trapero had told the court that the force had not been made aware of the Guardia Civil action. ""The Mossos were not notified sufficiently in advance... and this forced them to adjust to the circumstances accordingly.

Butterfly swarm glitters on Denver radar,"Birds (left) leave a different radar signature to butterflies A colourful, shimmering spectacle detected by weather radar over the US state of Colorado has been identified as swarms of migrating butterflies. Scientists at the National Weather Service (NWS) first mistook the orange radar blob for birds and had asked the public to help identifying the species. They later established that the 70-mile wide (110km) mass was a kaleidoscope of Painted Lady butterflies. Forecasters say it is uncommon for flying insects to be detected by radar. ""We hadn't seen a signature like that in a while,"" said NWS meteorologist Paul Schlatter, who first spotted the radar blip. The Painted Lady is often mistaken for the monarch butterfly ""We detect migrating birds all the time, but they were flying north to south,""he told CBS News,external, explaining that this direction of travel would be unusual for migratory birds for the time of year. So he put the question to Twitter, asking for help determining the bird species.

Ryanair 'run like a communist regime',"Michael O'Leary is chief executive of Ryanair Cabin crew reduced to tears, pilots refused days off even for their weddings, and workers ""left in exile"" thousands of miles from their homes and families. After budget airline Ryanair was forced to cancel thousands of flights - repeatedly blaming a rostering error rather than an alleged pilot shortage - chief executive Michael O'Leary has written to pilots offering them better pay and conditions. Here, a long-serving pilot explains why the offer is ""too little, too late"", and explains why his colleagues are leaving the airline. Ryanair said it had ""messed up the allocation of annual leave"", but pilots claim their colleagues are leaving to fly for other airlines Mr O'Leary is partly right to say the cancellations have been caused by problems accommodating pilots' leave, says the pilot. But this has been exacerbated by unhappy staff seeking new jobs with rival airlines, he believes. ""The Irish Aviation Authority has changed the rules where pilots cannot fly more than 1,000 hours in a rolling year, and the flight hours have to be taken from January to December, whereas Ryanair were using April to April. ""Ryanair have been given two years' notice but the company have left it to the last minute,"" the pilot says. ""It's been the perfect storm because, at the same time, other airlines are hiring crews, so they are leaving for pastures new. ""If it wasn't for the crews' goodwill I think this crisis would have come sooner, because for a long time now they've been asking people to work days off. ""Pilots are being used as the scapegoat to cover for incompetency in the upper management, and it's just totally disgusting. ""Instead of O'Leary standing up and taking the blame he's directing the problems and the blame at pilots and saying it's because we're taking leave and holidays. ""That's simply not true. It may be true in a very few cases, but people are working harder now than ever to try to make up this shortfall in crewing levels that we have."" Ryanair staff have been sharing memes among each other that compare the management of Ryanair to the North Korean regime The pilot said he and many other newly-qualified pilots joined Ryanair following the recession of 2008 when it was one of the few airlines still recruiting. ""A lot have remained here ticking along, but now that the market has become a lot more buoyant and there are other competitors offering much better terms and conditions, they've had enough and they are leaving,"" he said. ""On a local level the company is fantastic and I'm very fortunate to work with some very highly-skilled individuals. ""Then you have the management at the upper level and it's run like a communist regime in some respects. It's dictated from the top and you are just expected to get on with it. ""I know of colleagues that have had leave denied to get married and then these pilots rely on the goodwill and conscience of other pilots to cover their rostered flights so they can get married. ""This company will happily fire pilots to quell any uprising, even to the point wherethey would close a base,externalor multiple bases to send a message to the rest: 'You just get on and do your job and keep doing what we tell you to do'. ""We have some memes that have been doing the rounds which we feel accurately portray the situation and feelings of the crew - comparing the company to the North Korean communist regime. ""The way they treat the staff is not much better, if not worse, than the way they treat their customers. ""People have just had enough of the toxic atmosphere that's been created here."" The BBC contacted Ryanair with these claims and a spokesman said it was ""untrue"" there was a toxic atmosphere among staff. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has said he would ""challenge any pilot to explain how this is a difficult job or how it is they are overworked"" Mr O'Leary has said pilots fly for no more than 18 hours a week. However, the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) has said this ""does not seem to have any basis in reality"". The pilot echoed the Balpa view. ""In reality our hours are much longer than that,"" he said. ""[Mr O'Leary] has divided the maximum amount of hours a crew can fly in a year, which is 900 hours, by 52 weeks. ""I typically fly between 30 to 40 hours a week. This is what is called 'flight duty' and starts from reporting to work to when we set the parking brake at the end of the day. ""This does not include turnarounds and post-duty paperwork, which we are not paid for. ""If Ryanair advertise to their customers that the flight leaves at five o'clock and arrives at seven o'clock then we only get paid for those two hours. ""We are not paid for the time spent getting back to base either. Sometimes it's a case that you can't get back on the same day and you are having to pay for a hotel out of your own money, then catch a flight the following day to get home or catch multiple flight connections if the base isn't particularly well connected."" Ryanair declined to comment on whether pilots are paid only for the advertised length of the flight. It has said previously that pilots receive ""great pay and industry-leading terms and conditions"". There is a lack of basic benefits such as crew meals and drinks, the pilot said ""Cabin crew are employed under similar conditions, on agency contracts, and the things I've seen are pretty disgusting,"" said the pilot. ""They are given unachievable sales targets, and if they've not reached sales targets they will be berated in a debriefing afterwards by a base supervisor, who is acting as a minion for Dublin. ""It's known for cabin crew to cry after their debriefings. I've seen them lined up almost like a military parade before being inspected, having their bags searched and all kinds of things. ""These people are not earning very much money - around Â£1,000 a month. ""In some bases the cabin crew even have to rent one room together, and sleep in the same bed - maybe one person who works early shifts and one person who works late shifts - because they are not paid enough to even afford their own accommodation in those particular areas. ""It's quite common for them to be threatened to be moved to a less desirable base, further away from home, unless their sales improve. ""There is also a lack of basic benefits - no free bottles of water, coffee or tea and no crew meals. All of this needs to be brought to work by the pilot and it's the same for cabin crew. ""They provide a water dispenser at every crew room, where you need to take an empty bottle to fill up. You also pay for your own uniform through a Ryanair-approved supplier."" The BBC asked Ryanair to comment on cabin crew being threatened and berated for not meeting sales targets, not being able to afford accommodation and sharing beds with colleagues. Ryanair responded: ""These claims are untrue."" The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) has ""urged Ryanair to do more to encourage pilots to stay with the airline"" ""Some competitors do have similar work arrangements, but nothing to the extent that Ryanair do,"" the pilot said. ""They'vecopied the low cost business model from Southwest Airlines[in the United States] but gone to the extreme. ""Southwest make good profits and it's been ranked as one of the best airlines in America to fly for, as they take good care of crews and pay them well. ""However, Michael O'Leary seems to have taken enjoyment from taking the low road andtaunting his customers,externaland crews because he knows he can get away with it. ""Passengers want a British Airways service, but ultimately when it comes to booking they will book with Ryanair because he's offering a 10-euro seat. ""However, the tactics of ruling by fear and divide and conquer are outdated in the pilot market we're in now. ""Now, with the invention of WhatsApp people are openly discussing what's going on, and people are starting to see that there is more unity coming together. ""If there's no improvement here, and the management continue to bury their head in the sand, many people will continue to leave and the mass exodus will just continue."" The pilot saidMr O'Leary's offer of better pay and conditions""does not come across as sincere and genuine"". ""People want to stay, they want to work and do a good job, but management are treating us like the enemy when we are the assets of the company,"" he said. ""We are an airline and without pilots and cabin crew the aircraft go nowhere."" In his latest letter to pilots, Mr O'Leary said he had interacted with many pilots over 30 years. ""Over this period I have always tried to be courteous, respectful and grateful for the outstanding job that you do, and this will remain my approach."" Michael O'Leary, pictured outside a British Airways travel shop in 1998, has taken cost-cutting culture to the extreme, said the pilot Ryanair began operating in 1985, originally flying daily from Waterford in Ireland to London Gatwick In the early 1990s, the airline's founder Tony Ryan sent Michael O'Leary, an accountant by training, to Texas to find out how Southwest Airlines was making profits with lower fares Mr O'Leary, now chief executive, took cost-cutting culture to the extreme, eventelling his staff to take pens from hotels and legal offices instead of buying them,external Ryanair now has 4,200 pilots flying a fleet of 400 Boeing 737-800 aircraft between more than 200 airports in 33 countries It reports carrying 131 million passengers a year, more than any other airline in Europe, and operates more than 2,000 flights a day Read more - Ryanair and Easyjet: The history of the peanut airlines The BBC agreed not to identify the pilot.

'We eloped and sent postcards',"A view of New Zealand and Kristy and Corey Rousseau on their wedding day Why would couples keep their engagement and even their wedding secret from friends and family? Some would find it hard to believe, but for Kristy Rousseau from Ontario, Canada, it was probably the best decision she and her partner made. ""We travel a lot and preferred to spend money on marrying on a mountain top in our favourite place instead of a big traditional wedding,"" Kristy told the BBC. She and her husband Corey, who had been together for seven years, secretly got engaged so that their friends and family would not discover their plan to elope to New Zealand. In the run up to her wedding, Kristy found it hard not to wear her engagement ring. On her birthday, just two weeks before flying to New Zealand, she wore it out to dinner and nearly let the secret out. Kristy says husband Corey thinks he looks like James Bond They almost managed to tell no one, as Kristy explains: ""Corey had to tell his boss [about the elopement] because he was recruited to a new company and needed the time off. Some of his co-workers thought he was in rehab!"" As their big day approached, the couple flew to New Zealand, took a helicopter ride to the mountains, and enlisted the help of the pilot as the best man and a photographer as a witness. Having been a bridesmaid and maid of honour three times before getting married herself, Kristy saw how wedding planning can be stressful. She said: ""I didn't want to ruin what is meant to be the happiest day."" Personalised postcard anyone? The happy couple in 'the most beautiful place on earth' So, they got married, took photos and sent home postcards. Kristy said everyone was happy she and Corey had finally tied the knot although her mother was a little disappointed she was not there to witness her only daughter's big day. However, Kristy wanted her day to be about her and Corey: ""Ultimately, we wanted it to just be something personal between the two of us.""

May: Cabinet fully behind my leadership,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Look, I've had a cold this week"" Theresa May has said she has the ""full support of her cabinet"" after a former party chairman said there should be a Conservative leadership contest. The PM insisted she was providing the ""calm leadership"" the country needed. Grant Shapps says about 30 Tory MPs back his call for a leadership contest in the wake of the general election results and conference mishaps. But his claims prompted a backlash from loyal backbenchers, several of whom called on him to ""shut up"". There has been leadership speculation since Mrs May's decision to call a snap general election backfired and the Conservatives lost their majority. Laura Kuenssberg: Doubts are now out in open Tories rally round May after speech woes PM struggles through interrupted speech The Conservative conference this week was meant to be a chance to assert her authority over the party, but her big speech was plagued by a series of mishaps, as she struggled with a persistent cough, was interrupted by a prankster and some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her. Asked about leadership speculation as she attended a charity event in her constituency, Mrs May said: ""What the country needs is calm leadership and that's what I am providing with the full support of my cabinet."" This video can not be played Former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said Theresa May should face a leadership election She said her recent speech in Florence had given ""real momentum"" to Brexit negotiations and she was intending to update MPs next week on her plans to help ""ordinary working families"" with a cap on energy bills. Environment Secretary Michael Gove was among cabinet ministers and MPs publicly defending Mrs May on Friday morning, as the story broke that Mr Shapps was the senior Tory behind a bid to persuade her to go. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4 the prime minister was a ""fantastic"" leader, had widespread support, and should stay ""as long as she wants"". He said that the ""overwhelming majority of MPs and the entirety of the cabinet"" backed the prime minister. Home Secretary Amber Rudd wrote an article inthe Telegraph,externalurging the prime minister to stay, while First Secretary of State Damian Green said on the BBC's Question Time the prime minister ""was determined as ever to get on with her job - she sees it as her duty to do so"". Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, hit out at those plotting to oust Mrs May as prime minister. Speaking to the BBC's Political Thinking podcast, she said: ""I have to say, I've not got much time for them... ""I really don't think that having a bit of a cold... when you are trying to make a speech changes the fundamentals of whether Theresa May is the right person to lead the country."" There is, this morning, an operation being mounted by the government to try to show that nothing has changed in the Conservative Party in the last few days. That Theresa May's leadership remains on track and she is, to use another of her famous phrases, just, ""getting on with the job"". Except, as happened the last time she proclaimed ""nothing has changed"", something rather fundamental has, after all. For the doubts that have been building about her in the party for months are now out there in the wide open. Read more from the BBC's political editor To trigger a vote of confidence in the party leader, 48 of the 316 Conservative MPs would need to write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. A leadership contest would only be triggered if Mrs May lost that vote, or chose to quit. Mr Shapps, who was co-chair of the party between 2012 and 2015, said no letter had been sent and said his intention had been to gather signatures privately and persuade Mrs May to stand down. But he claimed party whips had taken the ""extraordinary"" step of making it public by naming him as the ringleader of a plot to oust the PM in a story in the Times. He told the BBC: ""I think it's time we actually tackle this issue of leadership and so do many colleagues. ""We wanted to present that to Theresa May privately. Now I'm afraid it's being done a bit more publicly."" He added: ""The country needs leadership. It needs leadership at this time in particular. I think the conference and the lead-up through the summer has shown that that's not going to happen. I think it's time that we have a leadership election now, or at least let's set out that timetable."" This video can not be played The ""overwhelming majority of MPs"" support the prime minister, says Environment Secretary Michael Gove But Conservative MP Nigel Evans told the BBC's Daily Politics that if Grant Shapps ""can't get 48 signatures, he should just shut up: ""In my chats to MPs at Westminster nobody wants an early leadership election. We just simply don't want that."" Fellow MP James Cleverlytweeted,external: ""I've always liked Grant Shapps but he really is doing himself, the party and (most importantly) the country no favours at all. Just stop."" Among other MPs criticising Mr Shapps was Charles Walker, vice chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, who suggested the plot was going to ""fizzle out"". ""No 10 must be delighted to learn that it's Grant Shapps leading this alleged coup,"" he said. ""Grant has many talents but one thing he doesn't have is a following in the party."" Former minister Ed Vaizey was the first MP to publicly suggest Mrs May should quit on Thursday, telling the BBC: ""I think there will be quite a few people who will now be pretty firmly of the view that she should resign.""

Cost of mortgages starts to rise,"The cost of taking out a fixed-rate mortgage has started to rise, even though the Bank of England has kept base rates at a record low. Barclays and NatWest have become the latest lenders to increase the cost of some of their fixed-rate products. At least nine other banks or building societies have also raised their rates in the past few weeks. Anyone taking out a typical mortgage of Â£125,000 could now pay around Â£130 a year more as a result of the changes. How would a rate rise of 0.25% affect me? Carney expects rate rise in near term ""Mortgage rates look like they're turning round from the record lows that borrowers have been enjoying,"" said David Hollingworth, associate director of London and Country Mortgages. But no one on a fixed rate will see any changes until their current deal expires. On Friday, Barclays increased the cost of its two-year fixes by up to 0.2% percentage points. Repayments on a two-year fix at 60% loan-to-value will go up from 1.09% to 1.29%. Anyone taking out a two-year fixed-rate mortgage from Barclays, and borrowing Â£125,000, will pay an extra Â£11.48 a month, according to London and Country Mortgages. NatWest is increasing the interest rate on one of its five-year fixes by 0.9% percentage points, but more typically by 0.16% points on a two-year fix. Other lenders that have increased rates include Nationwide, Halifax and Santander. About four million people have fixed-rate mortgages. The reason for the rise is that lenders are having to pay more to access the funds they need to lend out to homeowners. Even though base rates themselves have not gone up, so-called ""swap rates"" have risen in recent weeks. These are financial instruments used by lenders, which reflect the expectation that base rates will go up in the near future. The Bank of England has already suggested that rates will rise ""in the relatively near term"". Some experts think that could be as soon as next month. ""We are introducing changes to our mortgage rates that include a number of rate increases on our residential deals,"" said Mark Bullard, head of sales at NatWest. ""Swap rates have risen recently, on the expectation that interest rates will begin to rise in the near future, which has increased the cost of funding."" David Hollingworth advised anyone thinking of taking out a mortgage ""not to hang around"", as rates are likely to rise further.

And Dawn's real-life son Graham Ibbetson recounted personal memories, including the time when his mother, before she was famous, gave away the Â£25 prize from a holiday camp talent competition to a children's charity. Her generosity, he went on, meant that her husband Don had to borrow petrol money for the journey home. He said: ""No matter who met with mum, at any place, at any time, in any circumstances, all of them laughed and walked away smiling. Happier. That was mum's legacy."" Sally Dynevor and Michael Le Vell were among the Coronation Street stars present Graham Ibbetson also recounted the actress's final afternoon, when the family sat with her and held her hand, while he played Frank Sinatra on his phone ""hoping she could hear it"". He finished his tribute by adapting the words of Sinatra's My Way to apply to his mother, making it Her Way. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Other cast members at the service included Helen Worth, who plays Gail Rodwell, Sally Dynevor, who plays Sally Metcalfe, and Michael Le Vell, who plays Kevin Webster. ""It was a lovely service,"" said Worth, holding back tears. ""It was quiet, it was calm, it was gentle. People spoke beautifully and so bravely. ""We all loved her. I also know she'll be looking down now and saying, 'eh, that were nice.' It was a good send-off for someone we loved."" Ken Morley (l) and Bruce Jones were among others in attendance When Coronation Street's famous faces emerged from Salford Cathedral after the funeral, the mood was one of sadness - but they were also comforted by remembering and celebrating the woman who they knew as Liz and we knew as Vera. Above all, there was huge affection as they spoke. Antony Cotton described the service as the coming together of her ""two families"" - her real family and her screen family. The word family was mentioned a lot to describe the atmosphere on the show when she was there - as several co-stars said, she was the matriarch of Corrie. There was a third family - the family of fans. A few dozen of them had gathered to watch the mourners amid the everyday bustle of Salford, a couple of miles from the Corrie cobbles, outside Weatherfield's local cathedral. Dynevor said the service had been ""incredible"" and that Dawn was ""the heart of Coronation Street"". ""There was always laughter where Liz was, and kindness,"" she told the BBC. ""She was friends with everybody."" Le Vell remembered an occasion when Dawn, a devout Catholic, returned from an audience with Pope John Paul II in 1998 ""with all these little angel things to bless us with"". ""She was such a selfless person,"" he went on. ""She was like a proper matriarch. It's a massive loss."" Former stars Ken Morley, who played Reg Holdsworth, and Bruce Jones, who played Les Battersby, were among the others there to pay their respects. The Coronation Street theme tune was played as her coffin was brought in The funeral was conducted by Father Brendan Curley, the former dean of Salford Cathedral and a friend of Dawn and her family, alongside the cathedral's current dean, Father Michael Jones. Her coffin was transported to the cathedral with a display of pale pink roses spelling the word ""Mum"". Dawn played the battleaxe Vera from 1974 until 2008, whenan episode featuring Vera's death,externalattracted more than 12 million viewers. She wasdiagnosed with emphysema,externalin 2004.

What we still don't know about Vegas attack,"Las Vegas police hold a vigil for for slain officer Charleston Hartfield, who was killed in Sunday's massacre A week after a gunman fatally shot 58 people at a Las Vegas music festival, police are still unsure of why he opened fire - and why he stopped. Police have changed a key event in the timeline of how the massacre unfolded: Stephen Paddock shot a hotel security guard six minutes before he turned the gun on the Route 91 music festival and later, himself. Officials had previously suggested the guard, Jesus Campos, distracted Paddock and stopped him from unloading bullets into the crowd below from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. But the new timeline raises questions about police response and what prompted the suspect to stop shooting 10 minutes later. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo revised the timeline on Monday, telling reporters that Paddock shot Mr Campos before he opened fire. Mr Campos was investigating an alarm involving another door on the floor when Paddock shot him through the door of his suite, which he outfitted with surveillance cameras to see anyone approaching. The guard immediately ""notified security of his situation"", Mr Lombardo said, adding that he also prevented a maintenance worker from being shot. But the latest timeline underscores the question of why Paddock stopped shooting and what caused him to turn the gun on himself if it was not an intervention by Mr Campos. The sheriff also acknowledged that police ""weren't aware of [Mr Campos] being shot until they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator"", raising more questions about why the authorities were not alerted to the hotel shooting sooner. Sheriff Lombardo said the revisions were ""minute changes"" typical of a complex investigation. Paddock had shot and killed himself by the time police had entered his suite, which was more than an hour after the shooting ended. The gunman also fired 200 rounds of bullets into the hallway, police said. It was unclear if anyone alerted the hotel to sound of gunfire. Police also said Paddock was believed to have checked into the hotel on 25 September and not on 28 September, as they initially said. Paddock shoots Jesus Campos while he is investigating an alarm at 21:59 (04:59 GMT) Begins firing at crowd at about 22:05 (05:05 GMT) Stops shooting at about 22:15 (05:15 GMT) First police officers arrive at 22:17 (05:17 GMT) Encounter Mr Campos at 22:18 (05:18 GMT) Police enter Paddock's room at about 23:20 (06:20 GMT) Police have chased ""more than 1,000 leads"" in their quest to establish a motive for the shooting but are still struggling to establish the reason for the 64-year-old's shooting rampage. Sheriff Lombardo said on Monday he was ""frustrated"" that the gunman's motive has eluded them. ""This individual purposely hid his actions leading up to this event,"" he said, ""and it is difficult for us to find the answers to those actions."" The attack is considered the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history. This video can not be played Las Vegas police: 'We all want answers' Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said police are examining a computer and multiple electronic devices found in Paddock's Mandalay Bay suite as well as evidence taken from his homes in Mesquite and Reno, Nevada. Investigators also found a note containing numbers inside the hotel suite, but police say it was not a suicide note or manifesto. What was Stephen Paddock's motive? America's gun culture in 10 charts He is not believed to have held any extremist views and did not call police to explain his actions like Omar Mateen, the Orlando nightclub gunman who fatally shot 49 people last year. This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse Authorities have revealed few details about what has been discovered and whether any of it contains clues as to he carried out such an attack. Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the FBI, conceded on Wednesday the case was ""somewhat different than many of the ones we've dealt with in the past"". Paddock amassed a cache of weapons over the last 13 months, purchasing a haul of 33 guns, some of which had been modified with bump-stocks, or devices that enable guns to operate like fully automatic weapons. He smuggled into the hotel 24 weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition, concealed in 10 suitcases, for the ""meticulously planned"" attack, police say. Las Vegas shooting - what we know so far But Paddock may have been scouting other locations, including the Life is Beautiful music festival, which was held in Las Vegas the weekend before Sunday's attack. The gunman booked a luxury unit in the Ogden, a high-rise building that towered over the open-air concert, which featured acts including Muse, Lorde and Chance the Rapper. White crosses bearing the names of the 58 victims are displayed in Las Vegas US media reports now say the suspect may have considered other festivals, including Chicago's Lollapalooza, a massive August festival attended by hundreds of thousands of people. He also researched hotels near Boston's Fenway Park and the Boston Center for the Arts, the city's police commissioner William Evans said on Friday. There is no indication that he travelled to either city, police say. In a press conference on Wednesday, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said he saw evidence that Paddock had planned to escape after the attack, but declined to elaborate. Paddock instead turned the gun on himself as police stormed his suite. Adam Lankford, a University of Alabama criminologist and researcher who tracks global mass shootings, told the BBC he believes any evidence of an escape plan was probably a fantasy. He pointed to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, two teenage gunmen who killed 12 students and a teacher at a Colorado high school before killing themselves in 1999, who fantasised about a second attack. Harris detailed his plot in a journal and suggested the two would hijack a plane and crash it into New York City if they survived the school shooting - an escape fantasy, Mr Lankford said. Mr Lankford also noted the bunker that Paddock created in the hotel room, which he outfitted with surveillance cameras to see anyone approaching. ""You set up the cameras so you aren't caught alive,"" Mr Lankford said. Paddock also had in his car more than 50lbs of exploding materials, 1,600 rounds of ammunition and fertiliser, which can be used to make explosives, which could signal a plan to flee. But he also purchased a plane ticket for his girlfriend to travel to her native Philippines and wired her $100,000 (Â£75,400) before the shooting rampage, which some experts say could suggest he was trying to ensure she was taken care of after his death. Police have questioned Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, who has co-operated with police since she returned home from the Philippines earlier this week. Ms Danley, 62, said she had no idea about what Paddock had been plotting, adding that she thought the money was a sign he was planning to end the relationship. Eric Paddock, the suspect's brother, told reporters that his brother did not have any ties to political or religious groups. This video can not be played Eric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter Sheriff Lombardo has previously suggested that investigators were open to the possibility that someone else was involved. When asked if he had an accomplice, Mr Lombardo said he had the ""assumption that he had to have some help at some point"". Sheriff Lombardo said investigators had noted 200 ""instances"" of Paddock moving around Las Vegas before the attack. Paddock was always alone, the sheriff said.

Are you being sexually harassed at work?,"Sexual harassment at work has returned to the headlines afterUS film producer Harvey Weinstein apologisedabout the way he had ""behaved with colleagues in the past"". It came after a newspaper reported a number of sexual harassment allegations against him. What sort of behaviour counts as sexual harassment at work? And how should you deal with it if you think it is happening to you? Put simply, sexual harassment is unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature. This harassment can be verbal or non-verbal and may make you feel intimidated or uncomfortable. You do not need to have objected to a person's behaviour for it to be considered unwanted, Citizens Advice points out. It can include: Sexual comments or jokes - in person or via email Inappropriate touching, such as pinching, patting or hugging Unwelcome sexual advances or other forms of sexual assault Staring in a sexually suggestive manner or wolf whistling Displaying images of a sexual nature - for example, a colleague may put up a topless calendar or picture which you find offensive Being treated less favourably as a result of rejecting any such conduct Sexual Harassment at work: Four women reveal all The photographer telling women's sexual harassment stories I take selfies with men who harass me Anyone who experiences sexual harassment at work in the UK is protected by theEquality Act 2010,external. In some cases, telling someone their behaviour is making you uncomfortable may be enough to stop it, says employment solicitor James Watkins, from Slater and Gordon. Confiding in another colleague at work could also help you to decide what to do, he says. If not, you can: Tell your manager - Citizen's Advice suggests you put this in writing and keep a copy Keep a diary recording the harassment, when it happens and who witnessed it Speak to your HR department or trade union, who can offer advice - you can stay anonymous if you choose Make a formal complaint - all employers are required to have a grievance procedure - where you can set out in writing the ""who"" ""what"" ""where"" of the harassment and how it made you feel If these options don't work, you can make a claim to an employment tribunal. Before making a claim to an employment tribunal you have to go through an early conciliation process provided by mediation group Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) - it may be able to negotiate a settlement or practical solution for you. If this is not possible, you can make a claimonline,external. Claims can be made by women or men, including employees, apprentices and job applicants You must bring a claim within three months of the act of harassment A person can bring a claim against their employer and the perpetrator simultaneously A witness statement detailing the harassment is needed, but this does not have to be read out by the claimant A tribunal judge will consider whether a ""reasonable"" person would have been offended by the behaviour Employment tribunal fees havebeen scrapped, meaning you only pay for any legal representation you choose to have ""I was sexually harassed at work by two men, who had worked there for a long time. ""One of them said they would like to put me over the desk and ravish me and they would look at my legs when I was walking past. ""I did bring this up with a senior manager, but he shouted at me and said it was my word against my colleague... I left in tears and signed off sick...""Jane, London What it is like to be sexually harassed at work? Research published last year by the TUCsuggested more than half of women say they have been sexually harassed at work - and most admit to not reporting it. It found that in nine out of 10 cases the perpetrator was male, and nearly one in five women (17%) said it was their line manager or someone with direct authority over them. Reasons given for not reporting the harassment included embarrassment (20%), fear they would not be taken seriously (24%), or that reporting it would affect their relationships at work (28%).

Ryanair pilot on what it's like to work for the airline,"Michael O'Leary is chief executive of Ryanair Cabin crew reduced to tears, pilots refused days off even for their weddings, and workers ""left in exile"" thousands of miles from their homes and families. After budget airline Ryanair was forced to cancel thousands of flights - repeatedly blaming a rostering error rather than an alleged pilot shortage - chief executive Michael O'Leary has written to pilots offering them better pay and conditions. Here, a long-serving pilot explains why the offer is ""too little, too late"", and explains why his colleagues are leaving the airline. Ryanair said it had ""messed up the allocation of annual leave"", but pilots claim their colleagues are leaving to fly for other airlines Mr O'Leary is partly right to say the cancellations have been caused by problems accommodating pilots' leave, says the pilot. But this has been exacerbated by unhappy staff seeking new jobs with rival airlines, he believes. ""The Irish Aviation Authority has changed the rules where pilots cannot fly more than 1,000 hours in a rolling year, and the flight hours have to be taken from January to December, whereas Ryanair were using April to April. ""Ryanair have been given two years' notice but the company have left it to the last minute,"" the pilot says. ""It's been the perfect storm because, at the same time, other airlines are hiring crews, so they are leaving for pastures new. ""If it wasn't for the crews' goodwill I think this crisis would have come sooner, because for a long time now they've been asking people to work days off. ""Pilots are being used as the scapegoat to cover for incompetency in the upper management, and it's just totally disgusting. ""Instead of O'Leary standing up and taking the blame he's directing the problems and the blame at pilots and saying it's because we're taking leave and holidays. ""That's simply not true. It may be true in a very few cases, but people are working harder now than ever to try to make up this shortfall in crewing levels that we have."" Ryanair staff have been sharing memes among each other that compare the management of Ryanair to the North Korean regime The pilot said he and many other newly-qualified pilots joined Ryanair following the recession of 2008 when it was one of the few airlines still recruiting. ""A lot have remained here ticking along, but now that the market has become a lot more buoyant and there are other competitors offering much better terms and conditions, they've had enough and they are leaving,"" he said. ""On a local level the company is fantastic and I'm very fortunate to work with some very highly-skilled individuals. ""Then you have the management at the upper level and it's run like a communist regime in some respects. It's dictated from the top and you are just expected to get on with it. ""I know of colleagues that have had leave denied to get married and then these pilots rely on the goodwill and conscience of other pilots to cover their rostered flights so they can get married. ""This company will happily fire pilots to quell any uprising, even to the point wherethey would close a base,externalor multiple bases to send a message to the rest: 'You just get on and do your job and keep doing what we tell you to do'. ""We have some memes that have been doing the rounds which we feel accurately portray the situation and feelings of the crew - comparing the company to the North Korean communist regime. ""The way they treat the staff is not much better, if not worse, than the way they treat their customers. ""People have just had enough of the toxic atmosphere that's been created here."" The BBC contacted Ryanair with these claims and a spokesman said it was ""untrue"" there was a toxic atmosphere among staff. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has said he would ""challenge any pilot to explain how this is a difficult job or how it is they are overworked"" Mr O'Leary has said pilots fly for no more than 18 hours a week. However, the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) has said this ""does not seem to have any basis in reality"". The pilot echoed the Balpa view. ""In reality our hours are much longer than that,"" he said. ""[Mr O'Leary] has divided the maximum amount of hours a crew can fly in a year, which is 900 hours, by 52 weeks. ""I typically fly between 30 to 40 hours a week. This is what is called 'flight duty' and starts from reporting to work to when we set the parking brake at the end of the day. ""This does not include turnarounds and post-duty paperwork, which we are not paid for. ""If Ryanair advertise to their customers that the flight leaves at five o'clock and arrives at seven o'clock then we only get paid for those two hours. ""We are not paid for the time spent getting back to base either. Sometimes it's a case that you can't get back on the same day and you are having to pay for a hotel out of your own money, then catch a flight the following day to get home or catch multiple flight connections if the base isn't particularly well connected."" Ryanair declined to comment on whether pilots are paid only for the advertised length of the flight. It has said previously that pilots receive ""great pay and industry-leading terms and conditions"". There is a lack of basic benefits such as crew meals and drinks, the pilot said ""Cabin crew are employed under similar conditions, on agency contracts, and the things I've seen are pretty disgusting,"" said the pilot. ""They are given unachievable sales targets, and if they've not reached sales targets they will be berated in a debriefing afterwards by a base supervisor, who is acting as a minion for Dublin. ""It's known for cabin crew to cry after their debriefings. I've seen them lined up almost like a military parade before being inspected, having their bags searched and all kinds of things. ""These people are not earning very much money - around Â£1,000 a month. ""In some bases the cabin crew even have to rent one room together, and sleep in the same bed - maybe one person who works early shifts and one person who works late shifts - because they are not paid enough to even afford their own accommodation in those particular areas. ""It's quite common for them to be threatened to be moved to a less desirable base, further away from home, unless their sales improve. ""There is also a lack of basic benefits - no free bottles of water, coffee or tea and no crew meals. All of this needs to be brought to work by the pilot and it's the same for cabin crew. ""They provide a water dispenser at every crew room, where you need to take an empty bottle to fill up. You also pay for your own uniform through a Ryanair-approved supplier."" The BBC asked Ryanair to comment on cabin crew being threatened and berated for not meeting sales targets, not being able to afford accommodation and sharing beds with colleagues. Ryanair responded: ""These claims are untrue."" The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) has ""urged Ryanair to do more to encourage pilots to stay with the airline"" ""Some competitors do have similar work arrangements, but nothing to the extent that Ryanair do,"" the pilot said. ""They'vecopied the low cost business model from Southwest Airlines[in the United States] but gone to the extreme. ""Southwest make good profits and it's been ranked as one of the best airlines in America to fly for, as they take good care of crews and pay them well. ""However, Michael O'Leary seems to have taken enjoyment from taking the low road andtaunting his customers,externaland crews because he knows he can get away with it. ""Passengers want a British Airways service, but ultimately when it comes to booking they will book with Ryanair because he's offering a 10-euro seat. ""However, the tactics of ruling by fear and divide and conquer are outdated in the pilot market we're in now. ""Now, with the invention of WhatsApp people are openly discussing what's going on, and people are starting to see that there is more unity coming together. ""If there's no improvement here, and the management continue to bury their head in the sand, many people will continue to leave and the mass exodus will just continue."" The pilot saidMr O'Leary's offer of better pay and conditions""does not come across as sincere and genuine"". ""People want to stay, they want to work and do a good job, but management are treating us like the enemy when we are the assets of the company,"" he said. ""We are an airline and without pilots and cabin crew the aircraft go nowhere."" In his latest letter to pilots, Mr O'Leary said he had interacted with many pilots over 30 years. ""Over this period I have always tried to be courteous, respectful and grateful for the outstanding job that you do, and this will remain my approach."" Michael O'Leary, pictured outside a British Airways travel shop in 1998, has taken cost-cutting culture to the extreme, said the pilot Ryanair began operating in 1985, originally flying daily from Waterford in Ireland to London Gatwick In the early 1990s, the airline's founder Tony Ryan sent Michael O'Leary, an accountant by training, to Texas to find out how Southwest Airlines was making profits with lower fares Mr O'Leary, now chief executive, took cost-cutting culture to the extreme, eventelling his staff to take pens from hotels and legal offices instead of buying them,external Ryanair now has 4,200 pilots flying a fleet of 400 Boeing 737-800 aircraft between more than 200 airports in 33 countries It reports carrying 131 million passengers a year, more than any other airline in Europe, and operates more than 2,000 flights a day Read more - Ryanair and Easyjet: The history of the peanut airlines The BBC agreed not to identify the pilot.

Britain's teenage drug runners," London is getting crowded. For the capital’s drug dealers, it’s a tough market. Gangs compete for shrinking territories while dodging police officers who know their faces and movements well. But travel outside the capital and it’s a different story. In the countryside, these gang members are less to the authorities. There are fewer rivals and demand is high. This situation is being exploited by several urban gangs, giving rise to the‘country lines’ phenomenon. Urban gangs are sending junior members to market towns or coastal villages, where they run increasingly sophisticated drug dealing franchises. The gangs recruit local rural children to do the grunt work while senior gang members manage operations from their London headquarters. Put simply, they’re expanding. Senior gang members don’t choose just anyone to go into the country. They need a workforce that’s easily controlled – so it’s often the youngest members who are put on the train. Childrenas young as 12are known to be transporting and selling drugs for urban gangs. They can spend weeks at a time in the countryside, returning only when their supply is sold out. Orders from local customers are relayed to them via a dedicated phone line – the so-called ‘country line’ - which is usually manned by higher-ranking gang members back in London. When an order comes in, the runners go out to deliver it. Mr A is a senior gang member and cook in London. He’s been producing crack cocaine since he was 15 or 16 years old. “This is the white gold,” he says. He receives cocaine of up to 95% purity, which he cooks into crack and breaks apart for packaging. “I got thrown out of school, thrown out of college. Life never looked that bright for me,” he says. “Out on the street, cooking was the next thing that I learned.” The crack is broken into £10 or £20 chunks and wrapped in plastic. Mr A burns the edges to seal each package. The wraps are sorted into separate stashes worth £1000 each, known as “g-packs”. These are packed into plastic tubes referred to as “plugs.” Why? Because, “he'll have to plug that in his arse” says Inky, a London gang member who works with Mr A. The runners are typically very young, vulnerable teenagers with complicated backgrounds. They’re offered the chance to earn £200-£500 a week – the kind of money that these kids (and sometimes their families) find hard to turn down. “He’s the successor to the throne,” Mr A says as he introduces SK, a senior runner with his gang. Now, the drugs are ready for distribution to the countryside. Up to46,000 childrenare believed to be involved in gang activity in the UK. Social services are struggling to tackle the issue and politicians are unable to agree on the best way to combat its underlying causes. The country lines phenomenon has been flagged by a cross-party initiative of 19 local councils as“the next big grooming scandal.” “I don’t groom no one,” says Mr A. “No I don’t feel bad for using young people. Society grooms people, just like it groomed me.” London gangs dominate these rural networks, but there are nowreports of country lines being operated out of other major cities, including Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Reading. Established country line activity was reported by 71% of police forces in England and Wales in a2016 NCA report, with a further 12% of forces reporting an emerging picture over the six months to last November. Once they’re in the country, the runners are on call 24 hours a day. SK stays out there for as long as his pack of drugs lasts - usually two or three weeks. “You’re not really allowed to come back,” he says. “It’s just working, working, working.” The runners are based in a location arranged by senior gang members ahead of their arrival. Often, the gang will have taken over the home of a local drug addict– a practice known as ‘cuckooing’. They may start off by paying them in drugs or cash but sometimes it’s done coercively. The addict’s immediate circle frequently forms the gang’s first customers. They’ll text what are essentially advertisements to the user’s phone contacts, offering them bulk discounts and limited offers. Over time, news of a line spreads, helped along by the runners distributing business cards and leaflets through the letterboxes of known drug users. Gangs earn between £2,000 and £3,000 profit per day, per line, with some gangs operating several lines simultaneously. A country line can last for years, building up hundreds of customers. In some instances,lines have even been sold between gangscomplete with their customer bases. Runners get a small cut of the profits. They’ll usually cover their own expenses while in the country, as well as any losses incurred. It’s not unusual for runners to be robbed (or arrested), in which case they’ll be fined the value of the lost drugs. That debt needs paying off, leading to them working for the gangs without pay. In some cases where a runner owes money, senior gang members can even force that child’s siblings to take on their debt, creating new runners transporting and selling drugs against their will. The government and police are suggesting using the 2015 Modern Slavery Actto combat country lines dealing under the rationale that the gangs are trafficking children. But no one has yet been prosecuted under these laws for the trafficking of UK children in relation to country lines dealing. In the meantime, the drug networks continue to expand. SK has now set up his own franchise, with a local gang bulk-buying drugs from him to sell on their own phone line. “The hardest thing about dealing is not getting robbed, and trying to stay alive,” says SK. “Right now we’re still here aren’t we?” He points to himself and his new recruits. “One, two, three - live in the flesh. As far as I can see, everyone of us here right now is loving this life. There’s no turning back.” The country line is never closed. Once a runner’s stash is sold, a second runner will be sent to take over, allowing the first runner to go home and restock. “He’ll come back, reload, have a bath, then same again,” says Inky.

School discipline: How strict is too strict?,"Sarah Vincent changed her daughter's school when the rules suddenly got very strict ""Everyone will sit up extra straight, eyes front, looking at the teacher. You will follow their instructions first time, every time."" Pretty comfortable with that? Parents may well agree that this excerpt fromGreat Yarmouth Charter Academy's school rules,externalis no bad thing. The rules also require pupils to read with a ruler and to wait for teacher's instructions before picking up a pen or anything else. When they are not reading or writing they must sit up straight with their arms folded and they must ""track the teacher"" around the room. ""You never turn around - even if you hear a noise behind you. You don't look out of the window. You don't lose focus,"" the rules from new academy sponsors, Inspiration Trust, say. Still reasonable? Well, a group of parents did not think so and responded by contacting newspapers with claims children had wet themselves in class because they were not allowed to go to the toilet. One upset parent, Sarah Vincent, said: ""If we treated our children like that we would be reported to social services."" Her daughter, Summer, had become ""withdrawn"" and ""miserable"" after being repeatedly pulled up for uniform infringements, she said. She was then given a demerit because she did not have her arms folded as per the school rules, Sarah added. Others complained pupils were being isolated for as little as dropping a pencil, and parents of at least 16 children have applied to move them to other schools. But the school, which the new academy trust is trying to turn around after it was rated inadequate, insists it is simply trying to enforce new, high standards of behaviour where they had been lacking. Children were in school to learn, not look out of the window, a trust spokesman said. ""Setting out clear expectations means everyone knows what is expected and lessons start promptly and run efficiently, so that every pupil gets the most of their time in school."" Pupils had been getting out of their chairs and sometimes leaving classrooms and it was necessary now to enforce order, he said. ""It's very early days,"" he added. ""And there's been a culture shock from where the school was previously."" And some parents have been delighted with the change. Parent Tanya McCormick said it had been ""so far so good"" for her daughter and that she thought parents might be ""pleasantly surprised"" by the effect of the new regime by the end of term. But the case has certainly prompted parents, particularly those of children new to secondary school, to ask how strict is too strict. David, an 11-year-old who has just started a very popular London boys' state school, describes all the things for which you can get a detention. ""For talking too loudly in the playground, for talking while you are lining up... ""You can get one if you don't take your bag off within five seconds of going inside, if you take more than 10 minutes to eat your lunch, or if you have a sweet wrapper in your pocket. ""It just feels like you're only really behaving because you are scared you will get a detention,"" he says. Christopher, a pupil at another successful boys' state school, says about 80% of the boys in his class had been given a detention in the first week. He says his best friend crosses himself every time a detention is dished out in class, like he has ""dodged a bullet"". But are these boys enjoying their new schools? The answer's yes -  they love them. But both think teachers should stop handing out quite so many detentions. Jarlath O'Brien, director of schools with the Eden Academy Trust, says every September a slew of stories about parents horrified at the strictness of their new schools hits the headlines. ""No teacher would say 'we don't really care about bullying or the lessons being disrupted',"" he says. ""My concern is when you have a set of rules which start to interfere with the flow of things."" He gives the example of a school allowing short or long-sleeved shirts in its uniform, but not allowing rolled-up sleeves. ""A child might inadvertently roll his sleeves up, and then the lesson is disrupted because the teacher has to pick the child up on it."" Old school ties? Some schools specify how to tie them, as well as which to wear There has been a tendency in recent times to equate smart uniform with high standards of behaviour, he says, but the two are not the same. Being too strict can ""smack of professional insecurity"", he says, adding that this can backfire when ""kids find themselves getting into bother without even trying"". The government's behaviour tsar Tom Bennett says people outside the UK ""marvel at our obsession with school uniform"". He says the media pander to it by reporting examples of entire forms being sent home for wearing the wrong shoes or some such. But it can used as a way of fostering a sense of belonging, he says, and letting pupils know: ""This is the way we do things around here."" The best behaviour policies balance a culture of discipline with lots of pastoral support, he says. ""You need to have the compassion within the school structure. ""If you have that, if you have the love as well as the discipline, then things can really sky-rocket.""

"Amy Winehouse, music, arthritis and me","Jade Carter has spent a lot of her life in hospital. Rheumatoid arthritis causes the 20-year-old such intense pain she sometimes can't move. That's where music helps. ""I kind of enter this different world when I'm singing. I feel like I can just let go of the reality of life,"" she tells Newsbeat. Now Amy Winehouse's charity is helping her find her voice and launch a singing career. Amy Winehouse died in 2011, aged 27 ""I was singing since I was six-years-old, when my mum would leave me in Great Ormond Street hospital,"" she says. ""I just wrote songs all the time because that's pretty much all I could do. I couldn't go to school a lot of the time."" It paid off. Last night Jade performed for some of the biggest names in UK music, including Emeli Sande, Naughty Boy and Trevor Nelson, at the Amy Winehouse Foundation Gala, an event in memory ofthe late singer. She's one of a small group of musicians chosen for Amy's Yard, a 12-week project which gives them time in the late singer's studio, working with a producer on their own track. Trevor Nelson and Clara Amfo hosted the Amy Winehouse Foundation Gala ""It was a really lovely experience,"" says Jade, ""Too much information, but I would sit on the toilet and be like 'Amy probably sat on this toilet,"" she laughs. Jade, from London, was diagnosed with arthritis as a baby. ""I was on and off lots of trial drugs as well as arthritis drugs. Without those I think I would be in a wheelchair now. ""I can't bend my arm properly, sometimes I can't move my legs. I feel like I literally can't move my entire body.""

Doubts about May now out in the open,"""Nothing has changed."" Rememberthat? There is, this morning, an operation being mounted by the government to try to show that nothing has changed in the Conservative Party in the last few days, that Theresa May's leadership remains on track and she is, to use another of her famous phrases, just, ""getting on with the job"". Except, as happened the last time she proclaimed ""nothing has changed"", something rather fundamental has, after all. For the doubts that have been building about her in the party for months are now out there in the wide open. Grant Shapps urges Tory leadership contest Tories rally around PM after speech woes PM struggles through interrupted speech Yes, they have only been articulated by two former ministers, Grant Shapps and Ed Vaizey. Yes they were both close to David Cameron. Yes they were both Remainers too, which allows a conspiracy theory to take hold that the efforts to get rid of Theresa May are really a guise for stopping Brexit. (Having talked to those involved for some time, the doubts are about competence and authority, not Brexit and there is at least one senior Brexiteer among their number). And yes, most importantly of all, just as it was on the morning after the election, there is still no obvious successor to Theresa May, who commands broad support right across the Tory Party. If there had been, it's likely that she would have gone then. That is really why those around Theresa May believe they have got the plot under control. But the public, and now the prime minister's opponents across the table in the Brexit talks are aware that some of her colleagues simply don't think that she is up to the job. Remarks by Mr Vaizey and Mr Shapps can't be unsaid. The private questions are now out there in the ether and can't be taken back. Even if the plot has been killed off at birth, it's another crack in her authority, already so fractured after the election. It doesn't mean she'll have to go now, or indeed anytime soon. Other leaders have survived countless attempts to shove them out. But even many of Theresa May's supporters know that something is deeply wrong, however many times they tell themselves, ""nothing has changed"".

Father loses IVF damages claim,"A father has lost a damages claim against a London IVF clinic after his ex-partner forged his signature to use frozen embryos. The High Court found IVF Hammersmith was not negligent. The couple broke up in 2010 but some months later the woman asked the clinic to implant an embryo, which they had stored. The man, who can only be identified as ARB, said he did not give his consent and was tricked by his former partner. After the couple had a son together through IVF at the clinic in 2008, a number of embryos were frozen and they signed agreements annually for these to remain in storage. In October 2010, the mother handed IVF Hammersmith a 'consent to thaw' form, forged with ARB's signature. On the basis of this document, an embryo was thawed and successfully implanted. The father said his ex-partner's dishonesty resulted in the birth of his daughter, an ""unwanted child"". ""It's a very, very difficult situation for me.  A beautiful child, a child that everyone would want, a child that I love.  But also a child that has brought us so much pain."" He argued that the clinic should pay for the cost of her upbringing, including private school fees, holidays, refurbishing her bedroom and her wedding. The presiding judge Mr Justice Jay said: ""Although he has lost this case, my judgment must be seen as a complete personal and moral vindication for ARB."" ""The same, of course, cannot be said for R.""  R was used to identify the mother in the case. Jude Fleming of IVF Hammersmith welcomed the finding: ""As a clinic, we place patient care at the heart of everything we do. ""We have been clear throughout that we have always adhered to the highest industry standards and met all statutory and regulatory obligations."" But the judge said he did have concerns about the way consent was obtained by clinics during this time. The clinic said it has since reviewed its procedures to ""ensure such a case could not occur again."" The father said: ""This claim has never been about money; it is about justice."" He plans to appeal the decision regarding damages in the Supreme Court.

The frustrating wait for an organ to save your life,"Heart failure left Julie exhausted and grey-skinned - a pump has brought the colour back to her cheeks and given her a good quality of life At home, Julie Bartlett has her bags packed and people on standby to drive her to hospital, just in case she receives a phone call saying doctors have a heart that is a match for her. If the call comes, she'll have a couple of hours to get to Harefield Hospital in west London - she can even rely on a police escort if she gets stuck in traffic. ""That call could be this afternoon. It could be never,"" she says, but she's optimistic that government plans for a new organ donation system of presumed consent in England might boost her chances significantly. While the policy content of Theresa May's conference speech on Wednesday mighthave been overlooked,one of the prime minister's announcements could potentially save many lives - about three people a day in the UK die because of a lack of organ donors. The Conservatives areproposing a consultation,externalon changing the organ donation system in England from opt-in to opt-out, meaning people's organs could be used in transplants when they died unless they expressly said otherwise. Currently, anyone who wants to donate their organs after death has to ""opt in"" through the donor card scheme. There are currently 6,500 people waiting for an organ donation and it is hoped the new system would see more organs becoming available. What do people waiting for an organ, and recent recipients of life-saving transplants, think of the proposed changes? Last Christmas, former midwife Julie Bartlett was fitted with an LVAD - a mechanical pump for the heart known as a ""bridge to transplant"" - but what she really needs is a new heart. ""I could kiss Theresa May - although she's got that bad cold,"" she said. ""It was something that I have been waiting for, for a long a time - the sooner they do it, the better."" England to consider opt-out organ donation Does an opt-out system increase transplants? Girl's donated organs help a record eight people In 2009, Julie was diagnosed with heart failure and never expected to see her first grandchild or go to her daughter's wedding. After it became end-stage heart failure and she was in a hospice, the option of the LVAD was presented to her. ""My quality of life is good now, but I have good days and bad days,"" she says. The LVAD means Julie is permanently attached to two lines, has to recharge batteries overnight and can shower only weekly because of the wound. ""There are limits, but I'm very blessed to have one and it's better than being bedbound in a hospice,"" she says. However, a new heart would transform her life. It would even free her to travel abroad, as while  on the waiting list she must stay in the UK. While she waits for that heart, Julie lives in limbo. She believes families should have the final decision over donation, as they do under the Welsh ""soft opt-out"" system - where if the individual's family objects, their organs are not removed. ""Families need to share what their wishes are, so they are less likely to go against the person's wishes. It's a gift,"" she said. Matthew's new kidneys allow him to ""do what normal boys do"" The Victoria Derbyshire programme spoke to 12-year old Matthew Pietrzyk, who spent eight years on dialysis after he was born with failing kidneys which had to be removed. He and his mum Nicola told the programme that the transplant has not only ""given him his life back"" but had also transformed those of his brothers and parents. The family can now go on holiday and make plans without the fear of emergency hospital visits. Nicola said she can finally ""be a mum"" instead of a nurse. Matthew believes that the new opt-out scheme will ""save lives"". But another patient in need of a kidney donor is not so impressed with the proposals. Kerigh Palmer, from Hertfordshire, whose first kidney transplant failed this summer, said the change would be ""pointless"" because, under the system the government is proposing, families could still stop donations. ""The majority of possible transplants are blocked by family members,"" she says. ""I don't think doctors should be saying 'these are your loved one's wishes, now what do you want to do?'"" ""It takes away the individual's choice."" Kerigh Palmer does not think the new opt-out scheme goes far enough Kerigh's transplant story has been long and full of hurt.  After her kidneys failed in 2015, her wife, Julie, offered to donate hers. But they weren't compatible so Julie donated to another patient, and Kerigh, 40, received hers from someone else. Julie's recipient's transplant was a success. Kerigh's, though, was not - complications during surgery meant it failed at the last hurdle. As she drifted in and out of consciousness after the operation, she heard the words: ""We are very sorry that it did not work."" ""Is it true?"" she asked Julie, who was lying in a hospital bed nearby. ""It was devastating. That person is living with my kidney effectively. We feel pretty bitter."" Julie, left, saved another kidney patient's life. But the kidney Kerigh received did not transplant successfully Straight after the gruelling failed operation, she was back on dialysis twice a week. ""I'm trying not to think about what's happened, because I will depress myself. ""I'm thinking ahead to Christmas, because I love Christmas. I'm not thinking 'where's my next kidney coming from?'"" But she admits it would be life-changing to have a successful transplant. ""I wouldn't be tied to the hospital, I could work full-time without having to work from hospital, I could go abroad on holiday, eat what I like, not have to second-guess everything I do.""

'EastEnders helped me learn how to speak English',"This video can not be played Farid says he watched EastEnders with his foster family You might expect anyone who learns their English from watching BBC One's EastEnders to pepper every other sentence with shouts of ""Get outta my pub!"", ""You ain't my mother!"" and the collected musings on life of that great sage, Mick Carter, as played by Danny Dyer. But picking up English from the soap was about more than a string of one-liners for Farid Saleh when he arrived in the UK from Afghanistan as a child refugee. It was a route to a new life. Farid's father had been killed in political violence and, as the oldest son, the 13-year-old was in danger. His family paid for him to get to the UK, where the scared and bewildered teenager was placed with a foster family.

So every night his foster mother would sit with him and they'd watch EastEnders together with the subtitles on. They would note new words and Farid would try to use them in sentences. Slowly and steadily he stopped being a teenager lost in a foreign world and grew into a young man with a future. You don't need to take my word for it. Farid speaks for himself in our film, although I should perhaps apologise for twisting his arm into saying the legendary ""Get outta my pub!"" line. ""EastEnders helped me to know what people were talking about at school,"" he says. ""I was able to be part of that conversation."" Farid has done well for himself (more on that later) because he was well supported. But professionals say watching soaps is no substitute for proper tuition that can accelerate integration. The problem is, somebody has to pay for it. Very few refugees have the means to do so until they get into work... and to get into work, they need to speak English. So the government funds English tuition. But the charity Refugee Action says new research has uncovered what it says is a crisis in English classes that is preventing people from integrating. The charity says tens of thousands of refugees in the UK are in a linguistic limbo as they wait to get on to courses, known as Esol, because of chronic underfunding. The delays faced by women are even longer because they struggle to get childcare. If people can't speak the language, they end up poorer and more isolated, experts suggest The system is ""simply not fit for purpose"", says Mariam Kemple Hardy of Refugee Action, adding that refugees are waiting up to three years to get classes. ""When you can't speak English, life can be extremely isolating. They can't make friends with their neighbours. It is incredibly hard to get a job, to become a real part of their community,"" she said. ""So learning English is a big part of rebuilding their lives in the UK. The government has to improve English language provision by increasing investment."" Funding for Esol comes from the Department for Education and stood at just over Â£200m eight years ago - since then it has fallen by half. Natecla, which is the national association for teachers in the field, says that in 2008-09 there were 207,400 adults on courses. That had fallen to 131,000 by 2014/15 - all during a period of high immigration -and it wants a new national strategy,externalfor England, like this in place in Wales and Scotland. Special funding for refugees from Syria Free classes for those who get jobseeker's allowance Others have to pay at least half of costs Asylum seekers (those seeking to be recognised as a refugee) must wait six months Foreign-born spouses treated as international students and must typically pay higher fees A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We are committed to supporting all adults in England secure the English language skills they need for life and work. Adults who are granted refugee status are eligible for the same skills funding as any other English resident."" But the calls for better funding are not new - and not confined to lobby groups. They have also come from one of the government's top advisers. TheCasey Review into Opportunity and Integration,external, commissioned by former Prime Minister David Cameron, concluded last year that if people can't speak the language, they end up poorer, isolated and living in segregated communities. It noted that over the course of two recent years more had been spent on Cornish than on English by the department responsible for integration. Ministers have promised to publish an integration strategy in the coming months. There are many charities and volunteers who are trying to plug the gap in helping new refugees to integrate. Farid is one of them. He is studying at university to become a social worker and also helping today's child refugees who feel as lost as he once did. So what does he tell them? ""My advice would be to watch EastEnders - and a lot of TV,"" he smiles. ""It will help you - put the subtitles on and watch them.""

Glamour is not the first magazine to change its focus to digital content - last yearIn Style,externalmagazineclosed its print edition,external, while in 2014Company,externalmagazinedid the same,external. Glamour UK's editor Jo Elvin was unavailable for comment. What can Glamour do online that others can't? Be better - more smart, beautiful, easy to use - perhaps. But that won't be easy. There is no getting around the deeper structural forces that are driving this change, which is the flight of readers from print to online, and the pursuit of those readers by advertisers for whom print is an ever lower priority. The claim that integrating editorial and commercial departments is ""a further innovative move"" is not up to much, because many others have been forced to do the same. And when editorial and commercial departments merge, it's generally because the money is running out and so the commercial team actually control the editorial content. Jo Elvin is the editor of the UK's Glamour magazine And that must be the concern for staff and indeed readers. The danger is that by moving online and focusing ever more on the traffic-generating beauty content, Glamour invests less and less in quality journalism. Of course they will deny that is either the intention or the probable danger, but it is a substantial risk. It has felt over recent months like an era is passing in magazine culture. In the US, the editors of Vanity Fair, Time, Glamour and Elle all departed. Not so long ago Rolling Stone was sold. And in recent weeks Hugh Hefner and Si Newhouse, two giants of magazine publishing, have died. It may seem a stretch to link those events to Glamour becoming an online beauty destination, but there is a link: the huge upheaval in journalism, driven by technology. High quality magazine journalism still has a future online of course, but only if people pay for it. Everyone who wants to see journalism thrive will wish Glamour well, and hope it focuses on quality as it navigates this transition.

Ex-EastEnders actor is spared prison,"Ex-EastEnders actor Joseph Shade admitted sex offences against three girls between 2012 and 2015 A former EastEnders actor has been given a suspended prison sentence for sex offences against teenage girls. Joseph Shade, 24, from Sheringham in Norfolk, played Peter Beale as a child from 1998 until 2004. The youth workeradmitted causing or inciting a childunder 18 to engage in sexual activity while in a position of trust and sexual activity with a child. Victims sitting in Norwich Crown Court shouted ""where is the justice for us?"" in response to his sentence. Shade was given an 18-month prison sentence suspended for two years. The offences were committed against three girls aged between 14 and 17, and happened between 2012 and 2015. Shade was working as a youth worker at Norfolk at the time. Shade played the character Peter Beale (being carried, above) between 1998 and 2004 He sent text messages to girls asking them to have sex or send him pictures of their breasts, and on a single occasion he touched one girl on the bottom, the court heard. Sentencing him, Judge Maureen Bacon QC said: ""You sought to engage vulnerable teenage girls in sexual activity when you were in a position of trust."" During mitigation, it was heard he was a ""young vulnerable individual"" who had been helped by the youth project himself. The ""humiliation has been significant"" for Shade, the court heard. Joseph Shade had helped by the youth project himself, the court heard Shade, of Cliff Road, Sheringham, admitted five counts of causing or inciting a child under 18 to engage in sexual activity while in a position of trust. He admitted one count of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. Shade was given a five-year sexual harm prevention order, barring him from working with children and vulnerable adults, and ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work. He must also sign the sex offenders register and complete a 60-day offender programme.

Can EastEnders really help you learn how to speak English?,"This video can not be played Farid says he watched EastEnders with his foster family You might expect anyone who learns their English from watching BBC One's EastEnders to pepper every other sentence with shouts of ""Get outta my pub!"", ""You ain't my mother!"" and the collected musings on life of that great sage, Mick Carter, as played by Danny Dyer.

Farid's father had been killed in political violence and, as the oldest son, the 13-year-old was in danger. His family paid for him to get to the UK, where the scared and bewildered teenager was placed with a foster family.

Reality Check: Is automation worse for men or women?,"Virtual waiters and waitresses, self-service checkouts and robot orchestra conductors: love it or hate it, automation, artificial intelligence and robotics are here to stay. But will these technological advances - be it in the office or the factory - affect the working life of men and women equally? While there is debate about the benefits of automation in the world of work, there is no escaping the fact that more robots and artificial intelligence means more jobs in science, technology, engineering and maths, known as the Stem group. In the US, home to some of the world's largest technology firms, growth in computing is expected to yield half a million jobs within the next decade. But the prospects for women and girls aren't looking good. If current gender ratios remain the same until 2020, according to the World Economic Forum's study of more than a dozen advanced economies, for every twenty jobs lost to automation, men working in Stem will see five new jobs and women just one. This research shows that at the current rate, women and girls risk missing out on the jobs of the future as more tasks at work become automated. Experts say that if there were more female computer scientists it would also ensure that women and men both have creative input and oversight of new technology. ""You get them [girls] interested in the power of technology. It's inspiring,"" says Aimee van Wynsberghe, the co-founder of Responsible Robotics, which specialises in ethics in new technologies such as robotics and automation. So what do we know about whose jobs are likely to disappear because of automation? On balance, the evidence shows that more men work in the jobs that are at risk from automation, says Dr Carl Frey, who co-authored a 2013 Oxford University study on American jobs that were susceptible to automation. Technology has in many ways, he says, benefited women in employment over the past century. Machines have created jobs that require more cognitive skills such as memory and reading, proven to be beneficial for women, and have replaced physical tasks done mainly by men. The World Economic Forum's 2016 Future of Jobs report indicated men and women would share the burden of jobs losses fairly equally. And PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2017 suggested a higher percentage of men in the UK, US, Germany and Japan worked in jobs at a high risk of automation. Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, is one of the leading women in technology But according to preliminary findings from the Institute for Spatial Economic Analysis (ISEA), in California, women are twice as likely to work in jobs with a high chance of being replaced by automation. Many of the jobs on the list of occupations that have a high chance of becoming automated were in the office and administrative sector, which employs more women than men. ""Public officials need to take a stand and prepare for the future,"" says Dr Jess Chen, from ISEA. The pace of change will vary in different sectors and parts of the world; unpredictable economic events could make investment in robotics or AI less or more likely. There will be jobs created in the future that don't exist now, and there will be demand for jobs that require tasks that can't be done by a robot. There are ethical and social concerns too: does everyone find it socially acceptable to have robots caring for their ageing grandparents? BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. In 2017, we're challenging them to tackle four of the biggest problems facing women today - the glass ceiling, female illiteracy, harassment in public spaces and sexism in sport.

Find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,externaland use #100Women Read more:Who is on the 100 Women list? Calls to get more women and girls working in the Stem fields are about employment opportunities, but addressing the gender gap also protects against bias, experts say. Bias can be manifested in a number of different ways, says Catherine Ashcraft, director of research at the National Centre for Women and Information Technology, ranging from hiring practices to interview techniques. And there are other instances of human bias about race and gender actually becoming part of a computer's decision-making process. ""Biases can also evolve even after technologies are created through machine learning - because they learn from the data we give them. This also ends up reflecting our biases,"" says Dr Ashcraft. Machine learning, a type of AI, can help humans perform tasks and take decisions by seeing patterns in large quantities of data. This concern about bias has become especially relevant in the world of work because companies have started to screen applicants using artificial intelligence. ""Would artificial intelligence find a male applicant less fit for a nurse position? Or would this lead to women having lower chances to be called for a programming position?"" said Aylin Caliskan, an AI expert at Princeton University, in an interview withScience magazine,external. Therefore, it could make a difference if more women work in the professions overseeing this new technology. ""If we don't do something, bias will propagate and get worse,"" says Aimee Van Wynsberghe, the robotics expert. Search for your job below to find out how susceptible it is to automation.

"House price rises picking up, says Halifax","House prices across the UK have jumped by an average of 4% in the year to September, according to Britain's largest lender, the Halifax. The rate indicates a pick-up from August, when the Halifax said prices were rising at an annual pace of 2.6%. The Halifax said the average price of a house or flat in the UK had now risen to a new high of Â£225,109. A shortage of properties for sale and growth in full-time employment was supporting prices, it said. ""However, increasing pressure on spending power and continuing affordability concerns may well dampen buyer demand,"" said Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax Community Bank. Rival lender Nationwide has said prices in the year to September rose by 2%. London house prices fall for first time in eight years The Halifax figures are not broken down by region, but other research has indicated that while house price growth is slowing in the south of England, it is rising in parts of the Midlands and the North. Between August and September, prices rose by 0.8%, the Halifax said, compared to a monthly rise of 1.5% in the previous month. The 4% annual rise in house prices is calculated by comparing the three months to September with the same three months last year.

So the government funds English tuition. But the charity Refugee Action says new research has uncovered what it says is a crisis in English classes that is preventing people from integrating. The charity says tens of thousands of refugees in the UK are in a linguistic limbo as they wait to get on to courses, known as Esol, because of chronic underfunding. The delays faced by women are even longer because they struggle to get childcare. If people can't speak the language, they end up poorer and more isolated, experts suggest The system is ""simply not fit for purpose"", says Mariam Kemple Hardy of Refugee Action, adding that refugees are waiting up to three years to get classes. ""When you can't speak English, life can be extremely isolating. They can't make friends with their neighbours. It is incredibly hard to get a job, to become a real part of their community,"" she said. ""So learning English is a big part of rebuilding their lives in the UK. The government has to improve English language provision by increasing investment."" Funding for Esol comes from the Department for Education and stood at just over Â£200m eight years ago - since then it has fallen by half. Natecla, which is the national association for teachers in the field, says that in 2008-09 there were 207,400 adults on courses. That had fallen to 131,000 by 2014/15 - all during a period of high immigration -and it wants a new national strategy,externalfor England, like this in place in Wales and Scotland. Special funding for refugees from Syria Free classes for those who get jobseeker's allowance Others have to pay at least half of costs Asylum seekers (those seeking to be recognised as a refugee) must wait six months Foreign-born spouses treated as international students and must typically pay higher fees A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We are committed to supporting all adults in England secure the English language skills they need for life and work. Adults who are granted refugee status are eligible for the same skills funding as any other English resident."" But the calls for better funding are not new - and not confined to lobby groups. They have also come from one of the government's top advisers. TheCasey Review into Opportunity and Integration,external, commissioned by former Prime Minister David Cameron, concluded last year that if people can't speak the language, they end up poorer, isolated and living in segregated communities. It noted that over the course of two recent years more had been spent on Cornish than on English by the department responsible for integration. Ministers have promised to publish an integration strategy in the coming months. There are many charities and volunteers who are trying to plug the gap in helping new refugees to integrate. Farid is one of them. He is studying at university to become a social worker and also helping today's child refugees who feel as lost as he once did. So what does he tell them? ""My advice would be to watch EastEnders - and a lot of TV,"" he smiles. ""It will help you - put the subtitles on and watch them.""

May: I have cabinet's full support,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Look, I've had a cold this week"" Theresa May has said she has the ""full support of her cabinet"" after a former party chairman said there should be a Conservative leadership contest. The PM insisted she was providing the ""calm leadership"" the country needed. Grant Shapps says about 30 Tory MPs back his call for a leadership contest in the wake of the general election results and conference mishaps. But his claims prompted a backlash from loyal backbenchers, several of whom called on him to ""shut up"". There has been leadership speculation since Mrs May's decision to call a snap general election backfired and the Conservatives lost their majority. Laura Kuenssberg: Doubts are now out in open Tories rally round May after speech woes PM struggles through interrupted speech The Conservative conference this week was meant to be a chance to assert her authority over the party, but her big speech was plagued by a series of mishaps, as she struggled with a persistent cough, was interrupted by a prankster and some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her. Asked about leadership speculation as she attended a charity event in her constituency, Mrs May said: ""What the country needs is calm leadership and that's what I am providing with the full support of my cabinet."" This video can not be played Former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said Theresa May should face a leadership election She said her recent speech in Florence had given ""real momentum"" to Brexit negotiations and she was intending to update MPs next week on her plans to help ""ordinary working families"" with a cap on energy bills. Environment Secretary Michael Gove was among cabinet ministers and MPs publicly defending Mrs May on Friday morning, as the story broke that Mr Shapps was the senior Tory behind a bid to persuade her to go. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4 the prime minister was a ""fantastic"" leader, had widespread support, and should stay ""as long as she wants"". He said that the ""overwhelming majority of MPs and the entirety of the cabinet"" backed the prime minister. Home Secretary Amber Rudd wrote an article inthe Telegraph,externalurging the prime minister to stay, while First Secretary of State Damian Green said on the BBC's Question Time the prime minister ""was determined as ever to get on with her job - she sees it as her duty to do so"". Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, hit out at those plotting to oust Mrs May as prime minister. Speaking to the BBC's Political Thinking podcast, she said: ""I have to say, I've not got much time for them... ""I really don't think that having a bit of a cold... when you are trying to make a speech changes the fundamentals of whether Theresa May is the right person to lead the country."" There is, this morning, an operation being mounted by the government to try to show that nothing has changed in the Conservative Party in the last few days. That Theresa May's leadership remains on track and she is, to use another of her famous phrases, just, ""getting on with the job"". Except, as happened the last time she proclaimed ""nothing has changed"", something rather fundamental has, after all. For the doubts that have been building about her in the party for months are now out there in the wide open. Read more from the BBC's political editor To trigger a vote of confidence in the party leader, 48 of the 316 Conservative MPs would need to write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. A leadership contest would only be triggered if Mrs May lost that vote, or chose to quit. Mr Shapps, who was co-chair of the party between 2012 and 2015, said no letter had been sent and said his intention had been to gather signatures privately and persuade Mrs May to stand down. But he claimed party whips had taken the ""extraordinary"" step of making it public by naming him as the ringleader of a plot to oust the PM in a story in the Times. He told the BBC: ""I think it's time we actually tackle this issue of leadership and so do many colleagues. ""We wanted to present that to Theresa May privately. Now I'm afraid it's being done a bit more publicly."" He added: ""The country needs leadership. It needs leadership at this time in particular. I think the conference and the lead-up through the summer has shown that that's not going to happen. I think it's time that we have a leadership election now, or at least let's set out that timetable."" This video can not be played The ""overwhelming majority of MPs"" support the prime minister, says Environment Secretary Michael Gove But Conservative MP Nigel Evans told the BBC's Daily Politics that if Grant Shapps ""can't get 48 signatures, he should just shut up: ""In my chats to MPs at Westminster nobody wants an early leadership election. We just simply don't want that."" Fellow MP James Cleverlytweeted,external: ""I've always liked Grant Shapps but he really is doing himself, the party and (most importantly) the country no favours at all. Just stop."" Among other MPs criticising Mr Shapps was Charles Walker, vice chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, who suggested the plot was going to ""fizzle out"". ""No 10 must be delighted to learn that it's Grant Shapps leading this alleged coup,"" he said. ""Grant has many talents but one thing he doesn't have is a following in the party."" Former minister Ed Vaizey was the first MP to publicly suggest Mrs May should quit on Thursday, telling the BBC: ""I think there will be quite a few people who will now be pretty firmly of the view that she should resign.""

Duped mum warns over fake holiday scam,"Jane Clark advised people to make proper checks before booking A woman conned by a fraudster selling caravan holidays via social media has urged others not to fall for the scam. BBC Scotland has spoken to dozens of people who paid for holidays in static caravan parks only to discover the real owner knew nothing about their booking. Fraudsters using fake identities have booked families into caravans they do not own and taken the money. Jane Clark, from Stevenston in Ayrshire, advised people not to believe what they read and make proper checks. She booked a bank holiday weekend at the Craig Tara caravan site near Ayr and paid Â£180 plus a Â£50 deposit. Ms Clark said: ""It was a last-minute thing and after a look on Facebook I saw an advert."" She sent messages to the Facebook profile and arranged to transfer money to a bank account. Ms Clark was told to pick up the keys from the holiday park reception at 18:00 on the day. This video can not be played Scammers are targeting people with fake deals for caravans It was her son who noticed messages on the social media site warning that the holiday offer was a scam. Ms Clark tried to send further messages to the woman she had booked with but was ""blocked"" and received no reply. She said her three children were devastated and she had lost hard-earned money that she could not afford to lose. The Craig Tara site is run by Haven holidays Holiday caravans were offered for rent by people who did not own them Haven, the holiday firm that runs the Craig Tara site, said it had recently introduced state-of-the-art software that seeks to target and report suspicious pages and listings across social media sites. A statement said: ""Whilst we have only experienced a relatively small number of people who have been duped into making fraudulent bookings, we are committed to proactively targeting these sites where we can."" Haven advised customers to only book through ""trusted channels"" such as official websites, ABTA agents or affiliated third parties. It said: ""We would urge customers not to attempt to make bookings through social media channels."" A Facebook spokesman said: ""Ensuring that people have a safe and positive experience when they use Facebook is our number one priority. This is why we have easy ways for everyone to report content and profiles that they suspect may break our Community Standards. ""Our global team of reviewers provide 24/7 cover around the world to ensure we can respond to these reports as quickly as possible."" Chief Inspector Scott Tees said the problem had become more widespread Chief Inspector Scott Tees, who is a cyber-crime prevention officer for Police Scotland. said the problem had become more widespread. He said the police investigated all the cases that were brought to them but admitted it was often difficult to catch the people involved. Ch Insp Tees said he understood that people were trying to get the best deal for their families but they were often leaving themselves vulnerable to scammers. ""They see an offer online that is very appealing to them, then they would book that with the best intentions, and this is what people are preying on,"" he said. He advised people to take a step back if a holiday looked ""too cheap"" and ask ""is this genuine?"". The police officer said people should try to speak to someone in person and be very careful if ""alarm bells start ringing"". Sue and Dave Lloyd said the scam had spoilt their enjoyment of their caravan Sue and Dave Lloyd, who live in Kilsyth, told BBC Scotland their static caravan was used by online scammers without their knowledge. A woman had turned up at their caravan at Haggerston Castle in Northumberland and asked for the keys because she had booked a holiday via an online site. Mrs Lloyd said she later found adverts from the same scammer on lots of social media and free advertising websites. Her husband Dave said: ""We are doing something that is perfectly legitimate and this guy is taking money under false pretences and causing all kinds of trauma to the people concerned. ""They are all excited about coming for a holiday and when they get there they find there isn't one. ""It does not just reflect on us, it reflects on everyone. ""It makes people become even more wary about booking private holidays rather than having to go to the big companies and pay a lot more money for the same thing."" Mrs Lloyd said the experience had spoilt her enjoyment of her holiday home. ""I am not interested in that caravan any more,"" she said. ""It just seems wrong to still let people stay there unless they are family and friends."" According to Mr Lloyd: ""We were told it happens a lot just now but there is not a lot we can do about it."" Jane Clark says that since she fell for the scam she has learned of lots of other people who have also been affected. ""It is still going on,"" she said. ""There are still people doing it. I don't know why they have not been caught. ""There are a few people on Facebook that do caravans and they are legitimate but I still don't think I would ever do it again through Facebook. Don't believe what you read."" For Ms Clark, there was a happy ending of sorts when the owner of another caravan on the site she had booked gave them a weekend for free to make up for their loss. ""I'm very grateful to her,"" she said. ""It was a very nice thing to do.""

The stand-up comedian who can't speak,"This video can not be played Lee Ridley a.k.a. ""Lost Voice Guy"" reveals the perils of relying on a synthetic voice for comic timing Life as a disabled person sometimes means you are asked slightly confused questions. But amid those awkward moments, there can be humour. The following is an edited version of a monologue by Lost Voice Guy, Lee Ridley. He has cerebral palsy and uses a synthetic voice on his iPad to talk. He first performed this sketch for the BBC at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. One thing I've noticed about being a stand-up comedian is that mixing a disabled guy with loads of drunk people is rarely a good idea. In fact, I would say the majority of my awkward moments come from meeting people in bars after my gigs. It still amazes me how people can quite happily watch me on stage and laugh at my jokes, but as soon as I'm off stage, they aren't sure how to treat me. They either think I'm deaf, and write everything down to show me, or they talk to my mates instead, even though they've just seen me on stage. They could at least give me a bit of credit. My most awkward moment came after a gig at The Stand Comedy Club in Newcastle. I had just been on stage and was chilling out in the bar when this bloke came up to me and asked me if I really could talk - as if I was only putting it on to take advantage of the disabled parking. Ridley, here with his personal assistant Emy Jones, won the BBC New Comedy Award 2014 I had never been in a position where someone has questioned my disability before. Well, if you don't count my Department for Work and Pensions assessment. Surely it was obvious I was disabled? I mean, I have the funny walk and everything. Not even the best method actor could put this rubbish on for days at a time. But he didn't believe me. I tried to lighten the mood by making a joke and told him that if I was going to lie about being disabled, I doubt I would have chosen this. I explained that, as a comedian, not being able to speak is probably the worst disability to pretend to have. Lee was one of seven people with a disability or mental health difficulty to perform a story about awkward moments as part of BBC Ouch's storytelling event at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

It's far more likely I would pretend I couldn't walk, so I could perform while sitting down, or maybe I would say that I was blind, then I'd be able to let my dog poo on people who didn't laugh at my jokes. I told him my job would be so much easier if I could talk because, apparently, it's very important to get your tone of voice right when doing comedy. That meant I was completely screwed because my voice always sounds the same when I'm excited, miserable, happy or bored. Except on Tuesday nights, I added, when I pretend to be a woman. The bloke laughed and I thought that was the end of the matter. But instead of walking away, like any normal person, he decided to ask me if I had ever tried to talk just to see what would happen - as if I had just been lazy all of my life. I said no, I hadn't tried to talk before, mainly because I knew nothing would happen. Besides, I've built a career out of not being able to speak so I didn't think I should encourage my voice to magically reappear. Then I realised, because he was drunk, he'd be very easy to wind up. I told him that I talk in my sleep. I said I know this because I always wake up with random sentences typed out on my iPad and he believed me. Then I convinced him I had a job as a satellite navigation system. He didn't seem too sure at first, so I got him to suggest a location and said I could direct him to it exactly. Thankfully, he chose somewhere I knew. So I started my journey. ""After 200 yards bear left. At the roundabout, take the second exit. Or is it the third? Follow the yellow brick road. Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street.  Take the bridge over troubled water. You're on the road to hell. Stop - hammer time."" But, even after all this, he still wouldn't leave me alone. So I did what I always do when I get tired of talking to people. I pretended my batteries had gone flat.

Is ex-warlord pulling election strings from UK prison?,"Liberia's former President Charles Taylor is currently serving a 50-year sentence for war crimes in a prison in the British city of Durham. But is he using that as a base to interfere in the elections in his homeland next Tuesday? ""If he was to come back today, I'd roll out the red carpet,"" said Justin Luther Cassell, a 32-year-old man sitting outside the Pray for Peace Business Centre in Gbartala, central Liberia. Gathered round on plastic chairs, drinking beer and discussing the forthcoming Liberian elections, the men here are clearly frustrated. This was Charles Taylor's rebel headquarters in the 1990s. The former military base may be crumbling, with buildings almost completely engulfed by the jungle, but Taylor's name is still as strong as ever in Bong county. More than five years since the former president was sentenced for war crimes committed in neighbouring Sierra Leone, people in his heartland are still harking back to the old days. Charles Taylor's former rebel base in Gbartala is now in ruins ""Even with the sound of the gun, life was better,"" said one frustrated young man, bemoaning the lack of basic necessities in the country. In an unlikely alliance, former world footballer of the year George Weah, who is running on the presidential ballot for the third time, has chosen Taylor's ex-wife, Jewel Howard Taylor, as his deputy. Having historically been a staunch critic of Taylor and his National Patriotic Party (NPP), questions are being asked of the motives. George Weah and Jewel Howard Taylor have been touring the country together The union between Mr Weah's Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) and the NPP came just before a phone call from the former warlord was broadcast to a gathering of his supporters on his birthday in January this year. The call was made from inside a high-security prison in Durham. He is heard saying that ""this revolution is his life"", he advises his people not to betray the party: ""Go back to base and everything will be fine."" This video can not be played Charles Taylor's phone call from prison Rodney Sieh, editor of Front Page Africa - the Liberian paper that published the call - said he was sure that Taylor knew that ""he was speaking to an audience"". Taylor wanted his people to know that he was still relevant, according to Mr Sieh. ""He still wants his voice heard"" in the Liberian political scene, he said. Mrs Howard Taylor has made her allegiance to her ex-husband clear. In an interview with local journalists outside a campaign rally, she said that the country needed to get back to the ""agenda"" outlined by Taylor when he was president. But she denied that he was influencing the 2017 elections. 1989: Launches rebellion in Liberia 1991: Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebellion starts in Sierra Leone 1997: Elected president after a 1995 peace deal 1999: Rebels take up arms against Taylor June 2003: Arrest warrant issued; two months later he steps down and goes into exile in Nigeria March 2006: Arrested after a failed escape bid and sent to Sierra Leone June 2007: His trial opens - hosted in The Hague for security reasons April 2012: Convicted of aiding and abetting the commission of war crimes - later sentenced to 50 years in jail Oct 2013: Arrives in the UK to serve the remainder of his sentence Feb 2017: Phones political allies from inside a UK maximum security prison. Charles Taylor: Preacher, warlord, president Find out more about Liberia Speaking to the BBC after a friendly football game just outside the capital, Mr Weah admitted to taking a call from prison. But he rejected the idea that strings were being pulled. ""Charles Taylor is not running the campaign for us,"" he said. Defending his choice of running mate he said simply: ""People love her, she was the mother of this nation. ""If Charles Taylor was campaigning for me, I think the world would be aware."" Taylor's supporters in Gbartala say they would roll out the red carpet for the former leader should he return home But the world is aware of the alleged interference and it is concerned. Since news broke of the phone call, the US Congress passed a resolution that condemned any ""external interference"" in the poll and specifically any attempt by the convicted war criminal ""to influence the elections from prison"". The EU mission in Liberia has also made it clear that ""Charles Taylor is serving a 50 year jail sentence and he is not coming back to Liberia"". But if Taylor himself was to be believed when he left Liberia to be exiled in Nigeria on 11 August 2003, his intentions were clear. ""God willing, I will be back,"" he said at a resignation ceremony in the capital. Observers are concerned about meddling that could go beyond election day itself. Vice-President Joseph Boakai says he is nicknamed ""Sleepy Joe"" because he is a dreamer Mr Sieh told the BBC that Mr Weah now has some of Taylor's closest aides around him. ""He may not be here physically but he could influence a lot of things if one of these people are elected,"" the editor said. Mr Weah and Mrs Howard Taylor's main opponent is considered to be Vice-President Joseph Boakai - or ""Sleepy Joe"" as he is commonly known - because he is often caught napping at public events. The 73-year-old has served as vice-president under Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female president, for the past 12 years. But rumours of a rift between the two are rife. ""A lot more needs to be achieved,"" he told us when we caught up with him on the campaign trail. ""The Liberian people want to see development and someone who can unify them."" These women are fasting and praying for a peaceful election Asked about his nickname he smiled and said he is ""a dreamer"", but whether he has the charisma and dynamism to captivate Liberia's youthful population, only the vote on 10 October will prove. They have 20 candidates to choose from. Although many commentators predict a second round between Mr Weah and Mr Boakai, former Coca-Cola executive Alexander Cummings, who came on to the scene 18 months ago, is fast becoming a serious contender. A candidate needs more than 50% of the vote for a first-round victory. According to Mr Sieh, with his door-to-door strategy, Mr Cummings has changed the way campaigns are carried out in Liberia and he might just make it to a run-off. Former Coca-Cola executive Alexander Cumming has a chance of making it to the second round But for most Liberians, the most important thing is peace. Hundreds of women across the country are fasting and praying for a peaceful election. Just opposite President Sirleaf's private residence, 44-year-old Bernice Freeman is one of more than 100 women gathered under a tent providing shade from the hot sun. ""Every woman here has a very bitter past,"" she said with a determined look in her eye. ""Some of us were raped several times, we are tired."" The power of these women cannot be underestimated - this same group is credited with bringing an end to the conflict by forcing the warlords to engage in peace talks. Nobody here wants a return to those days.

Catalan police chief faces Madrid court,"Police moved in to prevent people voting in Sunday's disputed election The Spanish government's representative in Catalonia has apologised to those injured during police efforts to stop Sunday's independence referendum. But Enric Millo blamed the Catalan government for holding an illegal vote. Meanwhile the government in Madrid has issued a decree making it easier for companies to move their headquarters away from Catalonia. A Catalan minister told the BBC his government would go ahead with an independence debate in parliament. ""Parliament will discuss, parliament will meet,"" said Catalan foreign affairs chief RaÃ¼l Romeva. ""Every attempt the Spanish government has used to impede things to happen, they have been demonstrated completely not only useless but counter-productive,"" he told the BBC in English. Spain eases firms' exit from Catalonia Distressed police officer photo goes viral Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? In the first apology by a Spanish government official over the violence on Sunday, which saw hundreds injured as police, trying to enforce a Spanish court ban on the vote, attempted to seize ballot boxes and disperse voters, Mr Millo said he could not help but ""regret it and apologise on behalf of the officers that intervened"". Friday has seen a number of political, business and judicial developments in the unfolding crisis in Catalonia. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont now plans to address the Catalan parliament on Tuesday at 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT), the speaker of the parliament says. Spain's Constitutional Court had earlier suspended the Catalan parliament session that had been planned for Monday. There is speculation that the parliament will declare independence unilaterally at its next sitting, based on last Sunday's disputed vote. The final results from the outlawed poll show 90% of the 2.3m people who voted backed independence. Turnout was 43%. There have been several claims of irregularities, and many ballot boxes were seized by the Spanish police. After a cabinet meeting, the Spanish government spokesman also expressed regret that people had ""suffered consequences"" during Sunday's vote - though he cast doubt on the numbers who had been injured. ÃÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo suggested that new elections in Catalonia might be a way to heal the fracture caused by the disputed referendum. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold Madrid's decree making it easier for companies to relocate their legal base away from Catalonia means such a decision will now not need the prior approval of shareholders. According to media reports, the board of Barcelona-based Gas Natural Fenosa voted on Friday to move its headquarters to Madrid. The multinational utility company supplies gas and electricity to customers in Spain and beyond CaixaBank, a large Barcelona-based institution, has decided to move its headquarters from Barcelona to the city of Valencia. The bank said in a statement that it had taken the decision ""in light of the current political and social situation in Catalonia"" Sabadell, another major Barcelona bank,decided to transfer its legally registered base from Barcelonato the south-eastern Spanish city of Alicante on Thursday. Its HQ and workforce will remain in Barcelona This would ensure the banks remained within the eurozone and under the supervision of the European Central Bank, even if Catalonia broke away from Spain. Catalonia is Spain's richest region and accounts for 19% of Spain's GDP. Meanwhile, the Catalan chief of police, Josep Lluis Trapero, has appeared before a judge in a national criminal court in Madrid on suspicion of sedition against the state. His Mossos d'Esquadra force is accused of failing to help Guardia Civil police tackle thousands of pro-independence protesters outside the Catalan Economy Department in Barcelona on 20 September during the run up to the referendum. The Guardia Civil submitted an official accusation against the Mossos. In a statement, the Mossos said Mr Trapero had told the court that the force had not been made aware of the Guardia Civil action. ""The Mossos were not notified sufficiently in advance... and this forced them to adjust to the circumstances accordingly. The first they heard of the Spanish police's intended action was through the media,"" thestatement,externalsaid. ""Appropriate measures were taken ... In his opinion, he did not commit any crime of sedition or participated or collaborated in any such crime or any other."" Commander Trapero left court having denied sedition Another Catalan police officer and two leading independence activists, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez, are also being investigated in Madrid. They all left the court after Friday morning's hearing without facing any Spanish restrictions. Leading newspaper El Pais says the allegation of sedition is extraordinary in post-Franco democratic Spain. As recently as August, the Mossos was being widely praised for quickly tackling the Islamist cell that carried out the Barcelona terror attack in that month.

Top Hollywood producer 'sincerely sorry',"Film producer Harvey Weinstein has issued an apology as a newspaper reported a number of sexual harassment allegations against him. ""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it,"" said the movie mogul's statement. But he later disputed a New York Times report that claimed he harassed female employees over nearly three decades. The newspaper reported he had reached at least eight settlements with women. Mr Weinstein, a married father-of-five, said he planned to take a leave of absence from his company and had hired therapists to deal with his issue. ""My journey now will be to learn about myself and conquer my demons,"" the 65-year-old's statement on Thursday said. Weinstein is married to English fashion designer Georgina Chapman ""I so respect all women and regret what happened,"" he added in the statement initially given to the New York Times, and later sent to the BBC. It continued: ""I cannot be more remorseful about the people I hurt and I plan to do right by all of them."" The Miramax and Weinstein Company co-founder has produced a number of Oscar-winning blockbusters, including Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and The Artist. Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in another statement that he denies many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"". She also said that as a women's rights advocate she had been blunt with him that some of his conduct ""can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating"". ""He has acknowledged mistakes he has made,"" said Ms Bloom. ""He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways."" But another Weinstein lawyer, Charles Harder, said in a separate statementto the Hollywood Reporter,externalthat his client was preparing to sue the New York Times. The attorney said the newspaper's report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"". The statement also said the report ""relies on mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report, apparently stolen from an employee personnel file, which has been debunked by 9 different eyewitnesses"". It did not specify which particular parts of the Times article were disputed. Mr Harder's statement said the New York Times had ignored the ""facts and evidence"" and any proceeds from the lawsuit would be donated to women's organisations. Mr Weinstein has been married since 2007 to London-born fashion designer Georgina Rose Chapman, and they have two children.

Is privacy dead in an online world?,"Last month, 145 million Americans discovered they were victims of one of the biggest data breaches in history, after the credit rating agency Equifax was hacked. Social security numbers, birth dates, telephone numbers and, in some cases, driver's licence and credit card numberswere exposed, leaving people vulnerable to identity theft and fraud. Companies know more about individuals than they ever have. And almost every week there is news of a data hack. So does this mean that the age of personal privacy is over? BBC World Service's The Inquiry programme has been hearing the views of four experts. ""Technology has created enormous conveniences for us, but there is no reason why those conveniences have to inevitably come at the cost of giving up our privacy wholesale,"" says Ben Wizner, of the American Civil Liberties Union, who is chief legal adviser to the US intelligence leaker Edward Snowdon. Mr Wizner says people should be able to control information held on them, as well as with whom they share it. ""It is now both technologically and financially feasible for corporations and governments to collect and store records of almost all of our activities, records that never would have existed in the past,"" he says. All of this - whether harvested from the web, mobile phones or social media - creates vast amounts of data from consumers, held by corporations. And with the advent of smart appliances, this will only increase. ""You will be watching your television, your television will be watching you."" And he has concerns about agreements meant to safeguard consumers' data. ""It is literally impossible for consumers to read all of those agreements. What we all do instead is we click ""agree"". In legal terms, we have consented.  In meaningful terms, have we consented?"" Equifax raises the impact of US data breach Yahoo 2013 data breach hit 'all three billion accounts' Ransomware 'here to stay', warns Google Hiding out among the net's criminal class Personal information, Mr Wizner says, allows corporations to make highly accurate predictions about a person's life, including their sexuality and any health problems they may have. ""I think that we hear all too often this sort of blase remark that 'I don't need to be worried about surveillance because I've done nothing wrong and I have nothing to hide.' ""For every single one of us, there is some pile of aggregated data that exists, the publication of which would cause us enormous harm and, in some cases, even professional and personal ruin. ""Every single one of us has a database of ruin."" Former Amazon chief scientist Andreas Weigend says the time has come to recognise that privacy is now an illusion. He grew up in West Germany, where his family moved following his father's release from prison in East Germany, where he had been a political prisoner. Later, he discovered that, though his father's Stasi files had been destroyed, the secret police had opened a file on him, in 1986, when he was a graduate student in the US. Though he felt vulnerable after this revelation, his views on privacy are clear. ""I have realised that even if you were a privacy zealot, you don't have a chance. ""Data is being created as we breathe, as we live, and it is too hard a battle to try to live without creating data. ""And that is a starting point: that you assume that we do live in a post-privacy economy."" Indeed, he has just written a book called Data For the People: How to Make Our Post-Privacy Economy Work for You. Or daily lives, he says, constantly lead to the creation of new data: from phones, credit cards, public transport systems and more. ""I think we don't have the time in the day to know everything that's being created about us. ""On the other hand, we don't want companies to just scoop up all the data that we create and never tell us anything about it."" He believes we should embrace the fact we're creating lots of data, because we get better products and services in return. ""Every battle we should fight now is, 'And what can we, as individuals, as citizens, get out of the data which we create?' ""Having new technologies means that we need to think about what actually does 'privacy' mean. So, it's time to actually redefine privacy."" But Mr Weigend isn't willing to let go of all privacy. There is ""no way"", for instance, he would publish his browsing history. ""I think our browsing histories are way more personal than what we share with our partners. ""Our most secret questions in our mind, our most secret desires, they end up at Google and where Google takes us."" His message to people concerned about privacy is simple. ""Think about your computer security, think about your passwords, think about just how lax, probably, your own personal security is."" And he believes that people's views on privacy will change, just as things have already changed. ""What the KGB wouldn't have gotten out of people under torture, now people knowingly and willingly publish on Facebook."" Svea Eckert is an investigative reporter for Germany's national broadcaster, ARD. Last year she decided to adopt a fake name and set up a fake company, complete with its own website. Her target? Detailed information showing which web pages individuals had visited, offered for sale by companies who gather data about people's internet use. Journalist Svea Eckert was able to view the internet browsing histories of about 20 people, all in high-profile positions in Germany She and a colleague eventually gained access toa month's worth of de-anonymised browsing recordsof about 20 people, all in high-profile positions. The URLs pointed to details of a criminal investigation, a senior executive's complete financial records, a judge's daily porn viewing habits and the browsing histories of politicians. The subjects were shocked when shown the data held about them. It emerged that all this data had come from a browser plug-in that these users had installed. Ms Eckert says it wasn't legal for the data to be sold but there has been no action against the company selling it, because it was based outside the EU. And she is concerned at how smaller marketing companies were able to sell this sensitive data but may not have had the money available to wealthy corporations to protect themselves from hackers. ""I think at the moment we are living in a time which is like the time was when people were not wearing seatbelts in the car."" ""The beauty of what's been occurring in the past year or two,"" says Gus Hosein, head of Privacy International, a global non-governmental organisation campaigning for privacy, ""has been that some of the companies who are core now to the delivery of the internet as we know it have taken security and privacy much more seriously. The EU is set to introduce new regulations on data privacy ""What is disappointing is that below the waterline, below what we can see, some of these companies have doubled-down or tripled-down on the extent to which they are grabbing data and doing things with that data without you ever being able to see."" But he thinks there is a limit to how much individual behaviour can achieve in securing online privacy. ""Almost every positive move that Facebook and Google and the other large companies have taken, particularly the data companiesâ¦ has been as a result of regulatory pressure."" Most technology companies are based in the US where, he says, lobbyists have prevented regulations from being imposed. That lobbying influence has proven less effective in Europe, where a new law, the General Data Protection Regulation, designed to increase safeguards on the storage and handling of personal data, is due to come into effect next year. ""My worry is that we'll become desensitised and we'll become quite resigned to the fact that, 'Yeah, our data is harvested, and, yeah, I guess it is not secure, and, yeah, I guess any criminal who wanted to can get access to it.' ""The defence of privacy will be the saviour of the future, essentially."" The Inquiry: Is privacy dead? was broadcast on Thursday 5 October.Listen onlineordownload the podcast.

Ryanair boss offers pilots better pay,"Ryanair's boss has made an unprecedented apology to pilots Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has written to the airline's pilots to offer them better pay and conditions. The improved conditions came after the airline was forced to cancel thousands of flights in recent weeks. In a letter to pilots, Mr O'Leary also apologised for changes that caused disruptions to their rotas and urges them not to leave the airline. The  Irish Air Line Pilots' Association was sceptical, saying the letter gave no details of the cost of the promises. ""Our members have experienced Ryanair promises before and therefore we will need to carefully consider each point before we decide on a response,"" it added. The letter also received a lukewarm response from pilots who contacted the BBC. One, who didn't want to be named, said: ""It's the standard. It's a, How nice we are, followed by a carrot and then a threat."" Mr O'Leary's apology came after he accused the pilots of being ""full of their own self-importance"". But in the letter he urges pilots to stay with Ryanair ""for a brighter future"". Ryanair has been in crisis after the rota changes - brought about to comply with new aviation rules - led to a shortage of pilots because the airline failed to plan for enough leave. Does Ryanair have a pilot shortage? Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights? Ryanair passengers left 'furious' over cancellations Many of the airline's 4,200 pilots had joined unions over the past two weeks over discontent with the disruptions caused by the rota changes. Mr O'Leary's letter implored the pilot team not to leave the airline and offered them improved terms and working conditions. Ryanair's sweeteners included pay increases, loyalty bonus payments, improved rotas and better compensation for pilots forced to work away from their home base. Mr O'Leary stressed that Ryanair was a ""very secure employer in a very insecure industry"" and he emphasised that the airline's pilots ""are the best in the business"". And he asked them not to allow competitor pilots or their unions ""to demean or disparage our collective success"". The Ryanair boss also urged the airline's pilots not to join ""one of these less financially secure or Brexit-challenged airlines"". Mr O'Leary's letter asked the pilots to take note of ""the recent bankruptcies of Air Berlin, Alitalia and Monarch"", as well as the difficulties faced by another budget airline, Norwegian Air, which has been under pressure to boost its finances. Ryanair has cancelled thousands of flights since September Ryanair announced its first wave of 2,100 cancellations in the middle of September, after it rearranged pilots' rosters to comply with new aviation rules requiring a change in how their flying hours are logged. Towards the end of September it announced 18,000 further flights would be cancelled over the winter season. These moves affect more than 700,000 passengers. The airline blamed the flight fiasco on its own mistaken decision to force its pilots to take their remaining annual leave before the end of this year, rather than by the end of the financial year next March. That left Ryanair without enough pilots to fly all its scheduled flights in September and October. But passengers have complained about the short notice of the cancellations and the consumer groupWhich? said Ryanair's compensation information was ""woefully short"".

May faces calls for Tory leadership vote,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Look, I've had a cold this week"" Theresa May has said she has the ""full support of her cabinet"" after a former party chairman said there should be a Conservative leadership contest. The PM insisted she was providing the ""calm leadership"" the country needed. Grant Shapps says about 30 Tory MPs back his call for a leadership contest in the wake of the general election results and conference mishaps. But his claims prompted a backlash from loyal backbenchers, several of whom called on him to ""shut up"". There has been leadership speculation since Mrs May's decision to call a snap general election backfired and the Conservatives lost their majority. Laura Kuenssberg: Doubts are now out in open Tories rally round May after speech woes PM struggles through interrupted speech The Conservative conference this week was meant to be a chance to assert her authority over the party, but her big speech was plagued by a series of mishaps, as she struggled with a persistent cough, was interrupted by a prankster and some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her. Asked about leadership speculation as she attended a charity event in her constituency, Mrs May said: ""What the country needs is calm leadership and that's what I am providing with the full support of my cabinet."" This video can not be played Former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said Theresa May should face a leadership election She said her recent speech in Florence had given ""real momentum"" to Brexit negotiations and she was intending to update MPs next week on her plans to help ""ordinary working families"" with a cap on energy bills. Environment Secretary Michael Gove was among cabinet ministers and MPs publicly defending Mrs May on Friday morning, as the story broke that Mr Shapps was the senior Tory behind a bid to persuade her to go. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4 the prime minister was a ""fantastic"" leader, had widespread support, and should stay ""as long as she wants"". He said that the ""overwhelming majority of MPs and the entirety of the cabinet"" backed the prime minister. Home Secretary Amber Rudd wrote an article inthe Telegraph,externalurging the prime minister to stay, while First Secretary of State Damian Green said on the BBC's Question Time the prime minister ""was determined as ever to get on with her job - she sees it as her duty to do so"". Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, hit out at those plotting to oust Mrs May as prime minister. Speaking to the BBC's Political Thinking podcast, she said: ""I have to say, I've not got much time for them... ""I really don't think that having a bit of a cold... when you are trying to make a speech changes the fundamentals of whether Theresa May is the right person to lead the country."" There is, this morning, an operation being mounted by the government to try to show that nothing has changed in the Conservative Party in the last few days. That Theresa May's leadership remains on track and she is, to use another of her famous phrases, just, ""getting on with the job"". Except, as happened the last time she proclaimed ""nothing has changed"", something rather fundamental has, after all. For the doubts that have been building about her in the party for months are now out there in the wide open. Read more from the BBC's political editor To trigger a vote of confidence in the party leader, 48 of the 316 Conservative MPs would need to write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. A leadership contest would only be triggered if Mrs May lost that vote, or chose to quit. Mr Shapps, who was co-chair of the party between 2012 and 2015, said no letter had been sent and said his intention had been to gather signatures privately and persuade Mrs May to stand down. But he claimed party whips had taken the ""extraordinary"" step of making it public by naming him as the ringleader of a plot to oust the PM in a story in the Times. He told the BBC: ""I think it's time we actually tackle this issue of leadership and so do many colleagues. ""We wanted to present that to Theresa May privately. Now I'm afraid it's being done a bit more publicly."" He added: ""The country needs leadership. It needs leadership at this time in particular. I think the conference and the lead-up through the summer has shown that that's not going to happen.

Anti-nuclear arms group wins Nobel prize,"This video can not be played Berit Reiss-Andersen, the Nobel committee chair, announces the winner. The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican). Berit Reiss-Andersen, the Nobel committee chair, said it was due to the group's ""groundbreaking efforts to achieve a treaty prohibition"" on nuclear weapons. ""We live in a world where the risk of nuclear weapons being used is greater than it has been for a long time,"" she continued. She cited the North Korea issue. In July, after pressure from Ican, 122 nations backed a UN treaty designed to ban and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons. But none of the nine known nuclear powers in the world - including the UK and the US - endorsed it. Ms Reiss-Andersen called on nuclear-armed states to initiate negotiations to gradually eliminate the weapons. Ican, a coalition of hundreds of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), is 10 years old and is based in Geneva, Switzerland. The group will receive nine million Swedish kronor ($1.1 million, Â£846,000) along with a medal and a diploma at a ceremony in December. Ican award sends nuclear message Who are the Nobel Peace Prize winners? Irish priest nominee praises Ican Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the group, told reporters that the prize had come as a surprise but that it was ""a huge signal"" that the group's work was ""needed and appreciated"". ""The laws of war say that we can't target civilians. Nuclear weapons are meant to target civilians; they're meant to wipe out entire cities,"" she said, adding: ""That's unacceptable and nuclear weapons no longer get an excuse. ""It's a giant radioactive bomb, it just causes chaos and havoc and civilian casualties. It is not a weapon that you can use in line with the laws of war. ""Every state matters here. The more states that sign and ratify this treaty the stronger the norm is going to get. They're not moving towards disarmament fast enough."" The Nobel prize citation read: ""Some states are modernising their nuclear arsenals, and there is a real danger that more countries will try to procure nuclear weapons, as exemplified by North Korea."" North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has launched a series of rockets and a nuclear test this year, leading to an escalating war of words with US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump, who commands one of the world's most powerful nuclear arsenals, threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if his country is forced to defend itself or its allies. What did N Korea's nuclear tests achieve? North Korea-US tensions: How worried should you be? Why are Nobel laureates getting older? Winners throughout the years Last year's winner, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos,said the peace prize was ""like a gift from heaven""as his government tried to negotiate a deal with the main rebel group, the Farc. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent The Nobel Committee's decision provides a powerful and timely reinforcement of the opprobrium and concern attached to nuclear weapons. It comes at a moment when North Korea is actively developing its nuclear programme, the fate of the Iran nuclear deal is in the balance, and the US and Russia are both actively seeking to modernise their nuclear forces. There is of course already the Non-Proliferation Treaty under which most countries agreed never to develop nuclear weapons and those that already had them agreed progressively to disarm. But campaigners have long been unsatisfied with this process insisting that the nuclear ""haves"" have no intention of giving up their arsenals. So Ican set about an alternative approach - to raise popular awareness of the issue and to pressure governments to open up a new treaty for signature earlier this year that would seek an outright ban on nuclear weapons. a coalition group supported by hundreds of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in over 100 countries across the world formed in 2007, inspired by a similar campaign to ban the use of landmines worldwide supporters include actor Michael Sheen, artist Ai Weiwei and former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon its lobbying encouraged the UN to adopt theTreaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons,externalearlier this year which has been signed by 53 countries so far Eligible nominators from around the world can put forward candidates up to 1 February of the award year, while Nobel Committee members have more time All nominations are reviewed by the committee - whose five members are chosen by the Norwegian parliament - before a shortlist of 20-30 candidates are selected A group of Norwegian and international advisers write individual reports on the shortlisted candidates. Using these and further reports, the committee narrows the selection down to a handful A decision is reached in the last meeting of the committee, usually in late September or early October, before the prize is announced If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, a simple majority vote is used After the announcement, the award ceremony takes place on 10 December, the date of Alfred Nobel's death This video can not be played Where do the prizes come from and what do peace and dynamite have in common?

Catalonia media reflects polarised Spanish society,"Thousands protested in Barcelona against police action during the referendum The front page of Barcelona's La Vanguardia newspaper on 4 October was dominated by the ongoing Catalan crisis. An aerial photograph showed tens of thousands of people demonstrating in the city centre the previous day, when a region-wide strike had been staged in protest at attempts by Spanish security forces to stop people voting in Sunday's independence referendum. The article below the photograph underlined how successful the strike had been. In Madrid, meanwhile, Catalonia was also hogging the headlines but a different version of events was being presented. El PaÃ­s' front-page photograph of the strike was of two dozen youths running on to a road to stop a car, suggesting chaos rather than organised protest. ""The Catalan government takes its insurrection on to the streets on a day of disorder,"" read a headline above it. Such contrasting interpretations of what is happening in Catalonia reflect the deeply divisive nature of Spain's territorial crisis and the media has been a key factor in fuelling the polarisation. Newspaper headlines across Spain are dominated by the Catalonia crisis Newspapers, radio and television have been mobilised on both sides. Two media outlets which have particularly opposing approaches to the situation are Spanish public broadcaster TVE - which is part of Radio TelevisiÃ³n EspaÃ±ola - and Catalan public broadcaster TV3. On referendum day on 1 October, TV3 repeatedly showed footage of Spanish national police and civil guards charging into polling stations, beating voters and dragging them away before seizing ballot boxes. One elderly woman was shown bleeding from the head after a baton charge, and another woman was shown being dragged by her hair along the floor of a voting station by a masked riot policeman. Those images, and accounts by many of the hundreds people who have been hurt, were repeatedly broadcast in the days that followed. TVE, meanwhile, showed very little of the violence, or indeed the referendum itself, which the Spanish government insists was illegal. Many have also taken to the streets in support of the Spanish government and police Instead, news anchor Pedro CarreÃ±o told viewers there had been ""pushes"" and ""moments of tension"", suggesting that responsibility for any violence had been shared. The coverage by the national broadcaster drew outrage from some of its staff in Catalonia. They issued a statement to denounce the editorial line of their employer, whose senior appointments are heavily influenced by the Spanish government. ""The portrayal of a skewed version of reality has given a ridiculous and grotesque image [of the broadcaster],"" they wrote, ""instead of guaranteeing the fundamental right of honest and plural information, which is the obligation of TVE."" Staff complained that the channel had censored journalists in the Catalan coverage to manipulate the final news content. Carles Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain Divided loyalties: The couples at odds over independence Analysis: Biggest crisis for a generation Could Catalonia make a success of independence? ""All the private TV channels were showing what was happening that day from early in the morning,"" says Rafael GonzÃ¡lez a Madrid-based freelance TV journalist. ""But TVE barely covered it."" Yet the criticism cuts both ways. Catalan station TV3 is funded by the nationalist regional government, a fact that many believe sways its content. That might mean the TV weather map sometimes includes the Catalan-speaking territories of the Balearic Islands and Valencia, both historically claimed by nationalists. Or in the case of news coverage, it means delivering information that supports the drive for independence. In recent days, TV3 has been accused of indoctrination after airing a children's programme explaining the referendum as if it were an adventure film. ""For days, they were one of the most prized treasures in the world,"" says the narrator, of the ballot boxes that were smuggled into many polling stations. ""So on Sunday morning, when everything was ready and polling stations were opened, lots of people celebrated and even cried,"" the programme continued. King Felipe, in a rare televised address, admonished Catalan leaders Bernardo DÃ­az Nosty, who teaches journalism at MÃ¡laga University, says both TVE and TV3 fall short of basic public broadcasting duties, but in different ways. ""TV3 feeds a certain ideological position,"" he says. ""But TVE tries to play down big issues and focus on more trivial stories. That's another way of intervening - denying the importance of issues that are of public interest."" Televised speeches made by King Felipe on Tuesday and then Catalan President Carles Puigdemont 24 hours later echoed the editorial divide that has opened up. The king admonished the Catalan government, apparently siding with Madrid, while Mr Puigdemont rebuked the monarch but suggested he was willing to engage in talks. The next day, pro-independence newspaper Ara carried the headline: ""Puigdemont criticises the king and seeks external mediation""; while the conservative Madrid-based daily El Mundo ran: ""The cynicism of Puigdemont: invoking the constitution to attack the king."" Oriol Bartomeus, a political scientist at Barcelona's AutÃ²noma University, believes the editorial battle over Catalonia is particularly fierce, however he sees a broader trend. ""One of the big problems that we have here, in the UK, in the United States and all over Europe is that people increasingly receive information only from media that reinforce their existing ideas,"" he says. Pro-independence Catalans might watch TVE, he says, but only to confirm their opinions about how skewed it is; and a Spanish nationalist might watch TV3 for the same reason. ""The problem is in the middle, people who are on neither one side nor the other,"" Mr Bartomeus says. ""They are being left without any media.""

How EastEnders taught me English,"This video can not be played Farid says he watched EastEnders with his foster family You might expect anyone who learns their English from watching BBC One's EastEnders to pepper every other sentence with shouts of ""Get outta my pub!"", ""You ain't my mother!"" and the collected musings on life of that great sage, Mick Carter, as played by Danny Dyer. But picking up English from the soap was about more than a string of one-liners for Farid Saleh when he arrived in the UK from Afghanistan as a child refugee. It was a route to a new life. Farid's father had been killed in political violence and, as the oldest son, the 13-year-old was in danger. His family paid for him to get to the UK, where the scared and bewildered teenager was placed with a foster family. ""When I met my foster family it was challenging, I didn't know what they were saying,"" he says. ""There would be days I would come home from school and say, 'I can't do this.'"" So every night his foster mother would sit with him and they'd watch EastEnders together with the subtitles on. They would note new words and Farid would try to use them in sentences. Slowly and steadily he stopped being a teenager lost in a foreign world and grew into a young man with a future. You don't need to take my word for it. Farid speaks for himself in our film, although I should perhaps apologise for twisting his arm into saying the legendary ""Get outta my pub!"" line. ""EastEnders helped me to know what people were talking about at school,"" he says. ""I was able to be part of that conversation."" Farid has done well for himself (more on that later) because he was well supported. But professionals say watching soaps is no substitute for proper tuition that can accelerate integration. The problem is, somebody has to pay for it. Very few refugees have the means to do so until they get into work... and to get into work, they need to speak English. So the government funds English tuition. But the charity Refugee Action says new research has uncovered what it says is a crisis in English classes that is preventing people from integrating. The charity says tens of thousands of refugees in the UK are in a linguistic limbo as they wait to get on to courses, known as Esol, because of chronic underfunding. The delays faced by women are even longer because they struggle to get childcare. If people can't speak the language, they end up poorer and more isolated, experts suggest The system is ""simply not fit for purpose"", says Mariam Kemple Hardy of Refugee Action, adding that refugees are waiting up to three years to get classes. ""When you can't speak English, life can be extremely isolating. They can't make friends with their neighbours. It is incredibly hard to get a job, to become a real part of their community,"" she said. ""So learning English is a big part of rebuilding their lives in the UK. The government has to improve English language provision by increasing investment."" Funding for Esol comes from the Department for Education and stood at just over Â£200m eight years ago - since then it has fallen by half. Natecla, which is the national association for teachers in the field, says that in 2008-09 there were 207,400 adults on courses. That had fallen to 131,000 by 2014/15 - all during a period of high immigration -and it wants a new national strategy,externalfor England, like this in place in Wales and Scotland. Special funding for refugees from Syria Free classes for those who get jobseeker's allowance Others have to pay at least half of costs Asylum seekers (those seeking to be recognised as a refugee) must wait six months Foreign-born spouses treated as international students and must typically pay higher fees A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We are committed to supporting all adults in England secure the English language skills they need for life and work. Adults who are granted refugee status are eligible for the same skills funding as any other English resident."" But the calls for better funding are not new - and not confined to lobby groups. They have also come from one of the government's top advisers. TheCasey Review into Opportunity and Integration,external, commissioned by former Prime Minister David Cameron, concluded last year that if people can't speak the language, they end up poorer, isolated and living in segregated communities. It noted that over the course of two recent years more had been spent on Cornish than on English by the department responsible for integration. Ministers have promised to publish an integration strategy in the coming months. There are many charities and volunteers who are trying to plug the gap in helping new refugees to integrate. Farid is one of them. He is studying at university to become a social worker and also helping today's child refugees who feel as lost as he once did. So what does he tell them? ""My advice would be to watch EastEnders - and a lot of TV,"" he smiles. ""It will help you - put the subtitles on and watch them.""

The problem is, somebody has to pay for it. Very few refugees have the means to do so until they get into work... and to get into work, they need to speak English. So the government funds English tuition. But the charity Refugee Action says new research has uncovered what it says is a crisis in English classes that is preventing people from integrating. The charity says tens of thousands of refugees in the UK are in a linguistic limbo as they wait to get on to courses, known as Esol, because of chronic underfunding. The delays faced by women are even longer because they struggle to get childcare. If people can't speak the language, they end up poorer and more isolated, experts suggest The system is ""simply not fit for purpose"", says Mariam Kemple Hardy of Refugee Action, adding that refugees are waiting up to three years to get classes. ""When you can't speak English, life can be extremely isolating. They can't make friends with their neighbours. It is incredibly hard to get a job, to become a real part of their community,"" she said. ""So learning English is a big part of rebuilding their lives in the UK. The government has to improve English language provision by increasing investment."" Funding for Esol comes from the Department for Education and stood at just over Â£200m eight years ago - since then it has fallen by half. Natecla, which is the national association for teachers in the field, says that in 2008-09 there were 207,400 adults on courses. That had fallen to 131,000 by 2014/15 - all during a period of high immigration -and it wants a new national strategy,externalfor England, like this in place in Wales and Scotland. Special funding for refugees from Syria Free classes for those who get jobseeker's allowance Others have to pay at least half of costs Asylum seekers (those seeking to be recognised as a refugee) must wait six months Foreign-born spouses treated as international students and must typically pay higher fees A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We are committed to supporting all adults in England secure the English language skills they need for life and work. Adults who are granted refugee status are eligible for the same skills funding as any other English resident."" But the calls for better funding are not new - and not confined to lobby groups. They have also come from one of the government's top advisers. TheCasey Review into Opportunity and Integration,external, commissioned by former Prime Minister David Cameron, concluded last year that if people can't speak the language, they end up poorer, isolated and living in segregated communities. It noted that over the course of two recent years more had been spent on Cornish than on English by the department responsible for integration. Ministers have promised to publish an integration strategy in the coming months. There are many charities and volunteers who are trying to plug the gap in helping new refugees to integrate. Farid is one of them. He is studying at university to become a social worker and also helping today's child refugees who feel as lost as he once did. So what does he tell them? ""My advice would be to watch EastEnders - and a lot of TV,"" he smiles. ""It will help you - put the subtitles on and watch them.""

Storm Nate kills 22 in Central America,"Heavy rain has swollen rivers and affected towns across Costa Rica Tropical Storm Nate has killed at least 22 people in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras. It caused heavy rains, landslides and floods which blocked roads, destroyed bridges and damaged houses. In Costa Rica, nearly 400,000 people are without running water and thousands are sleeping in shelters. The eye of the storm has since moved over the sea, heading towards Mexico and the United States, where it could become a hurricane. At least eight people died in Costa Rica, while another 11 were killed when Nate moved north and reached Nicaragua, where as much as 15ins (38cm) of rain had been predicted to fall by the US National Hurricane Center. Three people were killed in Honduras, including two youths who drowned in a river, and several are reported missing. One man was killed in a mudslide in El Salvador, according to emergency services. Oil companies have been evacuating staff from platforms in the Gulf of Mexico that lie along the predicted path of the storm. In Costa Rica, people were trapped on a stretch of the Inter-American Highway known as the Mountain of Death, after the bus in which they were travelling got stuck between two landslides on Wednesday, according to La NaciÃ³n newspaper. There are also concerns crocodiles may be lurking around the overflowing TÃ¡rcoles river, and could appear in places where they are not normally expected. ""Please do not kill crocodiles,"" said officials, according to news site CRHoy.com. The advice was to avoid standing in overflowing water, to protect children and pets, and to call emergency services if one was spotted. Some 5,000 people are sleeping in temporary shelters in Costa Rica All train journeys were suspended in Costa Rica and dozens of flights cancelled on Thursday, when the weather worsened. More than a dozen national parks popular with tourists have been closed as a precaution. The storm also caused extensive damage to infrastructure in Nicaragua. ""Sometimes we think we think we can cross a river and the hardest thing to understand is that we must wait,"" Vice-President Rosario Murillo said on state radio. ""It's better to be late than not to get there at all."" Forecasters say the storm could become a category one hurricane before it makes landfall on the southern coast of the United States on Sunday. How to stay safe in a hurricane Do 'Pray for...' messages make disaster relief harder? Residents from Florida to Texas have been told to prepare for Nate, which, if it does strike, would be the third major storm to hit the southern coast this year. Most of the damage in Nicaragua has been along its Caribbean coast Texas and Florida are recovering from the damage inflicted by Hurricane Harvey, which hit the former in August andcaused ""unprecedented damage"", and Hurricane Irma, whichmade landfall in Floridain September. A state of emergency has been declared in 29 Florida counties, and in New Orleans. The city's mayor told people who live on low-lying ground to evacuate.

Trump 'might abandon Iran nuclear deal',"This video can not be played Donald Trump makes cryptic comments about ""calm before the storm"" US President Donald Trump is planning to abandon the Iran nuclear deal shortly, according to US media reports. If he fails to certify the accord, Congress will decide whether to re-impose economic sanctions on Iran. Mr Trump has until 15 October to decide. Opposition to the deal was a major part of his campaign last year. Posing for photographers with military leaders on Thursday, he said this was ""the calm before the storm"" but refused to give further details. There was speculation his comments might refer to heightened tensions with North Korea, but the New York Times says ""people who have been briefed on the matter"" believe he means Iran. Mr Trump was seen at the White House with his wife Melania, as well as military leaders, after Thursday's meetings but before dinner together. Gesturing at the people around him, he asked the waiting press if they knew ""what this represents"". ""Maybe it's the calm before the storm,"" he said. When reporters pressed him on what storm he was referring to, he would only say: ""You'll find out."" He had earlier told his top defence officials he expected them to provide ""a broad range of military options... at a much faster pace"" in future. US media say the president will announce next Thursday that he will not be certifying the deal on the grounds it does not serve US security interests. But some of his top advisers, such as Defence Secretary James Mattis,appear to back the deal. The presidency must certify the deal every 90 days; Mr Trump has already done so twice. If he rejected it this time, Congress would have 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Iran. US media reports suggest they are likely to leave the deal in place. What will happen to the Iran nuclear deal? Key details of the Iran nuclear deal Trump extends 'worst' Iran nuclear deal Speaking in the White House's Cabinet Room, President Trump said: ""The Iranian regime supports terrorism and exports violence and chaos across the Middle East. ""That is why we must put an end to Iran's continued aggression and nuclear ambitions. You will be hearing about Iran very shortly."" In reaction, Iranian nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi said the deal was not renegotiable, reported Iran's Press TV. But he suggested it might be salvageable if the other partners - France, Germany, China, Russia and the UK - remained on board. If not, he said, the deal will ""definitely fall apart"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he hoped ""the final decision reached by the US president will be balanced and will be based on the present-day realities"", reported Interfax news agency. Analysis by the BBC'sAnthony Zurcher Once again the president appears poised to hand a tough issue over to Congress to deal with. In July Mr Trump ended an Obama-era programme offering normalised immigration status to undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children - and gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative solution. They're still working on that one, sort of, and now Congress has another tricky situation to resolve while the clock is ticking. There's plenty of sentiment among Republicans to impose stringent new sanctions on the Iranian regime. The risks, however, of tearing up a multinational deal that international relations experts say has helped keep Iranian nuclear ambitions in check is great. Under the terms of the deal, Iran must let investigators access any site they deem suspicious As with healthcare, another issue the White House has given Congress little guidance on, legislators will have to decide between their at-times overheated campaign promises and more practical concerns. Given that inertia is on the side of inaction, the Iranian nuclear deal - though weakened by the president's sabre-rattling - may hold together. One thing is certain, however. The president's decision would inject new levels of acrimony into US-Iranian relations and again put a blazing spotlight on congressional politicians who are already anxiously eying their re-election campaigns in 2018. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was designedto prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon, with the president's administration having to certify to Congress that Iran is upholding its part of the deal every 90 days. It lifted some sanctions that stopped Iran from trading on international markets and selling oil. The lifting of sanctions is dependent on Iran restricting its nuclear programme. It must restrict its uranium stockpile, build no more heavy-water reactors for 15 years, and allow inspectors in to the country. Mr Trump has repeatedly said Iran has broken the ""spirit"" of the deal. In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Mr Trump called the deal, which was brokered while his predecessor Barack Obama was in power, ""an embarrassment to the United States"".

When pro-Russian trolls came after me,"When Jessikka Aro started investigating pro-Kremlin Twitter accounts, she was targeted by trolls both online and in real life An investigative journalist's reporting turned her into the target of trolls in a harassment campaign that has continued for years. What kind of toll has it taken on her life? Jessikka Aro works for the Finnish national broadcaster YLE. In 2014, she was investigating the existence of pro-Russian troll factories. She was uncovering evidence of a state-sanctioned propaganda machine pushing a pro-Kremlin line through Twitter bots - automated accounts - and bot networks. The Russian government has repeatedly denied using bot networks or online tools to interfere with Western countries. Soon after Aro started looking into the story, she became the target of a systematic campaign of abuse which has continued to the present day. She's been doxxed - her personal information including her address, contact details and whereabouts has appeared online - and trolls have spread fake stories about her. The harassment has led to police investigations and court cases - some of which she can't comment on - but she spoke about her experiences withBBC Trending radio. What first got you interested in online misinformation and bots? In 2014, I realised there was a new phenomenon of Russian information warfare. This was anonymous or fake profiles spreading propaganda on social networks - Facebook, Vkontakte, Twitter. I wanted to find out what kind of influence and impact they actually have in Finland, on freedom of speech and public debate. I asked Finnish people to tell me about their experiences. [Soon after], propagandists started to spread fake information about me in Russian information spaces. I was framed as some kind of foreign agent or foreign spy. My contact information was put online along with that disinformation. This is the worst problem: some people actually believe it and they contacted me, and called me, and sent nasty text messages and threatening phone calls. So that's where it started. This was September 2014 and it's still going on. And it has gotten so twisted and disturbing. What else did the trolls do? One really horrible racist neo-Nazi promoting fake news site started publishing tens or hundreds of pieces on me, in which they frame me as a person who has brain damage or a person who is spreading conspiracy theories. They have also published my private health information. Some troll activists went through old court files and they found that when I was really young, 20 years old, I received a 300 euro fine for drug use because I had a serious drug problem. They made that into really horrible, propagandist stories trying to frame me some kind of ""NATO drug dealer"". Also, they stalk me by releasing information about where I'm going to give presentations, where I'm going to give training courses. They are just really trying to character assassinate me. At some point there was a music video campaign against me. Troll accounts were sharing a studio-quality song about me, alleging I'm a ""stupid blonde"" who was only imagining this whole troll phenomenon and I'm some sort of American or NATO spy. They hired an actress to play me in some of these videos, and they shared these videos on Twitter and Facebook. The surprising new strategy of pro-Russia bots My conversations with Guccifer 2.0 Macron Leaks: the anatomy of a hack Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Did this make you think again about carrying on doing stories about alleged Russian disinformation? Well in the beginning when I noticed that there is so much misinformation being spread about me, I realised that this is actually a much more important topic than I originally thought. They wouldn't have attacked me so heavily if this was some sort of small issue, so in a way, with all this brutality and all this campaigning they have only exposed that this whole troll phenomenon is real and it's really serious. Many people who have been investigating these stories have seen a new tactic,where bots follow you en masse on Twitter. I've had that too. Many of those bots are super hot girls and they look really interesting, but when you look at them closer, you can see that often these are parts of troll and bot networks. It's really disturbing with the bots, how quickly they operate, how quickly you might get for example, a thousand or two thousand new followers. Allow Twitter content?

Download the BBC Trending podcast What cost have you paid for following this story? Some days are much more difficult than others. But because I have so many good friends and so many experts who are also looking into this topic and who are helping me to investigate - and also because Finnish people are very supportive of me - I get by really well. I cannot thank enough the Finnish police, who have been the key in helping me. Some of these [pro-Russian] activists are suspected of serious crimes and also the Finnish police have now set up an anti-hate speech unit.

Reality Check: Do women make companies richer?,"""Having women on company boards leads to better financial performance"" came the headlines from report after report, highlighting a business statistic guaranteed to capture the imagination and prompt debate. What better way to encourage companies to focus on equality and diversity than to make them think of their bottom line? In the UK, the 30% Club was set up in 2010 with the aim of having women make up at least 30% of the members on every board. In the US, the Thirty Percent Coalition - a group of people who are chief executives and chairs of their companies - was created to achieve the same thing. BBC 100 Women 2017 BBC 100 Women 2017: Who is on the list? Can women change the world in a week? Of course, there are many other - and some say better - reasons to argue for gender equality, but we wanted to look at whether this broadly accepted claim is true - does having more women on the board really mean the company makes more money? Academics have warned against jumping to simple conclusions. A report published byCredit Suisse,externallast year said companies with at least one woman director received a better return on their investments compared with companies with all-male boardrooms. They say companies where women made up at least 15% of senior management were 50% more profitable than those where fewer than 10% of senior managers were female. But Prof Alice Eagly, at Northwestern University in the US, says many of the studies commissioned by corporations are ""naive"" as they don't consider other variables. Some European countries have introduced quotas for female board members She explains that more sophisticated pieces of analysis carried out by academics have shown very small positive correlations between female board members and financial success. But this is an average - in some companies the relationship was neutral and in some it was negative. And proving causation is far harder. It is difficult to say that it is having more women on boards that makes companies do better, rather than other factors -  something corporate reports acknowledge. This is because companies with more women on boards are different in other ways, too, according to Prof Eagly. For example, firm size seems to be one of the most significant factors in determining profitability. And larger companies are likely to employ more women at every level. More innovative companies were more likely to use their talent effectively, regardless of gender. And companies that were already more profitable may have been more able to focus efforts on diversity, she says. A study looking at thegender make-up of the top management of the US's biggest firms,,externalnot only their board members, found female representation in top management improves firm performance but only in companies that are ""focused on innovation"". And, interestingly, female board members appear to have more of a positive impact on their company's performance in countries where women have more equal rights and treatment overall. It looks like there is a relationship between more successful companies and those with more women in senior positions in general, but it's not enough to simply ""add women and stir"", as Prof Robin Ely at Harvard Business School puts it. Another study from a group of German, Dutch and Belgian researchers found ""the mere representation of females on corporate boards is not related to firm financial performance if other factors are not considered"". It relies on there being a good company culture too. If women are in the minority in a room that is hostile to them, they are unlikely to be able to have a positive effect and that applies to other kinds of diversity too, the study suggests. Focusing on numbers without also addressing structural diversity issues is not enough, according to Prof Ely. In the biggest US companies on the stock market, around 16% of board seats are held by women Looking at how many spaces on a board are filled by women doesn't tell you how influential the board is, and it doesn't tell us whether those women are being listened to and allowed to have an impact, Prof Ely points out, as ""not all spots on a board are created equal"". There is some evidence that having three women on a board of 12 to 15 people is the tipping point for them to actually be heard and able to have an influence at all. So there are good arguments for the 30% rule -  it just doesn't necessarily translate directly to profits. In fact Corinne Post, a professor of organisation management at Lehigh University, says that board members don't have a direct influence on the bottom line of a company, but they do have a greater influence on corporate social responsibility. She found that there was a five times stronger correlation between a company having female board members and stronger performance when it comes to ensuring they are environmentally friendly as a company, or involve themselves in philanthropy for example, than the correlation between female board members and profits. Profitability is highly complex and there's even evidence that chief executives might not have much of an influence on company profits. ""In companies with any women on their board at all, they tend to have between one and three - are you really saying the gender of three people on a board is going to have an impact on the bottom line?"" Prof Ely asks. For Northwestern's Prof Eagly, the most pertinent question is why we would need evidence women bring in more money than men, before they are given equal status on boards. ""Why should you rule out 50% of the population from important jobs. It's about social justice not about profits.""

Ivory trade to be banned in UK,"Tiny elephants carved from ivory are the type of product that would be banned under the proposals The sale and export of almost all ivory items would be banned in the UK under plans set out by the government. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has announced a consultation to end the trade in ivory of all ages - previous attempts at a ban would have excluded antique ivory produced before 1947. The government says there will be some exemptions, for musical instruments and items of cultural importance. Conservation groups have given a guarded welcome to the plan. While the UK has had a ban on the trade in raw ivory tusks, it has become the world's leading exporter of legal ivory carvings and antiques in recent years. According to anEnvironmental Investigation Agency report,external, there were more than 36,000 items exported from the UK between 2010 and 2015, more than three times that of the next biggest exporter, the US. Conservationists argue that these sales stimulate the demand for the product, and are linked to increased elephant poaching across Africa. Prince William condemned illegal wildlife trading during a trip to China in 2015 Prince William has long been a campaigner against against ivory trade and in 2016urged the UK to pass a total banon domestic sales. At a wildlife conference in Vietnam, he said: ""Ivory is not something to be desired and when removed from an elephant it is not beautiful. ""So, the question is: why are we still trading it? We need governments to send a clear signal that trading in ivory is abhorrent."" Prince William plea on ivory trade Animals poached in 'horrifying numbers' Can China's ban save elephants? Previous attempts in the UK by the Conservative Party to limit sales of ivory have failed to get off the ground. A ban on sales of ivory produced after 1947 was announced by then Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom in 2016 but a follow-up consultation never materialised. However, a 12-week consultation on Mr Gove's proposals is due to start immediately, and draft legislation covering a ban on sales and exports is likely in the new year. Campaigners have been pushing hard for government action on UK ivory sales The government says that the proposals are being driven by concern for the 20,000 elephants that are killed by poachers every year. ""The decline in the elephant population fuelled by poaching for ivory shames our generation,"" said Mr Gove in a statement. ""The need for radical and robust action to protect one of the world's most iconic and treasured species is beyond dispute."" He said the proposals will put the ""UK front and centre of global efforts to end the insidious trade in ivory"". While the government says the plans are driven by concerns over elephants, there are other factors at play. Many countries have moved to end the trade in ivory by destroying stocks such as in Kenya Britain will host a major illegal wildlife conference in 2018 and it would be embarrassing if the UK was continuing to allow a domestic market in ivory while countries like China were moving to close theirs as they have promised to do by the end of this year. ""The key thing is, we hope, they will have committed to the ban before this conference,"" said Heather Sohl from WWF UK. She said it would allow the UK to have a greater standing in how China enforces its own ban and also strengthen its hand in dealing with countries with legal markets. While environmental groups have welcomed the government's new stand, there are concerns over the size and scale of exemptions to the ban. Mr Gove says there should be four categories of ivory items allowed for sale: Musical instruments Items with only a small proportion of ivory Items of significant historic, artistic or cultural value Sales between museums Some conservationists are worried that if these exemptions are too broad, they could become loopholes and undermine attempts at a ban. Others, though, believe that clear and strong restrictions can be put in place. But those involved in the antiques business are not happy about the proposed ban. Noelle McElhatton from the Antiques Trade Gazette said those involved in the trade abhor poaching and are disgusted by what is happening to the African elephant. However, she said she expected art and antique sellers to argue that a ban on trade in objects made pre-1947 - which she said could include Georgian chests of drawers, Victorian pianos or Art Deco figures - ""will not save a single living elephant"". ""We feel strongly that an outright ban would be an over-reaction and would be very detrimental to the honest and legitimate trade of pre-1947 ivory."" The consultation will run until 29 December.

News Daily: May's future and Ryanair's offer,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: Former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has told BBC 5 live  he is involved in organising up to 30 MPs who want the prime minister to call a leadership election. He called Theresa May a ""perfectly decent person"", but added that she had ""rolled the dice"" by requesting a snap general election which ended up with the party losing its Commons majority. Of the MPs Mr Shapps said were ""perfectly within their rights"" to urge her to go, five were former cabinet ministers, he claimed. But, following a Conservative conference in which her speech - designed to persuade colleagues to put national duty above party rows - went badly, cabinet colleagues continue to come to Mrs May's defence. First Secretary of State Damian Green, a long-time friend and ally, told BBC One's Question Time it was ""complete nonsense"" to suggest she should go because of her performance at the lectern in Manchester. It was not her fault that a cough had made her lose her voice at points or that an ""unfunny pillock"" of a comedian had interrupted her by handing her a mock P45 form, he added. It's been a highly embarrassing few weeks for budget airline Ryanair, with thousands of flights cancelled because of changes to pilots' rosters. But chief executive Michael O'Leary has moved to improve the situation by writing to these employees - whom he has previously accused of being ""full of their own self-importance"". In a letter seen by the Irish Independent, he promises pilots a ""brighter future"" if they stick with the company. He also offers them sweeteners including pay increases, loyalty bonus payments, improved rotas and better compensation for having to work away from their home bases.

Trump: This is the calm before the storm,"This video can not be played Donald Trump makes cryptic comments about ""calm before the storm"" US President Donald Trump is planning to abandon the Iran nuclear deal shortly, according to US media reports. If he fails to certify the accord, Congress will decide whether to re-impose economic sanctions on Iran. Mr Trump has until 15 October to decide. Opposition to the deal was a major part of his campaign last year. Posing for photographers with military leaders on Thursday, he said this was ""the calm before the storm"" but refused to give further details. There was speculation his comments might refer to heightened tensions with North Korea, but the New York Times says ""people who have been briefed on the matter"" believe he means Iran. Mr Trump was seen at the White House with his wife Melania, as well as military leaders, after Thursday's meetings but before dinner together. Gesturing at the people around him, he asked the waiting press if they knew ""what this represents"". ""Maybe it's the calm before the storm,"" he said. When reporters pressed him on what storm he was referring to, he would only say: ""You'll find out."" He had earlier told his top defence officials he expected them to provide ""a broad range of military options... at a much faster pace"" in future. US media say the president will announce next Thursday that he will not be certifying the deal on the grounds it does not serve US security interests. But some of his top advisers, such as Defence Secretary James Mattis,appear to back the deal. The presidency must certify the deal every 90 days; Mr Trump has already done so twice. If he rejected it this time, Congress would have 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Iran. US media reports suggest they are likely to leave the deal in place. What will happen to the Iran nuclear deal? Key details of the Iran nuclear deal Trump extends 'worst' Iran nuclear deal Speaking in the White House's Cabinet Room, President Trump said: ""The Iranian regime supports terrorism and exports violence and chaos across the Middle East. ""That is why we must put an end to Iran's continued aggression and nuclear ambitions. You will be hearing about Iran very shortly."" In reaction, Iranian nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi said the deal was not renegotiable, reported Iran's Press TV. But he suggested it might be salvageable if the other partners - France, Germany, China, Russia and the UK - remained on board. If not, he said, the deal will ""definitely fall apart"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he hoped ""the final decision reached by the US president will be balanced and will be based on the present-day realities"", reported Interfax news agency. Analysis by the BBC'sAnthony Zurcher Once again the president appears poised to hand a tough issue over to Congress to deal with. In July Mr Trump ended an Obama-era programme offering normalised immigration status to undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children - and gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative solution. They're still working on that one, sort of, and now Congress has another tricky situation to resolve while the clock is ticking. There's plenty of sentiment among Republicans to impose stringent new sanctions on the Iranian regime. The risks, however, of tearing up a multinational deal that international relations experts say has helped keep Iranian nuclear ambitions in check is great. Under the terms of the deal, Iran must let investigators access any site they deem suspicious As with healthcare, another issue the White House has given Congress little guidance on, legislators will have to decide between their at-times overheated campaign promises and more practical concerns. Given that inertia is on the side of inaction, the Iranian nuclear deal - though weakened by the president's sabre-rattling - may hold together. One thing is certain, however. The president's decision would inject new levels of acrimony into US-Iranian relations and again put a blazing spotlight on congressional politicians who are already anxiously eying their re-election campaigns in 2018. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was designedto prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon, with the president's administration having to certify to Congress that Iran is upholding its part of the deal every 90 days. It lifted some sanctions that stopped Iran from trading on international markets and selling oil. The lifting of sanctions is dependent on Iran restricting its nuclear programme. It must restrict its uranium stockpile, build no more heavy-water reactors for 15 years, and allow inspectors in to the country. Mr Trump has repeatedly said Iran has broken the ""spirit"" of the deal. In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Mr Trump called the deal, which was brokered while his predecessor Barack Obama was in power, ""an embarrassment to the United States"".

Storm Nate kills 20 in Central America,"Heavy rain has swollen rivers and affected towns across Costa Rica Tropical Storm Nate has killed at least 22 people in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras. It caused heavy rains, landslides and floods which blocked roads, destroyed bridges and damaged houses. In Costa Rica, nearly 400,000 people are without running water and thousands are sleeping in shelters. The eye of the storm has since moved over the sea, heading towards Mexico and the United States, where it could become a hurricane. At least eight people died in Costa Rica, while another 11 were killed when Nate moved north and reached Nicaragua, where as much as 15ins (38cm) of rain had been predicted to fall by the US National Hurricane Center. Three people were killed in Honduras, including two youths who drowned in a river, and several are reported missing. One man was killed in a mudslide in El Salvador, according to emergency services. Oil companies have been evacuating staff from platforms in the Gulf of Mexico that lie along the predicted path of the storm. In Costa Rica, people were trapped on a stretch of the Inter-American Highway known as the Mountain of Death, after the bus in which they were travelling got stuck between two landslides on Wednesday, according to La NaciÃ³n newspaper. There are also concerns crocodiles may be lurking around the overflowing TÃ¡rcoles river, and could appear in places where they are not normally expected. ""Please do not kill crocodiles,"" said officials, according to news site CRHoy.com. The advice was to avoid standing in overflowing water, to protect children and pets, and to call emergency services if one was spotted. Some 5,000 people are sleeping in temporary shelters in Costa Rica All train journeys were suspended in Costa Rica and dozens of flights cancelled on Thursday, when the weather worsened. More than a dozen national parks popular with tourists have been closed as a precaution. The storm also caused extensive damage to infrastructure in Nicaragua. ""Sometimes we think we think we can cross a river and the hardest thing to understand is that we must wait,"" Vice-President Rosario Murillo said on state radio. ""It's better to be late than not to get there at all."" Forecasters say the storm could become a category one hurricane before it makes landfall on the southern coast of the United States on Sunday. How to stay safe in a hurricane Do 'Pray for...' messages make disaster relief harder? Residents from Florida to Texas have been told to prepare for Nate, which, if it does strike, would be the third major storm to hit the southern coast this year. Most of the damage in Nicaragua has been along its Caribbean coast Texas and Florida are recovering from the damage inflicted by Hurricane Harvey, which hit the former in August andcaused ""unprecedented damage"", and Hurricane Irma, whichmade landfall in Floridain September. A state of emergency has been declared in 29 Florida counties, and in New Orleans. The city's mayor told people who live on low-lying ground to evacuate.
