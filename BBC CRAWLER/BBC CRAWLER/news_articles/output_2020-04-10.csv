Just 7% of GP appointments still face to face,"GPs are seeing just seven in every 100 patients face-to-face because of the coronavirus outbreak, following a ""remarkable"" shift to online and telephone appointments across England. Fewer than 1% of appointments were done via video link last year, with 80% in person, BBC analysis shows. But the Royal College of GPs (RCGP) said that had been turned on its head because of social distancing. Its chair said most people were ""pretty happy"" with phone appointments. Age UK has, however, urged doctors not to drop home visits and to seek out vulnerable patients ""proactively"". Professor Martin Marshall, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said practices were adapting Professor Martin Marshall, chairman of RCGP and whose own GP surgery is in Newham, east London, said around 40% of patients would normally be triaged before booking an appointment. Now all patients are initially assessed on the phone before booking either a call or video link with a doctor. He said: ""The GP profession has changed dramatically in just three weeks. ""Now 100% are triaged and around 7% or 8% are face-to-face. ""Most of the consultations are taking place on the telephone rather than video link. ""People are pretty happy with doing assessments over the phone and they are proving effective. ""Who would have thought this 150-year-old technology would still be just as useful today?"" He said there were occasions where a video appointment was beneficial, particularly in the case of assessing skin rashes. But with people able to email in pictures of the affected area, he said phone calls have been used in around 90% of cases. Last year, two thirds of all regional NHS commissioning areas carried out no video call appointments, NHS data shows. ""The big question is which elements do we want to embed in our practices in the future?"" Prof Marshall said. ""I don't see us doing all of our consultations over the phone or online, but certainly up to 50% is possible."" There are still occasions where patients need to attend a practice in person, such as where blood pressures or oxygen saturation needs to be read, he said. Regional NHS areas are establishing ""hot and cold"" practices to mitigate the risk of infection. Hot practices assess people with clear Covid-19 symptoms only. In more rural areas, this can take the form of a single room in a surgery. In bigger areas it can be several surgeries. Though Prof Marshall said just as many precautions were being taken at cold sites. Age UK's Tom Gentry has urged practices to be proactive in calling vulnerable patients. Concerns have been raised that people who may not have access to smartphones or a computer will be excluded from seeing their GP during the crisis. Elderly needs charity Age UK has urged practices to be ""proactive"" in contacting people on their registers known to have underlying health conditions. Senior health influencing manager at the charity Tom Gentry said: ""Surgeries have a lot of information at their disposal. Using that, they need to make active care plans for people to enable them to feel supported. ""It's about not waiting for people to deteriorate and it's about reaching out to them first."" Mr Gentry said that surgeries should also not discount the use of home visits, providing adequate precautions are taken. ""No one should be told outright that they should not be visited in their own home,"" he said. Sue Sharp received a video call from her doctor last week without her booking an appointment. Many GP practices have already adopted the proactive approach. Taxi firm administration assistant Sue Sharpe from Calne, Wiltshire, received a video call from her GP last week as she has rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome and multiple myeloma. ""She noted that I have been unwell recently and asked whether or not I was expecting further intervention from my specialist consultant,"" said Mrs Sharp. ""When I said that I was due a trip to the hospital as a day patient she asked whether I had transport for the journey, or did I require any help getting there. Joanna and Clive Williams received a call from their GP last week. ""I think it's brilliant that GP's are contacting at-risk patients in this way."" Fishing tackle supplier Clive Williams, from Horsham in West Sussex, is caring for his wife Joanna, 63, at home as she has a brain tumour. He was worried about going to a  surgery because of the risk of infection - and because he did not want to add extra burden to his stretched local practice. ""I felt it would be a nuisance to get in touch with them,"" the 64-year-old said. ""But my GP is absolutely brilliant. He contacted me out of the blue to have a little chat about my wife as she struggles with her memory.""

Public reassured over lockdown policing rules,"Police have been patrolling near supermarkets to ensure social distancing rules are followed Downing Street says people can buy whatever they want from shops that remain open amid concerns some police are overstepping lockdown powers. There have been cases of police warning shoppers against buying ""non-essential"" items. No 10 also said people can use their gardens as they wish, after a video showed police confronting a family for letting their children play outside. Meanwhile, the PM has been up and walking as his recovery continues. Downing Street said Boris Johnson, who was discharged from intensive care to a hospital ward on Thursday night, ""has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery"". The spokesman said Mr Johnson had spoken to his doctors and thanked ""the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received"". The number of people who have died in UK hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus has now reached 8,958, a record increase of 980 on Thursday. LIVE UPDATES: Christians face Good Friday on virus lockdown What can the police fine you for doing? Easter warnings from police, parks and councils Asked about suggestions that police were patrolling the supermarket aisles to see what people were buying, Downing Street said people were allowed to buy whatever they wanted from shops permitted to be open. ""We set out a list of shops which could remain open and if the shops are on that list then they are free to sell whatever they have in stock,"" the prime minister's official spokesman said. Police in Cambridge had to clarify a social media post - since deleted - by an ""over-exuberant"" officer who suggested they were monitoring aisles of ""non-essential"" goods in supermarkets. ""The force position, in line with national guidance, is that we are not monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets,""they said,external. On Thursday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said it was ""not appropriate"" for police to be checking people's supermarket trolleys afterNorthamptonshire Police threatened to introduce the measures. Chief Constable Nick Adderley said the force would consider roadblocks and searches of people's shopping if the public did not follow the rules. He later called his remarks ""clumsy"". With South Yorkshire Police also having apologised for a ""well-intentioned but ill-informed"" officer whotold a family not to play in their own front garden,external, Downing Street said people could use their gardens as they choose - as long as they are with members of their household. The government is seeking to reassure the public about the lockdown rules as it stresses the measures are working to reduce the spread of infection and the number of people admitted to hospital. Newly-elected Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to be transparent over its lockdown strategy and to clarify how long Mr Johnson will be ""out of action"". ""We need robust replacement arrangements in place and we need to know what they are, as soon as possible,"" he said. On Friday morning, the prime minister's father,Stanley Johnson, said there would have to be a ""period of adjustment""before his son returned to work. Earlier, individual nations reported their own coronavirus death figures, which are calculated using a different timeframe to the UK-wide figures. NHS England announced a further 866 deaths in English hospitals. In Scotland, 48 more people died, in Wales there were 29 more deaths, and in Northern Ireland there were 10.

The MP for Newark in Nottinghamshire travelled from London to a second home in Herefordshire, and separately visited his parents in Shropshire,the Daily Mail,externalandthe Guardian,externalreported. The government has advised against travel to second homes - and urged people to distance themselves from elderly relatives.

People thank key workers with Easter eggs,"Bettina Biazzoâs sons Rocco and Marco safeguard Easter eggs to be delivered to a hospital in Crawley People across England have been donating chocolate Easter eggs to key workers such as NHS staff to say 'thank you"" during the coronavirus pandemic. From local football clubs to multi-million pound companies, many have said they wanted to show support over the Easter holidays. Chris Collins, who donated eggs on behalf of the sports team he coaches, said it was âour little way of saying thank you very muchâ. Mr Collins, 50, and his wife, Suzy, 40, originally bought 40 eggs to give to the players of the Bootham Futsal Club. Chris and Suzy Collins said they had ""nothing but praise"" for NHS staff after she was treated following a motorcycle crash After the outbreak, with all club fixtures and training suspended, the couple - from York - said it was âonly rightâ to donate the eggs to the nearby York District Hospital. âWe thought, itâs the least we can do for the NHS,â Mr Collins said. âThereâs not a lot of good news around at the moment, people are struggling, but when things go wrong it brings out the good in people,â he added. âItâs such a minor thing weâre doing, but hopefully it will make staff smile while doing what is a horrible job at the moment.â Bettina Biazzo said she couldn't wait to see the faces of NHS staff when she delivered the eggs Bettina Biazzo, 39, started raising money to get 75 Easter eggs to staff at Crawley Hospital. âOne of my friends works at the hospital and said âIâm trying to get eggs for my nursesâ, theyâre working such long hours, they havenât got time to queue up at the shops to get Easter eggs.â Between her and a colleague, Ms Biazzo said they had raised enough to buy 100 eggs each and planned to deliver them as a surprise. âI think we all feel helpless in the lockdown,"" she said. ""Iâm stuck indoors and wanted to do something. I think people, especially those who are self-isolating and havenât got friends or family nearby, want to feel like a part of something.â Adam Everett said delivery of eggs went down well at his local hospital Football coaches Adam Everett, 17, and Jake Garner, 18, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, also donated chocolate eggs meant for players in their girls squads. Mr Everett, whose mother is an NHS nurse, said: âThey've been doing selfless acts for other people's wellbeing, they should be rewarded for that. âI know I donât want to go out and risk myself getting the virus, but theyâve got to.â Surprising staff with the gift at the Princess of Wales Hospital, Mr Everett said: âThey didnât have a clue, I went in and said âIâve got 27 Easter eggs for youâ, they were shocked and really grateful for the act of kindness. âI think everyoneâs starting to realise week to week how severe this virus is, and theyâre starting to look at what they can do for others. ""The issues we have as a country have been put to one side and everyone is having to get along, it feels like a very united country,â he added. Louisa Hobson said NHS staff acted quickly to save her life during a hospital stay in 2017 Louisa Hobson, who lives near Winchester, said she wanted to do something for NHS staff, but rather than give them something âessentialâ like personal protective equipment (PPE), she wanted to âput a smile on their facesâ. The 41-year-old started a crowdfunding page, raising enough to purchase 300 Easter eggs, to be distributed to Winchester Royal County Hospital, Alton Community Hospital and a local GP surgery. âI thought about staff not being able to see their families over Easter and wanted to do something to let them know we were thinking of them,â she said. âItâs something nice to do and itâs also achievable for a lot of people, a lot of us donât know where to get things like PPE, but this is more a morale booster than anything else.â Large retailers and manufacturers have also been stepping up to get Easter treats to NHS and other front line workers.

Chocolate makers Cadbury said more than 250,000 Easter eggs had been delivered to NHS and care home staff, as well as those at risk of food poverty.

Thank you for joining us, we'll see you again on Saturday morning. Here's a roundup of the biggest stories from the US today: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Things were already tense at a prison in Lansing, Kansas. A dozen
inmates and 14 staffers got sick from Covid-19, and officials gave out
cloth masks to try and stop the infection from spreading further. Then, on
Thursday, some of the prisoners began to set fires and smash windows. The
uprising lasted several hours, and it is not clear why it started. No-one was
badly hurt during the melee, and the facilities were locked down again by early
the following day. The violence at the prison - which houses about
150 inmates - is the latest sign that people in confinement are becoming
increasingly desperate. Hundreds of people have been infected in US prisons and
jails, according to data compiled by the New York Times, and more than two
dozen have died. Prisoners try to protect themselves against the disease
as best they can. In some places, such as in Lansing, they have begun to
express their rage in a violent manner. Dr David Wrigley, the Vice-Chairman of the doctorsâ union,
the British Medical Association (BMA), has criticised the health secretaryâs comments
thatthere had been a âHerculean effortâ to provide the NHS with protective equipment. He said that doctors âare not getting the PPE that they
needâ. âWeâve heard from two parts of England where there is insufficient
PPE being provided for doctors on the front line. Itâs forcing them into
impossible situations and itâs putting their lives at risk,â he told the BBC. He added that it was a âshocking indictmentâ that staff
working in some intensive care units did not have the correct face masks. And he said the BMA âknow now at least 11 doctors have died
in the fightâ against the virus. A Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, transit policy of having all bus passengers wear masks in order to protect employees was shortlived thanks to a couple of videos. In one clip, a man tells passengers without masks they must exit the bus - though he does not have a mask on himself. In another, police are seen dragging a man off. The footage was shared on Twitter, prompting questions from locals about what exactly the policy was. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) has nowtold the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper,externalit will no longer enforce the mask mandate, which began on Thursday.

The UK is experiencing warm weather across the Easter weekend but people are being urged to stay at home to reduce transmission of coronavirus. Seen from above, many areas in the UK that are normally crowded during sunny weather seem significantly emptier than they would otherwise be, suggesting people are following the government advice. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The UK's Easter lockdown from above Hidden behind protective masks, medics' faces are likely to remain unknown to most of the patients they treat. Thatâs a problem for nurses and doctors seeking to comfort their
patients with a reassuring smile. But medical staff in the US have found a novel solution - theyâve been attaching photos of their
smiling faces to their protective clothing. Respiratory therapist Robertino Rodriguez has been using the
technique while treating coronavirus patients at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San
Diego. In an Instagram post, he said he âfelt bad for my patients in ER
when I would come in the room with my face coveredâ. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Almojera, a senior paramedic in New York City, has written a diary for the BBC
of one day in his working life. He says that day - last Sunday - was the worst
in his 17-year career. We arrive at a house and I put on my mask, gown and
gloves. We find a man. His family says he has had a fever and
cough for five days. We start CPR and I watch the medics pass a tube down his
throat to breathe for him. We work on him for about 30 minutes before we pronounce
him dead. I make sure the crews are OK and get back in my truck -
decontaminating everything first. I hit the button to go available. Twenty minutes later, I get another cardiac arrest. Same
symptoms, same procedures, same results. We hit the button, get another one. Hit the button after that, get another one. There's only one patient we've seen so far who I feel
wasn't Covid-19 and that's because it was a suicide. Imagine: I was there and
my brain felt relief. This person's dead and it's a suicide. I felt relief that
it was a regular job. It is now around 11:00 and I've done about six cardiac
arrests. In normal times, a medic gets two or three in a week,
maybe. You can have a busy day sometimes, but never this. Never this.

Their plan is to initially help contact-tracing apps from public health authorities to run efficiently. Ultimately, they plan to develop a separate ""Bluetooth-based contract tracking platform"" to gather extensive data which apps from public health authorities can access. The two companies believe their approach addresses privacy concerns. People using the service will do so voluntarily, and no GPS location data or personal information will be recorded.

cities as it attempts to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The countryâs interior minister said all residents in those
cities, including the capital Ankara and Istanbul, will be required to stay at home from midnight
on Friday. Warm and sunny weather has been forecast for much of the
country over the weekend, prompting concern social-distancing rules may be
flouted. Turkeyâs coronavirus death toll jumped by 98 on Friday, with the total now at 1,006. Its total number of confirmed cases is now 47,029, a rise of
4,747 in 24 hours. Yemen was the last Arab country to confirm the presence of coronavirus Aid agencies have expressed alarm after the first virus case was confirmed in Yemen, where years of civil war have devastated health systems. Oxfam said it was a âdevastating blowâ, while the International Rescue Committee called it a ânightmare scenarioâ. Yemen is suffering the world's worst humanitarian crisis and millions are reliant on food aid. Diseases including cholera, dengue and malaria are rife and only half of hospitals are fully functional. News of the first Covid-19 case came a day after theSaudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen began a ceasefire, saying it wanted to help stop coronavirus spread and support UN peace efforts.

Here's what was said: Fans of Friends will have to wait a little longer for the highly anticipated reunion episode as it has been postponed due to the impact of coronavirus on TV production. The show had been due to launch with the HBO Max streaming service in May, but filming has not been able to take place. It is not yet clear when the episode will be filmed. Rumours of a reunion were confirmed by the cast in February. Friends aired from 1994 until 2004. The final show was watched by 52.5 million viewers in the US, making it the most watched TV episode of the 2000s. US President Donald Trump said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's approval rating ""must be about 300%"". Johnson tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March and has been in hospital since Sunday, including four days in intensive care. He had been leading the UK's response to the coronavirus but some have criticised his handling of the crisis. Trump said he had called Johnson's ""group"" to wish him well but had not spoken to the Prime Minister. ""His approval rating must be about 300%,"" Trump added. ""He is a great guy. ""He was a great guy before and people see what he has been through. What he has been through has been incredible."" Nick Thorpe, BBC News Romania's hospitals have struggled to cope with the influx of coronavirus patients The situation in Romania's hospitals is under control despite localised problems caused by the spread of coronavirus, a government official has told the BBC. The country has struggled to contain the spread of the virus, not helped by the return of 250,000 Romanians from jobs elsewhere in Europe during March. Almost 5,500 people have tested positive, 257 have died, and a similar number of new infections were reported in the last 24 hours. In the north-eastern city of Suceava, the hospital became the centre of contagion, with 182 medical staff infected. Elsewhere in the western city of Timisoara, 10 newborn babies tested positive for the virus, despite none of their mothers having the disease. Of those babies, seven have since tested negative. A criminal investigation has been launched, the director of the public health authority fired, and the hospital re-organised. Romanian government spokesman Andi Munciu told the BBC such cases were not a reflection of the ""generalised situation"" in the country. Social media companies are struggling to contain a wave of coronavirus misinformation. Into the breach have stepped volunteers who are fighting to stop rumours, bad advice and conspiracy theories from going viral. Rachael Hogg is currently juggling her busy job as a project manager and teaching her nine-year-old from her home in the market town of Morpeth, about 15 miles north of Newcastle. But if that wasn't enough, each day she's also deleting as many as 50 misleading posts about coronavirus from the local Facebook group she runs. See here for more on the people fighting fake news from home.  President Trump said he wants to reopen the country ""as soon as possible"" but ""facts will determine"" when he does so. Current restrictions in the US are set to end on 30 April. Asked if he was overly determined to reopening the country on that date, Trump said: ""I would love to open, I've not determined anything. The facts will determine what I do."" He said he will announce a new council on Tuesday, made up of doctors and businessmen tasked with discussing when the country could reopen. Trump named the council the ""opening our country council"". ""We are going to have great business leaders and doctors,"" he said. ""We will be announcing names on Tuesday and that will play a role [in deciding when the country can reopen]. ""I want to get open as soon as possible. This country is meant to be open and vibrant."" More than 18,000 have died from Covid-19 in Italy Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has extended Italyâs nationwide lockdown until 3 May. The first nationwide lockdown was imposed on 9 March until 3 April but was later extended to 13 April. The tight lockdown in Italy appears to be working. Its latest 24-hour death toll is 570, continuing a declining trend. But Italy still has the world's highest overall death toll, which currently stands at 18,849. Liverpool and Scotland football legend Sir Kenny Dalglish has tested positive for coronavirus and is in hospital but showing no symptoms. The 69-year-old was admitted to hospital on Wednesday for treatment of an infection and tested positive for Covid-19 after a routine test. His family said in a statement ""he looks forward to being home soon"". Dalglish played over 500 games for Liverpool and also managed the club on two occasions. He also won more than 100 caps for Scotland. Many Good Friday services, like this one in Kenya, were broadcast live as churches have suspended congregational worship Many Christians in Africa usually

PM taking short walks as virus care continues,"The PM outside Downing Street before he was admitted to hospital Boris Johnson is taking short walks between periods of rest as part of the care he is receiving for coronavirus. The prime minister has also thanked the team looking after him for the ""incredible care"" he has received, a Downing Street spokesman said. Mr Johnson was taken to hospital on Sunday - 10 days after testing positive. Earlier on Friday, his father said Mr Johnson ""must rest up"" after he wasmoved from intensive care. Stanley Johnson spoke of his ""relief"" that his son had begun his recovery, adding that he thought his illness had ""got the whole country to realise this is a serious event"". The No 10 spokesman said: ""[Mr Johnson] has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received. ""His thoughts are with those affected by this terrible disease."" LIVE UPDATES: Christians face Good Friday on virus lockdown Earlier, the spokesman said the prime minister was back on a ward and ""in very good spirits"", emphasising that Mr Johnson was at an ""early stage"" of his recovery from coronavirus. NHS England has announced 866 more people have died in England after testing positive for coronavirus, and separate figures show there have been 48 more in Scotland,29 more in Walesand10 more in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, scientific adviser Prof Neil Ferguson, who was asked about coming out of lockdown, said it would likely ""be targeted by age, by geography"". Prof Ferguson, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that work to end the coronavirus lockdown in the UK was the ""number one topic and priority"" both in the scientific community and in government. ""Every waking minute, as it were,"" he said. Speaking about what measures might be needed to end the lockdown, Prof Ferguson said the UK would have to introduce larger levels of testing at community level ""to isolate cases more effectively"". However, he suggested the lockdown would have to remain in place for ""several more weeks"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for clarity about how long the prime minister will be ""out of action"". ""We need robust replacement arrangements in place and we need to know what they are, as soon as possible,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Meanwhile, the government has launched a campaign urging people to stay at home over the Easter Bank Holiday. It comes as Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick defended his travel moves amid reports he flouted lockdown rules. The MP for Newark in Nottinghamshire is said to have travelled from London to a second home in Herefordshire, and separately visited his parents in neighbouring Shropshire,according to the Daily Mail,externalandthe Guardian,external. The government has advised against travel to second homes - and urged people to distance themselves from elderly relatives. Easter warnings from police, parks and councils 15% find lockdown 'extremely difficult' - poll 'I'm in lockdown with my long-lost sister' Mr Jenrick said he had been in London on ministerial duties and left for what he said was a family home in Herefordshire to join his wife and children. He added that he visited his parents to deliver essentials, including medicines - allowed by the rules. Downing Street has defended Mr Jenrick, saying it was ""not an unnecessary journey"" for cabinet ministers commuting to and from London to rejoin their family. ""We're confident that he complied with the social distancing rules,"" a spokesman said. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said it was ""important for public confidence"" that Mr Jenrick explained the purpose of the journey. But he added that if the housing secretary had delivered medicine to his parents, ""clearly... it fits within the four exceptions"". Prof Paul Cosford, medical director for Public Health England, said government guidelines were ""quite clear"" that people must stay at home except in one of four circumstances, including exercise, essential shopping for food and medicines, healthcare and essential work. ""I can't comment on Mr Jenrick, it sounds as if what he did was within one of the four guidelines to me, but others will obviously have to think about that more,"" he told the Today programme. Asked about the government's lockdown exit strategy, Prof Cosford said he ""could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lifted sooner and some are lifted later"", but cautioned that there was still an ""awfully long way to go"". Meanwhile, the German army is donating 60 mobile ventilators to the NHS. There are currently 10,000 available in the UK and the government says 18,000 are needed. Thousands of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) suits for the UK are also scheduled to arrive at RAF Brize Norton later on Friday from Nato ally Turkey. At the government's daily briefing on Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who is standing in for Mr Johnson - acknowledged it was hard for people hoping to go out and be with their families over Easter, but urged restraint. Mr Raab was speaking ahead of a bank holiday weekend forecasted to see temperatures as high as 26C in London on Saturday, though cooler weather is expected on Sunday. He said lockdown restrictions will stay in place until evidence showed the UK had moved beyond the peak of the virus. The new campaign aims to reinforce the importance of staying at home over Easter Police forces across the UK have urged people to stay at home over the Easter weekend, with police in North Irelandwarning of increased patrols, and forces in Wales vowinga crackdown on unnecessary travel. Police Scotland officers will also be on patrolto explain the risks to public health of flouting guidance. Some forces and local authorities said they had already turned away would-be holidaymakers making journeys to popular destinations on Thursday. Downing Street has given its ""full backing"" to officers enforcing the lockdown rules. However, some forces have been criticised for their handling of the new measures. What powers do police have during the pandemic? On Friday morning, the Cambridge Police Twitter account posted a statement  to ""clarify"" officers were ""not monitoring"" what people are buying from supermarkets. An earlier post suggested officers were patrolling ""non-essential"" aisles at Tesco supermarket in Barhill. The force said the initial post, since deleted, was made by an ""over-exuberant"" officer. ""The force position, in line with national guidance, is that we are not monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets,""Cambridge Police tweeted,external. On Thursday, Northamptonshire's chief constable was criticised for sayinghe would not rule out road blocks or checking supermarket trolleys- later confirming that the force would not be judging people on what they are buying. This video can not be played Watch people around the UK clap for NHS workers on 9 April A number of Easter-themed government adverts will be running in newspapers and on social media urging people to stay at home during the holiday. A government spokesperson said: ""We understand that people will want to spend time with their friends and families this Easter, and we recognise that we are asking the public to make sacrifices in the fight against this disease. ""We are at a crucial moment in preventing further transmission of coronavirus, and so it is vital that we continue following the government's guidance.""

Outbreak 'levelling off' in US - Fauci,"Refrigerated tractor trailers serve as temporary morgues in New York City The US has become the first country in the world to record more than 2,000 coronavirus deaths in a single day. Figures from Johns Hopkins University show 2,108 people died in the past 24 hours while there are now more than half a million confirmed infections. The US could soon surpass Italy as the country with the most coronavirus deaths worldwide. But experts on the White House Covid-19 task force say the outbreak is starting to level off across the US. Dr Deborah Birx said there were good signs the outbreak was stabilising, but cautioned: ""As encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak."" President Donald Trump also said he expects the US to see a lower death toll than the initial predictions of 100,000 fatalities, adding: ""We're seeing clear signs that our aggressive strategy is saving countless lives"".

About half of the deaths were recorded in the New York area. Italy has reported 18,849 deaths while globally more than 102,000 people have died with the virus. Researchers had predicted the US death toll would hit its peak on Friday and then gradually start to decline, falling to around 970 people a day by 1 May - the day members of the Trump administration have floated as a possible date to start reopening the economy. ""I want to get it open as soon as possible,"" Mr Trump said at a Good Friday briefing at the White House. ""I would say without question it's the biggest decision I've ever had to make."" However, no action would be taken until the government knew the ""country [was] going to be healthy"", he said. ""We don't want to go back and start doing it over again."" By Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York The coronavirus has changed everything about life, and now it's upending the rituals of death. New Yorkers have been shocked by the grim scenes: ambulances constantly blaring down eerily deserted streets, body bags being forklifted into refrigerated trucks outside hospitals and now new trenches being dug on Hart's Island for possible mass burials. The remote cemetery, accessible only by boat, is a place regarded historically with sorrow because of its mass graves with no tombstones, just unclaimed bodies. The city's morgues can only handle so much before temporary burials for Covid-19 victims, once an absolute worst-case scenario, become necessary. Funeral directors talk openly about how scared and depressed the spiking death toll has left them. Even before this week's record number of deaths, some families have had to wait a week or more to bury and cremate their loved ones. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Dr Anthony Fauci, US infectious diseases chief, concurred that the country was ""starting to see the levelling off and coming down"" of cases and deaths. But despite the ""important advance"", he added, mitigation efforts such as social distancing should not be pulled back yet. A new projection by theInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington forecast 60,000 deaths by 4 August,externalassuming that those restrictions remain in place. Last month, Dr Fauci estimated at least 100,000 deaths. Also at the briefing, Dr Birx noted that the rate of increase appeared to be stabilising in hard-hit regions like New York, New Jersey and the city of Chicago. She added that the US mortality rate was ""significantly less than many of the other countries, when you correct them for our population"". But she emphasised the nation had yet to see the peak of the outbreak. ""We need to continue to do what we did yesterday, and the week before, and the week before that because that's what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side.""

On Friday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the latest data showed the state was successfully ""flattening the curve"", but also cautioned that it was too early to relax social distancing measures.

""As a matter of fact, I have been carrying an inhaler in my pocket for 40 years out of fear of having a fatal asthma attack,"" continued Dr Adams, who is African-American. But he caused controversy by urging minorities to stop drinking, smoking and taking drugs to reduce their risk. He was particularly criticised for his use of colloquial language, when he told them to respect social distancing guidelines. ""Do it for your abuela. Do it for your granddaddy. Do it for your Big Mama. Do it for your Pop Pop,"" Dr Adams said. He later advised all Americans to avoid alcohol, tobacco and drugs. This video can not be played US surgeon general shows his inhaler while discussing the impact of coronavirus on people of colour In Friday's briefing, Mr Trump also said he had seen the drone images of coffins being stacked in a mass grave on New York's Hart Island. Officials there say the island, which has been used to bury people with no next of kin for over 150 years, is now burying bodies at five times the normal rate. Earlier in the day, Dr Fauci told CNN that officials are currently discussing whether to adopt immunity certificates for Americans who have safely survived the coronavirus and have antibodies in their blood to prove it. The certificates might ""have some merit under certain circumstances"", he said, adding that antibody tests would be available next week.

Air industry bodies call for government support,"Air industry bodies have called on the UK government to expand support for the sector, which is reeling due to the coronavirus crisis. They say providing more help for aviation, and extending the duration of that help, will stave off job losses. The Department for Transport said aviation firms could already draw on an ""unprecedented"" government aid package. And Greenpeace said the UK shouldn't ""open the cheque book"" for ""polluting"" sectors. Bodies representing the UK's aerospace industry, airlines and airports claim that if action isn't taken now, the aviation sector in Britain could be left behind when an economic recovery comes. At present, hundreds of aircraft are grounded, airports are operating at minimal capacity, and aerospace production has slowed. But industry groups ADS Group, Airlines UK and the Airport Operators Association warned this could just be the beginning. The groups, whose members include Airbus, BAE Systems, British Airways, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic, said they didn't expect demand for flights to recover quickly, meaning that much of the aviation workforce may not be needed for months to come. The aviation industry is fighting for survival - and not just in the immediate future. As far as the present crisis is concerned, the government has made it clear there won't be a special deal for the sector. Companies will have to make use of the measures already set out by the chancellor. But many of them can't do that because they don't fit the government's criteria - so the plea now is at least to make those measures more flexible, so that more businesses can benefit. Then there's the recognition that although the industry's grounding appeared to happen almost overnight, its recovery is likely to be very slow. What we're seeing now is just the beginning. But if we're going to see fewer flights - then there won't be a need for as many people working in the industry for quite a while. There's a risk of significant layoffs. And then there's the question of what happens when flights do restart. If different countries all have different restrictions and procedures in place, it could become a nightmare for the humble traveller. Significant challenges - which aviation groups say the government needs to help solve. The groups have asked the government to extend its Job Retention Scheme  - under which it will pay for staff to be laid off for short periods - beyond its current end date in May. And they want relief from business tax rates that have already been given to the retail and hospitality sectors to be extended to all UK aviation firms - as has happened in Scotland. They are also calling for the government to work with other countries to ensure that when travel restrictions are removed, it is done in a coordinated manner so that customers aren't left confused and put off from travelling. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said that the aviation sector is ""important to the UK economy"" and that firms can draw upon an ""unprecedented package of measures"" announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak, ""including schemes to raise capital, flexibilities with tax bills, and financial support for employees."" ""We are continuing to work closely with the sector and are willing to consider the situation of individual firms, so long as all other government schemes have been explored and all commercial options exhausted, including raising capital from existing investors,"" the spokesperson added. However, environmental campaign group Greenpeace said that any support the UK government extends to the sector should be conditional on aviation cleaning up its act. ""The government cannot simply open the cheque book for polluting industries with no questions asked,"" said Greenpeace executive director John Sauven. ""Any public money going to airlines must come with strict and clear conditions attached. ""Government support must be used to help employees and plan for a transition to a cleaner more resilient economy. It should not be spent on bonuses, dividends, and lobbying against environmental standards."" ""If airlines want the public to bail them out, they need to provide public good in return.""

New York ramps up mass burials amid virus outbreak,"This video can not be played Drone footage shows mass burials in New York Images have emerged of coffins being buried in a mass grave in New York City, as the death toll from the coronavirus continues to rise. Workers in hazmat outfits were seen stacking wooden coffins in deep trenches in Hart Island. Officials say burials are being ramped up at site, which has long been used for people with no next-of-kin or families who cannot afford a funeral. New York state now has more coronavirus cases than any single country. The state's confirmed caseload of Covid-19 is nearly 162,000, of whom 7,844 have died. Spain has recorded about 157,000 cases and Italy 143,600, while China, where the virus emerged last year, has nearly 83,000 cases. The US as a whole has recorded 467,000 cases and about 16,700 deaths. Globally there are 1.6 million cases and 97,000 deaths. About 40 bodies were buried on Thursday The drone footage comes from Hart Island, off the Bronx in Long Island Sound, which has been used for more than 150 years by city officials as a mass burial site for those withno next-of-kin, or families who cannot afford funerals. Normally, about 25 bodies a week are interred on the island, according to the Associated Press news agency. But burial operations have increased from one day a week to five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, said Department of Correction spokesman Jason Kersten. One virus, two Americas Four out of five jobs affected by virus globally Prisoners from Rikers Island, the city's main jail complex, usually do the job, but the rising workload has recently been taken over by contractors. It is not clear how many of the dead have no next-of-kin or could not afford a funeral. However, the city has cut the amount of time it will hold unclaimed remains amid pressure on morgue space. New York City Mayor Bill de BlasioÂ indicated earlier this week that ""temporary burials"" might be necessary until the crisis had passed.Â ""Obviously the place we have used historically is Hart Island,"" he said.

Dr Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House's coronavirus task force, told NBC News' Today show the final number of Americans who would die from Covid-19 in the outbreak ""looks more like 60,000"". In late March, Dr Fauci estimated ""between 100,000 and 200,000"" could die. Mourners attend a funeral in Brooklyn, New York, as the city's coronavirus death toll hit a record high for a third day The 60,000 projection would match the upper estimate for total flu deaths in the US between October 2019 to March 2020,according to government data,external. But Vice-President Mike Pence stressed on Thursday that Covid-19 was about three times as contagious as influenza. Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Global economy will suffer for 'years to come' The White House has previously touted estimates that 2.2 million Americans could die from coronavirus if nothing was done to stop its spread. Stay-at-home orders have in the meantime closed non-essential businesses in 42 states, while drastically slowing the US economy. New data on Thursday showedunemployment claims had topped 6 millionfor the second week in a row, bringing the number of Americans out of work over the last three weeks to 16.8 million.

Are minorities being hit hardest by coronavirus? Figures from Louisiana, Mississippi, Michigan, Wisconsin and New York reflect the same racial disparity in coronavirus infections.

Even before this week's record number of deaths, some families have had to wait a week or more to bury and cremate their loved ones. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Dr Anthony Fauci, US infectious diseases chief, concurred that the country was ""starting to see the levelling off and coming down"" of cases and deaths. But despite the ""important advance"", he added, mitigation efforts such as social distancing should not be pulled back yet. A new projection by theInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington forecast 60,000 deaths by 4 August,externalassuming that those restrictions remain in place. Last month, Dr Fauci estimated at least 100,000 deaths. Also at the briefing, Dr Birx noted that the rate of increase appeared to be stabilising in hard-hit regions like New York, New Jersey and the city of Chicago. She added that the US mortality rate was ""significantly less than many of the other countries, when you correct them for our population"". But she emphasised the nation had yet to see the peak of the outbreak. ""We need to continue to do what we did yesterday, and the week before, and the week before that because that's what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side.""

On Friday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the latest data showed the state was successfully ""flattening the curve"", but also cautioned that it was too early to relax social distancing measures. ""Even though it's a grind, even though it's difficult, we have to stay with it."" The danger appears to be highest for America's minority communities, which have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19. Killed by a virus he thought had been overhyped I'm using my pizza oven to toss masks for nurses Why some US churches are still open this Easter Apple and Google team up for coronavirus tracking Dr Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general, said the trend was ""alarming, but not surprising"" given that minorities in the US generally had more chronic health conditions such as asthma, hypertension and diabetes. ""As a matter of fact, I have been carrying an inhaler in my pocket for 40 years out of fear of having a fatal asthma attack,"" continued Dr Adams, who is African-American. But he caused controversy by urging minorities to stop drinking, smoking and taking drugs to reduce their risk. He was particularly criticised for his use of colloquial language, when he told them to respect social distancing guidelines. ""Do it for your abuela. Do it for your granddaddy. Do it for your Big Mama. Do it for your Pop Pop,"" Dr Adams said. He later advised all Americans to avoid alcohol, tobacco and drugs.

Officials there say the island, which has been used to bury people with no next of kin for over 150 years, is now burying bodies at five times the normal rate. Earlier in the day, Dr Fauci told CNN that officials are currently discussing whether to adopt immunity certificates for Americans who have safely survived the coronavirus and have antibodies in their blood to prove it. The certificates might ""have some merit under certain circumstances"", he said, adding that antibody tests would be available next week.

The Democratic-led proposal calls for a $13 (Â£10) hourly rate, on top of the pay that workers already receive from their employers. Payment would be capped at $25,000. The money would go towards nurses, doctors, grocery store clerks, transit workers and other workers deemed essential. Seven people stuck in a lift. Then one coughs...

'I'm happy Cadet finally got recognition before he died',"On 9 February 2019, Blaine Johnson, better known as Cadet, was on his way to perform a gig at Keele University when the taxi he was in crashed, killing him and injuring the other passengers in the car. More than a year later, as his debut album Rated Legend is released, Cadet's cousin Krept reflects on their at-times complicated relationship. As told to Kameron Virkâ¦ It's hard putting private things out in the open. I do it in my music because I know how much people look at artists and think that everything's great. But when you're open and honest and let them know that you're going through just as much stuff as they're going through, it helps. It can literally save lives. That's why I've been so honest about how hard it's been for me since Cadet died. As his debut album comes out, I want to just take a minute to reflect on his life and our relationship. Some people have such mad stories that they have to figure out a way to talk about them. Cadet was 100% one of those people. He was such a talented storyteller. Anyone who's heard his music knows that. When you come from a certain place, a certain background, and you go through so much stuffâ¦ if you like doing music, you like rapping, to put it into words is not gonna be difficult. I think that's what separates a lot of people. It's just their story. But before the world knew him as Cadet, he was Blaine Johnson, my cousin. And for a period he was MC Bubbly too! Yeah. MC Bubbly. When he spat his first bar, at my dad's house in Brixton, that's what he was called. The lyric was actually good - but I was like 'Bro, you can't be called MC Bubbly'. Cadet was always a funny kid. He was a troll before we knew what trolls were Blaine was less than a month younger than me. So growing up we were always together. Like, always. His dad and my dad are brothers, but our mums are close too. I've got an older brother, and we were all really close. But my brother spent some time in Jamaica, and it was just me and Blaine together. It was like he was my brother. We used to spend every Sunday at my nan's. Those Sundays were a vibe. We all used to go there - Cadet, me, my dad, his dad, Cadet's sister Chandler, our nan and granddad, our auntie - sometimes other cousins too. My nan used to cook every Sunday so there was always food there. But it wasn't even just for that reason: we just used to go there, play games and buss jokes - and Cadet would be dancing. He was always dancing when we were younger. The guy loved body-popping. And he was so sick! He could've been a professional dancer if he stuck with it. I used to body pop a bit too - but he was to the point where when we used to go parties, he used to get in the middle and start body popping and everyone would go crazy. There's something else that sticks with me from that age too - an image I just can't get out of my head. I don't know why my dad did it - Cadet must've been being naughty. But we were at the petrol station, and you know where it says how much the petrol is per litre? There was a little peg on there. He lifted Blaine up and hung him on there by his pants. I just remember Blaine swinging helplessly and crying and I can't get that out of my head. I used to laugh about it every day. Ludo was our family game - we used to play it every Sunday at our nan's When we got a bit older I took advantage of the 417 bus, which went from my house in Gipsy Hill to his in Clapham Common. It dropped me literally right outside. So from when I was allowed to travel by myself, in secondary school, I'd get on there and it would take me all the way there, or he'd come to mine. Then when Cadet started living with his dad in South Norwood we used to walk to Crystal Palace from my house and jump on the 410 bus down to his dad's. Those buses are where his name came from - their brand name was Cadet. We were just on the bus and I saw the Cadet thing and I just said, ""Cadet! Why don't you call yourself Cadet?"" He was like ""Cadet?â¦. Yeah. Yeah, that's hard!"" We must've been 14 or 15, and ever since then he's been Cadet. I started rapping before him, just because all my friends were. They were doing sets in the ends and I was like, I need some bars to jump in the set. That's when I started writing. And then he saw all of us were spitting, so he started. The maddest thing is even when his name was MC Bubbly, the lyrics were good - I knew from then he could spit. We went to Richmond College together when we turned 16 and made a whole new friendship group. Things started changing after that though. I went to uni in Portsmouth, and Cadet started working. So we just didn't see each other. Me, Cadet and his dad Paul at a restaurant in south London back when we were still at college Me and Konan started making a name for ourselves at this point too. We put out our first mixtape in my first year of uni. So I'm doing uni, I'm doing music, and then we're just getting into mad problems and involved in street stuff too. It was like three different lives I was living. It was balancing bare stuff. It looked like me and Konan were already successful - and any time me and Cadet spoke, it felt like he was asking for stuff. 'Oh, can you do this for me. Can you promote that?' But we weren't making no money, we were still building. We weren't even seeing each other on Sundays now, because I was in Portsmouth. My family thought I was distancing myself. Cadet didn't fully understand until a few years later, when he was in the ""groundwork stage"" of his own career - as I call that period in mine - that I was just working. He talks about it on the new album. But we weren't speaking openly at the time. There was a communication breakdown. He used to make songs or freestyles every now and then and send shots for me. And I was like, why does he keep doing that? And then he'd ask me to promote it! I was like 'Are you alright?' It was weird. It really took off for me and Kone in the next few years. We did the remix of Otis, which went crazy viral. But it was a mad period - this was just after the situation happened with Konan, where his step-dad was killed. But we capitalised on the Otis momentum, dropped Paranormal, and ended up going on tour with Skepta. He gave us some advice - basically told us to keep doing us and not chase the labels or the radio - and we never really looked back. Mobo Awards, BET Awards and a record deal followed. But I never got a call from Cadet. I'm definitely someone who thinks 'Everyone's got their own life'. I don't expect nothing from anyone. But that was the person I was closest to my whole life, and I didn't get to share that with him. Winning a BET Award was crazy - we couldn't believe the Americans knew our song We'd still see each other sometimes, round nan's on a Sunday. And when we were together it was normal. But for me relationships aren't just about when you see each other - it's about when you're not with each other too. I'm sure at some point he would have said 'I'm proud of you'. But it wasn't how it would have been if we were close. I know that for a fact. At this point I'd had enough. I just kept thinking, 'Why are we like this? How did it get like this?' I missed that relationship - and I knew it had gone because of the music. The only thing that was gonna build our relationship back was him doing music and taking it seriously. That's when I messaged him and said 'Bro, you're coming Wireless'. I needed to inspire him. I knew how talented he was, and that if he took it seriously, he would get big. Sometimes you just need that little fire. Wireless that year was mad - there were loads of celebrities backstage. When he saw them coming up to us, he was like, 'What's going on? These man are actually getting big!' There must've been 5,000 people in the crowd that day, singing every single word back. All our friends watched us perform from the side of the stage. Cadet was the last person to leave - I could see it had worked. He was inspired. I knew taking Cadet to Wireless in 2015 would change his mindset Things felt pretty normal after that. We started talking all the time - mostly about his music. As far as I was concerned, our relationship was fixed. But he was still sending shots for me on freestyles - like on Slut. I thought that was just about music, so I was like, whatever. As long as you're doing music, you can say what you want. But I didn't know all of the stuff he thought had been going on. That's when the letters came. He told me he was dropping something, to look out for it. From when I saw the title, Letter To Krept, I just knew it was gonna be honest. I was in my house in Bermondsey and watched it as soon as it was uploaded. I wanted to hear it. And then I just started writing. I was glad he did it because then it was like, now I can explain my side to you. When I heard the lyric about his girlfriend - that he thought I knew she was cheating on him, I was like, 'Rah, swear down you thought that?' Until the letter came out I had no idea he'd been thinking that the whole time. I was happy with the way it played out though. He likes expressing and telling his truth in music, and I do as well. So I was cool with how that happened. At the same time I knew that if I responded to him it was only gonna help his career. Cadet's Letter healed our relationship After I said what I needed to in my reply - about him asking for my help but not putting the work in himself - the air was cleared. It was back to normal. We didn't even need to build anything back up - because we'd been so close for the rest of our lives, except for that six-year period in the middle. It was the same as it was before, just with no weird elephants in the room. We finally got to witness each other flourish. I got to share those big moments I'd always wanted to with him. At this point Cadet was hitting hard with the freestyles. He knew his lane, he knew what his fans wanted, and he was delivering. And when it came to storytelling, he was in his own lane. When he spat I had to just sit back like, 'Wow. That's talent'. But he felt underrated. He didn't think he was getting his dues. I remember we all had a conversation and I said how if you tell people something enough, it becomes true. As an example, Giggs calling himself the Landlord - you end up calling him that. That was when he started calling himself Underrated Legend. It was a smart move from Cadet to put that out there, because then everyone starts saying he needs his ratings! But Cadet's thing was, 'Rapping about my life is cool, but that's not really getting me the bookings. We're not going to be able to shut down the clubs or the festivals with that.' Until Advice came. That was the hit he'd been looking for. He'd been dabbling, and he got it so right with that one. But it was almost never a song. Cadet and Deno done it as a freestyle in the car, put the video on social, and left it at that. Konan rang him and was like 'Bro. Cadet. Bro. This is a banger! Record a video and put this out ASAP'. He did, and it was his biggest song ever. Cadet's biggest song - Advice with Deno - was almost just a freestyle After that, he just kept on going. He started feeling like he was finally getting the recognition he deserved. You see when you start getting records like that back? You start getting serious money. He was like, 'Rah, I'm about to actually join the crew'. He started getting bookings - he was booked for Wireless - and he started feeling like a real artist. I'm glad he got to feel that. He was chasing it and he got there, he knew what it felt like to have a massive record. That's something that makes the way he died so much easier for me. A month before Cadet died, I lost one of my closest friends, Nash, to suicide. I met Nash in college but we became mad tight. We were all in the same group chat - me, him and Cadet. I remember playing Broski, about Nash passing away, to Cadet. We played it and just sat back like, 'Wow. I can't believe he's gone'. Then a month later, it happened again. When I found out, I was in Dubai. My girlfriend took me for my birthday. The day before, Cadet messaged me saying, ""Yo cuz, I just want you to know I love you."" I was like, 'You're dumb man. You're soft'. He told me he'd got me the socks I'd asked for for my birthday. The next day my friend CJ called as I was boarding my flight home. I knew something was wrong because it was late in the UK, like 2am. So for you to call me at 2am, knowing I'm abroad, something's wrong. And it's someone that doesn't call me a lot - we don't have phone conversations like that. So I know there's a reason he's calling me, and I know he's always with Cadet. I picked up and he was crying. I just knew. He didn't even have to tell me what happened. I knew exactly what he was going to say. I hung up the phone and nearly dropped to the floor. I had to put my bags down, take a seat and have a breather. My girlfriend was helping me. All I kept saying was there's no way. There's no way, there's no way, there's no way. I was trying to ring people, and eventually I got through to my dad. He was crying, and that made me cry. All this time I'm having to board a plane. It was the worst, absolute worst, worst, worst feeling I've ever had. By the time I landed home, I'd been seeing the response on social media. I could see all the love he had, I could feel it. But his mum, dad and our nan, they weren't seeing it. As adults they know that their kids are doing well as musicians, but they don't really know until they see you at a concert or something. So I needed them to see all the love that was being poured out on social media. That's why I said Hyde Park - 'Everyone come to Hyde Park, we're gonna let off some balloons for Cadet'. I needed them to see the impact that he made. At first they didn't understand why I was saying Hyde Park. They wanted to do something in Clapham. But I had to explain - this is bigger than South London. When they saw all the people they couldn't believe it. There must have been 1,000. They couldn't believe it, that he had so much love. My uncle never cries. That was the first time I've seen him break down. It was hard, it was so hard. It still is. Cadet died a month before his 29th birthday I started to learn about what happened on the night he died. I had to speak to the people that were in the car with him. He was in a packed car and he's the only one that died. I spoke to his friend Money that was there, his DJ, and Ed his cameraman. They were all in the car. Cadet was behind the driver. The DJ was next to him, Money was on the left behind the front passenger and then Ed was in the passenger. What they found mad was the fact that they called an Uber, and they missed it. So the Uber they actually got in wasn't the original Uber they were meant to get in. They got into a second Uber and they were driving for like five minutes on country roads. They said they turned a corner and a car crashed into them. Head on collision. He died instantly. There wasn't any other major injuries. I know Ed fractured something. But no-one had life-threatening injuries. Cadet hit his head. That's what killed him. Whatever he hit is what killed him. But they weren't even meant to be in that Uber. It's like something out of Final Destination. You call an Uber, you just, JUST, about miss it. You cancel it and have to call another one and it just so happens that at that time, this guy is coming around the corner. If they got in a car one minute earlier that wouldn't have happened. If they got in that first cab, this wouldn't have happened. That's what I find mad. After the funeral I was just keeping busy. I was getting ready for his show, the Rated Legend show. We put it on in Brixton Academy on his birthday, two weeks later. It was like Avengers Assemble. Everybody was being helpful - the venue, my agent, all the artists, 1Xtra who helped with logistics. Everyone came on time, it was perfect. It was like 'Rah, all these people, these artists, they all had respect for Cadet'. I have no idea how, but we pulled the Rated Legend tribute show together in two weeks After he passed, loads of producers started hitting us up saying they'd recorded songs with him. It ended up being 50, 60 songs or something. It just kept on being more and more. I was like, 'This guy was working his arse off! Why's he got so many songs?!' We tried to get a cohesive body of work out of it. That's what his mum and dad wanted. The family listened to all the songs and decided what they liked, and Rated Legend is the culmination of putting those together and finishing them off. We set up the Cadet Trust too - which funds organisations that are doing something good for young people or in the community. All these kids that we're funding and helping, when they get to where they get to in life, they're gonna be able to say 'Cadet helped me get here'. We just wanted to leave something in his name that can benefit people who are chasing their dreams. My first child is due later this year. Having something missing from your life and then having something added is a weird feeling. But I really can't wait for my daughter to arrive. It's going to help take my mind off loads of stuff, like my friends that I've lost. It feels like finally I'm gaining something instead of losing people. I know the relationship my daughter would have had with Cadet. He was so good with kids. I know for a fact, when she got old enough, he would have come over like, 'I'm taking her out'. That's the kind of person he is. He would've been an amazing uncle. For me, I just want people to know how special he is. That's what this album is. I want people to listen to it, and to hear this amazing body of work he made without even trying to. I want people to think, 'Wow, imagine if he'd beentryingto make an album?' I want people to see how much potential he had. And I want people to no longer call him underrated - he's surpassed that now.

'I'm in lockdown with my long-lost sister',"This video can not be played Long-lost sisters Margaret and Sue are enjoying the chance to get to know each other ""The lockdown has been an absolutely fantastic silver lining for us. It's given us an opportunity to make up for lost time."" Sue Bremner and her husband David, from Shropshire, are stranded in New Zealand due to the coronoavirus pandemic. But it's given Sue the chance to get to know her long-lost sister Margaret Hannay - who she didn't know existed for more than 40 years. Margaret, 71, was given up for adoption at two weeks old by her mum, who had a short relationship with Sue's dad in 1948. It was only last year that the sisters met for the first time after Margaret - who lives in Auckland - got in touch with Sue in the UK. Sue, 65, and her husband went out to see her sister again as part of a two-month trip across New Zealand and Australia on 5 March. But two weeks later,the country went into lockdownand they couldn't get back to the UK.  So Sue has been able to spend some extra time with Margaret and her husband, John. ""We've been having a wonderful time here,"" says Sue, who lives in Ludlow. ""We've been spending lots of time together drinking wine and cooking and having fun."" Margaret says she now calls her sister the ""Sue-chef"" ""We haven't killed each other yet,"" Margaret laughs. ""It's been great. It's really hard, as you probably know, to share a kitchen with someone. But we seem to manage, everything works."" Sue found out she had an older sister in 2000 when her dad told her that he'd had a child with another woman before he'd met her mum. ""My dad asked me would I try to find Margaret because he wanted her to know there's never been a day gone past when he hadn't thought about the child that had been adopted. ""He was very regretful that somebody had been brought into the world and he didn't know them and he wanted to apologise for that."" Sue gave her details to the General Register Office - which holds records of births and deaths - and searched on social media and ancestry websites. She was told she wouldn't be able to find out any information about her sister unless Margaret got in touch saying she wanted to be found. Margaret (second left) met up with her siblings John (far left), Sue and Lawrence (far right) for the first time last year Margaret, who moved to New Zealand 45 years ago, always knew she was adopted but didn't really have any desire to track down her birth parents. But last year, she told her daughter she had started to wonder whether she had any siblings. She then got in touch with the General Register Office and within two weeks they got back to her to say she had a sister - giving her Sue's contact details. ""I was sitting there in bed with my first morning cup of tea with John snoring next to me and I opened this email and I was like, 'Oh I've got a sister',"" says Margaret. ""So when he woke up he found me sitting in bed with my cup of tea sobbing. When I told him he was delighted as he has two older brothers. I always wanted to have brothers and sisters but I never did."" Sue says it was ""amazing"" when she got an email from Margaret introducing herself - but unfortunately their dad had died before they were reunited. ""Receiving that email was like winning the pools. I would've loved to have told my dad but I just kind of feel he's inside me and he knew it was happening."" Margaret and Sue spoke to the BBC on FaceTime from Auckland Margaret and Sue also have two brothers - Lawrence and John Connell - and all four siblings met up for the first time in the UK last year. ""It was a great opportunity for all of a sudden meet the rest of family to see how we all got on,"" says Margaret. ""Since we've known each other we've found so many similarities it's uncanny."" Sue and Margaret say they both like weak coffee and they suffer from ""wobbly knees"". Sue and her husband have already had two flights back to the UK cancelled - but are booked on a flight to return home on Saturday. Currently, there's only beenone coronavirus related death in New Zealandand their daughter - who is a doctor - even advised them to stay on there. ""She says stay where you are, it's very safe in New Zealand. But we've got children back in the UK and grandchildren. It's a hard decision. Your heart is pulled to come back. We need to get back really but we're having a wonderful time."" The sisters had planned to meet up again in the UK later this year - but they've put the trip on hold until 2021 now. ""I'm already starting to plan as I've got to match this stay,"" says Sue. ""I'm thinking of booking Ludlow Castle and getting all the family together."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

'Herculean effort' to provide NHS protective gearHealth Secretary Matt Hancock says the UK's new distribution network would ensure daily deliveries.UK,"This video can not be played ""We're getting the PPE out there but there's clearly a huge task ahead to keep it flowing"" The UK will now ensure daily deliveries of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline workers, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told the daily coronavirus briefing it had been a ""Herculean effort"", after criticism the government was not doing enough to protect critical NHS staff. Officials told the briefing the lockdown was ""beginning to pay off"" but it was still a ""dangerous situation"". The UK recorded another 980 hospital deaths, bringing the total to 8,958. That death toll, which does not include those who died in care homes or the community, has now exceeded the worst daily figures seen in Italy and Spain. But England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, warned it was ""impossible to say we have peaked"", adding that the measures the country was taking with social distancing needed to continue. Live page: Global death toll tops 100,000 NHS doctor who pleaded for virus protection dies Can we 3D-print our way out of the PPE shortage? The total number of deaths worldwide has now passed 100,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University in the US. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said that some NHS and care workers were saying they were still struggling to get protective equipment and they felt unsafe, despite earlier pledges by the government. He asked if Mr Hancock was acknowledging the previous plans were insufficient. The health secretary responded that it had been an ""enormous challenge"", but that 742 million pieces of protective gear had been delivered so far. ""But there's clearly a huge task ahead to keep it flowing and to make sure that those who need it get it,"" he added. Mr Hancock also told the briefing that the protective equipment - such as masks, gloves and aprons - must be used only where it was most needed. ""There's enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is,"" he said. He also cautioned against using protective gear outside of health and social care settings, saying handwashing, social distancing and staying at home were the best ways for people to stay safe. ""A front door is better than any face mask,"" Mr Hancock said. Those looking after Covid-19 patients are themselves most at risk of catching the virus. Protective gear and testing are vital not only for protecting staff, but also for minimising the spread of Covid-19. There have been constant stories of doctors, nurses or care home staff not getting the protection they need. The government says it has been, in part, a logistical problem. Instead of supplying just over 200 hospital organisations with PPE they are now delivering to 58,000 separate organisations including pharmacies, care homes and GP surgeries. We are still not at the peak of the outbreak, despite some positive signs in the data. However, even if we pass the peak and cases start to fall it won't mean all restrictions can be lifted. The best estimate of the proportion of people infected (and potentially immune in the UK) is 4%. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable to the infection. So lifting the lockdown could lead to another surge in cases. Instead the government will have to decide which restrictions to lift, which to keep and what new strategies to introduce in order to suppress the virus. Mr Hancock said that because of ""huge international demand"" the UK was having to create a domestic manufacturing industry for protective equipment from scratch, as well as buying from abroad. He said Burberry had offered to make protective gowns, Rolls-Royce and McLaren were making visors and hand sanitiser was being made by drinks company Diageo and chemicals producer Ineos. Susan Masters, national director of nursing policy and practice at the Royal College of Nursing, said the amount of PPE being delivered would only be impressive ""when nursing staff stop contacting me to say what they need to use wasn't available"". ""The calls are still coming through - people are petrified. They have seen colleagues die already."" At the government's briefing, chief nursing officer Ruth May paid tribute to frontline staff who had died after contracting coronavirus. ""The NHS is a family and we feel their loss deeply,"" she said. Appealing to the public to continue observing the lockdown rules, she said it was ""frustrating"" for NHS staff to see people failing to observe the social distancing. ""It is enormously frustrating... there's also still occasions where my colleagues are getting abuse from their neighbours for driving off to work,"" she said. ""Our nurses, our healthcare staff, need to be able to get to work, it's right and proper they do, but my ask of everybody, please stay at home, save lives and protect my staff."" By Philippa Roxby, health reporter There is no hiding from the fact that today's announcement of 980 new UK deaths has surpassed Italy and Spain's worst days during this pandemic. Italy's highest death toll was 969; Spain's 950. While these two countries are now seeing daily death figures coming down, the UK's have been closing in on 1,000 for several days - and the true death toll is likely to be higher once deaths not yet reported have been added in. Yet the NHS has not been overwhelmed in the way that Italy's hospitals appeared to be, particularly in the north. The message is that the NHS has spare capacity and intensive care beds not yet used, thanks to planning and everyone's efforts to stay at home. There was even a plea from health officials that anyone with serious and worrying health problems of any kind should contact the NHS as usual. The hope is now that the UK's social distancing measures will have the same effect as Italy and Spain's lockdowns, and deaths will start to fall - not just slow down - in the weeks to come. Mr Hancock was challenged ona report in Health Service Journal,externalthat he had been failing to observe social distancing rules himself, holding regular video calls in his office surrounded by between 10 and 20 colleagues. Senior NHS leaders expressed alarm that the health secretary was providing a bad example, the report said. Mr Hancock insisted that he followed social distancing rules on the occasions when he had to come into the office. It comes after Housing Secretary Robert Jenrickdefended his travel movesfollowing reports he flouted the government's lockdown rules. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Mr Hancock also told the briefing 15 drive-through testing centres had been opened across the UK to enable all frontline NHS and social care staff to be screened for the virus. The 19,100 tests carried out in the last day still fall well short of thehealth secretary's target of 100,000 a day by the end of April. Can the UK do 100,000 coronavirus tests a day? But he said new ""Lighthouse mega-labs"" were on track in Cheshire and Glasgow, and another has opened in Milton Keynes. Pharmaceutical giants AstraZeneca and GSK were opening an additional testing facility in Cambridge, he added.

"PM taking short walks as virus care continuesThe prime minister thanks the NHS team looking after him for ""the incredible care he has received"".","The PM outside Downing Street before he was admitted to hospital Boris Johnson is taking short walks between periods of rest as part of the care he is receiving for coronavirus. The prime minister has also thanked the team looking after him for the ""incredible care"" he has received, a Downing Street spokesman said. Mr Johnson was taken to hospital on Sunday - 10 days after testing positive. Earlier on Friday, his father said Mr Johnson ""must rest up"" after he wasmoved from intensive care. Stanley Johnson spoke of his ""relief"" that his son had begun his recovery, adding that he thought his illness had ""got the whole country to realise this is a serious event"". The No 10 spokesman said: ""[Mr Johnson] has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received. ""His thoughts are with those affected by this terrible disease."" LIVE UPDATES: Christians face Good Friday on virus lockdown Earlier, the spokesman said the prime minister was back on a ward and ""in very good spirits"", emphasising that Mr Johnson was at an ""early stage"" of his recovery from coronavirus. NHS England has announced 866 more people have died in England after testing positive for coronavirus, and separate figures show there have been 48 more in Scotland,29 more in Walesand10 more in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, scientific adviser Prof Neil Ferguson, who was asked about coming out of lockdown, said it would likely ""be targeted by age, by geography"". Prof Ferguson, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that work to end the coronavirus lockdown in the UK was the ""number one topic and priority"" both in the scientific community and in government. ""Every waking minute, as it were,"" he said. Speaking about what measures might be needed to end the lockdown, Prof Ferguson said the UK would have to introduce larger levels of testing at community level ""to isolate cases more effectively"". However, he suggested the lockdown would have to remain in place for ""several more weeks"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for clarity about how long the prime minister will be ""out of action"". ""We need robust replacement arrangements in place and we need to know what they are, as soon as possible,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Meanwhile, the government has launched a campaign urging people to stay at home over the Easter Bank Holiday. It comes as Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick defended his travel moves amid reports he flouted lockdown rules. The MP for Newark in Nottinghamshire is said to have travelled from London to a second home in Herefordshire, and separately visited his parents in neighbouring Shropshire,according to the Daily Mail,externalandthe Guardian,external. The government has advised against travel to second homes - and urged people to distance themselves from elderly relatives. Easter warnings from police, parks and councils 15% find lockdown 'extremely difficult' - poll 'I'm in lockdown with my long-lost sister' Mr Jenrick said he had been in London on ministerial duties and left for what he said was a family home in Herefordshire to join his wife and children. He added that he visited his parents to deliver essentials, including medicines - allowed by the rules. Downing Street has defended Mr Jenrick, saying it was ""not an unnecessary journey"" for cabinet ministers commuting to and from London to rejoin their family. ""We're confident that he complied with the social distancing rules,"" a spokesman said. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said it was ""important for public confidence"" that Mr Jenrick explained the purpose of the journey. But he added that if the housing secretary had delivered medicine to his parents, ""clearly... it fits within the four exceptions"". Prof Paul Cosford, medical director for Public Health England, said government guidelines were ""quite clear"" that people must stay at home except in one of four circumstances, including exercise, essential shopping for food and medicines, healthcare and essential work. ""I can't comment on Mr Jenrick, it sounds as if what he did was within one of the four guidelines to me, but others will obviously have to think about that more,"" he told the Today programme. Asked about the government's lockdown exit strategy, Prof Cosford said he ""could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lifted sooner and some are lifted later"", but cautioned that there was still an ""awfully long way to go"". Meanwhile, the German army is donating 60 mobile ventilators to the NHS. There are currently 10,000 available in the UK and the government says 18,000 are needed. Thousands of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) suits for the UK are also scheduled to arrive at RAF Brize Norton later on Friday from Nato ally Turkey. At the government's daily briefing on Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who is standing in for Mr Johnson - acknowledged it was hard for people hoping to go out and be with their families over Easter, but urged restraint. Mr Raab was speaking ahead of a bank holiday weekend forecasted to see temperatures as high as 26C in London on Saturday, though cooler weather is expected on Sunday. He said lockdown restrictions will stay in place until evidence showed the UK had moved beyond the peak of the virus. The new campaign aims to reinforce the importance of staying at home over Easter Police forces across the UK have urged people to stay at home over the Easter weekend, with police in North Irelandwarning of increased patrols, and forces in Wales vowinga crackdown on unnecessary travel. Police Scotland officers will also be on patrolto explain the risks to public health of flouting guidance. Some forces and local authorities said they had already turned away would-be holidaymakers making journeys to popular destinations on Thursday. Downing Street has given its ""full backing"" to officers enforcing the lockdown rules. However, some forces have been criticised for their handling of the new measures. What powers do police have during the pandemic? On Friday morning, the Cambridge Police Twitter account posted a statement  to ""clarify"" officers were ""not monitoring"" what people are buying from supermarkets. An earlier post suggested officers were patrolling ""non-essential"" aisles at Tesco supermarket in Barhill. The force said the initial post, since deleted, was made by an ""over-exuberant"" officer. ""The force position, in line with national guidance, is that we are not monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets,""Cambridge Police tweeted,external. On Thursday, Northamptonshire's chief constable was criticised for sayinghe would not rule out road blocks or checking supermarket trolleys- later confirming that the force would not be judging people on what they are buying. This video can not be played Watch people around the UK clap for NHS workers on 9 April A number of Easter-themed government adverts will be running in newspapers and on social media urging people to stay at home during the holiday. A government spokesperson said: ""We understand that people will want to spend time with their friends and families this Easter, and we recognise that we are asking the public to make sacrifices in the fight against this disease. ""We are at a crucial moment in preventing further transmission of coronavirus, and so it is vital that we continue following the government's guidance.""

Oil producers agree to cut production by a tenth,"A global deal to cut oil production by more than 10% appears to be on track after the US promised to reduce supply. Mexico, which initially baulked at the scale of the cuts, said President Donald Trump had suggested the US might make cuts on behalf of its neighbour on Friday 10 April. Oil prices have been plunging due to coronavirus lockdowns. However the prospect of unprecedented cuts to supply failed to boost the oil price on Thursday. G20 oil ministers held talks on Friday to finalise the draft agreement, which would see cuts of 10 million barrels per day. ""This is a time for all nations to seriously examine what each can do to correct the supply/demand imbalance,"" said US Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette. America would ""take surplus off the market"" by storing ""as much oil as possible"", he added. Coronavirus: Oil prices surge on hopes of a price war truce Coronavirus: Oil price collapses to lowest level for 18 years Oil plunges in Asia as producers start price war Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the US would make 250,000 barrels per day in additional cuts to oil output, to help Mexico contribute to global reductions. Mr Lopez Obrador, who has made increasing oil output one of the priorities of his administration, said US President Donald Trump had spoken to him on Thursday and offered to help before Mexico announced it would cut output by 100,000 barrels per day. ""President Trump said the United States committed to reducing by 250,000 (barrels), on top of what it was going to do, for Mexico, in order to compensate,"" he said. Opec+, which includes Russia, had said it would cut production in May and June by 10 million barrels a day to help prop up prices. The cuts will then be eased gradually until April 2022. However,a final agreement was dependent on Mexico signing up, after it questioned the level of production cuts it was asked to make,Reuters had reported,external. Oil prices have recently slumped as the coronavirus pandemic has grounded planes, halted travel and put a brake on industry across the world. That coincided with a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, further pushing down the price of crude. On Thursday, the Opec producers' organisation and its allies reached a tentative agreement to cut production by about 10% compared to what was being produced before the crisis. Another 5 million barrels is expected to be cut by other oil exporting countries. Opec said the cuts would be eased to eight million barrels a day between July and December. They would later be eased again to six million barrels from January 2021. Nevertheless, Brent crude closed down by 4% at $31.48 a barrel on Thursday as the agreement began to take shape. Despite the scale of the cuts agreed, they are unlikely to compensate for the sharp fall in demand for oil. A conference call is taking place on Friday between energy ministers from the G20 who will be hoping to finalise the agreement. It will be hosted by Saudi Arabia. Opec secretary-general Mohammed Barkindo called for action for the oil industry to combat the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday he said: ""There is a grizzly shadow hanging over all of us. We do not want this shadow to envelope us. It will have a crushing and long-term impact on the entire industry."" The global coronavirus pandemic hit demand for oil in March as restrictions on business and consumer activity were introduced in dozens of countries in quick succession. Crude had already fallen to just over $31 (Â£24.90; â¬28.30) a barrel at the start of the month afterSaudi Arabia failed to convince Russia to back production cutsthat had previously been agreed with the other members of  Opec. By the end of Marchcrude had fallen to $22.58, its lowest price in 18 years. Some analysts have questioned whether any agreed cuts would succeed in boosting the price of oil, given the prospect of a sharp and possibly prolonged global economic downturn, as the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organisation have warned. If it does remain subdued, lower prices on the wholesale oil market could lead to cheaper production costs of some materials, such as plastic. That would potentially be reflected in prices of everyday consumer goods. However, producer countries will see sharp reductions in revenue. This story was originally published on Thursday 9 April, but has been updated to correct a factual error.

'Herculean effort' to ensure PPE for front line,"This video can not be played ""We're getting the PPE out there but there's clearly a huge task ahead to keep it flowing"" The UK will now ensure daily deliveries of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline workers, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told the daily coronavirus briefing it had been a ""Herculean effort"", after criticism the government was not doing enough to protect critical NHS staff. Officials told the briefing the lockdown was ""beginning to pay off"" but it was still a ""dangerous situation"". The UK recorded another 980 hospital deaths, bringing the total to 8,958. That death toll, which does not include those who died in care homes or the community, has now exceeded the worst daily figures seen in Italy and Spain. But England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, warned it was ""impossible to say we have peaked"", adding that the measures the country was taking with social distancing needed to continue. Live page: Global death toll tops 100,000 NHS doctor who pleaded for virus protection dies Can we 3D-print our way out of the PPE shortage? The total number of deaths worldwide has now passed 100,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University in the US. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said that some NHS and care workers were saying they were still struggling to get protective equipment and they felt unsafe, despite earlier pledges by the government. He asked if Mr Hancock was acknowledging the previous plans were insufficient. The health secretary responded that it had been an ""enormous challenge"", but that 742 million pieces of protective gear had been delivered so far. ""But there's clearly a huge task ahead to keep it flowing and to make sure that those who need it get it,"" he added. Mr Hancock also told the briefing that the protective equipment - such as masks, gloves and aprons - must be used only where it was most needed. ""There's enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is,"" he said. He also cautioned against using protective gear outside of health and social care settings, saying handwashing, social distancing and staying at home were the best ways for people to stay safe. ""A front door is better than any face mask,"" Mr Hancock said. Those looking after Covid-19 patients are themselves most at risk of catching the virus. Protective gear and testing are vital not only for protecting staff, but also for minimising the spread of Covid-19. There have been constant stories of doctors, nurses or care home staff not getting the protection they need. The government says it has been, in part, a logistical problem. Instead of supplying just over 200 hospital organisations with PPE they are now delivering to 58,000 separate organisations including pharmacies, care homes and GP surgeries. We are still not at the peak of the outbreak, despite some positive signs in the data. However, even if we pass the peak and cases start to fall it won't mean all restrictions can be lifted. The best estimate of the proportion of people infected (and potentially immune in the UK) is 4%. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable to the infection. So lifting the lockdown could lead to another surge in cases. Instead the government will have to decide which restrictions to lift, which to keep and what new strategies to introduce in order to suppress the virus. Mr Hancock said that because of ""huge international demand"" the UK was having to create a domestic manufacturing industry for protective equipment from scratch, as well as buying from abroad. He said Burberry had offered to make protective gowns, Rolls-Royce and McLaren were making visors and hand sanitiser was being made by drinks company Diageo and chemicals producer Ineos. Susan Masters, national director of nursing policy and practice at the Royal College of Nursing, said the amount of PPE being delivered would only be impressive ""when nursing staff stop contacting me to say what they need to use wasn't available"". ""The calls are still coming through - people are petrified. They have seen colleagues die already."" At the government's briefing, chief nursing officer Ruth May paid tribute to frontline staff who had died after contracting coronavirus. ""The NHS is a family and we feel their loss deeply,"" she said. Appealing to the public to continue observing the lockdown rules, she said it was ""frustrating"" for NHS staff to see people failing to observe the social distancing. ""It is enormously frustrating... there's also still occasions where my colleagues are getting abuse from their neighbours for driving off to work,"" she said. ""Our nurses, our healthcare staff, need to be able to get to work, it's right and proper they do, but my ask of everybody, please stay at home, save lives and protect my staff."" By Philippa Roxby, health reporter There is no hiding from the fact that today's announcement of 980 new UK deaths has surpassed Italy and Spain's worst days during this pandemic. Italy's highest death toll was 969; Spain's 950. While these two countries are now seeing daily death figures coming down, the UK's have been closing in on 1,000 for several days - and the true death toll is likely to be higher once deaths not yet reported have been added in. Yet the NHS has not been overwhelmed in the way that Italy's hospitals appeared to be, particularly in the north. The message is that the NHS has spare capacity and intensive care beds not yet used, thanks to planning and everyone's efforts to stay at home. There was even a plea from health officials that anyone with serious and worrying health problems of any kind should contact the NHS as usual. The hope is now that the UK's social distancing measures will have the same effect as Italy and Spain's lockdowns, and deaths will start to fall - not just slow down - in the weeks to come. Mr Hancock was challenged ona report in Health Service Journal,externalthat he had been failing to observe social distancing rules himself, holding regular video calls in his office surrounded by between 10 and 20 colleagues. Senior NHS leaders expressed alarm that the health secretary was providing a bad example, the report said. Mr Hancock insisted that he followed social distancing rules on the occasions when he had to come into the office. It comes after Housing Secretary Robert Jenrickdefended his travel movesfollowing reports he flouted the government's lockdown rules. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Mr Hancock also told the briefing 15 drive-through testing centres had been opened across the UK to enable all frontline NHS and social care staff to be screened for the virus. The 19,100 tests carried out in the last day still fall well short of thehealth secretary's target of 100,000 a day by the end of April. Can the UK do 100,000 coronavirus tests a day? But he said new ""Lighthouse mega-labs"" were on track in Cheshire and Glasgow, and another has opened in Milton Keynes. Pharmaceutical giants AstraZeneca and GSK were opening an additional testing facility in Cambridge, he added. The government also announced new Nightingale temporary hospitals to be opened, with 460 beds in Washington, Tyne and Wear, and a smaller facility in Exeter. It brings the total number to seven, with units in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol and Harrogate as well.

Public reassured over lockdown policing rulesNo 10 says people can buy what they like from shops which remain open - and use their gardens as they wish.,"Police have been patrolling near supermarkets to ensure social distancing rules are followed Downing Street says people can buy whatever they want from shops that remain open amid concerns some police are overstepping lockdown powers. There have been cases of police warning shoppers against buying ""non-essential"" items. No 10 also said people can use their gardens as they wish, after a video showed police confronting a family for letting their children play outside. Meanwhile, the PM has been up and walking as his recovery continues. Downing Street said Boris Johnson, who was discharged from intensive care to a hospital ward on Thursday night, ""has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery"". The spokesman said Mr Johnson had spoken to his doctors and thanked ""the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received"". The number of people who have died in UK hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus has now reached 8,958, a record increase of 980 on Thursday. LIVE UPDATES: Christians face Good Friday on virus lockdown What can the police fine you for doing? Easter warnings from police, parks and councils Asked about suggestions that police were patrolling the supermarket aisles to see what people were buying, Downing Street said people were allowed to buy whatever they wanted from shops permitted to be open. ""We set out a list of shops which could remain open and if the shops are on that list then they are free to sell whatever they have in stock,"" the prime minister's official spokesman said. Police in Cambridge had to clarify a social media post - since deleted - by an ""over-exuberant"" officer who suggested they were monitoring aisles of ""non-essential"" goods in supermarkets. ""The force position, in line with national guidance, is that we are not monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets,""they said,external. On Thursday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said it was ""not appropriate"" for police to be checking people's supermarket trolleys afterNorthamptonshire Police threatened to introduce the measures. Chief Constable Nick Adderley said the force would consider roadblocks and searches of people's shopping if the public did not follow the rules. He later called his remarks ""clumsy"". With South Yorkshire Police also having apologised for a ""well-intentioned but ill-informed"" officer whotold a family not to play in their own front garden,external, Downing Street said people could use their gardens as they choose - as long as they are with members of their household. The government is seeking to reassure the public about the lockdown rules as it stresses the measures are working to reduce the spread of infection and the number of people admitted to hospital. Newly-elected Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to be transparent over its lockdown strategy and to clarify how long Mr Johnson will be ""out of action"". ""We need robust replacement arrangements in place and we need to know what they are, as soon as possible,"" he said. On Friday morning, the prime minister's father,Stanley Johnson, said there would have to be a ""period of adjustment""before his son returned to work. Earlier, individual nations reported their own coronavirus death figures, which are calculated using a different timeframe to the UK-wide figures.

Whoâs in charge if the PM is ill?,"Foreign SecretaryDominic Raabsaid he had ""all the authority"" he needed to make relevant decisions, as he deputised for Boris Johnson while he was in hospital with coronavirus. The prime minister,who has paid tribute to the NHS staff who cared for him, is now recovering at Chequers, and is not expected to return to work for some time. So who else shares power and how are decisions made while the prime minister is ill? Mr Raab is the foreign secretary, but he also has the title offirst secretary of state,external- giving him seniority above all other cabinet ministers. So if Mr Johnson did not return to his post, Mr Raab would take over in the first instance. When Mr Johnson was moved into intensive care, Mr Raab said the government would continue to focus ""at the prime minister's direction"" on defeating coronavirus. The role of deputy prime minister - like that of first secretary of state - is not a permanent position in government. Someone is appointed at the discretion of the prime minister. The last deputy PM was Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, during the 2010-15 coalition government with the Conservatives. Although Mr Raab was first asked to deputise for the PM while he was in intensive care, we know very little about the exact extent of his authority. There are various things only the prime minister can do - but some of these could be taken up by Mr Raab without much trouble. For example, he could make recommendations to the Queen on appointments to the senior judiciary and high-ranking positions in the Church of England. But it's harder to imagine him conducting a reshuffle - even though, formally, it seems he ought to have that power. It would be tricky for him to authorise military action at short notice. Other ministers would most likely have to agree first, but the buck would stop with Mr Raab. Then, there are theletters of last resort the prime minister writesfor nuclear submarines, giving commanding officers instructions about what to do in the event of a deadly attack. It's unlikely Mr Raab would have to write them unless Mr Johnson was incapacitated for a long time. When asked if his role let him take decisions, Mr Raab said there was ""total unity"" among his cabinet colleagues and referred to the system of collective responsibility. It means that in practice, any major decisions will probably be taken by Mr Raab in consultation with the cabinet or, where appropriate, senior civil servants. The cabinet is the ultimate decision-making body of government, made up of the most senior ministers including the home secretary, the health secretary and the chancellor of the exchequer. After February's general election, Boris Johnsonformed a cabinetof 22 full members - including himself - and four other attending members. So although he's the head of the government and has some individual powers, most important decisions are taken collectively in cabinet. And the principle of ""collective responsibility"" means each cabinet decision is binding for each member - even if they personally disagreed with it. Not all decisions are taken by full cabinet. It's normal for there to be ""cabinet committees"" - smaller groups of ministers focused on specific issues. There are four ""implementation committees"" working on different parts of the response. They're looking at healthcare, the public sector response, economics and business, and the international response. Each is chaired by a cabinet minister and feeding into a daily overarching ""C-19 meeting"" - led in the prime minister's absence by Dominic Raab. Power is no protection from harm If Boris Johnson wasn't able to continue as PM, the rules for what should happen next are unclear - a consequence of the UK's unwritten constitution. But we do have some idea of what might happen. Thecabinet manual,externalis the closest thing we have to a document which sets out the role of the prime minister. It suggests the cabinet would select a replacement who the Queen would ask to form a government. That could be Mr Raab or another senior MP. The expectation is that he or she would be in place until the Conservative Party appointed a new leader. According to the Institute for Government think tank, prime ministers continue in office unless they resign or die. It adds: ""While political parties usually have the ability to appoint an 'acting leader' if the leader resigns or is incapacitated, there is no formal 'acting prime minister' role. He or she would be prime minister until they chose to resign or if their cabinet forced them out."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Prof Ferguson, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that work to end the coronavirus lockdown in the UK was the ""number one topic and priority"" both in the scientific community and in government. ""Every waking minute, as it were,"" he said. Speaking about what measures might be needed to end the lockdown, Prof Ferguson said the UK would have to introduce larger levels of testing at community level ""to isolate cases more effectively"". However, he suggested the lockdown would have to remain in place for ""several more weeks"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for clarity about how long the prime minister will be ""out of action"". ""We need robust replacement arrangements in place and we need to know what they are, as soon as possible,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Meanwhile, the government has launched a campaign urging people to stay at home over the Easter Bank Holiday. It comes as Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick defended his travel moves amid reports he flouted lockdown rules. The MP for Newark in Nottinghamshire is said to have travelled from London to a second home in Herefordshire, and separately visited his parents in neighbouring Shropshire,according to the Daily Mail,externalandthe Guardian,external. The government has advised against travel to second homes - and urged people to distance themselves from elderly relatives. Easter warnings from police, parks and councils 15% find lockdown 'extremely difficult' - poll 'I'm in lockdown with my long-lost sister' Mr Jenrick said he had been in London on ministerial duties and left for what he said was a family home in Herefordshire to join his wife and children. He added that he visited his parents to deliver essentials, including medicines - allowed by the rules. Downing Street has defended Mr Jenrick, saying it was ""not an unnecessary journey"" for cabinet ministers commuting to and from London to rejoin their family. ""We're confident that he complied with the social distancing rules,"" a spokesman said. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said it was ""important for public confidence"" that Mr Jenrick explained the purpose of the journey. But he added that if the housing secretary had delivered medicine to his parents, ""clearly... it fits within the four exceptions"". Prof Paul Cosford, medical director for Public Health England, said government guidelines were ""quite clear"" that people must stay at home except in one of four circumstances, including exercise, essential shopping for food and medicines, healthcare and essential work. ""I can't comment on Mr Jenrick, it sounds as if what he did was within one of the four guidelines to me, but others will obviously have to think about that more,"" he told the Today programme. Asked about the government's lockdown exit strategy, Prof Cosford said he ""could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lifted sooner and some are lifted later"", but cautioned that there was still an ""awfully long way to go"". Meanwhile, the German army is donating 60 mobile ventilators to the NHS. There are currently 10,000 available in the UK and the government says 18,000 are needed. Thousands of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) suits for the UK are also scheduled to arrive at RAF Brize Norton later on Friday from Nato ally Turkey. At the government's daily briefing on Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who is standing in for Mr Johnson - acknowledged it was hard for people hoping to go out and be with their families over Easter, but urged restraint. Mr Raab was speaking ahead of a bank holiday weekend forecasted to see temperatures as high as 26C in London on Saturday, though cooler weather is expected on Sunday. He said lockdown restrictions will stay in place until evidence showed the UK had moved beyond the peak of the virus. The new campaign aims to reinforce the importance of staying at home over Easter Police forces across the UK have urged people to stay at home over the Easter weekend, with police in North Irelandwarning of increased patrols, and forces in Wales vowinga crackdown on unnecessary travel. Police Scotland officers will also be on patrolto explain the risks to public health of flouting guidance. Some forces and local authorities said they had already turned away would-be holidaymakers making journeys to popular destinations on Thursday. Downing Street has given its ""full backing"" to officers enforcing the lockdown rules. However, some forces have been criticised for their handling of the new measures. What powers do police have during the pandemic? On Friday morning, the Cambridge Police Twitter account posted a statement  to ""clarify"" officers were ""not monitoring"" what people are buying from supermarkets. An earlier post suggested officers were patrolling ""non-essential"" aisles at Tesco supermarket in Barhill. The force said the initial post, since deleted, was made by an ""over-exuberant"" officer. ""The force position, in line with national guidance, is that we are not monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets,""Cambridge Police tweeted,external. On Thursday, Northamptonshire's chief constable was criticised for sayinghe would not rule out road blocks or checking supermarket trolleys- later confirming that the force would not be judging people on what they are buying. This video can not be played Watch people around the UK clap for NHS workers on 9 April A number of Easter-themed government adverts will be running in newspapers and on social media urging people to stay at home during the holiday. A government spokesperson said: ""We understand that people will want to spend time with their friends and families this Easter, and we recognise that we are asking the public to make sacrifices in the fight against this disease. ""We are at a crucial moment in preventing further transmission of coronavirus, and so it is vital that we continue following the government's guidance.""

Universities warn of going bust without extra cashUniversities call for Â£2bn bail out to survive the cash pressures of the coronavirus pandemic.Family & Education,"Universities face uncertainty over student numbers during the coronavirus outbreak Universities across the UK are calling for emergency funding of at least Â£2bn, warning some institutions will go bust without it. Universities UK says the coronavirus pandemic is threatening to sharply cut overseas student numbers and put universities in financial danger. They are asking for controls on student numbers in each university, to keep fee income at similar levels to last year. Universities are promising to honour any offers already made to students. ""Without government support, some universities would face financial failure, others would come close to financial failure and be forced to reduce provision,"" says a letter from higher education leaders to ministers across the UK. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, says the proposals would help universities to ""weather the very serious financial challenges posed by Covid-19"". University numbers could face emergency controls Students angry at being charged rent when not in rooms next term Universities told to stop unconditional offers in coronavirus confusion He says academic researchers have made a ""huge contribution"" to tackling the coronavirus pandemic - and their expertise will be needed in the ""recovery of the economy and communities following the crisis"".Â They are calling for an extra Â£2bn in research funding and on top of that to provide emergency loans for universities that faced ""significant income losses"". ""Targeted support"" should be available to protect strategically important subjects such as science and medicine, say the industry leaders. This would be in response to cash pressures from the pandemic: Universities receive almost Â£7bn in fees from overseas students - and there are fears that their numbers could be much reduced this autumn The university sector says it has already lost Â£790m in cancelled business activities, such as conferences, catering and student accommodation There is also uncertainty about whether campuses will be able to re-open in the autumn and whether many UK students will defer entry this year There have been warnings of unprecedented ""volatility"" in this year's admissions - which, if left unchecked, could see some universities expanding but others left with too few students to be financially viable.

Universities are calling for controls on the number of students each institution can recruit this year In response, Universities UK is asking for controls on the number of students each university in England and Wales can recruit this year, keeping them to levels expected before the coronavirus outbreak, to stop financially unsustainable swings in numbers. The scale of concern was suggested in an internal email from a Russell Group university seen by the BBC this week, which warned the university could lose a quarter of its income next year. The letter from Universities UK to ministers says that to provide ""stability"" for students currently applying, all offers already made would have to be honoured if students made the required grade. There is also a call to push back by a year the point at which European Union students are categorised as overseas students, when they will face higher fees and visa restrictions.

New York digging mass graves amid virus outbreak,"This video can not be played Drone footage shows mass burials in New York Images have emerged of coffins being buried in a mass grave in New York City, as the death toll from the coronavirus continues to rise. Workers in hazmat outfits were seen stacking wooden coffins in deep trenches in Hart Island. Officials say burials are being ramped up at site, which has long been used for people with no next-of-kin or families who cannot afford a funeral. New York state now has more coronavirus cases than any single country. The state's confirmed caseload of Covid-19 is nearly 162,000, of whom 7,844 have died. Spain has recorded about 157,000 cases and Italy 143,600, while China, where the virus emerged last year, has nearly 83,000 cases. The US as a whole has recorded 467,000 cases and about 16,700 deaths. Globally there are 1.6 million cases and 97,000 deaths. About 40 bodies were buried on Thursday The drone footage comes from Hart Island, off the Bronx in Long Island Sound, which has been used for more than 150 years by city officials as a mass burial site for those withno next-of-kin, or families who cannot afford funerals. Normally, about 25 bodies a week are interred on the island, according to the Associated Press news agency. But burial operations have increased from one day a week to five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, said Department of Correction spokesman Jason Kersten. One virus, two Americas Four out of five jobs affected by virus globally Prisoners from Rikers Island, the city's main jail complex, usually do the job, but the rising workload has recently been taken over by contractors. It is not clear how many of the dead have no next-of-kin or could not afford a funeral. However, the city has cut the amount of time it will hold unclaimed remains amid pressure on morgue space. New York City Mayor Bill de BlasioÂ indicated earlier this week that ""temporary burials"" might be necessary until the crisis had passed.Â ""Obviously the place we have used historically is Hart Island,"" he said. By Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York The coronavirus has changed everything about life, and now it's upending the rituals of death. New Yorkers have been shocked by the grim scenes: ambulances constantly blaring down eerily deserted streets, body bags being forklifted into refrigerated trucks outside hospitals and now new trenches being dug on Hart's Island for possible mass burials. The remote cemetery, accessible only by boat, is a place regarded historically with sorrow because of its mass graves with no tombstones, just unclaimed bodies. The city's morgues can only handle so much before temporary burials for Covid-19 victims, once an absolute worst-case scenario, become necessary. Funeral directors talk openly about how scared and depressed the spiking death toll has left them. Even before this week's record number of deaths, some families have had to wait a week or more to bury and cremate their loved ones. The daily rise in coronavirus deaths announced in New York state on Friday was 777 - down slightly from the record high of 799 the day before. Governor Andrew Cuomo said he took ""solace"" from this fact, as well as the continued decline in the number of Covid-19 patients admitted to New York hospitals. He said the state was succeeding in ""flattening the curve"" but was still enduring ""great pain"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health On Thursday, another glimmer of hope was heralded as official projections for the nationwide death toll were lowered. Dr Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House's coronavirus task force, told NBC News' Today show the final number of Americans who would die from Covid-19 in the outbreak ""looks more like 60,000"". In late March, Dr Fauci estimated ""between 100,000 and 200,000"" could die. Mourners attend a funeral in Brooklyn, New York, as the city's coronavirus death toll hit a record high for a third day The 60,000 projection would match the upper estimate for total flu deaths in the US between October 2019 to March 2020,according to government data,external. But Vice-President Mike Pence stressed on Thursday that Covid-19 was about three times as contagious as influenza. Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Global economy will suffer for 'years to come' The White House has previously touted estimates that 2.2 million Americans could die from coronavirus if nothing was done to stop its spread. Stay-at-home orders have in the meantime closed non-essential businesses in 42 states, while drastically slowing the US economy. New data on Thursday showedunemployment claims had topped 6 millionfor the second week in a row, bringing the number of Americans out of work over the last three weeks to 16.8 million. Chicago, meanwhile, imposed a curfew on alcohol sales from 21:00 local time on Thursday to stop the persistent violation of a ban on large gatherings.

Are minorities being hit hardest by coronavirus? Figures from Louisiana, Mississippi, Michigan, Wisconsin and New York reflect the same racial disparity in coronavirus infections. Presumptive Democratic White House nominee Joe Biden joined growing calls on Thursday for the release of comprehensive racial data on the pandemic.

'I'm in lockdown with my long-lost sister'Sue Bremner and Margaret Hannay had only met once before they ended up in coronavirus lockdown together.UK,"This video can not be played Long-lost sisters Margaret and Sue are enjoying the chance to get to know each other ""The lockdown has been an absolutely fantastic silver lining for us. It's given us an opportunity to make up for lost time."" Sue Bremner and her husband David, from Shropshire, are stranded in New Zealand due to the coronoavirus pandemic. But it's given Sue the chance to get to know her long-lost sister Margaret Hannay - who she didn't know existed for more than 40 years. Margaret, 71, was given up for adoption at two weeks old by her mum, who had a short relationship with Sue's dad in 1948. It was only last year that the sisters met for the first time after Margaret - who lives in Auckland - got in touch with Sue in the UK. Sue, 65, and her husband went out to see her sister again as part of a two-month trip across New Zealand and Australia on 5 March. But two weeks later,the country went into lockdownand they couldn't get back to the UK.  So Sue has been able to spend some extra time with Margaret and her husband, John. ""We've been having a wonderful time here,"" says Sue, who lives in Ludlow. ""We've been spending lots of time together drinking wine and cooking and having fun."" Margaret says she now calls her sister the ""Sue-chef"" ""We haven't killed each other yet,"" Margaret laughs. ""It's been great. It's really hard, as you probably know, to share a kitchen with someone. But we seem to manage, everything works."" Sue found out she had an older sister in 2000 when her dad told her that he'd had a child with another woman before he'd met her mum. ""My dad asked me would I try to find Margaret because he wanted her to know there's never been a day gone past when he hadn't thought about the child that had been adopted. ""He was very regretful that somebody had been brought into the world and he didn't know them and he wanted to apologise for that."" Sue gave her details to the General Register Office - which holds records of births and deaths - and searched on social media and ancestry websites. She was told she wouldn't be able to find out any information about her sister unless Margaret got in touch saying she wanted to be found. Margaret (second left) met up with her siblings John (far left), Sue and Lawrence (far right) for the first time last year Margaret, who moved to New Zealand 45 years ago, always knew she was adopted but didn't really have any desire to track down her birth parents. But last year, she told her daughter she had started to wonder whether she had any siblings. She then got in touch with the General Register Office and within two weeks they got back to her to say she had a sister - giving her Sue's contact details. ""I was sitting there in bed with my first morning cup of tea with John snoring next to me and I opened this email and I was like, 'Oh I've got a sister',"" says Margaret. ""So when he woke up he found me sitting in bed with my cup of tea sobbing. When I told him he was delighted as he has two older brothers. I always wanted to have brothers and sisters but I never did."" Sue says it was ""amazing"" when she got an email from Margaret introducing herself - but unfortunately their dad had died before they were reunited. ""Receiving that email was like winning the pools. I would've loved to have told my dad but I just kind of feel he's inside me and he knew it was happening."" Margaret and Sue spoke to the BBC on FaceTime from Auckland Margaret and Sue also have two brothers - Lawrence and John Connell - and all four siblings met up for the first time in the UK last year. ""It was a great opportunity for all of a sudden meet the rest of family to see how we all got on,"" says Margaret. ""Since we've known each other we've found so many similarities it's uncanny."" Sue and Margaret say they both like weak coffee and they suffer from ""wobbly knees"".

Singapore teachers ditch Zoom after 'lewd' hijackA secondary school home-based geography lesson in Singapore was hijacked by two men.,"Zoom has recently gone from 10m users a day to 200m Singapore has suspended the use of video-conferencing tool Zoom by its teachers, after a ""very serious incident"" during a home-based lesson. Singapore closed its schools on Wednesday in response to arising number of coronavirus cases. But one mothertold local media,externalthat, during her daughter's geography lesson, obscene images appeared on screen, before two men asked girls to ""flash"". Zoom told the BBC the company was ""deeply upset"" about the incidents. Zoom recently changed its default settings for home-based learning, and issued a guide for teachers to secure their ""virtual classrooms"". Parents told local media the incidents happened in a geography class for first-year secondary school pupils. About 39 children were in the class when the stream was hacked, before ""two Caucasian men"" appeared and made lewd comments. The class was stopped immediately. ""Home-based learning is supposed to be a safe space,"" one parenttold the Straits Times.,external""I know it's difficult to manage but as a parent I feel very concerned."" It's not known how the hackers gained access. Zoom meetings have nine-digit IDs and can, in theory, be joined by any user if they are not protected by the organiser. ""These are very serious incidents,"" said Aaron Loh of the government's educational technology division. ""The Ministry of Education is currently investigating both breaches and will lodge a police report if warranted. ""As a precautionary measure, our teachers will suspend their use of Zoom until these security issues are ironed out.""

Easter egg shoppers turn to online amid lockdown,"Upmarket chocolate retailer Hotel Chocolat closed all its UK stores three weeks ago. The firm was forced to ""turn on a sixpence"" reorganising the warehouse to make it safe for staff. But it has paid off. ""As it turns out, we've sold more Easter eggs than last year,"" says boss Angus Thirlwell. Online sales of Easter eggs are surging as UK consumers turn to the internet during the coronavirus lockdown. Thorntons too said it had seen ""a significant increase in online orders"" since the lockdown started. ""Demand is four times higher than average - and we have received approximately one million visitors to our site this week,"" they added. Easter is big business in Britain. In 2019, consumers spent Â£1.1bn on buying items to celebrate the festival, according to research firm Mintel, with Â£206m of that spent on Easter eggs alone. But with the coronavirus lockdown preventing families and friends from meeting up to celebrate and Easter egg hunt activities cancelled, the usual opportunities for buying and sharing the traditional treats are limited. Thorntons opens its website for just two hours each days to accept new customer orders Facing the surge in online traffic, Thorntons has decided to open its website at 09:00 each day for just one or two hours for customer orders, before closing it again. Hotel Chocolat is taking a different approach. Rather than have its staff waste time searching for products in the warehouse to fulfil orders, the chocolate maker has reduced the range of products that people can purchase online. Instead, the retailer has created themed bundles and pre-packs the items into boxes the moment they come off the production line. ""We've created 30 new products from scratch,"" said Mr Thirlwell, adding that customers had been much less demanding about their packages during the lockdown than they would typically be. In contrast, aisles fully stocked with Easter eggs have been widely discounted in supermarkets across the UK in the last two weeks, which is unusual for the run-up to the Easter holiday weekend. In Tesco, almost all branded Easter eggs are selling on two-for-one deals, while Sainsbury's lifted its three-item limit per customer on Easter eggs several days beforeit eased restrictions on other food products. Supermarkets have been heavily discounting Easter eggs in stores The BBC asked Tesco and Sainsbury's about their Easter egg sales, but the supermarkets declined to comment. Chocolate manufacturer Kinnerton Confectionery makes many of the branded Easter eggs sold in these supermarkets, and it too has seen demand move online. ""With travel restrictions extending over Easter, consumers have turned to order Easter eggs online for home delivery to their loved ones,"" Julia Catton, marketing and innovation director at Zertus UK, the parent company for Kinnerton Confectionery and several other chocolate brands, told the BBC. ""Some of our major customers have increased their online range to help customers, but this has been further hampered bylimitation of home delivery slots in many retailers."" Stay at home over Easter to stop virus, public told Tesco tells people to visit stores to get food Flour mills working 'round the clock' to meet demand Kinnerton itself set up a new online shop to allow customers of its Nomo vegan and ""free-from"" chocolate range to make direct orders if they couldn't get the products from supermarkets. However, according to US market research firm IRI, overall Easter confectionery sales for the week ending 28 March were down 17% year-on-year. Ms Catton added: ""The next few days will be important for Easter egg sales to see if demand improves."" Other analysts also feel that there will be a significant impact on Easter spending, and that not everyone is buying Easter eggs. Independent retail expert Kate Hardcastle says consumers will have to decide between the must-haves and nice-to-haves: ""It's just not front-of-mind focus for anyone, and it's also an extra cost for a lot of families they just can't afford."" Mintel is running a weekly survey tracking the impacts of coronavirus on consumer spending in the UK. It says that in the last week, almost a quarter of British consumers increased the shopping they are doing online. But in the last seven days, it also found that 46% of consumers have cut back on non-essential spending. Despite this, Hotel Chocolat's Angus Thirlwell says that his business is seeing consumer behaviour it's never seen before in its 27-year-history. ""There's a lot of people using online food shopping for the first time. People are asking for help in making orders on the online chat and calling customer service,"" he said. Hotel Chocolat is also seeing customer messages that show a shift in consumer habits, says Mr Thirlwell: ""We're seeing messages like, 'Here's something to keep your strength up', or 'Thinking of you', sent to key workers, and families saying 'Here's some chocolate so we can FaceTime eating chocolate together'. ""Chocolate does play an important part in keeping morale up.""

New York has more virus cases than any country,"Mourners attend a funeral in Brooklyn, New York, as the city's coronavirus death toll hit a record high for a third day New York state now has more coronavirus cases than any single country outside the US, according to latest figures. The state's confirmed caseload of Covid-19 jumped by 10,000 on Thursday to 159,937, placing it ahead of Spain (153,000 cases) and Italy (143,000). China, where the virus emerged last year, has reported 82,000 cases. The US as a whole has recorded 462,000 cases and nearly 16,500 deaths. Globally there are 1.6 million cases and 95,000 deaths. While New York state leads the world in coronavirus cases, its death toll (7,000) lags behind Spain (15,500) and Italy (18,000), though it is more than double the official figure from China (3,300). Photos have emerged of workers in hazmat outfits burying coffins in a mass grave in New York City. About 40 coffins were buried on Thursday Drone footage showed workers using a ladder to descend into the huge pit where the caskets were stacked. The images were taken at Hart Island, off the Bronx, which has been used for more than 150 years by city officials as a mass burial site for those with no next-of-kin, or families who cannot afford funerals. Burial operations at the site have ramped up amid the pandemic from one day a week to five days a week, according to the Department of Corrections. Prisoners from Rikers Island usually do the job, but the rising workload has recently been taken over by contractors. New York City Mayor Bill de BlasioÂ indicated earlier this week the city's public cemetery might be used for burials during the pandemic.Â ""Obviously the place we have used historically is Hart Island,"" he said. This video can not be played Is it too soon for a thriller movie on coronavirus? The number of coronavirus deaths in New York state increased to 799 on Wednesday, a record high for a third day. But Governor Andrew Cuomo took heart from the fact that the number of Covid-19 patients admitted to New York hospitals dropped for a second day, to 200. He said it was a sign social distancing was working. He called the outbreak a ""silent explosion that ripples through society with the same randomness, the same evil that we saw on 9/11"". Another glimmer of hope was heralded on Thursday as official projections for the nationwide death toll were lowered. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

In late March, Dr Fauci estimated ""between 100,000 and 200,000"" could die. The 60,000 projection would match the upper estimate for total flu deaths in the US between October 2019 to March 2020,according to government data,external. But Vice-President Mike Pence stressed on Thursday that Covid-19 is about three times as contagious as influenza. One virus, two Americas Four out of five jobs affected by virus globally Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Global economy will suffer for 'years to come' The White House has previously touted estimates that 2.2 million Americans could die from coronavirus if nothing was done to stop its spread. Stay-at-home orders have in the meantime closed non-essential businesses in 42 states, while drastically slowing the US economy. New data on Thursday showedunemployment claims topped 6 millionfor the second week in a row, bringing the number of Americans out of work over the last three weeks to 16.8 million. Chicago meanwhile imposed a curfew on liquor sales from 21:00 local time on Thursday to stop the persistent violation of a ban on large gatherings. This video can not be played How caravans are helping frontline medics with a place to stay The measure, due to remain in place until 30 April, comes after health officials this week said black Chicagoans account for half of all the Illinois city's coronavirus cases and more than 70% of its deaths, despite making up just 30% of the population. ""We are putting this curfew in place because too many individuals and businesses have been violating the stay-at-home order,"" said Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Wednesday. Gun violence in Chicago on Tuesday left seven dead and 14 injured, which city officials said was unforgivable given the virus crisis. ""Every one of those ER beds taken up by a gunshot victim could be somebody's grandmother, somebody with pre-existing conditions, somebody that is in danger of losing their lives because of the pandemic,"" Supt Charlie Beck said.Â This video can not be played âI just had a baby - now Iâm going to the frontline.â Figures from Louisiana, Mississippi, Michigan, Wisconsin and New York reflect the same racial disparity in coronavirus infections. Presumptive Democratic White House nominee Joe Biden joined growing calls on Thursday for the release of comprehensive racial data on the pandemic. He said it had cast a spotlight on inequity and the impact of ""structural racism"". Meanwhile, a court has blocked parts of Texas' temporary abortion ban, which the state announced last month citing the coronavirus outbreak. The order against ""medically unnecessary"" procedures was introduced to reserve valuable medical resources for those treating Covid-19 only, the state's Republican attorney general said in March. This video can not be played Italian PM Giuseppe Conte told the BBC in April how the lockdown could be eased But Judge Lee Yaekel, a George W Bush appointee, granted a temporary restraining order against the ban on Thursday. ""As a minimum, this is an undue burden on a woman's right to a previability abortion,"" he wrote in his ruling. Alabama, Iowa, Ohio and Oklahoma have introduced similar abortion bans. While there is still no vaccine for Covid-19, America's culture wars have proved similarly incurable. Legal battles have also ensued over whether guns shops should be closed during the pandemic, and if religious services should be exempt from state orders that ban large gatherings.

The state's confirmed caseload of Covid-19 jumped by 10,000 on Thursday to 159,937, placing it ahead of Spain (153,000 cases) and Italy (143,000). China, where the virus emerged last year, has reported 82,000 cases. The US as a whole has recorded 462,000 cases and nearly 16,500 deaths. Globally there are 1.6 million cases and 95,000 deaths. While New York state leads the world in coronavirus cases, its death toll (7,000) lags behind Spain (15,500) and Italy (18,000), though it is more than double the official figure from China (3,300). Photos have emerged of workers in hazmat outfits burying coffins in a mass grave in New York City. About 40 coffins were buried on Thursday Drone footage showed workers using a ladder to descend into the huge pit where the caskets were stacked. The images were taken at Hart Island, off the Bronx, which has been used for more than 150 years by city officials as a mass burial site for those with no next-of-kin, or families who cannot afford funerals. Burial operations at the site have ramped up amid the pandemic from one day a week to five days a week, according to the Department of Corrections. Prisoners from Rikers Island usually do the job, but the rising workload has recently been taken over by contractors. New York City Mayor Bill de BlasioÂ indicated earlier this week the city's public cemetery might be used for burials during the pandemic.Â ""Obviously the place we have used historically is Hart Island,"" he said. This video can not be played Is it too soon for a thriller movie on coronavirus? The number of coronavirus deaths in New York state increased to 799 on Wednesday, a record high for a third day. But Governor Andrew Cuomo took heart from the fact that the number of Covid-19 patients admitted to New York hospitals dropped for a second day, to 200. He said it was a sign social distancing was working. He called the outbreak a ""silent explosion that ripples through society with the same randomness, the same evil that we saw on 9/11"". Another glimmer of hope was heralded on Thursday as official projections for the nationwide death toll were lowered. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Dr Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House's coronavirus task force, told NBC News' Today show on Thursday the final number of Americans who will die from Covid-19 in the outbreak ""looks more like 60,000"". In late March, Dr Fauci estimated ""between 100,000 and 200,000"" could die. The 60,000 projection would match the upper estimate for total flu deaths in the US between October 2019 to March 2020,according to government data,external. But Vice-President Mike Pence stressed on Thursday that Covid-19 is about three times as contagious as influenza. One virus, two Americas Four out of five jobs affected by virus globally Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Global economy will suffer for 'years to come' The White House has previously touted estimates that 2.2 million Americans could die from coronavirus if nothing was done to stop its spread. Stay-at-home orders have in the meantime closed non-essential businesses in 42 states, while drastically slowing the US economy. New data on Thursday showedunemployment claims topped 6 millionfor the second week in a row, bringing the number of Americans out of work over the last three weeks to 16.8 million. Chicago meanwhile imposed a curfew on liquor sales from 21:00 local time on Thursday to stop the persistent violation of a ban on large gatherings. This video can not be played How caravans are helping frontline medics with a place to stay The measure, due to remain in place until 30 April, comes after health officials this week said black Chicagoans account for half of all the Illinois city's coronavirus cases and more than 70% of its deaths, despite making up just 30% of the population. ""We are putting this curfew in place because too many individuals and businesses have been violating the stay-at-home order,"" said Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Wednesday. Gun violence in Chicago on Tuesday left seven dead and 14 injured, which city officials said was unforgivable given the virus crisis. ""Every one of those ER beds taken up by a gunshot victim could be somebody's grandmother, somebody with pre-existing conditions, somebody that is in danger of losing their lives because of the pandemic,"" Supt Charlie Beck said.Â This video can not be played âI just had a baby - now Iâm going to the frontline.â Figures from Louisiana, Mississippi, Michigan, Wisconsin and New York reflect the same racial disparity in coronavirus infections. Presumptive Democratic White House nominee Joe Biden joined growing calls on Thursday for the release of comprehensive racial data on the pandemic. He said it had cast a spotlight on inequity and the impact of ""structural racism"". Meanwhile, a court has blocked parts of Texas' temporary abortion ban, which the state announced last month citing the coronavirus outbreak. The order against ""medically unnecessary"" procedures was introduced to reserve valuable medical resources for those treating Covid-19 only, the state's Republican attorney general said in March. This video can not be played Italian PM Giuseppe Conte told the BBC in April how the lockdown could be eased But Judge Lee Yaekel, a George W Bush appointee, granted a temporary restraining order against the ban on Thursday. ""As a minimum, this is an undue burden on a woman's right to a previability abortion,"" he wrote in his ruling. Alabama, Iowa, Ohio and Oklahoma have introduced similar abortion bans. While there is still no vaccine for Covid-19, America's culture wars have proved similarly incurable. Legal battles have also ensued over whether guns shops should be closed during the pandemic, and if religious services should be exempt from state orders that ban large gatherings.

Clothing makers give stark virus warning,"""If our workers don't die from coronavirus, they'd die of starvation."" This is the stark assessment of how the pandemic is impacting the clothing industry from garment factory owner, Vijay Mahtaney, the chairman of Ambattur Fashion India. In normal times, Vijay Mahtaney and his partners Amit Mahtaney and Shawn Islam employ a total of 18,000 workers in three countries - Bangladesh, India and Jordan. But the outbreak has forced them to shut down the majority of the business, with just one factory, in Dhaka, partially operational. Coronavirus lockdowns aren't the only thing affecting their ability to pay their workers. They say their main problem is unreasonable demands from big clients - mainly in the US and the UK. ""Some brands are showing a true sense of partnership and high level of ethics in trying to ensure at least enough cash flow to pay workers,"" Amit Mahtaney, the chief executive of Tusker Apparel Jordan, told the BBC. Virus could push half a billion people into poverty Calls for debt relief for world's poorest nations Global fashion industry facing a 'nightmare' ""But we've also experienced demands for cancellations for goods that are ready or are work in progress, or discounts for outstanding payments and for goods in transit. They are also asking for a 30 to 120 day extensions on previously agreed payment terms."" In an email obtained by the BBC, one US retailer has asked for a 30% discount ""for all payables - current or order"", including those already delivered. The reason they cite is to ""get through this extraordinary period"". ""Their attitude is one of protecting only shareholder value without any regard to the garment worker, behaving in a hypocritical manner, showing complete disregard to their ethos of responsible sourcing,"" Vijay Mahtaney said. ""Brand focus on share price, now means some of them don't have money for this rainy day, and are coming to the weakest link in the supply chain, asking us to help them out when they could be applying for a bailout from the US government stimulus package,"" Vijay added. It comes as garment manufacturers have been hit hard by two major issues related to coronavirus lockdowns. The problems started in February when factories couldn't get the raw materials they needed from China, the world biggest exporter of textiles, which accounted for some $118bn (Â£67bn) in 2018. Then as China's textile factories reopened in recent weeks - giving garment manufacturers hopes of getting operations back on track - demand collapsed as retailers were forced to shut their doors after governments around the world imposed lockdowns. China may be known as the factory of the world, but when it comes to clothes, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar play a growing role. ""Garment manufacturing has been diversifying away from China for around ten years due to China's high costs,"" according to Stanley Szeto of apparel maker Lever Style which supplies premium brands including Hugo Boss, Theory, Vince, and Coach, as well as online names like Bonobos, Stitch Fix and Everlane. It means that garment manufacturing is a crucial industry for many of Asia's developing economies, with World Trade Organization data showing that Bangladesh and Vietnam are amongst the world's four largest exporters of clothing. Bangladesh now accounts for 6.7% of market share, followed by Vietnam with 5.7%. Bangladesh has more than four million garment workers, and textile and apparel products made up more than 90% of the country's exports last year. Cambodia and Sri Lanka also rely on the industry for more than 60% of their exports, according to Sheng Lu at the University of Delaware's department of fashion and apparel studies. The industry accounts for more than half of all manufacturing jobs in Bangladesh, and 60% in Cambodia, with production being a particularly important employer of women. Associate Professor Lu thinks the coronavirus pandemic could see countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia and India cutting between 4% to 9% of garment sector jobs. That is partly why the Bangladeshi government is trying to help the industry. ""It has offered a generous stimulus package to subsidise wages, convert loans to long-term debt and offer very reasonable interest rates,"" said Shawn Islam, managing director of Sparrow Apparel Bangladesh. ""While it's not enough to weather the storm, it will help."" The Cambodian government has also announced tax holidays for textile factories and proposed a wage subsidy scheme for workers. That is because this outbreak could result in a longer term impact like labour shortages, price increases of raw materials and a lack of production capacity, said Associate Professor Lu. After growing criticism and pressure, some brands including H&M and Zara-owner Inditex have committed to paying in full for existing orders from clothing manufacturers. ""Brands have profited for many years from producing in low wage countries without social security systems and have in many cases built up huge empires through this business model,"" said Dominique Muller of Labour Behind the Label. ""Decades of exploitation must now be paid back to care for their workers."" Factory owner Amit Mahtaney agrees. ""Retailers have to help out. Richer governments' bailouts of the industry are also critical,"" he said. Without it, he claims, the industry could be wiped out completely.

A man has been jailed after coughing
at a policeman and telling the officer he had coronavirus. Simon Kibble, 29, of Trethomas,
Caerphilly, assaulted the officer after throttling his girlfriend in an
alcohol-fuelled attack. Kibble admitted two charges of common
assault and was sentenced to 16 weeks. Cardiff Magistrates Court heard the policeman
had spoken of how these were ""scary times"" for frontline officers and
a feeling of ""heightened anxiety"" during the pandemic. Judge Shomon Khan said: ""Alcohol
was an aggravating factor in this deeply unpleasant incident. ""Coronavirus can bring out the
best in people but it can also bring out the worst in the people. ""This has had a serious impact on
the officer and his family."" There should be no false hope that an end to the coronavirus lockdown is around the corner, the first minister says. Mark Drakeford told the Welsh Government's daily news conference a meeting next Wednesday would be about how the restrictions continue, not about whether they continue. A UK government minister has unveiled a new plan to get personal protective equipment (PPE) to those who need it. Matt Hancock, the health secretary for England, says there are three strands, the first of which is guidance - about ""being clear who needs PPE, when they need it and who does not"". Giving the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Hancock said there was enough PPE to go round, but only if it is used within guidance as it is a ""precious resource"". The second strand is the ""Herculean logistical effort"" to distribute. He says 742 million pieces of PPE have been delivered to the front line, but over the next three weeks, an online portal will launch so primary care and social care can request what they need. Finally, Mr Hancock says it is about supply, appealing to British companies to help create PPE ""on an unprecedented scale"". Euryl Howells lights a candle every day Every day at noon, the lead chaplain at Hywel Dda University Health Board lights a candle at Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen. Euryl Howells hopes his gesture will offer hope at a dark time. He said the hardest part of his job now is balancing the way he offers support to patients with social distancing rules and safety. ""I think it's really important to reassure that people are
not dying alone,"" Mr Howells said. ""If there was a need and if it was possible, then we
would be there, with the consent of the family and the patient. ""We have spent time over the last
weeks speaking to relatives at a distance - reassuring them, listening to their
concerns and hopefully giving them just a little bit of comfort."" Mr Howells says he will continue to light a candle every day until the coronavirus crisis is over.  ""If this carries on and the lockdown doesn't stop before the
summer holidays, our reserves will be gone,"" says Ceri Davies, manager of
Oxwich Watersports on Gower. Like many of Wales' seasonal businesses, the company is totally reliant on spring and summer trade. ""We work very long hours during the summer season, to compensate for the lack of hours that we work over the winter,"" Mr Davies said. ""We still have to pay for insurance and rent all year round."" Mr Davies and his instructors take hundreds of people out to sea on
kayaks and paddle-boards every day during the summer, but say
they are ineligible for the Welsh Government's small business grant of Â£10,000. A government spokesperson said they had launched a different fund for ineligible businesses. Watersports companies are completely reliant on summer trade With the women's T20
league suspended until further notice, Cricket Wales and Glamorgan Cricket have set up a virtual classroom for its cricketers - and their dogs. A biker was stopped on the A55 near Bangor after deciding to have a ""ride out"" from Chester. Police said the rider was reported for the unnecessary journey, and for not displaying L plates.

People will want to holiday in Wales once the lockdown is over, a campsite owner says. Rob Grove, owner of the Skysea campsite in Gower, said he felt optimistic despite losing business due to the coronavirus lockdown. ""Moving forward, if we're opening in the beginning of June
then I foresee us being very busy,"" he said. ""People will be very, very anxious to get out
and about. People who've got caravans or tents, they are going to want to get
out and use them, and I think after being locked up for several weeks are going
to appreciate them that much more. "" Mr Grove believes people will feel safer staying closer to home. ""I think people are going to be very fearful of booking
European holidays and holidays further afield really,"" he said. Welsh weather presenter Owain Wyn Evans takes some tips on how to present his forecasts. Allow Twitter content?

Here's the picture across Wales on Friday after Public Health Wales reported the biggest jump in new cases in one day since the start of the outbreak. Another 29 deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales have been confirmed, taking the total to 315. Public Health Wales also said there were another 502 confirmed cases of Covid-19 - the biggest daily increase announced so far - taking the total to 4,591. However, the additional number of deaths is lower than the record 41 announced yesterday. Dr Robin Howe, incident director for Covid-19 at Public Health Wales, said: âWe want to thank each and every person across Wales for doing their bit to help slow the spread of the virus. âWe know that staying at home can be hard especially when the weather is nice, but members of the public must adhere to social distancing rules about staying at home, and away from others, introduced by the UK and Welsh Government. ""These rules are available on thePublic Health Wales website,external."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Another 502 cases of coronavirus in Wales have been confirmed, the biggest daily increase of the outbreak so far. Public Health Wales said yesterday's total of 16 was untypically low because it only covered a six-hour period rather than 24 hours, as the authority changes the time period being covered in the daily announcement. Another 29 deaths linked to coronavirus in Wales have been confirmed, taking the total to 315. This was a fall from the 41 additional deaths announced on Thursday. There have been 29 more people with coronavirus who have died in
Wales, according to Public Health Wales. It takes the total
number of deaths since the start of the virus pandemic to 315. There were another 502 cases, taking the total to 4,591. However the real figure is thought to be far more as not everyone has been tested. Food parcels have begun reaching vulnerable
residents shielding themselves from coronavirus in Neath Port Talbot. Itâs
all part of the local authority's new service which arranges support
particularly for people without the help of close family or friends. Since
launching an appeal last week, the council says over 500 volunteers have come forward
in the first few days and more than 600 residents have already benefited. Council leader Rob Jones said: âOur
aim is to be here for people, and by working together, we can make this
challenging and uncertain time a bit easier for everyone.â I don't want anybody to be fined because I want everybody to do the right thing. I don't think fines are a sign of success, fines are a sign of people not doing what we want them to do. First Minister Mark Drakeford Police forces in Wales insist they have the powers to deal with people ignoring guidelines to stay at home, the first minister says. Mark Drakeford said chief constables in Wales told
him they can deal with those taking unnecessary
journeys, such as travelling to second homes. However he added that if police ask for greater measures during the coronavirus pandemic, ""they
will get those powers"". ""If they think that the penalties are not sufficient we will
look at the penalties as well,"" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has called for Â£1,000 fines for those repeatedly ignoring the ban on non-essential travel as a ""real deterrent"". Police in Wales have the same powers of arrest as counterparts in
England but the fining guidelines differ and are much lower in Wales. Police in England can issue fines of up to Â£960 for repeat
offences. The Welsh Government ""doesn't have the luxury"" of being able to plan ahead for providing personal protective equipment (PPE) to local authorities, the first minister has said. The comments come as Carmarthenshire council said it was procuring its own PPE due to a ""lack of transparency"" around Welsh Government supplies. Council leader Emlyn Doe saidnot knowing what equipment would be provided by the government from one week to the next made it difficult to plan ahead. Speaking at the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mark Drakeford said: ""We don't have the luxury that we have in other times of long planning and lead in times. ""Most local authority leaders understand that we are all doing this under extreme conditions where the normal ability to provide information, notice, time to plan is not available to any one of us."" The Welsh Local Government Association has also said that supplies of PPE to front-line workers has been a ""significant concern"" to councils and there have been issues over ""availability and completeness of supplies"". A review of the current lockdown regulations could lead to
tighter restrictions being put in place, the first minister has admitted. Mark Drakeford said: âThe review of the regulations could lead to a
tightening; itâs an open review. ""Personally I hope they donât need to be
further tightened; they are already onerous.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Oil producers agree to cut production by a fifth,"A global deal to cut oil production by more than 10% appears to be on track after the US promised to reduce supply. Mexico, which initially baulked at the scale of the cuts, said President Donald Trump had suggested the US might make cuts on behalf of its neighbour on Friday 10 April. Oil prices have been plunging due to coronavirus lockdowns. However the prospect of unprecedented cuts to supply failed to boost the oil price on Thursday. G20 oil ministers held talks on Friday to finalise the draft agreement, which would see cuts of 10 million barrels per day. ""This is a time for all nations to seriously examine what each can do to correct the supply/demand imbalance,"" said US Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette. America would ""take surplus off the market"" by storing ""as much oil as possible"", he added. Coronavirus: Oil prices surge on hopes of a price war truce Coronavirus: Oil price collapses to lowest level for 18 years Oil plunges in Asia as producers start price war Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the US would make 250,000 barrels per day in additional cuts to oil output, to help Mexico contribute to global reductions. Mr Lopez Obrador, who has made increasing oil output one of the priorities of his administration, said US President Donald Trump had spoken to him on Thursday and offered to help before Mexico announced it would cut output by 100,000 barrels per day. ""President Trump said the United States committed to reducing by 250,000 (barrels), on top of what it was going to do, for Mexico, in order to compensate,"" he said. Opec+, which includes Russia, had said it would cut production in May and June by 10 million barrels a day to help prop up prices. The cuts will then be eased gradually until April 2022. However,a final agreement was dependent on Mexico signing up, after it questioned the level of production cuts it was asked to make,Reuters had reported,external. Oil prices have recently slumped as the coronavirus pandemic has grounded planes, halted travel and put a brake on industry across the world. That coincided with a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, further pushing down the price of crude. On Thursday, the Opec producers' organisation and its allies reached a tentative agreement to cut production by about 10% compared to what was being produced before the crisis. Another 5 million barrels is expected to be cut by other oil exporting countries. Opec said the cuts would be eased to eight million barrels a day between July and December. They would later be eased again to six million barrels from January 2021. Nevertheless, Brent crude closed down by 4% at $31.48 a barrel on Thursday as the agreement began to take shape. Despite the scale of the cuts agreed, they are unlikely to compensate for the sharp fall in demand for oil. A conference call is taking place on Friday between energy ministers from the G20 who will be hoping to finalise the agreement. It will be hosted by Saudi Arabia. Opec secretary-general Mohammed Barkindo called for action for the oil industry to combat the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday he said: ""There is a grizzly shadow hanging over all of us. We do not want this shadow to envelope us. It will have a crushing and long-term impact on the entire industry."" The global coronavirus pandemic hit demand for oil in March as restrictions on business and consumer activity were introduced in dozens of countries in quick succession. Crude had already fallen to just over $31 (Â£24.90; â¬28.30) a barrel at the start of the month afterSaudi Arabia failed to convince Russia to back production cutsthat had previously been agreed with the other members of  Opec. By the end of Marchcrude had fallen to $22.58, its lowest price in 18 years. Some analysts have questioned whether any agreed cuts would succeed in boosting the price of oil, given the prospect of a sharp and possibly prolonged global economic downturn, as the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organisation have warned. If it does remain subdued, lower prices on the wholesale oil market could lead to cheaper production costs of some materials, such as plastic. That would potentially be reflected in prices of everyday consumer goods. However, producer countries will see sharp reductions in revenue.

Easter egg online sales surge despite lockdown,"Upmarket chocolate retailer Hotel Chocolat closed all its UK stores three weeks ago. The firm was forced to ""turn on a sixpence"" reorganising the warehouse to make it safe for staff. But it has paid off. ""As it turns out, we've sold more Easter eggs than last year,"" says boss Angus Thirlwell. Online sales of Easter eggs are surging as UK consumers turn to the internet during the coronavirus lockdown. Thorntons too said it had seen ""a significant increase in online orders"" since the lockdown started. ""Demand is four times higher than average - and we have received approximately one million visitors to our site this week,"" they added. Easter is big business in Britain. In 2019, consumers spent Â£1.1bn on buying items to celebrate the festival, according to research firm Mintel, with Â£206m of that spent on Easter eggs alone. But with the coronavirus lockdown preventing families and friends from meeting up to celebrate and Easter egg hunt activities cancelled, the usual opportunities for buying and sharing the traditional treats are limited. Thorntons opens its website for just two hours each days to accept new customer orders Facing the surge in online traffic, Thorntons has decided to open its website at 09:00 each day for just one or two hours for customer orders, before closing it again. Hotel Chocolat is taking a different approach. Rather than have its staff waste time searching for products in the warehouse to fulfil orders, the chocolate maker has reduced the range of products that people can purchase online. Instead, the retailer has created themed bundles and pre-packs the items into boxes the moment they come off the production line. ""We've created 30 new products from scratch,"" said Mr Thirlwell, adding that customers had been much less demanding about their packages during the lockdown than they would typically be. In contrast, aisles fully stocked with Easter eggs have been widely discounted in supermarkets across the UK in the last two weeks, which is unusual for the run-up to the Easter holiday weekend. In Tesco, almost all branded Easter eggs are selling on two-for-one deals, while Sainsbury's lifted its three-item limit per customer on Easter eggs several days beforeit eased restrictions on other food products. Supermarkets have been heavily discounting Easter eggs in stores The BBC asked Tesco and Sainsbury's about their Easter egg sales, but the supermarkets declined to comment. Chocolate manufacturer Kinnerton Confectionery makes many of the branded Easter eggs sold in these supermarkets, and it too has seen demand move online. ""With travel restrictions extending over Easter, consumers have turned to order Easter eggs online for home delivery to their loved ones,"" Julia Catton, marketing and innovation director at Zertus UK, the parent company for Kinnerton Confectionery and several other chocolate brands, told the BBC. ""Some of our major customers have increased their online range to help customers, but this has been further hampered bylimitation of home delivery slots in many retailers."" Stay at home over Easter to stop virus, public told Tesco tells people to visit stores to get food Flour mills working 'round the clock' to meet demand Kinnerton itself set up a new online shop to allow customers of its Nomo vegan and ""free-from"" chocolate range to make direct orders if they couldn't get the products from supermarkets. However, according to US market research firm IRI, overall Easter confectionery sales for the week ending 28 March were down 17% year-on-year. Ms Catton added: ""The next few days will be important for Easter egg sales to see if demand improves."" Other analysts also feel that there will be a significant impact on Easter spending, and that not everyone is buying Easter eggs. Independent retail expert Kate Hardcastle says consumers will have to decide between the must-haves and nice-to-haves: ""It's just not front-of-mind focus for anyone, and it's also an extra cost for a lot of families they just can't afford."" Mintel is running a weekly survey tracking the impacts of coronavirus on consumer spending in the UK. It says that in the last week, almost a quarter of British consumers increased the shopping they are doing online. But in the last seven days, it also found that 46% of consumers have cut back on non-essential spending. Despite this, Hotel Chocolat's Angus Thirlwell says that his business is seeing consumer behaviour it's never seen before in its 27-year-history. ""There's a lot of people using online food shopping for the first time. People are asking for help in making orders on the online chat and calling customer service,"" he said. Hotel Chocolat is also seeing customer messages that show a shift in consumer habits, says Mr Thirlwell: ""We're seeing messages like, 'Here's something to keep your strength up', or 'Thinking of you', sent to key workers, and families saying 'Here's some chocolate so we can FaceTime eating chocolate together'. ""Chocolate does play an important part in keeping morale up.""

Can we 3D-print our way out of the PPE shortage?,"Dr Sam Pashneh-Tala's team has crowdfunded over Â£15,000 to make the face shields Universities, tech firms and 3D print enthusiasts with their own printers are responding to the shortage of healthcare workers' personal protective equipment (PPE) - and in some case more complex hospital medical supplies - by making it themselves. It's been called a ""citizen supply chain"". In general, 3D-printed kit is fairly cheap to produce in terms of materials required, and can be turned around in a matter of hours on each printer. There's a motivated community who want to make it and it can be distributed locally to those who need it without a centralised supplier - so is it the solution to the current PPE shortage? Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple. ""3D printing is this technology where on the face of it people envisage this kind of Star Trek replicator, where you press a button and something gets made out of nothing,"" said Dr Sam Pashneh-Tala, a bioengineer at the University of Sheffield. ""This is not true - you have to understand the limitations."" And while it is undoubtedly in demand - there are a few issues to bear in mind. There doesn't seem to be any official guidance for healthcare workers about the use of 3D-printed protective kit. The BBC contacted several medical organisations, government departments and the NHS. They all replied, but none thought it was for them to say whether it was advisable for healthcare workers to use it. The MHRA which oversees medical equipment,pointed to its guidelines on manufacture during the pandemic,external- but not all face masks, for example, are considered by it to be medical supplies. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The volunteers making face shields for Madridâs medical staff There are various types of 3D printer and a range of materials they can print with. Both the printers and the materials vary in price, quality and suitability for different projects. Some materials, for example, will result in a more porous product, making it more difficult to clean. While templates are being shared and modified among the 3D-printer community for creating PPE kit, not one of the resulting products has a CE Kitemark, the European safety standard, which ultimately means that there is no quality benchmark. For this reason they cannot be sold - so no maker should be offering them in exchange for cash. It is also impossible to guarantee how sterilised these products are because of where they are made and packaged, and as a result they are being given out with the guidance that they should only be used once. Dr Pashneh-Tala is part of a team at the University of Sheffield called iForge that has so far made 600 face shields for healthcare workers using a combination of 3D-printed frames, visors made from laser cutting and elastic. He says they have been sent to local GP practices, social workers and paramedics. In terms of materials each shield costs less than Â£1.80 - but a laser cutter can cost thousands. He says they are manufactured in a controlled environment. ""We put them through a cleaning process designed to deactivate Covid-19 specifically,"" he said. ""It's for the user to determine if that is suitable. Healthcare providers so far have been happy."" Gary Riches is 3D-printing face shields from his home While professionals and experts are on the case there's also an army of enthusiasts using their own 3D printers at home. Gary Riches, a software engineer from Hertfordshire, is part of a co-ordinated network of thousands of volunteer 3D printers called 3DCrowd UK. So far, he has made 150 face shields on his two 3D printers at home, and says he has delivered 39 of them to community nurses and midwives locally. 3DCrowd UK is using a template that has been approved in the Czech Republic although not officially in the UK. Mr Riches feels strongly that it's worth the risk. ""If we worry too much about whether it's 100% perfect then nobody who needs it will get it,"" he said. ""If you can step up, you have to step up."" And there's certainly the demand -  3DCrowd UK says it has received requests for nearly 350,000 face shields so far. Some 3D printers have gone even further. Last month, an Italian firm called Isinnova hit the headlines when it announced it had 3D-printed ventilator tubes for a hospital in Brescia, a region badly hit by Covid-19. The tubes can only be used for eight hours at a time and the regular supplier said it could not send replacements in good time. Isinnova's 3D-printed valves However, IDC analyst Galina Spasova urged caution about their use. ""While such 3D-printed items have proven helpful in emergency situations, the safety of these designs is under examination,""she wrote in a blog post,external. ""At this stage, there is little visibility on the outcomes of the use of these components. They remain uncertified medical devices and should be used with caution and as a last resort."" Dr Pashneh-Tala agrees. ""With a face shield, there's reasonably low risk - it doesn't have working parts beyond covering your face,"" he said. ""For a higher-end application - what kind of performance are you getting? Proper certification and testing is needed. There are people who are pushing for that."" 3DCrowd UK is seeking more volunteers for its network but it too is clear about what it can offer. ""There are 3D printers that can print medical-grade things but for anything important, that for now has to remain in the hands of the professionals,"" said adviser Seb Lee-Delise. ""I'd be incredibly wary of making anything that goes on or inside or around a patient.""

Thank you for joining us, we'll see you again on Saturday morning. Here's a roundup of the biggest stories from the US today: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Things were already tense at a prison in Lansing, Kansas. A dozen
inmates and 14 staffers got sick from Covid-19, and officials gave out
cloth masks to try and stop the infection from spreading further. Then, on
Thursday, some of the prisoners began to set fires and smash windows. The
uprising lasted several hours, and it is not clear why it started. No-one was
badly hurt during the melee, and the facilities were locked down again by early
the following day. The violence at the prison - which houses about
150 inmates - is the latest sign that people in confinement are becoming
increasingly desperate. Hundreds of people have been infected in US prisons and
jails, according to data compiled by the New York Times, and more than two
dozen have died. Prisoners try to protect themselves against the disease
as best they can. In some places, such as in Lansing, they have begun to
express their rage in a violent manner. Dr David Wrigley, the Vice-Chairman of the doctorsâ union,
the British Medical Association (BMA), has criticised the health secretaryâs comments
thatthere had been a âHerculean effortâ to provide the NHS with protective equipment. He said that doctors âare not getting the PPE that they
needâ. âWeâve heard from two parts of England where there is insufficient
PPE being provided for doctors on the front line. Itâs forcing them into
impossible situations and itâs putting their lives at risk,â he told the BBC. He added that it was a âshocking indictmentâ that staff
working in some intensive care units did not have the correct face masks. And he said the BMA âknow now at least 11 doctors have died
in the fightâ against the virus. A Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, transit policy of having all bus passengers wear masks in order to protect employees was shortlived thanks to a couple of videos. In one clip, a man tells passengers without masks they must exit the bus - though he does not have a mask on himself. In another, police are seen dragging a man off. The footage was shared on Twitter, prompting questions from locals about what exactly the policy was. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) has nowtold the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper,externalit will no longer enforce the mask mandate, which began on Thursday.

The UK is experiencing warm weather across the Easter weekend but people are being urged to stay at home to reduce transmission of coronavirus. Seen from above, many areas in the UK that are normally crowded during sunny weather seem significantly emptier than they would otherwise be, suggesting people are following the government advice. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The UK's Easter lockdown from above Hidden behind protective masks, medics' faces are likely to remain unknown to most of the patients they treat. Thatâs a problem for nurses and doctors seeking to comfort their
patients with a reassuring smile. But medical staff in the US have found a novel solution - theyâve been attaching photos of their
smiling faces to their protective clothing. Respiratory therapist Robertino Rodriguez has been using the
technique while treating coronavirus patients at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San
Diego. In an Instagram post, he said he âfelt bad for my patients in ER
when I would come in the room with my face coveredâ. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Almojera, a senior paramedic in New York City, has written a diary for the BBC
of one day in his working life. He says that day - last Sunday - was the worst
in his 17-year career. We arrive at a house and I put on my mask, gown and
gloves. We find a man. His family says he has had a fever and
cough for five days. We start CPR and I watch the medics pass a tube down his
throat to breathe for him. We work on him for about 30 minutes before we pronounce
him dead. I make sure the crews are OK and get back in my truck -
decontaminating everything first. I hit the button to go available. Twenty minutes later, I get another cardiac arrest. Same
symptoms, same procedures, same results. We hit the button, get another one. Hit the button after that, get another one. There's only one patient we've seen so far who I feel
wasn't Covid-19 and that's because it was a suicide. Imagine: I was there and
my brain felt relief. This person's dead and it's a suicide. I felt relief that
it was a regular job. It is now around 11:00 and I've done about six cardiac
arrests. In normal times, a medic gets two or three in a week,
maybe. You can have a busy day sometimes, but never this. Never this.

Their plan is to initially help contact-tracing apps from public health authorities to run efficiently. Ultimately, they plan to develop a separate ""Bluetooth-based contract tracking platform"" to gather extensive data which apps from public health authorities can access. The two companies believe their approach addresses privacy concerns. People using the service will do so voluntarily, and no GPS location data or personal information will be recorded.

cities as it attempts to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The countryâs interior minister said all residents in those
cities, including the capital Ankara and Istanbul, will be required to stay at home from midnight
on Friday. Warm and sunny weather has been forecast for much of the
country over the weekend, prompting concern social-distancing rules may be
flouted. Turkeyâs coronavirus death toll jumped by 98 on Friday, with the total now at 1,006. Its total number of confirmed cases is now 47,029, a rise of
4,747 in 24 hours. Yemen was the last Arab country to confirm the presence of coronavirus Aid agencies have expressed alarm after the first virus case was confirmed in Yemen, where years of civil war have devastated health systems. Oxfam said it was a âdevastating blowâ, while the International Rescue Committee called it a ânightmare scenarioâ. Yemen is suffering the world's worst humanitarian crisis and millions are reliant on food aid. Diseases including cholera, dengue and malaria are rife and only half of hospitals are fully functional. News of the first Covid-19 case came a day after theSaudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen began a ceasefire, saying it wanted to help stop coronavirus spread and support UN peace efforts.

Here's what was said: Fans of Friends will have to wait a little longer for the highly anticipated reunion episode as it has been postponed due to the impact of coronavirus on TV production. The show had been due to launch with the HBO Max streaming service in May, but filming has not been able to take place. It is not yet clear when the episode will be filmed. Rumours of a reunion were confirmed by the cast in February. Friends aired from 1994 until 2004. The final show was watched by 52.5 million viewers in the US, making it the most watched TV episode of the 2000s. US President Donald Trump said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's approval rating ""must be about 300%"". Johnson tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March and has been in hospital since Sunday, including four days in intensive care. He had been leading the UK's response to the coronavirus but some have criticised his handling of the crisis. Trump said he had called Johnson's ""group"" to wish him well but had not spoken to the Prime Minister. ""His approval rating must be about 300%,"" Trump added. ""He is a great guy. ""He was a great guy before and people see what he has been through. What he has been through has been incredible."" Nick Thorpe, BBC News Romania's hospitals have struggled to cope with the influx of coronavirus patients The situation in Romania's hospitals is under control despite localised problems caused by the spread of coronavirus, a government official has told the BBC. The country has struggled to contain the spread of the virus, not helped by the return of 250,000 Romanians from jobs elsewhere in Europe during March. Almost 5,500 people have tested positive, 257 have died, and a similar number of new infections were reported in the last 24 hours. In the north-eastern city of Suceava, the hospital became the centre of contagion, with 182 medical staff infected. Elsewhere in the western city of Timisoara, 10 newborn babies tested positive for the virus, despite none of their mothers having the disease. Of those babies, seven have since tested negative. A criminal investigation has been launched, the director of the public health authority fired, and the hospital re-organised. Romanian government spokesman Andi Munciu told the BBC such cases were not a reflection of the ""generalised situation"" in the country. Social media companies are struggling to contain a wave of coronavirus misinformation. Into the breach have stepped volunteers who are fighting to stop rumours, bad advice and conspiracy theories from going viral. Rachael Hogg is currently juggling her busy job as a project manager and teaching her nine-year-old from her home in the market town of Morpeth, about 15 miles north of Newcastle. But if that wasn't enough, each day she's also deleting as many as 50 misleading posts about coronavirus from the local Facebook group she runs. See here for more on the people fighting fake news from home.  President Trump said he wants to reopen the country ""as soon as possible"" but ""facts will determine"" when he does so. Current restrictions in the US are set to end on 30 April. Asked if he was overly determined to reopening the country on that date, Trump said: ""I would love to open, I've not determined anything. The facts will determine what I do."" He said he will announce a new council on Tuesday, made up of doctors and businessmen tasked with discussing when the country could reopen. Trump named the council the ""opening our country council"". ""We are going to have great business leaders and doctors,"" he said. ""We will be announcing names on Tuesday and that will play a role [in deciding when the country can reopen]. ""I want to get open as soon as possible. This country is meant to be open and vibrant."" More than 18,000 have died from Covid-19 in Italy Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has extended Italyâs nationwide lockdown until 3 May. The first nationwide lockdown was imposed on 9 March until 3 April but was later extended to 13 April. The tight lockdown in Italy appears to be working. Its latest 24-hour death toll is 570, continuing a declining trend. But Italy still has the world's highest overall death toll, which currently stands at 18,849. Liverpool and Scotland football legend Sir Kenny Dalglish has tested positive for coronavirus and is in hospital but showing no symptoms. The 69-year-old was admitted to hospital on Wednesday for treatment of an infection and tested positive for Covid-19 after a routine test. His family said in a statement ""he looks forward to being home soon"". Dalglish played over 500 games for Liverpool and also managed the club on two occasions. He also won more than 100 caps for Scotland. Many Good Friday services, like this one in Kenya, were broadcast live as churches have suspended congregational worship Many Christians in Africa usually
attend services on Good Friday, but this Easter, like elsewhere in the world,
most churches were closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus. As several countries on the
continent extend restrictions, these are the main developments: Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"We can't have a normal Easter, Britons told","The PM outside Downing Street before he was admitted to hospital Boris Johnson is taking short walks between periods of rest as part of the care he is receiving for coronavirus. The prime minister has also thanked the team looking after him for the ""incredible care"" he has received, a Downing Street spokesman said. Mr Johnson was taken to hospital on Sunday - 10 days after testing positive. Earlier on Friday, his father said Mr Johnson ""must rest up"" after he wasmoved from intensive care. Stanley Johnson spoke of his ""relief"" that his son had begun his recovery, adding that he thought his illness had ""got the whole country to realise this is a serious event"". The No 10 spokesman said: ""[Mr Johnson] has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received. ""His thoughts are with those affected by this terrible disease."" LIVE UPDATES: Christians face Good Friday on virus lockdown Earlier, the spokesman said the prime minister was back on a ward and ""in very good spirits"", emphasising that Mr Johnson was at an ""early stage"" of his recovery from coronavirus. NHS England has announced 866 more people have died in England after testing positive for coronavirus, and separate figures show there have been 48 more in Scotland,29 more in Walesand10 more in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, scientific adviser Prof Neil Ferguson, who was asked about coming out of lockdown, said it would likely ""be targeted by age, by geography"". Prof Ferguson, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that work to end the coronavirus lockdown in the UK was the ""number one topic and priority"" both in the scientific community and in government. ""Every waking minute, as it were,"" he said. Speaking about what measures might be needed to end the lockdown, Prof Ferguson said the UK would have to introduce larger levels of testing at community level ""to isolate cases more effectively"". However, he suggested the lockdown would have to remain in place for ""several more weeks"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for clarity about how long the prime minister will be ""out of action"". ""We need robust replacement arrangements in place and we need to know what they are, as soon as possible,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

It comes as Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick defended his travel moves amid reports he flouted lockdown rules. The MP for Newark in Nottinghamshire is said to have travelled from London to a second home in Herefordshire, and separately visited his parents in neighbouring Shropshire,according to the Daily Mail,externalandthe Guardian,external. The government has advised against travel to second homes - and urged people to distance themselves from elderly relatives. Easter warnings from police, parks and councils 15% find lockdown 'extremely difficult' - poll 'I'm in lockdown with my long-lost sister' Mr Jenrick said he had been in London on ministerial duties and left for what he said was a family home in Herefordshire to join his wife and children. He added that he visited his parents to deliver essentials, including medicines - allowed by the rules. Downing Street has defended Mr Jenrick, saying it was ""not an unnecessary journey"" for cabinet ministers commuting to and from London to rejoin their family. ""We're confident that he complied with the social distancing rules,"" a spokesman said. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said it was ""important for public confidence"" that Mr Jenrick explained the purpose of the journey. But he added that if the housing secretary had delivered medicine to his parents, ""clearly... it fits within the four exceptions"". Prof Paul Cosford, medical director for Public Health England, said government guidelines were ""quite clear"" that people must stay at home except in one of four circumstances, including exercise, essential shopping for food and medicines, healthcare and essential work. ""I can't comment on Mr Jenrick, it sounds as if what he did was within one of the four guidelines to me, but others will obviously have to think about that more,"" he told the Today programme. Asked about the government's lockdown exit strategy, Prof Cosford said he ""could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lifted sooner and some are lifted later"", but cautioned that there was still an ""awfully long way to go"". Meanwhile, the German army is donating 60 mobile ventilators to the NHS. There are currently 10,000 available in the UK and the government says 18,000 are needed. Thousands of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) suits for the UK are also scheduled to arrive at RAF Brize Norton later on Friday from Nato ally Turkey. At the government's daily briefing on Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who is standing in for Mr Johnson - acknowledged it was hard for people hoping to go out and be with their families over Easter, but urged restraint. Mr Raab was speaking ahead of a bank holiday weekend forecasted to see temperatures as high as 26C in London on Saturday, though cooler weather is expected on Sunday. He said lockdown restrictions will stay in place until evidence showed the UK had moved beyond the peak of the virus. The new campaign aims to reinforce the importance of staying at home over Easter Police forces across the UK have urged people to stay at home over the Easter weekend, with police in North Irelandwarning of increased patrols, and forces in Wales vowinga crackdown on unnecessary travel. Police Scotland officers will also be on patrolto explain the risks to public health of flouting guidance. Some forces and local authorities said they had already turned away would-be holidaymakers making journeys to popular destinations on Thursday. Downing Street has given its ""full backing"" to officers enforcing the lockdown rules. However, some forces have been criticised for their handling of the new measures. What powers do police have during the pandemic? On Friday morning, the Cambridge Police Twitter account posted a statement  to ""clarify"" officers were ""not monitoring"" what people are buying from supermarkets. An earlier post suggested officers were patrolling ""non-essential"" aisles at Tesco supermarket in Barhill. The force said the initial post, since deleted, was made by an ""over-exuberant"" officer. ""The force position, in line with national guidance, is that we are not monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets,""Cambridge Police tweeted,external. On Thursday, Northamptonshire's chief constable was criticised for sayinghe would not rule out road blocks or checking supermarket trolleys- later confirming that the force would not be judging people on what they are buying.
