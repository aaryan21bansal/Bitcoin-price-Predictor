What makes a major tournament?,"Jason Day had a four-stroke advantage to win the Players Championship at Sawgrass last year. Players Championship Venue:TPC Sawgrass, Ponte Vedra Beach, FloridaDates:11-14 May Coverage:Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website on Saturday and Sunday. What makes a major? The question arises because it is becoming harder to find reasons why this week's Players Championship will not eventually evolve to that elevated level. The four men's majors are the benchmark of the game. The Open Championship is the world's oldest and most prestigious event, the Masters has become the game's most glamorous tournament, the US Open is America's national championship and the PGA? Well, it is the PGA. Chronologically it is last of the big four and is regarded as such in significance - this despite always boasting the top 100 players in the world, which is more than the other three majors are able to do. Gaining major status only genuinely happens when there is universal agreement that a tournament deserves such status. The stature of the US Open has never been in doubt while on these shores, The Open's lustre only wobbled when American professionals became reluctant to travel in the 1950s. Arnold Palmer's continued support of The Open ensured its elite status was preserved and never again ignored by any of the world's leading stars. The Masters only truly acquired its major standing in the post-Second World War years and the US PGA Championship needed to switch from its original matchplay format in 1958 to maintain its relevance. It is also the preserve of the PGA of America, one of the most powerful bodies in the sport and the organisation that runs the US Ryder Cup team. All majors have in common a place in sporting history, large prize funds, deep fields populated with players desperate to win, a resonance that stretches beyond the golfing village and the ability to identify the best players in the world. Sawgrass, the home of the Players Championship And this neatly brings us to the 44th Players Championship, which will be played at TPC Sawgrass, Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida from Thursday. Which of those boxes is not ticked by the Players? Its history has built year on year. This is the 36th time it will be played on Pete Dye's famous Stadium Course, relaid and refined this year, and the closing stretch of holes including the famous island-green 17th have become as familiar as any on the golf calendar. In financial terms it is every bit as lucrative as any other tournament on the planet. This year it is worth $10.5m (Â£8.1m) and it is little surprise that it attracts the PGA Tour's strongest field of the season. And it resonates. The fact that it returns to the same course every year helps and it generates memories that stick with us. Remember Hal Sutton's ""be the right club, be the right club, today"" as he fired his tournament-winning approach to the 72nd green to hold off Tiger Woods in 2000? Or Fred Funk slamming his cap into the green upon completing his 2005 victory? Sandy Lyle has been Britain's only winner, and his victory is still fondly remembered even though it was achieved 30 years ago. More recently the nerveless play-off wins by Sergio Garcia (2008) and Rickie Fowler (2015) are easier to recall than many a decisive moment in, say, the PGA Championship. And there can be little argument over the pedigree of its champions. The Players is rarely won by anyone other than the highest calibre of golfer. Rory McIlroy has finished eighth, sixth, eighth and 12th in the past four years at Sawgrass Jack Nicklaus triumphed three times, including the inaugural tournament in 1974, and the roster of champions includes; Woods, Greg Norman, Nick Price, Fred Couples, David Duval, Adam Scott, Martin Kaymer and last year's winner Jason Day - all world number ones. Sawgrass messes with golfers heads. It demands precision and the correct angles of attack. ""It tests basically everything from a mechanical and hitting standpoint, as well as to a mental approach,"" said Duval, the champion in 1999. For this year's event the course has been relaid with new grasses and several greens have been altered. The 12th hole now becomes a driveable par-four to provide a kickstart to the fireworks that inevitably occur on the water dominated par-five 16th, short 17th and dramatic par-four closing hole. Until 2007, the tournament occupied a March date and was recognised as the first genuine gathering of the world's best golfers before the Masters. Then came the move to its current timing in May. Many have debated the wisdom of the schedule change. ""I don't believe the golf course has quite lived up to how they have wanted it since the move to May, with the condition of it,"" Duval said. ""It should go back to March,"" he added, saying such a move is more likely to yield firmer and faster playing conditions. ""It's been a bit of struggle and so I hope it does go back."" Recent Players Championship winners 2016: Jason Day (Aus) -15 2015: Rickie Fowler (US) -12 (won after play-off) 2014: Martin Kaymer (Ger) -13 2013: Tiger Woods (US) -13 2012: Matt Kuchar (US) -13 2011: KJ Choi (Kor) -13 Duval may well get his wish. The proposed restructuring of the golfing calendar would see the PGA shift from its August date to take the Players Championship slot in May, as it moves back to the original pre-Masters timing. Tellingly, the Players is at the heart of the conversation on finding the most attractive schedule for the men's game. It, therefore, is already sitting at golf's top table. And, while the sport might not need another major - and certainly not another in the United States - it feels more and more as though we are arriving at a tipping point. Right now it is ""the four majors and the Players"" when we discuss the most prized events in the game, but for how much longer might this distinction be drawn?

Laura Kuenssberg: Why May is keeping immigration target,"Privately lots of Tories have said for years, six years in fact, that the chances of getting immigration down to under 100,000 were small. And for as long as we were in the European Union, the UK government had no way of guaranteeing it would happen in any case. The job prospects for young Spaniards, Poles, Italians, were arguably a bigger determinant for UK immigration than anything the UK government could do about European immigration at least. Election live: Rolling text and video updates PM: Immigration target still important UKIP want 'one in, one out' migration For as long as we have freedom of movement, part of the deal of being in the EU, we can't put a limit on the numbers, nor the rest of the EU put a limit on the number of Brits who could move around the EU. It's also worth saying that immigration from the rest of the world, on its own, has also been well over the target of ""tens of thousands"" - and remember, that's the bit that is easier to control. You can see the numbers here, since the Tories came into government in 2010: Year ending Dec 2010: 77,000 (EU)       217,000 (non-EU) YE Dec 2011: 82,000 (EU)    204,000 (non-EU) YE Dec 2012: 82,000 (EU)    157,000 (non-EU) YE Dec 2013: 123,000 (EU)    143,000 (non-EU) YE Dec 2014: 174,000 (EU)    194,000 (non-EU) YE Dec 2015: 184,000 (EU)    189,000 (non-EU) YE Sep 2016: 165,000 (EU)    165,000 (non-EU) Once we are out of the EU, controlling those numbers will in theory be easier. It will be the UK that decides how many people can come from around Europe, as they currently do with the rest of the world. But while Theresa May has staunchly recommitted to the target she, as home secretary, missed for six years in a row, ministers have been also busy reassuring businesses they will be able to get the people they need, whether builders, bankers, or fruit pickers. If the economy needs them, they will be allowed to come. That doesn't sound like a recipe for getting the numbers down to Theresa May's preferred level. And even though we are on our way out of the EU, there is still huge scepticism over whether the target is remotely achievable. So why keep it? Sometimes in politics it's useful to ponder what would happen if they did the opposite. Ditch the immigration target after the referendum when public concern about the levels was so obvious? Ditch it when the Tories want to pick up as many former UKIP voters as possible? Ditch it when Theresa May has spent years, with limited success, trying different ways of getting it down? One source told me ""it's just too ingrained"". The political, if not the pragmatic, reasons for keeping it become clear pretty fast. Whether the target is suddenly achievable however is an entirely different debate.

Smoking 'may be banned in new council homes',"Smoking could be banned in some new council homes in a bid to protect the health of children, a UK public health expert has said. Under the proposals, tenants would be asked to sign an agreement not to light up inside their home. President of the Faculty of Public Health, Prof John Middleton, says some councils and housing associations are already exploring the smoke-free housing idea. According to the professor, the agreement would be voluntary rather than mandatory, although it would be part of the tenancy contract for new family housing. He says there would be tenants who would prefer to live in a non-smoking block, particularly if they have children. Second-hand smoke harms children's lungs and has been linked to an increased risk of cot death in babies. ""We are not saying people can't smoke or that they have to give up smoking. The voluntary agreement would be that they have to smoke outside."" It would be up to social landlords and housing associations to set the rules. Anyone living in the smoke-free building who signed up would then need to abide by the arrangements. The US has decided to go a step further and insist all public housing agencies provide smoke-free environments for their residents by the end of July 2018 It will means no-one can smoke inside or within 25 feet of the homes. Policymakers think so, although it can be difficult to measure the full impact. A ban on smoking in public places, including restaurants and bars, was introduced in England in 2007. The government then commissioned a review of the evidence on the impact of the law in England. This was carried out by Prof Linda Bauld from the University of Stirling and the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies. Prof Bauld's report,external, published in 2011, concluded there had been ""benefits for health"" as well as changes in attitudes and behaviour, with more people looking to cut down on or quit smoking. According to the charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), the majority of people who live in social housing in the UK do not smoke and many of those who do already act responsibly and take their smoke outside. A spokeswoman said: ""Blanket bans are unlikely to be the answer but it would be great to see social landlords thinking strategically about how they can support healthier environments around smoking. ""Looking at new housing and setting some aside for smoke-free tenancies seems like a sensible suggestion and it would be great to see landlords adopt this as part of a wider approach."" Smoke can stay in the air for up to two-and-a-half hours even with a window open It may still be there even if you can't see it or smell it Second-hand smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals, some of which are known to cause cancer Children who breathe in second-hand smoke have an increased risk of asthma and coughs and colds, as well as cot death, meningitis and ear infections Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said banning smoking in social housing would set a very dangerous precedent. ""Not only would it be a gross invasion of privacy, it would penalise unfairly those who can't afford to buy their own homes. ""How would the policy be enforced? It could create a snooper's charter allowing people to snitch on neighbours, especially those they don't get on with. Children might inadvertently give their parents away, resulting in possible eviction. ""It's not second-hand smoke that's making people's lives a misery. It's puritanical bodies like the Faculty of Public Health who, having campaigned to ban smoking in every pub and club in the country, are now trying to dictate how people behave in their own private space as well.""

Will Macron mean Brexit blues or boost?,"The received wisdom is that the election of Emmanuel Macron as president of France is bad for Britain's Brexit negotiations. Like much received wisdom, it may just be wrong. For the arrival of this young financier-turned politician in the Elysee could actually make a deal between Britain and the European Union easier. Yes, President Macron is a devoted pro-European. His belief in the idea and the institutions of the EU is part of his core. In his election manifesto, he described Brexit as a ""crime"" that will plunge Britain into ""servitude"". As such, he will brook no Brexit-induced dilution of the single market and all its works. After he met the prime minister in February, he told reporters in Downing Street: ""Brexit cannot lead to a kind of optimisation of Britain's relationship with the rest of Europe. I am very determined that there will be no undue advantages."" Macron will thus, so the argument goes, stiffen sinews in Brussels and re-invigorate the Franco-German motor that has lain dormant in recent years. He has made utterly clear that he wants Britain to pay top whack when it exits the EU. He has spoken of reforming the Le Touquet agreement that allows British immigration officers to check passports in Calais. And he has been shameless in his ambition to lure French workers and money back to France. So Macron on paper could look like no friend of Britain in the Brexit stakes. And yet his election is actually better news for Theresa May than she might imagine. Theresa May will face tough Brexit negotiations with France's new president Some Conservative ministers had been quite open in their preference for Francois Fillon, the former centre-right candidate with whom they had more natural, partisan commonalities. But they know they can live with Macron. The new president is not going to be as Brexit obsessed as some imagine. He has other fish to fry. He has to build support and coalitions in the National Assembly where polls suggest his new party may struggle to form a majority in next month's elections. He has huge economic problems to deal with at home. And his efforts in Brussels will be focused on gaining support for his own proposals to reform the EU and the eurozone. Brexit is just one issue on his to-do list. His priority is dealing with France's difficulties and stopping Marine Le Pen winning in 2022. Now, of course, when President Macron does focus on Brexit, he will naturally be tough on Britain. But that is already the position of the French government. Whitehall has long ruled out any favours from Paris. In many ways, Macron represents continuity. And just think of the alternative. If Marine Le Pen had won, the EU would be in chaos. The EU's focus may have shifted from Brexit had Marine Le Pen won the French presidency Her election would have been seen by some as an existential threat to the EU. Brexit would have become a second order issue. EU politicians would have had less bandwidth to spend on Brexit. And as such, a deal would have been less likely, or at the very least much harder. Compare that to the stability that a Macron presidency may provide. For here is the real point. The election of Macron may just make the EU a little more confident or perhaps a little less defensive. Many in the EU will conclude - maybe over-optimistically - that the global populist surge has now peaked with Trump and Brexit. The electoral failure of anti-establishment politicians in Austria, the Netherlands and now France will give them hope that the troubled EU project is not quite so threatened as they had imagined. They may feel a little less fearful that Brexit could presage the breakup of the EU. And a less vulnerable EU may feel less determined to make an example of Britain in the negotiations. And that can only be good for Brexit, however hard or soft you want it. So the election of President Macron will of course send shivers of relief through the corridors of Brussels. But it won't make the challenge of Brexit any more enormous than it already is. And just perhaps, it might make the task a little easier.

Why are TV singing contests still popular?,"Pitch Battle's judging panel will include Will Young and Bebe Rexha - who sang vocals on David Guetta and Nicki Minaj hit Hey Mama Pitch Battle will become the latest singing contest set to hit our TV screens this summer but, 16 years on from ITV's Popstars, why is the format still so strong? Putting Kelis, Gareth Malone, Chaka Khan and Mel Giedroyc together in the same room is, quite simply, a magnificent idea. Having clearly recognised this, BBC One has dulyrecruitedthis dream team to appear in its upcoming singing contest Pitch Battle. Judges Kelis and Malone will be joined by a different guest judge each week, with Chaka Khan, Will Young, Bebe Rexha and Seal lined up to critique the contestants. Choirs and a capella groups will be pitted against each other in a format you just might recognise from the many, many other talent shows which have preceded it. ""I remember seeing Popstars back in 2001 and it being a genuinely fresh and exciting idea,"" says Julia Raeside, TV critic for The Guardian. Hear'Say, made up of (l-r) Noel Sullivan, Suzanne Shaw, Myleene Klass, Kym Marsh and Danny Foster, won the first series of Popstars in 2001 ""To watch the hopes and dreams of these young kids, it didn't feel quite so manipulated back then, and the concept of a judge being a bit of a villain was relatively new."" But, perhaps inevitably, the success of the show sparked a new wave of singing contests such as Popstars: The Rivals, Pop Idol, The X Factor and The Voice. A number of successful groups and singers such as Girls Aloud, Little Mix, Leona Lewis and Olly Murs came out of these shows over the years - but there were also plenty of potential careers which never took off. The Observer's pop critic Kitty Empire says: ""If you are an artist, quite often going on TV talent shows might not be the best idea for your career, because for every One Direction there are a thousand No Directions. ""If you want a career in music, that sometimes doesn't happen as a result of going on a talent show. However, if you're more versatile and more willing to go on the West End stage, you can certainly turn the TV exposure to your advantage."" It's true - there are plenty of contestants who applied for talent contests as singers, and ended up taking their careers in totally different directions after receiving the TV exposure. Rylan released an autobiography, The Life of Rylan, last year Rylan-Clark Neal was something of a novelty act in the 2012 series of the show, but has gone on to be a successful TV presenter and even released an autobiography last year. Elsewhere, 2005 X Factor winner Shayne Ward and Popstars' Kym Marsh can now be seen acting in Coronation Street. While Marsh's bandmate Myleene Klass is now a radio presenter and X Factor 2008 victor Alexandra Burke has starred in multiple theatre productions. Certainly some of these former contestants have had success, but Empire points out: ""There is a wider issue of whether great art is being made. ""For a country that produced people like David Bowie, who is universally acclaimed, we're not seeing that quality of talent on TV shows. ""People are just entertained by these programmes, and a singing contest is something that lends itself to TV watching by all generations. It gets kids and grandparents in front of the TV, in an age when most people are on YouTube. ""So it's much more about the format being successful TV than it is about creating meaningful musical careers."" A successful TV format it clearly is, but it's perhaps surprising that 16 years on from Popstars, singing contests continue to dominate TV schedules. Girls Aloud formed after winning Popstars: The Rivals in 2002 ""I understand the heavy reliance on singing contests - the idea that a show needs a result to make you tune in for the next instalment,"" Raeside says. ""But I think it's a shame that, by now, light entertainment producers haven't come up with something to replace it. She adds: ""I used to work in TV development, and the wheels do tend to move quite slowly. ""Back then, they were trying to work out what was going to be the next Big Brother. Similarly, these singing shows have a shelf life, and some would argue they've already reached their sell by date."" Empire agrees: ""Increasingly now the talent show formula can get a little tired, and I think many people have realised winning these shows perhaps isn't always the best thing to do. ""In Britain we particularly embrace this format, partly because we love an underdog story, like Paul Potts [the mobile phone salesman who won the first series of Britain's got Talent]. ""In America, the underdog stories don't play so well - it's the shiniest people with the straightest teeth who win. Whereas in Britain we love unlikely success stories, so it really serves our market. The Pitch Perfect films sparked renewed interest in a capella singing Looking ahead to Pitch Battle, Raeside says she can see the appeal of using choirs instead of individual singers to attract viewers and thinks it's a good way to get more mileage out of the talent show format. ""There was something quite shrieky about a show like The Voice, because it's one singer trying to make their mark in a 90-second audition, and there's something unrelaxing about watching that,"" she says. ""When you watch a choir it has a much more positive feeling, so it could have the edge over a show where teenagers are trying to get their break."" Empire agrees that, on paper at least, Pitch Battle ""looks like it's a winner"". ""Before Glee, it was a very American phenomenon, but now people getting together and harmonising doesn't seem like such a weird thing to do anymore,"" she says. ""The idea that there will be choirs and a capella groups battling it out means that you're getting quite a variety of people into the TV studio, and presumably they'll be doing mash ups and cover versions, so I can see how the format has been thought up to appeal to the broadest audience."" But, Raeside adds: ""I don't know how much longer these shows can keep going for. I can't see where else they'd take this format now, it feels like we're coming to the end of the line.""

Facebook - the secret election weapon,"Facebook was a key influencer in the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit vote, according to those who ran the campaigns. But critics say it is a largely unregulated form of campaigning. Those in charge of the digital campaigns for Donald Trump's Republican Party and the political consultant behind Leave EU's referendum strategy are clear the social network was decisive in both wins. Political strategist Gerry Gunster, from Leave EU,told BBC Panoramathat Facebook was a game changer for convincing voters to back Brexit. ""You can say to Facebook, 'I would like to make sure that I can micro-target that fisherman, in certain parts of the UK, so that they are specifically hearing that if you vote to leave you will be able to change the way that the regulations are set for the fishing industry'. This video can not be played BBC Panorama's Darragh MacIntyre asks Facebook whether they have made money from fake news. ""Now I can do the exact same thing for people who live in the Midlands who are struggling because the factory has shut down. So I may send a specific message through Facebook to them that nobody else sees."" Gary Coby, the director of advertising for the Republican Party, says Facebook was also the key to Trump's victory. He said the party used data about potential voters to reach them on social media, adding: ""So if you are on Facebook, I can then match you and put you into a bucket of users that I can then target."" Mr Coby confirmed the official Trump campaign alone had spent in the region of $70m on Facebook over the election period. ""The way we bought media on Facebook was like no one else in politics has ever done."" Panorama has also been told Facebook had teams of people working directly with both the Democratic and Republican campaigns. Targeted campaigning helped the Leave campaign get its message to voters Simon Milner, Facebook's head of policy UK, confirmed that people from Facebook worked with the two campaigns, but declined to say how many. ""One of the things we are absolutely there to do is to help people make use of Facebook products. We do have people whose role is to help politicians and governments make good use of Facebook. ""I can't give you the number of exactly how many people worked with these campaigns. But I can tell you that it was completely demand driven, so it was really up to the campaigns."" The social network says it complies with all regulations but the platform, which is also expected to play a key role in the British general election on 8 June, has been criticised for being unaccountable when it comes to politics. Teams of people from Facebook were working on both Trump and Hillary Clinton's campaigns A quarter of the world's population now use Facebook, including 32 million people in the UK. Many use Facebook to stay in touch with family and friends and are unaware that it has become an important political player. For example, the videos that appear in people's news feeds can be promoted by political parties and campaigners. The far-right group, Britain First, has told Panorama how it paid Facebook to repeatedly promote its videos. It now has more than 1.6 million Facebook followers. Damian Collins, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in the outgoing parliament, says Facebook needs to be more accountable.

Japan's obsession with a redheaded orphan,"The entrance to Canadian World in Hokkaido, Japan With two red braids hanging from her straw hat, Anne of Green Gables may just be the most recognisable ginger-haired girl in the world. But in Japan, the orphan from Prince Edward Island is more than just a quaint Canadian import - she's a national heroine. As he approached the farmhouse with the forest green shutters and opened the old-fashioned wooden door, Terry Dawes readied himself for what he was about to see inside. Having grown up in Prince Edward Island, Canada's smallest province, Mr Dawes had visited the famous ""Green Gables"" historic site many times throughout his life. But this building that Mr Dawes was about to enter wasn't that house at all - it was an exact replica built 9,700km away, in Hokkaido, Japan. At its peak, the house - one of the main attractions at Japan's Canadian World theme park - drew 40,000 visitors a day. Now, the park is largely abandoned, a ghost of Japan's economic heyday in the 1990s. ""I've sort of likened it to having a dream, like an uncanny dream, where you're walking down a familiar street but something's off,"" Mr Dawes told the BBC. The house of Green Gables in Hokkaido, Japan is an exact replica of the real house in Prince Edward Island. The very existence of the Green Gables replica, and of Canadian World itself, is a testament to Japan's deep love for Anne of Green Gables, says Mr Dawes, who visited Japan in 2014 to film a documentary on that subject. This love began just before the outbreak of the Second World War, when a Canadian missionary gave her student Hanako Muraoka a copy of the book. It continues to this day with an anime series, manga comics and several Japanese movies inspired by the story. In this way, Anne became not just a Western cultural import, but a part of Japanese culture itself, interpreted and re-interpreted by Japanese artists and writers for a primarily Japanese audience. ""Generally speaking, we are good at imitating,"" says Yukari Yoshihara, a literature teacher at the University of Tsukuba who includes Anne in her first-year curriculum. ""Anne of Green Gables is a part of this larger culture of adaptations."" The enduring lure of Anne of Green Gables Why is Canadian English so unique? Anne is popular with Japanese women especially, Ms Yoshihara says, because the world of Green Gables is filled with ""kawaii"", which means the quality of being cute, romantic and beautiful in Japanese. ""They love the story because it is full of beautiful scenery and puff sleeves and cute things, like tea parties,"" she says. A Japanese tourist takes a photo outside the real Green Gables house in Canada in 2011. But not everyone who loves Anne is a girl. Go Takahashi, a student of Ms Yoshihara's, is also a devoted fan of Anne and is writing his university thesis on the books. ""I like Anne's character. I feel attracted to a person who talks a lot, makes a little trouble, and considers others' feelings. So Anne is perfect for me,"" he said. Take a ride on Japan's ultra-luxurious train Why a middle-aged man in Japan is hiring himself out for friendship Like many other Japanese readers of the Anne stories, Mr Takahashi has made the pilgrimage to Prince Edward Island, where he visited many of the sites written about in the books - the original Green Gables house, Lovers Lane and the Haunted Wood. About 3,500 Japanese tourists visit Prince Edward Island - population 150,000 - annually, which makes Japan one of the largest source of overseas tourism on the island. ""They come for weddings, they come to see the wildflowers, they come for theatrical or musical offerings,"" says the province's Premier Wade MacLauchlan. Tourism from Japan tends to spike when a new Anne-related production is broadcast. Premier MacLauchlan expects Netflix's new series, Anne, will draw large crowds once it launches on 12 May. The co-production with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is helmed by Breaking Bad alumna Moira Walley-Beckett, and makes ample use of the book's feminist subtext, choosing to portray Anne more as a survivor than a saint. Anne (Amybeth McNulty) waits at the train station in the latest retelling of Anne of Green Gables, airing on CBC and coming to Netflix 12 May. This subtext is also essential in Japan, Ms Yoshihara says. In class, she likes to teach Anne because the book is a kind of gateway for getting students to talk about gender, which is often considered taboo in Japanese society. ""We do not usually teach kids about how gender is related to our day to day issues, like education, or fashion or how we behave,"" she says. It's for this reason that Anne was probably published in Japan in the first place, she adds. Citing Japanese scholar Hiromi Ochi, Ms Yoshihara explains that Anne may have been a key part of America's plan to rapidly democratise Japan after the war. Published in 1952 by Muraoka, who translated the story secretly during the war, the book was widely distributed in libraries run by theUS State Department in Allied-occupied Japan,external. Its central story, about an orphan girl who proves her heart and mind is just as good as any boy's, served as a kind of benign liberal propaganda aimed at freeing women from traditional Japanese gender roles, she says. Anne (Amybeth McNulty) stands on the cliffs of Prince Edward Island It seems that core reading of Anne is still prevalent today. In his interviews with Anne fans in Japan, Mr Dawes heard over and over again how people, especially women, identified with her. ""I think Anne Shirley provides a way of acting out, to a point, without ever transgressing fully,"" he says. ""Ultimately, she does the right thing by her family, her adopted family."" Anne is both a conformist and revolutionary, a romantic and a radical. ""In a sense we are tricked into believing that Anne of Green Gables is a dream story of liberation,"" Ms Yoshihara says, laughing. But that doesn't mean Anne is loved any less.

Corruption and North Korea ignite S Korea poll,"Moon Jae-in (left) and Ahn Cheol-soo are the main rivals in an election which could see South Korea move to the left South Koreans will elect a new president on Tuesday, months ahead of schedule, after a corruption scandal that felled conservative President Park Geun-hye. The poll comes amid major tensions with North Korea, rising youth unemployment and bubbling anger among the electorate over corruption. Liberal Moon Jae-in, a human rights lawyer, has dominated opinion polls and is the clear front-runner.  His closest rivals are Ahn Cheol-soo, a centre-left IT multi-millionaire, and Hong Joon-pyo, the ruling party candidate. Record numbers cast their ballots in early voting last week and turn-out is expected to be high. South Korea is still reeling fromthe money-for-influence scandalthat engulfed the former president, who is currently awaiting trial after being impeached. Huge crowds had protested against Ms Park, amid anger over inequality and the perceived privilege of South Korea's elite. During months of protests older voters came out in support of her, however, exposing a deep generational divide. Whoever wins the election will have to reunite society and tackle the economic and social mobility issues that have energised the youth vote. Last year, youth unemployment stood at 9.8%, highlighting job-seeking challenges for young people. North Korea, meanwhile, remains a pressing challenge. Pyongyang has upped the pace of missile tests in recent months and many expect a sixth nuclear test soon. US leader Donald Trump has adopted a hard-line stance and tensions are at their highest level in years. The next South Korean leader will need to create a workable relationship with both Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party is out in front of his rivals.  An aide to former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, he is trying his chances again after losing to Ms Park in 2012. A student activist, he was expelled from law school in the 1970s after leading a protest against Ms Park's father, strongman President Park Chung-Hee. After qualifying, he worked as a human rights lawyers for years before entering politics when Mr Roh was elected president. Domestically, he has talked of tackling the perceived untouchability of South Korea's huge family-run conglomerates and their cosy ties with the government. On North Korea, he has called for a new vision to achieve peace, one that potentially includes economic engagement - something that critics say channels funds to Pyongyang's nuclear programme. His position on the US missile system, Thaad, remains unclear, but he was critical of the move to roll it out last month. His spokesman called it ""very inappropriate"" as it stripped the next government of the right to make its own decision on the system. Early voting took place between 3-5 May - and high numbers turned out Mr Moon's most prominent rival is Ahn Cheol-soo, a software tycoon and co-founder of the centre-left People's Party. Nicknamed ""Korea's Bill Gates"", Mr Ahn has portrayed himself as above the corruption that has plagued the political scene. He has described himself as a ""conservative in security issues and a reformist in economic affairs"". On North Korea, he advocates pressure and dialogue to bring Pyongyang to the negotiating table. He was initially opposed to Thaad but has since said that he will respect an agreement made between countries. A third candidate who has slowly gained popularity is Hong Joon-pyo, from the conservative Liberty Korea Party. This is the party of the impeached Ms Park, previously known as the Saenuri Party. He says national security is top of his agenda. Who are the candidates? 'Life or death' election North Korea is threatening to increase its nuclear and ballistic missile capacity Though North Korea dominates dialogue on the international stage, for South Koreans it is domestic issues - jobs, transparency, good governance - where they want the new leadership to make rapid improvements. According toa survey by RealMeter,external, 27.5% said the key issue for them was a candidate's willingness to resolve corruption issues, followed by economic and livelihood issues at 24.5% and national security at 18.5%. But many commentators say the leading candidates have not provided detailed policies. On North Korea, the incoming president will have to contend with a leader in Pyongyang committed to the development of nuclear weapons, a bullish White House that has suggested military action could be on the table if tensions escalate and an electorate that could be caught in the crossfire. Initiating a policy of economic engagement could be very challenging amid these circumstances, analysts suggest. Balancing ties with the US - Seoul's traditional ally - will also be made more complicated by China's furious reaction to the Thaad deployment. Seoul and Washington say the system is aimed at safeguarding against attacks from North Korea, but Beijing says the missile system infringes on its own security and has initiated a number of informal economic sanctions. Mr Trump, meanwhile, recently suggested South Korea should pay for the system, causing consternation in the host nation. He's also threatened to scrap a ""horrible"" free-trade deal between the two.

Rupert Murdoch gives robust response to BBC questions,"This video can not be played The media mogul was leaving work in Manhattan, New York As Ofcom explores whether Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox should be allowed to press on with its planned takeover of Sky, we thought the company might agree to an interview with the BBC. But they said no. So we paid Rupert Murdoch a surprise visit at his headquarters in Manhattan. Outside the Fox News building, I asked him if he was worried about whether Ofcom would take a close interest in what's happening at his cable news network as it made its decision. First he waved a finger at me and responded: ""You should be worried about what's happening at the BBC."" But once inside his car, he clarified: ""Nothing's happening at Fox News. Nothing."" Murdoch's claim that there was nothing going on at Fox News, (aside from the ""record ratings"" he was very keen to mention) put me in mind of the wonderful Monty Python sketch about what the Romans have ever done for us. Alas I didn't have time to engage him more fully, but I suppose I could have said that -  aside from the departures of the founder and chief executive, and the most high-profile and popular host on the channel, and the co-president who was a senior figure for decades - then, yes, nothing's happening at Fox News. Rupert Murdoch answers questions outside his New York offices Except of course, for the 20-plus legal actions that are now lodged against Fox News, from former employees claiming to be victims of racial and sexual harassment. Oh, and the internal investigation by legal firm Paul, Weiss, which unearthed such things as caused the aforementioned senior figures to depart. The allegations against O'Reilly and Ailes are strongly denied by them, and there are no allegations against Bill Shine. So apart from all that, yes I suppose there is nothing going on at Fox News. Oh, but forgive me - there's also the federal investigation into whether or not they concealed from investors the details of settlement payments for alleged harassment. Apart, then, from the departures of Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly, and Bill Shine, the federal investigation, an internal investigation, dozens of claims of sexual or racial harassment, an advertising boycott following the New York Times's brilliant investigation into O'Reilly, and a month of terrible headlines, I suppose it is true to say that ""nothing's happening at Fox News. Nothing."" As for the instinctive threat that it's the BBC that should be worried, I blame myself for this. Instead of saying ""Amol Rajan, BBC News"", I should have said - channelling my innerTroy McClure,external- ""You may remember, Rupert, we first met at Barry Diller's garden party in Los Angeles during Oscars weekend in 2015, but then Graydon Carter sauntered over to say hi with Anjelica Houston, and I just couldn't compete."" I can't blame Mr Murdoch: faced with a choice between speaking to myself, or Graydon Carter and Anjelica Houston, I would definitely have chosen the latter option. No wonder I didn't leave much of an impression. Had I done so, perhaps we could have conversed like old pals. Instead, Mr Murdoch simply told me that he was ""not worried at all"" about what's happening. But his family and company's long-standing desire to take full control of Sky makes the timing of this scandal, and the series of visitors to Ofcom, rather annoying. That's not to say that Ofcom will indeed rule against the latest bid for full control of Sky. There is, after all, a strong response from 21st Century Fox. In several conversations in Manhattan with those following this story closely, including representatives of Fox, the message comes back loud and clear, even if it is contradicted by Mr Murdoch's comment to me. That message is that Fox has taken swift and decisive action; that the allegations remain unproven; that there is so much more to Fox than Rupert Murdoch; and that the generational change now under way is harbinger of a very different corporate culture. Lawyer Douglas Wigdor will give evidence to Ofcom this week Even if all that is true - and of course there are many who say it is rubbish - the man at the top was not on message when I spoke to him as he left work, doubtless to the annoyance of those trying to maintain message discipline on this ever-spreading scandal. Douglas Wigdor, the lawyer representing more than 20 of the individuals who have launched cases against Fox, told me that Fox only got rid of O'Reilly because of the looming Ofcom scrutiny and because the advertising boycott was hurting them financially. Fox vigorously denies these claims. The trouble for the company is that, on Thursday, Wigdor is going to spend rather a long time in the inner sanctum of Ofcom providing the kind of detail that cannot be good news for the Murdochs' latest bid.

Why May is keeping immigration target,"Privately lots of Tories have said for years, six years in fact, that the chances of getting immigration down to under 100,000 were small. And for as long as we were in the European Union, the UK government had no way of guaranteeing it would happen in any case. The job prospects for young Spaniards, Poles, Italians, were arguably a bigger determinant for UK immigration than anything the UK government could do about European immigration at least. Election live: Rolling text and video updates PM: Immigration target still important UKIP want 'one in, one out' migration For as long as we have freedom of movement, part of the deal of being in the EU, we can't put a limit on the numbers, nor the rest of the EU put a limit on the number of Brits who could move around the EU. It's also worth saying that immigration from the rest of the world, on its own, has also been well over the target of ""tens of thousands"" - and remember, that's the bit that is easier to control. You can see the numbers here, since the Tories came into government in 2010: Year ending Dec 2010: 77,000 (EU)       217,000 (non-EU) YE Dec 2011: 82,000 (EU)    204,000 (non-EU) YE Dec 2012: 82,000 (EU)    157,000 (non-EU) YE Dec 2013: 123,000 (EU)    143,000 (non-EU) YE Dec 2014: 174,000 (EU)    194,000 (non-EU) YE Dec 2015: 184,000 (EU)    189,000 (non-EU) YE Sep 2016: 165,000 (EU)    165,000 (non-EU) Once we are out of the EU, controlling those numbers will in theory be easier. It will be the UK that decides how many people can come from around Europe, as they currently do with the rest of the world. But while Theresa May has staunchly recommitted to the target she, as home secretary, missed for six years in a row, ministers have been also busy reassuring businesses they will be able to get the people they need, whether builders, bankers, or fruit pickers. If the economy needs them, they will be allowed to come. That doesn't sound like a recipe for getting the numbers down to Theresa May's preferred level. And even though we are on our way out of the EU, there is still huge scepticism over whether the target is remotely achievable. So why keep it? Sometimes in politics it's useful to ponder what would happen if they did the opposite. Ditch the immigration target after the referendum when public concern about the levels was so obvious? Ditch it when the Tories want to pick up as many former UKIP voters as possible? Ditch it when Theresa May has spent years, with limited success, trying different ways of getting it down? One source told me ""it's just too ingrained"". The political, if not the pragmatic, reasons for keeping it become clear pretty fast. Whether the target is suddenly achievable however is an entirely different debate.

Why are TV singing contests still a thing?,"Pitch Battle's judging panel will include Will Young and Bebe Rexha - who sang vocals on David Guetta and Nicki Minaj hit Hey Mama Pitch Battle will become the latest singing contest set to hit our TV screens this summer but, 16 years on from ITV's Popstars, why is the format still so strong? Putting Kelis, Gareth Malone, Chaka Khan and Mel Giedroyc together in the same room is, quite simply, a magnificent idea. Having clearly recognised this, BBC One has dulyrecruitedthis dream team to appear in its upcoming singing contest Pitch Battle. Judges Kelis and Malone will be joined by a different guest judge each week, with Chaka Khan, Will Young, Bebe Rexha and Seal lined up to critique the contestants. Choirs and a capella groups will be pitted against each other in a format you just might recognise from the many, many other talent shows which have preceded it. ""I remember seeing Popstars back in 2001 and it being a genuinely fresh and exciting idea,"" says Julia Raeside, TV critic for The Guardian. Hear'Say, made up of (l-r) Noel Sullivan, Suzanne Shaw, Myleene Klass, Kym Marsh and Danny Foster, won the first series of Popstars in 2001 ""To watch the hopes and dreams of these young kids, it didn't feel quite so manipulated back then, and the concept of a judge being a bit of a villain was relatively new."" But, perhaps inevitably, the success of the show sparked a new wave of singing contests such as Popstars: The Rivals, Pop Idol, The X Factor and The Voice. A number of successful groups and singers such as Girls Aloud, Little Mix, Leona Lewis and Olly Murs came out of these shows over the years - but there were also plenty of potential careers which never took off. The Observer's pop critic Kitty Empire says: ""If you are an artist, quite often going on TV talent shows might not be the best idea for your career, because for every One Direction there are a thousand No Directions. ""If you want a career in music, that sometimes doesn't happen as a result of going on a talent show. However, if you're more versatile and more willing to go on the West End stage, you can certainly turn the TV exposure to your advantage."" It's true - there are plenty of contestants who applied for talent contests as singers, and ended up taking their careers in totally different directions after receiving the TV exposure. Rylan released an autobiography, The Life of Rylan, last year Rylan-Clark Neal was something of a novelty act in the 2012 series of the show, but has gone on to be a successful TV presenter and even released an autobiography last year. Elsewhere, 2005 X Factor winner Shayne Ward and Popstars' Kym Marsh can now be seen acting in Coronation Street. While Marsh's bandmate Myleene Klass is now a radio presenter and X Factor 2008 victor Alexandra Burke has starred in multiple theatre productions. Certainly some of these former contestants have had success, but Empire points out: ""There is a wider issue of whether great art is being made. ""For a country that produced people like David Bowie, who is universally acclaimed, we're not seeing that quality of talent on TV shows. ""People are just entertained by these programmes, and a singing contest is something that lends itself to TV watching by all generations. It gets kids and grandparents in front of the TV, in an age when most people are on YouTube. ""So it's much more about the format being successful TV than it is about creating meaningful musical careers."" A successful TV format it clearly is, but it's perhaps surprising that 16 years on from Popstars, singing contests continue to dominate TV schedules. Girls Aloud formed after winning Popstars: The Rivals in 2002 ""I understand the heavy reliance on singing contests - the idea that a show needs a result to make you tune in for the next instalment,"" Raeside says. ""But I think it's a shame that, by now, light entertainment producers haven't come up with something to replace it. She adds: ""I used to work in TV development, and the wheels do tend to move quite slowly. ""Back then, they were trying to work out what was going to be the next Big Brother. Similarly, these singing shows have a shelf life, and some would argue they've already reached their sell by date."" Empire agrees: ""Increasingly now the talent show formula can get a little tired, and I think many people have realised winning these shows perhaps isn't always the best thing to do. ""In Britain we particularly embrace this format, partly because we love an underdog story, like Paul Potts [the mobile phone salesman who won the first series of Britain's got Talent]. ""In America, the underdog stories don't play so well - it's the shiniest people with the straightest teeth who win. Whereas in Britain we love unlikely success stories, so it really serves our market. The Pitch Perfect films sparked renewed interest in a capella singing Looking ahead to Pitch Battle, Raeside says she can see the appeal of using choirs instead of individual singers to attract viewers and thinks it's a good way to get more mileage out of the talent show format. ""There was something quite shrieky about a show like The Voice, because it's one singer trying to make their mark in a 90-second audition, and there's something unrelaxing about watching that,"" she says. ""When you watch a choir it has a much more positive feeling, so it could have the edge over a show where teenagers are trying to get their break."" Empire agrees that, on paper at least, Pitch Battle ""looks like it's a winner"". ""Before Glee, it was a very American phenomenon, but now people getting together and harmonising doesn't seem like such a weird thing to do anymore,"" she says. ""The idea that there will be choirs and a capella groups battling it out means that you're getting quite a variety of people into the TV studio, and presumably they'll be doing mash ups and cover versions, so I can see how the format has been thought up to appeal to the broadest audience."" But, Raeside adds: ""I don't know how much longer these shows can keep going for. I can't see where else they'd take this format now, it feels like we're coming to the end of the line.""

How the gramophone changed everything,"Who is the best paid solo singer in the world? In 2015,according to Forbes,external, it was probably Elton John, who reportedly made $100m (Â£79m). U2 apparently made twice as much as that, but there are four of them. There's only one Elton John. If we'd asked that question 215 years ago, the answer would have been Mrs Elizabeth Billington, to some the greatest English soprano who ever lived. Sir Joshua Reynolds once painted Mrs Billington holding a book of music, listening to a choir of angels. The composer Joseph Haydn thought the portrait an injustice: the angels, said Haydn, should have been listening to her. Elizabeth Billington was something of a sensation offstage too. A scurrilous biography of her sold out in less than a day. It contained what were purportedly copies of intimate letters about her famous lovers - including, they say, the Prince of Wales. Such was her fame, she attracted a bidding war for her performances. The managers of London's leading opera houses at the time - Covent Garden and Drury Lane - fought so desperately for her that she ended up singing at both venues, alternating between the two, pulling in at least Â£10,000 in the 1801 season. It was a remarkable sum. But in today's terms, it's a mere Â£687,000, or about $1m - just 1% of Elton John's earnings. So why is Elton John worth 100 Elizabeth Billingtons? 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Almost 60 years after Elizabeth Billington's death, the great economist Alfred Marshall analysed the impact of the electric telegraph, which then connected America, Britain, India, and Australia. Thanks to such modern communications, he wrote: ""Men who have once attained a commanding position are enabled to apply their constructive or speculative genius to undertakings vaster, and extending over a wide area, than ever before."" The world's top industrialists were getting richer, faster. The gap between themselves and less outstanding entrepreneurs was growing. But not every profession's best and brightest could gain in the same way, Marshall said. Take the performing arts. ""[The] number of persons who can be reached by a human voice,"" he wrote, ""is strictly limited."" And so, in consequence, was vocalists' earning power. But just two years later, in 1877, Thomas Edison applied for a patent for his phonograph, the first machine that could both record and reproduce the human voice. Nobody seemed quite sure what to do with the technology at first. The French publisher Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville had already developed the phonoautograph, a device intended to provide a visual record of the sound of a human voice - a little like a seismograph records an earthquake. But it doesn't seem to have occurred to Martinville that one might try to convert the recording back into sound again. Soon enough, the application of the new technology became clear: you could record the best singers in the world, and sell the recordings. At first, making a recording was a bit like making carbon copies on a typewriter: a single performance could be captured on only three or four phonographs at once. In the 1890s, there was great demand to hear a song by the American singer George W Johnson. He reportedly spent day after day singing the same song till his voice gave out - but even singing it 50 times a day churned out a mere 200 records. When Emile Berliner introduced recordings on a disc, rather than Edison's cylinder, it opened the way to mass-production. Then came radio and film. Performers such as Charlie Chaplin could reach a global market just as easily as the men of industry described by Alfred Marshall. For the Charlie Chaplins and Elton Johns of the world, new technologies meant wider fame and more money. But for the journeymen singers, it was a disaster. In Elizabeth Billington's day, many half-decent singers made a living performing in music halls. After all, Billington herself could sing in only one hall at a time. But when you can listen to the best performers in the world at home, why pay to hear a merely competent act in person? Thomas Edison's phonograph led the way towards a winner-take-all dynamic in the performing industry. The top performers went from earning like Mrs Billington to earning like Elton John. But the only-slightly-less good went from making a comfortable living to struggling to pay their bills: small gaps in quality became vast gaps in income. In 1981, an economist called Sherwin Rosen called this phenomenon ""the superstar economy"". Imagine, he said, the fortune that Mrs Billington might have made if there had been phonographs in 1801. Satellite television has massively boosted the average wages of Premier League players versus those in the lower divisions Technological innovations have created superstar economics in other sectors, too. Satellite television has been to footballers what the gramophone was to musicians, or the telegraph to 19th Century industrialists. If you were the world's best footballer a few decades ago, no more than a stadium-full of fans could have seen you play every week. Now, your every move can be watched by hundreds of millions on every continent. And as the market for football expanded, so has the gap in pay between the very best and the merely very good. Just Google it: The student project that changed the world Tick tock: The importance of knowing the right time How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff What the rise of the robots means for us all As recently in the 1980s, footballers in English football's top tier used to earn twice as much as those in the third tier, playing for - say - the 50th best team in the country. Now, average wages in the Premier League are 25 times those earned by the players two divisions down. Technological shifts can dramatically change who gets what, and they are wrenching because they can be so abrupt - and because the people concerned have the same skills as before, but suddenly have very different earning power. Throughout the 20th Century, new innovations - the cassette, the CD, the DVD - maintained the economic model created by the gramophone. But at the end of the century came the MP3 format, and fast internet connections. Suddenly, you didn't have to spend Â£10 on a plastic disc to hear your favourite music - you could find it online, free. David Bowie recognised the seismic effect digital technology would have on the music industry In 2002, David Bowie warned his fellow musicians that they were facing a very different future. ""Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity,"" he said. ""You'd better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that's really the only unique situation that's going to be left."" Bowie seems to have been right. Artists have stopped using concert tickets as a way to sell albums, and started using albums as a way to sell concert tickets. But we haven't returned to the days of Mrs Billington. Amplification, stadium rock, global tours and endorsement deals mean that the most admired musicians can still profit from a vast audience. Inequality remains alive and well - the top 1% of artists take more than five times more money from concerts than the bottom 95% put together. The gramophone may be passe, but the ability of technological progress to change who wins - and who loses - persists.

The hospital errors leaving new parents devastated,"This video can not be played 'Our baby son died due to NHS error' More than 1,400 mistakes are being recorded by maternity staff in hospitals in England each week on average. For some families, those errors can have life-changing consequences. ""Every single day we have to live with the fact that we're a victim of the NHS,"" Adam Asquith tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Adam and his fiancee, Sarah Ellis, were expecting their first child in 2014. ""When I first fell pregnant, everything was amazing. We were over the Moon,"" Sarah says. When she went into labour, the pair headed to Calderdale Royal Hospital, in Halifax. But once there, Sarah was left waiting on a busy maternity ward - even though she told staff she was concerned she couldn't feel her baby moving. ""We were left for six hours, we didn't really know anything, they just told us and reassured us that everything was OK,"" she says. Gino was finally delivered by Caesarean section. But Sarah and Adam's joy quickly turned to despair. Sarah and Adam can't understand why so many mistakes were made ""One of the doctors pulled me to one side and just said, 'He's not in a good condition, he was born in a really bad condition, and if he does pull through, he's going to be very badly brain damaged,'"" Adam says. ""I was in the corridor with Sarah's mum and dad and I just said, 'How am I going to tell Sarah that he's not all right?'"" Gino was placed on a life-support machine. But just days later, Sarah and Adam were advised to withdraw treatment. ""The words used were that he was 'unrecoverable' and that was when we knew he wasn't going to get any better,"" she says. ""We had to make a joint decision that we would turn the machines off."" The inquest later showed Sarah should have had an emergency Caesarean section hours before she finally did. A report found medical staff had failed to act on warning signs and Gino had been severely starved of oxygen. The coroner said the hospital had missed four opportunities to save Gino's life. ""Everyone makes mistakes - I do, we all do - but to see so many people make so many different mistakes within six hours is just shocking,"" Sarah says. ""People who you put your trust in, your life is in their hands, and Gino's life was in their hands and they didn't take care of him."" Sarah and Adam decided to take legal action against the hospital trust and were paid compensation. ""Every single day I think, 'Why? Why us?"" Adam says. Lucas was diagnosed with cerebral palsy after being born An investigation by the Victoria Derbyshire programme has found an average of more than 1,400 mistakes a week were recorded in England's NHS maternity units between 2013 and 2016. Figures from 81 NHS trusts out of the 132 in England - obtained through a Freedom of Information request - showed 305,019 adverse incidents had been recorded in the four-year period. These incidents are when unexpected harm, injury or death has occurred, and include anything from records being lost to a mother or baby dying. Figures from 39 trusts, for the same four-year period, showed 259 deaths of mothers or babies had been recorded as avoidable or unexpected. In April,the BBC revealedthat England's Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had ordered an investigation into a number of deaths and other maternity errors at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospital Trust. Seven baby deaths, later deemed as avoidable, took place at the trust between September 2014 and May 2016. Jade Penny, 26, is currently suing her local hospital trust, after her eldest son was left with cerebral palsy. Lucas, now seven, was born three months prematurely, cannot walk or talk and is partially blind and deaf. Jade's lawyers argue that Lucas's brain damage is due to a lack of oxygen when he had his intubation tube replaced. The NHS trust is defending the claim ""Imagine laying down and not being able to breathe, but you can't tell someone,"" Jade says. ""It must be the most horrible thing to go through ever, and he couldn't tell anyone. ""I think that's what upsets me the most. ""He's still alive, but he doesn't have the quality of life that other kids have. ""For the rest of my life, I'm going to be angry. And I'll never ever forgive anyone for that."" The NHS trust is defending the claim. The Department of Health said it could not respond to the figures regarding maternity ward mistakes due to the pre-election purdah period. But it said plans were in place to halve rates of stillbirths, neonatal deaths, maternal deaths and brain injuries in babies by 2030. As part of that, the government has launched a new Â£8m maternity safety training scheme. Writing in October,external, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government had invested almost Â£40m since 2010 to make ""tangible physical improvements"" to maternity units. He said: ""Dedicated and hardworking NHS staff do an incredible job - 24 hours a day, every day of the year - of bringing new babies into the world and achieving great outcomes for women, newborns and their families."" The Royal College of Midwives says safety is being compromised by the pressure maternity services are under. Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the college, said: ""The simple truth is we do not have enough midwives working in them right now, we are also seeing more leaving the profession because of stress and a slight reduction in the number of student midwives training. ""We need to reduce the number of mistakes to an absolute minimum,"" she added. ""We can't deliver the safest possible care if we don't have enough midwives and doctors working here.""

Kenny Rogers prepares to hang up his microphone,"Rogers has sold more than 100 million records It's funny the things you covet most when you are a child - for country music superstar Kenny Rogers it was water sprinklers. Growing up in poverty on a federal housing estate in Houston, Texas, on his walks to and from school he'd go past wealthy houses, and be amazed by the big jets automatically watering the immaculate lawns. So when he first made his millions back in the 1970s, he knew exactly how he would celebrate. Building a massive house with its own 18-hole golf course, he fitted the grounds with hundreds of automated water sprinklers. Now 78, Rogers says: ""I would drive a golf cart out, right into those sprinklers, and it was great fun. ""If I had to pick one word [to describe the feeling], I'd say it was... satisfaction."" Rogers and close friend Dolly Parton had a smash hit in 1983 with Islands in the Stream Currently on a farewell tour in the US, Rogers has been in the music industry for 60 years. Over that time he has released more than 70 albums, and sold more than 100 million records. Thanks to hit songs such as The Gambler, Lady, Coward of the County, and Islands in the Stream (a duet with Dolly Parton), and a parallel acting career, he was a household name in the late 1970s and 1980s. A keen businessman, Rogers has also led several business ventures over the years, mainly in property and the restaurant sector. Married five times, Rogers' divorce settlement to fourth wife Marianne Gordon, pictured, was worth $60m. He says she deserved every cent The successes have brought Rogers wealth he could not have dreamed of as a child, and he is now worth an estimated $250m (Â£195m). But in a story that could be told in a country and western song, he has had some financial rock bottoms along the way. While some business bets failed, and he has had four expensive divorces, Rogers admits that living too extravagantly - even for someone earning a fortune - left him ""broke"" both when he was 30, and again when he was 50. ""You don't think it [wealth] will have that impact on you, but it really did,"" he says. Releasing his first single in 1958, Rogers remembers that he was always focused on the business side of the music industry. He recalls pop singer and mentor Kirby Stone warning him that ""if you don't treat it like a business it'll eat you up"". Rogers first enjoyed popularity in the 1960s So fast-forward to the late 1960s when Rogers was having success as the lead singer in the psychedelic rock band Kenny Rogers And The First Edition, he was happy for the group to promote US aluminium giant Alcoa. Going solo again in 1976 Rogers  says he wanted to release pure country albums to match those of artists he admired, such as Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard, but because he didn't think he could be as good as them he came up with a different plan. ""I really studied the music business, and I realised there's only two ways to compete,"" he says. ""You can do what everybody else is doing and do it better - and I didn't like my chances - or you could do something nobody else is doing, and you don't invite comparison."" Rogers has joked in interviews that he would probably look worse without the plastic surgery So instead of recording pure country albums, Rogers developed his own sound - a country and pop crossover - that sold by the bucketload. ""I did something different, and I was lucky it was successful."" Fast-forward to the 1990s, and with his record sales slowing, Rogers was spending more time looking after his business interests. In 1991 he launched what would ultimately turn out to be his most high-profile business failure - rotisserie chicken restaurant chain Kenny Rogers Roasters (KRR). Rogers was inducted to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2013 Co-owned with a former boss of Kentucky Fried Chicken, KRR was initially a great success, and grew strongly. Within five years it had more than 400 restaurants across the US, Canada, the Middle East and Asia, and was so well-known in the US that it was even the central focus of one episode of hit comedy show Seinfeld. However, the chain had over-expanded, and in 1998 had to file for bankruptcy protection. KRR no longer has any restaurants in North America, but now Malaysian owned, it is still popular in Asia, and Rogers receives annual payments. He says: ""It's a good product. They are still using my name. God bless 'em you know."" Rogers performed at the UK's Glastonbury Festival in 2013 In 1998 Rogers' music was introduced to a new audience when cult movie The Big Lebowski made good use of his version of the song Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In). It helped put more younger faces in the crowd as he continued to tour intensively. Despite his enduring love of performing, Rogers says his current tour really will be his last because he wants to retire to spend more time with his wife Wanda and their 12-year-old twin sons. While Wanda is Rogers' fifth wife, and 28 years younger than him, they have now been married for 20 years. Rogers says he is looking forward to spending more time with his wife and kids Musicology professor Mark Samples from Central Washington University says that Rogers is a great example of a ""star 20th Century performer"" who was able to diversify his business interests ""beyond just playing music"". ""He leveraged his musical brand as a down-to-earth, world-wise, straight-talker into multiple successful film characters, and even a chain of fast food restaurants."" As Rogers looks forward to putting his feet up a bit more, his advice for anyone in business or life in general is to do something for a living that ""you care about"". ""I think what it really boils down to for newcomers, the best advice I can give you, is pay your taxes, put 20% away, and then have some fun.""

Japan's obsession with a redhead,"The entrance to Canadian World in Hokkaido, Japan With two red braids hanging from her straw hat, Anne of Green Gables may just be the most recognisable ginger-haired girl in the world. But in Japan, the orphan from Prince Edward Island is more than just a quaint Canadian import - she's a national heroine. As he approached the farmhouse with the forest green shutters and opened the old-fashioned wooden door, Terry Dawes readied himself for what he was about to see inside. Having grown up in Prince Edward Island, Canada's smallest province, Mr Dawes had visited the famous ""Green Gables"" historic site many times throughout his life. But this building that Mr Dawes was about to enter wasn't that house at all - it was an exact replica built 9,700km away, in Hokkaido, Japan. At its peak, the house - one of the main attractions at Japan's Canadian World theme park - drew 40,000 visitors a day. Now, the park is largely abandoned, a ghost of Japan's economic heyday in the 1990s. ""I've sort of likened it to having a dream, like an uncanny dream, where you're walking down a familiar street but something's off,"" Mr Dawes told the BBC. The house of Green Gables in Hokkaido, Japan is an exact replica of the real house in Prince Edward Island. The very existence of the Green Gables replica, and of Canadian World itself, is a testament to Japan's deep love for Anne of Green Gables, says Mr Dawes, who visited Japan in 2014 to film a documentary on that subject. This love began just before the outbreak of the Second World War, when a Canadian missionary gave her student Hanako Muraoka a copy of the book. It continues to this day with an anime series, manga comics and several Japanese movies inspired by the story. In this way, Anne became not just a Western cultural import, but a part of Japanese culture itself, interpreted and re-interpreted by Japanese artists and writers for a primarily Japanese audience. ""Generally speaking, we are good at imitating,"" says Yukari Yoshihara, a literature teacher at the University of Tsukuba who includes Anne in her first-year curriculum. ""Anne of Green Gables is a part of this larger culture of adaptations."" The enduring lure of Anne of Green Gables Why is Canadian English so unique? Anne is popular with Japanese women especially, Ms Yoshihara says, because the world of Green Gables is filled with ""kawaii"", which means the quality of being cute, romantic and beautiful in Japanese. ""They love the story because it is full of beautiful scenery and puff sleeves and cute things, like tea parties,"" she says. A Japanese tourist takes a photo outside the real Green Gables house in Canada in 2011. But not everyone who loves Anne is a girl. Go Takahashi, a student of Ms Yoshihara's, is also a devoted fan of Anne and is writing his university thesis on the books. ""I like Anne's character. I feel attracted to a person who talks a lot, makes a little trouble, and considers others' feelings. So Anne is perfect for me,"" he said. Take a ride on Japan's ultra-luxurious train Why a middle-aged man in Japan is hiring himself out for friendship Like many other Japanese readers of the Anne stories, Mr Takahashi has made the pilgrimage to Prince Edward Island, where he visited many of the sites written about in the books - the original Green Gables house, Lovers Lane and the Haunted Wood. About 3,500 Japanese tourists visit Prince Edward Island - population 150,000 - annually, which makes Japan one of the largest source of overseas tourism on the island. ""They come for weddings, they come to see the wildflowers, they come for theatrical or musical offerings,"" says the province's Premier Wade MacLauchlan. Tourism from Japan tends to spike when a new Anne-related production is broadcast. Premier MacLauchlan expects Netflix's new series, Anne, will draw large crowds once it launches on 12 May. The co-production with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is helmed by Breaking Bad alumna Moira Walley-Beckett, and makes ample use of the book's feminist subtext, choosing to portray Anne more as a survivor than a saint. Anne (Amybeth McNulty) waits at the train station in the latest retelling of Anne of Green Gables, airing on CBC and coming to Netflix 12 May. This subtext is also essential in Japan, Ms Yoshihara says. In class, she likes to teach Anne because the book is a kind of gateway for getting students to talk about gender, which is often considered taboo in Japanese society. ""We do not usually teach kids about how gender is related to our day to day issues, like education, or fashion or how we behave,"" she says. It's for this reason that Anne was probably published in Japan in the first place, she adds. Citing Japanese scholar Hiromi Ochi, Ms Yoshihara explains that Anne may have been a key part of America's plan to rapidly democratise Japan after the war. Published in 1952 by Muraoka, who translated the story secretly during the war, the book was widely distributed in libraries run by theUS State Department in Allied-occupied Japan,external. Its central story, about an orphan girl who proves her heart and mind is just as good as any boy's, served as a kind of benign liberal propaganda aimed at freeing women from traditional Japanese gender roles, she says. Anne (Amybeth McNulty) stands on the cliffs of Prince Edward Island It seems that core reading of Anne is still prevalent today. In his interviews with Anne fans in Japan, Mr Dawes heard over and over again how people, especially women, identified with her. ""I think Anne Shirley provides a way of acting out, to a point, without ever transgressing fully,"" he says. ""Ultimately, she does the right thing by her family, her adopted family."" Anne is both a conformist and revolutionary, a romantic and a radical. ""In a sense we are tricked into believing that Anne of Green Gables is a dream story of liberation,"" Ms Yoshihara says, laughing. But that doesn't mean Anne is loved any less.

""Anne of Green Gables is a part of this larger culture of adaptations."" The enduring lure of Anne of Green Gables Why is Canadian English so unique? Anne is popular with Japanese women especially, Ms Yoshihara says, because the world of Green Gables is filled with ""kawaii"", which means the quality of being cute, romantic and beautiful in Japanese. ""They love the story because it is full of beautiful scenery and puff sleeves and cute things, like tea parties,"" she says. A Japanese tourist takes a photo outside the real Green Gables house in Canada in 2011. But not everyone who loves Anne is a girl. Go Takahashi, a student of Ms Yoshihara's, is also a devoted fan of Anne and is writing his university thesis on the books. ""I like Anne's character. I feel attracted to a person who talks a lot, makes a little trouble, and considers others' feelings. So Anne is perfect for me,"" he said. Take a ride on Japan's ultra-luxurious train Why a middle-aged man in Japan is hiring himself out for friendship Like many other Japanese readers of the Anne stories, Mr Takahashi has made the pilgrimage to Prince Edward Island, where he visited many of the sites written about in the books - the original Green Gables house, Lovers Lane and the Haunted Wood. About 3,500 Japanese tourists visit Prince Edward Island - population 150,000 - annually, which makes Japan one of the largest source of overseas tourism on the island. ""They come for weddings, they come to see the wildflowers, they come for theatrical or musical offerings,"" says the province's Premier Wade MacLauchlan. Tourism from Japan tends to spike when a new Anne-related production is broadcast. Premier MacLauchlan expects Netflix's new series, Anne, will draw large crowds once it launches on 12 May. The co-production with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is helmed by Breaking Bad alumna Moira Walley-Beckett, and makes ample use of the book's feminist subtext, choosing to portray Anne more as a survivor than a saint. Anne (Amybeth McNulty) waits at the train station in the latest retelling of Anne of Green Gables, airing on CBC and coming to Netflix 12 May. This subtext is also essential in Japan, Ms Yoshihara says. In class, she likes to teach Anne because the book is a kind of gateway for getting students to talk about gender, which is often considered taboo in Japanese society. ""We do not usually teach kids about how gender is related to our day to day issues, like education, or fashion or how we behave,"" she says. It's for this reason that Anne was probably published in Japan in the first place, she adds. Citing Japanese scholar Hiromi Ochi, Ms Yoshihara explains that Anne may have been a key part of America's plan to rapidly democratise Japan after the war. Published in 1952 by Muraoka, who translated the story secretly during the war, the book was widely distributed in libraries run by theUS State Department in Allied-occupied Japan,external. Its central story, about an orphan girl who proves her heart and mind is just as good as any boy's, served as a kind of benign liberal propaganda aimed at freeing women from traditional Japanese gender roles, she says. Anne (Amybeth McNulty) stands on the cliffs of Prince Edward Island It seems that core reading of Anne is still prevalent today. In his interviews with Anne fans in Japan, Mr Dawes heard over and over again how people, especially women, identified with her. ""I think Anne Shirley provides a way of acting out, to a point, without ever transgressing fully,"" he says. ""Ultimately, she does the right thing by her family, her adopted family."" Anne is both a conformist and revolutionary, a romantic and a radical. ""In a sense we are tricked into believing that Anne of Green Gables is a dream story of liberation,"" Ms Yoshihara says, laughing. But that doesn't mean Anne is loved any less.

Itoje 'proud' if he can be role model,"This video can not be played Saracens and England forward Maro Itoje on the Lions, his hero Muhammad Ali, and faith European Champions Cup final - Clermont Auvergne v Saracens Venue:MurrayfieldDate:13 MayKick-off:17:00 BST Coverage:Commentary on Radio 5 live and live text coverage on the BBC Sport website. England forward Maro Itoje says he will be ""proud"" if he can be a role model for young black rugby players. The 22-year-old faces Clermont Auvergne in Saturday's European Champions Cup final, as Saracens look to defend their title at Murrayfield. Itoje,the youngest tourist with the British and Irish Lions this summer,says as a kid he looked up to former England wings Ugo Monye and Topsy Ojo. ""If I want to be honest, it's because they were black,"" said Itoje. Listen to the full Itoje interview on Radio 5 live's Rugby Union Weekly podcast Speaking to 5 live's Rugby Union Weekly podcast, Itoje, who was was born in Camden to Nigerian parents, added: ""They were the guys I looked up to and who I had a natural affinity to. ""You look around at the type of schools I went to, there are not many black guys playing rugby, or as many black guys when you watch Premiership and international games - though it is changing a little bit now. ""You see before games at Allianz Park these mini rugby festivals, I tend to look around and see who is playing and there are a lot more BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] kids about. So it's good, and it is definitely improving."" In a wide-ranging interview, Itoje also discussed being the youngest member of the Lions squad, Muhammad Ali, and the importance of his faith. Despite only being 22, Maro Itoje is the reigning European Player of the Year Itoje made his England debut in 2016 and his 12 caps have included two Six Nations titles - including a Grand Slam in 2016 - plus a 3-0 series whitewash of Australia down under last summer. His performances for club and country have earned him a place inWarren Gatland's 41-man Lions squadto face New Zealand this summer. As the youngest member of the squad, he will have the responsibility of looking after the soft-toy tour mascot, Billy. ""I've heard that players try and sabotage it,"" he said. ""I am going to have to keep quite it tight to me, I don't think I can trust anybody, I heard there are some severe punishments."" Speaking about the tour, he added: ""I am looking forward to the whole experience. I think it is going to be a real eye-opening experience for me. ""A lot of these guys, I know who they are but I don't really know them - so it will be interesting to get to know these guys, build new relationships and new bonds. And from what I hear, these bonds tend to last a very long time."" Muhammad Ali was a three-time heavyweight champion of the world Itoje says his sporting idol is the three-time world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali, whodied last year aged 74. Aside from his sporting achievements in the ring, Ali was also a civil rights campaigner who transcended the bounds of sport, race and nationality. ""Obviously his skills in the ring are unbelievable, but what makes him so impressive was his mind,"" added Itoje, who has lost just once in his England career. ""How he was able to captivate an audience and speak to a crowd. Whether you liked him or not you still respected him. For me, he is well and truly the greatest. ""For me the biggest [thing] was how he put his religious and political beliefs before the boxing. He wasn't afraid of speaking out, when other athletes were afraid of speaking out. ""He wasn't doing this at the end [of his career], he started doing this when he was 21, when he was world champion. He's just an incredible person to look up to."" Itoje, who is a devout Christian, added: ""Once you reach a certain level - play for your club and your country - naturally you get a bit of a following and have people of a younger generation looking up to you. ""You go on the pitch and try and play your best and give the best representation of yourself. The by-product of doing that stuff well is people of a younger generation will follow, in the way that when I was a younger player, watching the greats of the past were the same kind of inspiration."" Maro Itoje was named man of the match in last year's Champions Cup final as Saracens beat Racing 92 Itoje, who can play lock or blind-side flanker, was named man of the match as Saracensbecame champions of Europe for the first timeas they beat Top 14 side Racing 92 in Lyon last May. On Saturday in Edinburgh they face two-time runners-up Clermont, who have finished second in France's top division regular season to qualify for the play-offs. ""Their fans are probably the loudest, most passionate group I've come across,"" said Itoje. ""Big games are always different,"" added the reigning European Player of the Year. ""There is always an extra edge and everyone is a bit sharper and more switched on during the week. There is more of a build-up, a bit more anxiety in the lead-up to the game. ""It's going to be special. Clermont are a top side. We are going to prepare unbelievably well. We will leave no stone unturned and make sure we are the best we can be.""

Six surprising ways to get rich,"If you want to get rich fast, then donning a pinstriped suit and heading for the City has traditionally been seen as the most straightforward path to wealth. Unsurprisingly this year'sranking of the UK's richest 1,000 people,externalby the Sunday Times continues to be dominated by financiers, hedge funders and property tycoons. Yet delve a bit deeper and the list reveals some less obvious ways to become one of the super-rich. We look at six of the career choices which you wouldn't typically bet on to bring in the big bucks. William Dean's firm started out as a door-to-door egg seller in rural Hertfordshire ""The egg market is big"" - that's how egg producer Noble Foods put it. In the UK, we eat a staggering 30 million eggs every day and as chairman of Noble Foods, Peter Dean has amassed a Â£212m fortune from the family egg business, putting him at 534 on the list. The company was started in the 1920s by his grandfather William Dean, who sold eggs door-to-door in rural Hertfordshire. The firm rapidly moved from packing and selling a small amount of eggs for local grocery stores into a national business. Always ambitious, the firm bought several other companies to speed up its growth. Just over a decade ago, Dean Food Group merged with Stonegate, controlled by lifelong egg producer Michael Kent, to create Noble Foods. ""Bringing eggs to life,"" is the tagline of the company, whose brands include Happy Egg and Big & Fresh as well as luxury pudding brand Gu. VIP Pet Foods offers posh nosh for cats and dogs Never underestimate how much people love their pets. Most owners think of their animals as members of the family and are willing to spend big to prove it, making it a lucrative industry. British husband and wife duo Tony and Christina Quinn - listed at number 446 with a Â£255m joint fortune - set up their business catering to pampered pets after emigrating to Australia. Their chilled pet food business VIP Pet Foods focused on the gourmet end of the market for cats and dogs, offering a ""Fussy Cat"" range and vacuum-packed fresh minces. The pair sold the business in 2015 for AU$410m - the equivalent of Â£250m today. Over a quarter of all bakery products eaten in the UK are produced by Warburtons Thomas Warburton and his wife Ellen opened a grocery shop in 1870. When sales fell in 1870, Ellen switched to baking bread, with her loaves becoming an instant success. Almost 150 years on, Warburtons is still a private family owned business managed by the fifth generation of Warburtons Jonathan, Ross and Brett. The firm now sells Â£500m a year's worth of bread, crumpets, fruit loaf, muffins, tea cakes and wraps. It claims over a quarter of all bakery products eaten in the UK are produced by them. Their enduring popularity has made them plenty of dough - putting the Warburton family at 225 on the list with a Â£545m fortune. Imperial Leather maker PZ Cussons started out as a commodities trader Everyone needs to wash. Soap brand Imperial Leather has helped power Anthony Green, former chairman of household products firm PZ Cussons, and the Zochonis family, descendants of company owner George Zochonis, to 170th on the list with a Â£541m fortune. The Manchester-based company is now behind a range of household products from Charles Worthington hair care to self-tanning brand St Tropez. The firm actually started out as a commodities trader in the 1880s, but by 1948 had switched to manufacturing, opening its first soap factory in Nigeria. The Tetra Pak packaging was reportedly inspired by sausages Boxes of juice may seem a pretty everyday item now. But back in the 1950s, sterile and watertight containers were seen as a novel alternative to glass bottles. Tetra Pak founder Ruben Rausing came up with the idea after watching his wife make sausages by tying up the ends, and wondering if a similar system would work for milk, according to the New York Times. Last year the firm sold 188 billion Tetra Pak packages. The invention has made the Rausing family rich, propelling Ruben's son Hans Rausing and family - who have now sold their 50% stake in the business - to number 11 on the rich list with a Â£650m fortune. It's hard to resist a bargain Starting out as a market trader isn't an obvious route to wealth, yet at least one person on the list started out this way. Former market trader Chris Dawson founded the Range discount stores which he describes as ""the working man's John Lewis"". Together with his wife Sarah Dawson, he's now worth Â£1.9bn and ranked 67th on the list. The ""pile it high, sell it cheap"" approach has helped three other discounters make the grade. Home Bargains chain founder Tom Morris and family rank 39th with a wealth of over Â£3bn, followed by Simon, Bobby and Robin Arora - the brothers behind the B&M discount store chain. Together the brothers are listed at 65, and are collectively worth Â£1.92bn. Poundstretcher owners and brothers Rashid and Aziz Tayub and family - which now have over 400 stores in the UK - come 453rd on the list with Â£250m.

What next for Emmanuel Macron?,"Mr Macron says he has someone in mind for prime minister Emmanuel Macron has gone from political newcomer to French president in just a few years. He has promised a new approach to politics but what exactly will his government look like? Two days before polling day, Emmanuel Macron let slip on French radio that he had someone in mind for prime minister should he win Sunday's vote. He did not say who it was, simply tantalising listeners with a vague reference to ""someone with experience of politics, and the skills to lead a parliamentary majority"". But such is the secrecy around his plan for government that it was enough to send the French papers into a spin. Macron's meteoric rise It is a taboo subject even within his campaign team, according to the daily newspaper Le Monde. ""It's like sailors who refuse to say the word 'rabbit' in case it brings bad luck,"" one unnamed staffer told the paper. On one level, his reticence is understandable. Forming a government is a delicate business at the best of times and for Mr Macron it is delicate in ways previous presidents can only imagine. First there is the tension between the poetry of campaign and the prose of government. It was Mr Macron's promise of renewal and change that won him his place in the ElysÃ©e Palace. He has promised fresh faces from outside politics, an overhaul of the established political system and a new kind morality in political life. Could it be IMF head Christine Lagarde? His En Marche (English: On The Move) movement has the feel of a start-up, with the average age said to be around 30. But he is also going to need experience, particularly in areas such as security. Alexis Kohler, 43:Special adviser and likely to be Mr Macron's secretary general at the ElysÃ©e. Joined a shipping company after working as chief-of-staff for Mr Macron while in government Brigitte Trogneux, 64:President-elect's wife initially helped rewrite his speeches but is said to seek role as a ""bridge"" to the president IsmaÃ«l Emelien, 29:Right-hand man and longtime friend, head of communications and strategic adviser, ex-colleague in economy ministry Jean Pisani-Ferry, 65:Economics professor and government adviser, in charge of Macron economic programme and big ideas. Founded Brussels-based Bruegel think tank Sophie Gagnant-Ferracci, 40:Head of campaign team. Highly experienced corporate lawyer and longstanding friend of president-elect through her husband, economist Marc Ferracci FranÃ§ois Bayrou, 65:Political heavyweight, head of centrist Democratic Movement party; his backing boosted Macron candidacy in February ""The young technocrats that surround Macron are impatient for their go,"" says Pierre Haski, former deputy editor at the left-wing newspaper LibÃ©ration. ""They think the oldies have made a mess of thingsâ¦ [but] Emmanuel Macron needs to find a balance between the traditional big beasts of the main parties and the newcomers.  It can't just be the younger generation."" Balancing the expectations of sweeping change with the demands of government will not be easy, especially as he is likely to face a politically diverse cabinet - and probably a divided parliament too. Brigitte Trogneux (R, with Mr Macron) is reportedly seeking a role in her husband's administration And that is the second challenge for Mr Macron: the unique blend of left and right that he promised in his campaign means that his cabinet will need to contain not just a mix of fresh faces and old hands, but a mix of figures from the established right and left. There have been several high-profile figures from both sides who have backed him for president but until now his supporters have not had to sever their existing party memberships and some have already made it clear that voting for him as president is not the same as supporting his programme in government. But lack of clarity has never left politics starved of speculation and since Mr Macron's hint on his pick for prime minister, there has been renewed interest in who might be given a position of power. A poll published on Friday suggested that the head of the IMF and former Economy Minister, Christine Lagarde, would be the most popular choice for prime minister. Defence Minister Yves Le Drian (L) has also been mooted as Mr Macron's pick for PM Some analysts believe she is a good option for Mr Macron because, while she has experience of ministerial office, she has never actually been elected and so may qualify as part of his political renewal. Other names that have cropped up include the current Defence Minister, Yves Le Drian. His appointment would be a ""reassuring gesture"", says Haski, and significant, given far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen's attacks on Macron as soft on terrorism. Further names touted for senior positions include the centrist FranÃ§ois Bayrou and the MEP Sylvie Goulard. But this is all unprecedented territory, says Haski. ""We've never been through this before: a team created from scratch."" Mr Macron defeated Ms Le Pen in both rounds of voting En Marche was only created a year before its leader was elected. And with no established party structure and no real campaign manager, responsibility was parcelled out to managers in different policy areas. The only one who knows Mr Macron's mind, said one analyst, is probably his wife Brigitte Trogneux. Many say she is unlikely to be given a prominent political role, even though she has played a key part in her husband's campaign. Their relationship has been controversial - 24 years his senior, Brigitte met her future husband when she taught him drama at school - and Mr Macron has been stern about politicians employing family members. As if this was not amorphous enough, in a month's time the new president-elect will face another round of elections - for the French parliament.  All 577 posts are up for election and En Marche! has vowed to run candidates in every seat. An absolute majority would be a ""political miracle"", unexpected even by those close to Mr Macron such as mentor Alain Minc. Mr Macron campaigned on a pro-EU platform ""They'll have to make a coalition,"" he told me. ""I don't believe at all that he's able to have 280 MPs coming from En Marche with half of them beginning in politics and chosen from 14,000 CVs sent by email."" The result is that Emmanuel Macron may find governing very difficult. His experience as economy minister taught him that building cross-party consensus for each individual issue can be draining and dispiriting. Much will depend on whether En Marche can form a stable coalition to stand a chance of getting its reforms passed. In that sense, the coming days will be a time of frenetic activity for Team Macron, as high-profile figures from both the centre-right Republicans and the centre-left Socialist Party absorb the scale of his win and the future direction of political power in France. Some may leave their parties to join him - if there are enough of them, it could sign the death warrant for France's two main parties. But it is a fine balance for Mr Macron: he needs enough of them on board the boat to stabilise it, but too many and his political vision is sunk. Just do not mention the rabbit.

The political power of Facebook,"Facebook was a key influencer in the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit vote, according to those who ran the campaigns. But critics say it is a largely unregulated form of campaigning. Those in charge of the digital campaigns for Donald Trump's Republican Party and the political consultant behind Leave EU's referendum strategy are clear the social network was decisive in both wins. Political strategist Gerry Gunster, from Leave EU,told BBC Panoramathat Facebook was a game changer for convincing voters to back Brexit. ""You can say to Facebook, 'I would like to make sure that I can micro-target that fisherman, in certain parts of the UK, so that they are specifically hearing that if you vote to leave you will be able to change the way that the regulations are set for the fishing industry'. This video can not be played BBC Panorama's Darragh MacIntyre asks Facebook whether they have made money from fake news. ""Now I can do the exact same thing for people who live in the Midlands who are struggling because the factory has shut down. So I may send a specific message through Facebook to them that nobody else sees."" Gary Coby, the director of advertising for the Republican Party, says Facebook was also the key to Trump's victory. He said the party used data about potential voters to reach them on social media, adding: ""So if you are on Facebook, I can then match you and put you into a bucket of users that I can then target."" Mr Coby confirmed the official Trump campaign alone had spent in the region of $70m on Facebook over the election period. ""The way we bought media on Facebook was like no one else in politics has ever done."" Panorama has also been told Facebook had teams of people working directly with both the Democratic and Republican campaigns. Targeted campaigning helped the Leave campaign get its message to voters Simon Milner, Facebook's head of policy UK, confirmed that people from Facebook worked with the two campaigns, but declined to say how many. ""One of the things we are absolutely there to do is to help people make use of Facebook products. We do have people whose role is to help politicians and governments make good use of Facebook. ""I can't give you the number of exactly how many people worked with these campaigns. But I can tell you that it was completely demand driven, so it was really up to the campaigns."" The social network says it complies with all regulations but the platform, which is also expected to play a key role in the British general election on 8 June, has been criticised for being unaccountable when it comes to politics. Teams of people from Facebook were working on both Trump and Hillary Clinton's campaigns A quarter of the world's population now use Facebook, including 32 million people in the UK. Many use Facebook to stay in touch with family and friends and are unaware that it has become an important political player. For example, the videos that appear in people's news feeds can be promoted by political parties and campaigners. The far-right group, Britain First, has told Panorama how it paid Facebook to repeatedly promote its videos. It now has more than 1.6 million Facebook followers. Damian Collins, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in the outgoing parliament, says Facebook needs to be more accountable. ""Historically, there have been quite strict rules about the way information is presented and broadcasters work to a very strict code in terms of partiality and there are restrictions on use of advertising. ""But with something like Facebook you have a media which is increasingly seen as the most valuable media in an election period but which is totally unregulated."" Facebook says it is committed to assisting civic engagement and electoral participation, and that it helped two million people register to vote in the US presidential elections.

Parties to focus on more than tax pledges,"Shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, wants to talk about ""real"" pay. How much tax you pay, and what for, is one of the most fundamental relationships between the state and the citizen. It was John Locke who said that ""governments cannot be supported without great charge"". This weekend Labour pledged that people earning under Â£80,000 would not face increases in income tax and national insurance. And that there would be no rises in the standard rate of VAT. The Liberal Democrats said that they would increase income and dividend taxes by 1p in every pound, and that the money raised would be used to support the NHS in England, with the devolved assemblies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland left to choose where any extra funding is spent. AsI have writtenbefore, the Tories are looking to ""reduce the tax burden"" although it is not yet clear if the aspiration will fit into a neat manifesto promise. Tax pledges make for simple headlines. But a more complicated debate - which could well be as important for voters - is taking shape. And it is not just about the income you receive from work - and the tax you pay on it. It is about the quality of that work. Last week, the Conservative peer and trade minister, Lord Price, published a book called Fairness For All. In itself, not that headline grabbing. But the fact that the book has the full blessing of Number 10, and was published in the middle of an election campaign, ups its significance. And once again reveals that government and business have - since the financial crisis - become uneasy bedfellows. The Prime Minister has said ordinary working class families have borne the brunt of sacrifices In his book, Lord Price, the former head of Waitrose, argues that firms need to shape up and look at how they treat their workforces. He admits that trust has broken down and that issues such as mega-high pay have poisoned the debate about profit-making firms. This is an issue central to the ""offer"" Theresa May has made to the electorate. And therefore one the Prime Minister is presumably happy to be tested on. Mrs May has spoken about stagnating pay and said that the economic ""sacrifices"" made since the financial crisis have not been borne by ""the wealthy"" but by ""ordinary working class families"". On Tuesday, Matthew Taylor, the former special advisor to Tony Blair and the person tasked by Number 10 to look at the changing world of work from zero-hours contracts onwards, will make a speech in which he will argue for a fundamental change in the attitude to employment. Yes, Britain has been good at creating jobs. But has quality been sacrificed for quantity? And what rights do we have to a ""good"" job - however elastic such a definition may be? Lord Price told me this was not a ""party political"" argument. And to an extent he is right. All the major parties have spoken about the need to reform work, whether its banning zero hours contracts (Labour) or ""transparency over pay"" (the Liberal Democrats). On Sunday John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said that ""families across the country"" have seen real pay (adjusted for inflation) fall by more than at any time since the industrial revolution. And he said that it's all very well for Mrs May to talk about a ""fairer Britain"" and a strong economy, but it is the Conservative government which has allowed the problem to fester. Lord Price admitted to me that there needed to be change - but said that persuasion rather than compulsion was the best way forward. He argues that the ""happiness"" and satisfaction of employees is the key to increasing productivity, profitability and economic wealth. ""Business has to recognise that instead of taking a short term view or quarterly profits and rewarding shareholders, a long term view needs to be taken of what we need as we move from an industrial era to the digital era,"" he said. ""What I don't want to do - what I think would be wrong for the economy - is for any government to go to war with business, to make business afraid of them,"" said Lord Price. ""We have got to embrace business now - working collaboratively with business as a force for good."" Vince Cable says the Liberal Democrats want more employee engagement, fair contracts and transparency over pay. This is not necessarily about being ""anti"" or ""pro"" business, Lord Price insisted. And he strongly deniedthe claimby Iain Conn, the chief executive of Centrica which owns British Gas, that some people at the heart of government ""just don't believe in free markets"". Although, privately, Lord Price knows that there are those with the ear of the PM who think that some markets - such as the one that governs energy bills - deserves the firm smack of state action. In an election campaign dominated by Brexit and ""tax bombshells"", it is sometimes easy to forget that for many voters, incomes (being squeezed) and the world of work (often stressful and uncertain), is what actually matters day-to-day. And it will be interesting to see how much is made of this major economic theme in each of the parties' manifestos. ""Under this Conservative government, the input and well-being of employees has been pushed aside too often,"" said Sir Vince Cable, who is standing to try to win back his former seat of Twickenham for the Liberal Democrats. ""The prime minister claims to be for the 'just about managings', but has done nothing to protect their rights and incomes, even in the face of major scandals about working practices. ""The Liberal Democrats are  calling for more employee engagement, fair contracts and transparency over pay. When we get the balance right, everybody wins."" For Labour, the minority of poorly behaving businesses is the issue. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: ""Labour is a proud supporter of British business, but we also realise that the decisions made by a small minority of British boardrooms have undermined Britain's ability to become a nation of world-leading, successful, long-term businesses. ""Scandals like BHS show how the long-term growth of a company, and the welfare of its workers, can be sacrificed for short-term gain. ""Labour will tackle the short-termism of some by reforming corporate governance. ""We will support long-term investment and productivity growth to ensure that businesses work for the many, rather than the short-term interests of the few."" Corporation taxes on businesses are set to rise if Labour wins on 8 June. An economy ""that works for everyone"" or ""the many"" are certainly bold ambitions. Are they realisable? And who is responsible for delivery? Businesses, whether compelled or encouraged? Or politicians, whose frustrations on this most vital matter are clear for all to see and hear?

What is Marx's Das Kapital?,"Karl Marx published the first volume of Das Kapital in 1867 Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell hassaid there is much to learn from reading Das Kapital.What is it? Written in the middle of the 19th Century by German philosopher and economist Karl Marx, Das Kapital is essentially a description of how the capitalist system works and how, Marx claims, it will destroy itself. Marx had already set out his ideas on class struggle - how the workers of the world would seize power from the ruling elites - in the Communist Manifesto and other writings. Das Kapital is an attempt to give these ideas a grounding in verifiable fact and scientific analysis. It is not an easy read. The product of 30 years of work, and Marx's study of the condition of workers in English factories at the height of the industrial revolution, it is part history, part economics and part sociology. As Marx's biographerFrancis Wheen has pointed out,external, it reads at times like a Gothic novel ""whose heroes are enslaved and consumed by the monster they created"". In simple terms, Marx argues that an economic system based on private profit is inherently unstable. Workers are exploited by factory owners and don't own the products of their labour, making them little better than machines. John McDonnell is a keen student of Marx's most significant work The factory owners and other capitalists hold all the power because they control the means of production, allowing them to amass vast fortunes while the workers fall deeper into poverty. This is an unsustainable way to organise society and it will eventually collapse under the weight of its own contradictions, Marx argues. He is not clear about when this will happen, only that it is inevitable. Neither does he explicitly spell out what the communist society that will replace capitalism will look like, only that it will free workers from their servitude (he did not complete work on his theories before his death in 1883 so perhaps he ran out of time). Marx published the first volume of Das Kapital in 1867, by which time he had settled in London with his family, and was being financially supported by Friedrich Engels, the rich son of a cotton mill owner. He continued to refine the ideas set out in the first volume for the rest of his life, although the next two volumes would not appear in print until after his death. The ideas contained in Das Kapital would go on to inspire revolutions in Russia, China and many other countries around the world in the 20th Century, as ruling elites were overthrown and private property seized on behalf of the workers. Marx predicted the collapse of capitalism They would also exert a powerful influence over many in the Labour Party and the trade union movement, even if they did not always share his vision of a global workers' revolution. Marxism became a way of interpreting the world - the simple idea at its core that history was a battle between opposing social classes could be applied to everything from the study of literature and film to the education system. It also became a byword for totalitarianism - as one-party states and dictators proclaimed Marxism as their guiding philosophy. Some argued that this was a perversion of Marx's ideas as set out in Das Kapital, and that the Soviet Union, for many the ultimate example of a Marxist state, was really just a form of state capitalism, where the factory owners had been replaced by government bureaucrats. But the Soviet Union's collapse in the early 1990s dealt a major blow to the credibility of Marxist theory and it went out of fashion on university campuses and in mainstream left-wing political parties that aspired to gain power in the West, such as the Labour Party. It underwent something of a revival in the wake of the 2008 global financial crash, however, which some saw as a classic example of capitalism in crisis, just as Marx had predicted.

"UKIP will survive, says Nigel Farage","UKIP ""will survive"" as an electoral force despite a drubbing at last week's local elections, former leader Nigel Farage has said. He told ITV's Peston on Sunday that his successor Paul Nuttall was ""doing fine"" and said UKIP was still needed, to prevent any ""back sliding"" on Brexit. Neil Hamilton, UKIP leader in the Welsh Assembly, told the BBC ""cosmic forces"", not Mr Nuttall were to blame. Mr Nuttall says UKIP voters who backed the Tories will come back to his party. Election Live: Rolling text and video updates Labour: No tax rises for 95% of earners Tories pledge new mental health laws Lib Dems would keep pensions triple lock UKIP won 3.8 million votes at the last general election in 2015 but, after the UK voted to leave the EU in last year's referendum, many believe that its vote will be badly squeezed on 8 June, with the Conservatives being the main beneficiary. All the 145 UKIP councillors defending their seats in local elections last week were beaten, although the party did pick up one seat in Burnley. In Lincolnshire, where Mr Nuttall is standing in the general election in Boston and Skegness, UKIP went from being the official opposition to having no seats at all as the Tories gained 23 seats. The results prompted the party's former donor Arron Banks - who is no longer a party member - to say it was ""finished as an electoral force"" under its current leadership. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map But former leader Mr Farage told the ITV show that while Prime Minister Theresa May had adopted many of the arguments he had been making for years - she had failed to deliver on immigration targets in her previous job as home secretary. ""UKIP is going to survive, it has to survive, "" he said. ""It's all well and good for Mrs May who gives wonderful speeches and sounds very reassuring, but... UKIP needs to be there in case there is back sliding on Brexit. ""If, in two and a half years' time Mrs May has delivered the kind of Brexit that voters wanted, then I think you can ask the question: What is UKIP's future, where does it go from here? He said Mr Nuttall, who was elected party leader in November 2016, had been ""strong and reassuring"" after a ""tough"" 24 hours following last week's local elections. ""It's difficult for him... because the Conservative Party have taken our agenda, for now. It's also difficult because when you follow on from someone - and I was a dominant, some of my critics would say domineering leader of UKIP - it's always difficult to step into someone else's shoes - he's doing fine."" On BBC One's Sunday Politics, Mr Hamilton said the prime minister was a ""very acute tactician"" by calling the election now, but said once Brexit negotiations had been concluded ""the focus will be on bread and butter issues"" and UKIP had domestic policies which ""will be popular with ordinary working people"". He said ""cosmic forces beyond the control of any individual"" were to blame and it was ""certainly"" not Mr Nuttall's fault: ""I think our prospects in the future will be very rosy because I don't believe the Tories will deliver on many of the promises they are now making.""

Superstar economics: How the gramophone changed everything,"Who is the best paid solo singer in the world? In 2015,according to Forbes,external, it was probably Elton John, who reportedly made $100m (Â£79m). U2 apparently made twice as much as that, but there are four of them. There's only one Elton John. If we'd asked that question 215 years ago, the answer would have been Mrs Elizabeth Billington, to some the greatest English soprano who ever lived. Sir Joshua Reynolds once painted Mrs Billington holding a book of music, listening to a choir of angels. The composer Joseph Haydn thought the portrait an injustice: the angels, said Haydn, should have been listening to her. Elizabeth Billington was something of a sensation offstage too. A scurrilous biography of her sold out in less than a day. It contained what were purportedly copies of intimate letters about her famous lovers - including, they say, the Prince of Wales. Such was her fame, she attracted a bidding war for her performances. The managers of London's leading opera houses at the time - Covent Garden and Drury Lane - fought so desperately for her that she ended up singing at both venues, alternating between the two, pulling in at least Â£10,000 in the 1801 season. It was a remarkable sum. But in today's terms, it's a mere Â£687,000, or about $1m - just 1% of Elton John's earnings. So why is Elton John worth 100 Elizabeth Billingtons? 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Almost 60 years after Elizabeth Billington's death, the great economist Alfred Marshall analysed the impact of the electric telegraph, which then connected America, Britain, India, and Australia. Thanks to such modern communications, he wrote: ""Men who have once attained a commanding position are enabled to apply their constructive or speculative genius to undertakings vaster, and extending over a wide area, than ever before."" The world's top industrialists were getting richer, faster. The gap between themselves and less outstanding entrepreneurs was growing. But not every profession's best and brightest could gain in the same way, Marshall said. Take the performing arts. ""[The] number of persons who can be reached by a human voice,"" he wrote, ""is strictly limited."" And so, in consequence, was vocalists' earning power. But just two years later, in 1877, Thomas Edison applied for a patent for his phonograph, the first machine that could both record and reproduce the human voice. Nobody seemed quite sure what to do with the technology at first. The French publisher Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville had already developed the phonoautograph, a device intended to provide a visual record of the sound of a human voice - a little like a seismograph records an earthquake. But it doesn't seem to have occurred to Martinville that one might try to convert the recording back into sound again. Soon enough, the application of the new technology became clear: you could record the best singers in the world, and sell the recordings. At first, making a recording was a bit like making carbon copies on a typewriter: a single performance could be captured on only three or four phonographs at once. In the 1890s, there was great demand to hear a song by the American singer George W Johnson. He reportedly spent day after day singing the same song till his voice gave out - but even singing it 50 times a day churned out a mere 200 records. When Emile Berliner introduced recordings on a disc, rather than Edison's cylinder, it opened the way to mass-production. Then came radio and film. Performers such as Charlie Chaplin could reach a global market just as easily as the men of industry described by Alfred Marshall. For the Charlie Chaplins and Elton Johns of the world, new technologies meant wider fame and more money. But for the journeymen singers, it was a disaster. In Elizabeth Billington's day, many half-decent singers made a living performing in music halls. After all, Billington herself could sing in only one hall at a time. But when you can listen to the best performers in the world at home, why pay to hear a merely competent act in person? Thomas Edison's phonograph led the way towards a winner-take-all dynamic in the performing industry. The top performers went from earning like Mrs Billington to earning like Elton John. But the only-slightly-less good went from making a comfortable living to struggling to pay their bills: small gaps in quality became vast gaps in income. In 1981, an economist called Sherwin Rosen called this phenomenon ""the superstar economy"". Imagine, he said, the fortune that Mrs Billington might have made if there had been phonographs in 1801. Satellite television has massively boosted the average wages of Premier League players versus those in the lower divisions Technological innovations have created superstar economics in other sectors, too. Satellite television has been to footballers what the gramophone was to musicians, or the telegraph to 19th Century industrialists. If you were the world's best footballer a few decades ago, no more than a stadium-full of fans could have seen you play every week. Now, your every move can be watched by hundreds of millions on every continent. And as the market for football expanded, so has the gap in pay between the very best and the merely very good. Just Google it: The student project that changed the world Tick tock: The importance of knowing the right time How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff What the rise of the robots means for us all As recently in the 1980s, footballers in English football's top tier used to earn twice as much as those in the third tier, playing for - say - the 50th best team in the country. Now, average wages in the Premier League are 25 times those earned by the players two divisions down. Technological shifts can dramatically change who gets what, and they are wrenching because they can be so abrupt - and because the people concerned have the same skills as before, but suddenly have very different earning power. Throughout the 20th Century, new innovations - the cassette, the CD, the DVD - maintained the economic model created by the gramophone. But at the end of the century came the MP3 format, and fast internet connections. Suddenly, you didn't have to spend Â£10 on a plastic disc to hear your favourite music - you could find it online, free. David Bowie recognised the seismic effect digital technology would have on the music industry In 2002, David Bowie warned his fellow musicians that they were facing a very different future. ""Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity,"" he said. ""You'd better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that's really the only unique situation that's going to be left."" Bowie seems to have been right. Artists have stopped using concert tickets as a way to sell albums, and started using albums as a way to sell concert tickets. But we haven't returned to the days of Mrs Billington. Amplification, stadium rock, global tours and endorsement deals mean that the most admired musicians can still profit from a vast audience. Inequality remains alive and well - the top 1% of artists take more than five times more money from concerts than the bottom 95% put together. The gramophone may be passe, but the ability of technological progress to change who wins - and who loses - persists.

Fighting for equality in big-wave surfing,"Since 1999, the world's elite big-wave surfers have battled it out at an event known as the Mount Everest of surf competitions - at Mavericks in California. Until this year, female surfers were banned from taking part. But a small group of determined women have fought their way in. The first time Bianca Valenti surfed a 6m (20ft) wave, the ferocity of the breaking water sucked her down to the ocean bed. There, it tossed and spun her body over and over until everything went black and she began convulsing from lack of oxygen. Badly shaken, the 18-year-old swam back to shore at Ocean Beach, next to San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, and swore she would learn to conquer these giant waves. Valenti, now 31, grew up in southern California where she fell in love with surfing at the age of seven and became a precocious champion - competing against boys and girls and travelling around the world for tournaments. But the breaks - where a wave that can be surfed is formed - in southern California are small and the water warm. The biggest injury Valenti was likely to face there was a cut from her board's fins or a broken rib from colliding with other surfers. Northern California is a different matter. A few miles south of Ocean Beach is a surf break regarded as one of the most challenging on the planet - Mavericks. Bianca Valenti competes in Biarritz, France, in 2006 Long considered too dangerous to ride, Mavericks has become known as the fiercest and deadliest big-wave spot in the world. It's where the world's top big-wave surfers compete every winter to prove their skill and bravery. But until now it's been a competition for men only. Mavericks: ""The fiercest wave spot in the world"" Mavericks' potential as a surf break was recognised in the late 1960s, but surfers gave its treacherous waters a wide berth until a local teenager, Jeff Clark, began paddling out in the mid-1970s. It then took 15 years for Clark to persuade anyone to join him in the freezing water and for the news to reach the big-wave surfing community. The break is formed by an unusually deep underwater geological formation that forces swells from winter storms into crests higher than four-storey buildings. Just at the point they break is an underwater labyrinth of jagged rock known as the ""boneyard"", adding another element of danger. And as if that wasn't enough, the break is situated in a hunting ground for Great White sharks - an area known at the Red Triangle. ""It's so scary at first,"" says Valenti. ""You see these big waves coming at you and you want to run from them."" When surfers finally started coming to Mavericks, it quickly became celebrated - but tragedy followed too. In 1994, one of the world's top competitors, Hawaiian champion Mark Foo, drowned on his first Mavericks outing after becoming trapped in the underwater rocks. Foo's death cemented Mavericks' reputation. ""We knew Mavericks was dangerous and we knew it could take us,"" said Clarkin a 2015 BBC interview. ""Mark Foo had said: 'You have to be willing to pay the ultimate price for the ultimate thrill.'"" In the late 1990s, Jeff Clark co-founded The Titans of Mavericks - an invitation-only competition for the world's top big-wave surfers. Posters for the first event in 1999 were emblazoned with the title, Men Who Ride Mountains. The conditions were so punishing it was hard enough for the male competitors to qualify - it was inconceivable to the organisers that a woman might also want to be in the running. But a week after the competition was over, a lone female surfer, Sarah Gerhardt, proved everyone wrong. Alongside her surfer husband, the PhD student from California paddled out past the break and began catching waves. ""It's got to be the way a glider feels,"" says Gerhardt, describing the experience of dropping off the top of a vast wave. ""Just barely making contact with the Earth. It feels like flying. It's this liberating experience."" This video can not be played Sarah Gerhardt describes surfing at Mavericks for the first time Within years, other women began to join Gerhardt at Mavericks. One of them was the 25-year-old Bianca Valenti. ""You're dealing with football-pitch lengths of water moving so there's a lot of tactics involved,"" says Valenti. ""Part of it is studying and learning and putting in the time. Another part is going with your instincts about where the wave is going to come next, what the set is doing and how the swell is moving."" Paddling out through the tempestuous waters to reach Mavericks demands tremendous upper-body strength, so Valenti focused her training on cardio and weights. To cope with the speed of the waves, she emphasised lateral movements and explosive bursts of power. Most importantly, she practised holding her breath for four minutes - about eight times longer than most ordinary people can. ""You can be held down for a really long time,"" says Valenti. ""Once you go under 33ft (10m), the pressure changes. It can take only a few seconds to get down there, but your diaphragm compresses and all of a sudden you feel the urge to breathe. ""You really have the same amount of air that you had at the surface. So you have to tell yourself: 'I have enough air, I have enough down here.'"" Underpinning the physical training is what surfers often refer to as the spiritual side of riding waves - being focused on the moment, accepting the fear and appreciating the experience. ""I've been really scared, but not to the point of panicking,"" says Valenti. ""What the wipeouts do is make you feel the greater power of the universe. It's a reminder that you're still little, and it's so humbling. ""For me, the wipeouts are positive."" A decade after Sarah Gerhardt first took on Mavericks, a number of proficient and competitive female surfers were regularly surfing the break. Although they did not have the power of the elite male surfers, the skills of women like Savannah Shaughnessy, Paige Alms, Keala Kennelly, Jamilah Star, Andrea Moller, Emily Erickson, Polly Poline and Bianca Valenti were beginning to edge closer. But there were still no women's big-wave surf events for them to compete in. The women believed this was partly because the image promoted by big surf brands - of lithe, young, blonde, thong-bikini-clad surf babes - was nothing like the reality of big-wave surfing. This video can not be played Bianca Valenti observed from a GoPro camera on her board To cope with the freezing water temperatures, big-wave surfers wear full wetsuits and hoods, their bodies are strong and muscular, as opposed to model-thin and their faces are often raw from the cold, their noses streaming with snot. In the 2017 documentaryIt Ain't Pretty,external, by Californian film-maker Dayla Soul, Valenti and her fellow surfers discuss wanting to be taken seriously as athletes and not portrayed as pin-ups to sell surf clothes. ""I realised in college that unless you were a model, you weren't going to get sponsorship,"" says Valenti, who works as a wine expert in her family restaurant to support herself. ""There are people like me who are past the point of being angryâ¦ But it's frustrating, it's upsetting and it gives you body-image issues."" But by 2014 public interest in female big-wave surfers was beginning to pick up. That year, the first Big Wave World Tour women's event was held at Nelscott Reef in Oregon. Valenti won it. ""The viewership was amazing,"" she says. ""So we said: 'Let's do a woman's event at Mavericks.'"" Shortly afterwards, Valenti heard Jeff Clark being interviewed on a local radio phone-in programme. She called in to ask how she could get the conversation going about introducing a women's heat at Titans of Mavericks. ""We look forward to evolving what Mavericks has always been, and for everyone to experience it,"" replied Clark. But his words were not followed up with action. Unknown to Valenti, though, a member of the local government harbour commission had also been wondering how she could support female surfers. Sabrina Brennan had moved to the area in 1999 - the same year posters were celebrating the ""Men Who Ride Mountains"". ""I thought this slogan really doesn't leave much of a door open. It sounds like it's only men who can ride mountains, and don't even bother if you're a woman,"" she says. ""But I heard there were women surfing out there and I had seen one in the parking lot."" In 2015, Brennan seized a chance to change this. Brennan's local harbour commission had only recently granted a five-year permit for Titans of Mavericks to be held without women. In November 2015, though, she heard the event was also being reviewed for a permit by the state Californian Coastal Commission. At first her cause was supported by a local NGO, but they dropped out at the last minute, and Brennan had to decide whether to lobby the commission alone. ""I woke up at 2am and thought: I have to do this,"" she says. ""So I started working on a presentation. I searched the internet for names of women who surf big waves and finally came up with a list. ""I had no clue about any of these people - I wasn't even a fan."" This video can not be played Bianca Valenti surfs at Mavericks Brennan's presentation argued that if a permit was given as things stood, women would be excluded from coastal access, and the commissioners agreed, demanding that the organisers of Titans of Mavericks should come back within a year with a plan to include women. But Titans continued to hold out against organising a women's heat. ""My understanding of what the Coastal Commission wants is more women involved in Mavericks,"" Clark told CBS news in February 2016. ""We've had women judges, we've had women in our water patrol and water rescue,"" he said. Women were just not good enough for the main event, he insisted. ""It's not a gender thing, it's a performance thing,"" he said. ""Women just aren't there yet."" When a scene from Apocalypse Now was shot on an obscure beach in the Philippines in the late 70s, little did the film-makers know they were giving birth to the country's surfing culture. How Apocalypse Now inspired Filipino surfers (April 2013) But the women surfers weren't asking to take part in the main competition. ""We all, as human beings, need a venue to compete against our peers: women against women, men against men,"" wrote prize-winning surfer Keala Kennelly in a 2016 editorial for the surfing site inertia.com. ""I cannot see why big-wave surfing should compromise these centuries-long standards of competition. Do men compete against women in boxing, golf, tennis, or basketball?... The answer is no."" Valenti guesses that the organisers were scared to have women at Mavericks because of ""the traditional patriarchal role of wanting to protect women and not embracing us to make our own choices"". ""But they would spin it around on us, saying: 'If you don't think women are good enough to compete against men, then you don't really believe in women,'"" she adds. Valenti realised in order to win the fight, the female surfers would need to get organised. They formed a lobbying group - the Committee for Equity in Women's Surfing - and together with Brennan wrote a new proposal for the next Coastal Commission meeting demanding a women's heat. In November 2016, the commission voted unanimously to support the women. Almost immediately, Titans announced they would be holding a women's one-hour heat in their 2017 event. The prize money was announced at $30,000 (Â£23,000) - far short of the $120,000 given to the male winner - and the heat would be for only six surfers, rather than the 24 in the main competition. After years of struggle, women surfers had achieved their goal. But then suddenly, in February this year, the organisers of Titans of Mavericks declared bankruptcy. It's unclear who will take over, but the principle that women must be allowed to participate has been established. ""The Coastal Commission is going to stand behind including women, so that's good news,"" says Brennan. ""No matter who runs the event in the future, women are going to have to be included."" Hawaii, November 2016: Hawaiian surfer Paige Alms at the first ever Women's Big Wave Tour event Even without the chance to compete in Titans of Mavericks this year, the sisterhood of female big-wave surfers feel the tide has begun to turn in their favour. In April 2016, the World Surf League announced the first ever Women's Big Wave World Tour - the Peahi Women's Challenge - which was held in November that year at the big-wave venue, Jaws, in Hawaii. ""We saw a tremendous increase in audience last year with the performances of both the men and women at the Peahi Challenge,"" says World Surf League spokesman, Dave Prodhan. Valenti believes this is a strong indication that female big wave surfing has a commercial future. Most of all, she's grateful that finally the sport she's devoted her life to is getting the recognition and support it deserves. ""What keeps me coming back is that it's never the same,"" says Valenti. ""You're out there in the middle of the ocean and it's that feeling of when you go up a roller-coaster - that tick, tick, tick - and then you drop."" ""There are a million things you think about - safety, other people, rocks, sharks. But, all of a sudden, when that wave approaches, everything goes silent and there's only one thing you think about - trying to make that wave.""

The penguins that would not explode,"The minefields laid in the Falkland Islands were intended to kill or maim British soldiers, but over the last 35 years they have become de facto nature reserves for penguins. For better or worse, however, the time has now come for their home to be demined, reports Matthew Teller. I'm following a crunching gravel path leading up over a headland. To one side stretches a sweeping curve of white sand, backed by tussocky dunes, the coarse grass mixed with a low-growing plant bearing tartly sweet red berries that the locals call diddle-dee. But it's the sound that startles. Overlaying the booming ocean is a comical honking noise coming from thousands of Magellanic penguins. One, guarding its burrow beside the path, stretches its neck up at me, then lets out an ear-splitting, wing-waggling bray of displeasure. I can see why these penguins are known locally as jackasses. The beach, also dotted with waddling clusters of Gentoo penguins, looks tempting, but between me and the birds stretches a barbed-wire fence marked with signs warning of danger. This is Yorke Bay, just outside Stanley, capital of the Falkland Islands. Once a popular leisure beach, it was here, at 04:30 on the morning of 2 April 1982, that Argentine naval commandos landed, marking the start of a full-scale invasion. By the time British forces retook Stanley 74 days later, 907 people had lost their lives, most of them Argentine conscripts. During the occupation, one of the Argentine military's first actions was to lay tens of thousands of land mines across the uncultivated countryside to slow a British counter-attack - especially a seaborne attack via the beaches around Stanley, including Yorke Bay. Fortunately, the landmines aren't a problem for the penguins - at least, not the little Magellanics and Gentoos of Yorke Bay. ""They don't seem to be heavy enough to set them off,"" says Esther Bertram, chief executive officer of Falklands Conservation. Behind their fences, shielded from human encroachment, the penguins have had decades of peace and quiet in their minefield. Native flora has regrown around them. ""Natural systems have returned to not quite a pristine state, but a state where you've reached climax communities in certain parts,"" says Paul Brickle, director of the South Atlantic Environmental Research Institute. ""The mines are horrible things, and very difficult to remove - you essentially have to get on your hands and knees to do that, remove bits of earth and dunes, and disrupt the ecosystem. There's a bit of a trade-off in thinking: what are the benefits of having them removed?"" he asks. Initially at least, not everyone in the islands' tiny, close-knit population of 3,000 was supportive. ""Falkland Islanders weren't enthused by the idea, to put it bluntly,"" says Barry Elsby, a member of the Falklands Legislative Assembly. ""We would rather have left the minefields as they were. They are all clearly marked, clearly fenced. No civilian has ever been injured. We said to the British government, 'Don't spend the money here, go to some other country where they have a much greater need to free up farming land.'"" ""Unfortunately,"" Elsby adds, ""the British government have signed up to the Ottawa convention, which puts a duty on them to do this."" The 1997 Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty compels signatories - which include the UK - to clear minefields in territory under their control. So whatever the locals - and the penguins - thought, the mines had to go. A mine is detonated near Stanley Since 2009 the British government has spent tens of millions of pounds on mine-clearance in the Falklands. Guy Marot of the Falkland Islands Demining Programme Office oversees a team of largely Zimbabwean operatives, highly valued for their long experience of demining in their home country and further afield. He takes me out to one of the clearance sites. In a setting of wide open moorland, battling gales and driving rain, demining specialist Innocent Mudzamiri, fully kitted out with protective clothing and visor, explains how he approaches his job, lying prone in the boggy peat, painstakingly clearing dirt from around devices that could blow up in his face. ""It's just caution. You have to do it gently, so that you don't disturb the mine,"" he says. ""Your mind must be free - no thinking of home, or thinking whatever, but just concentrate."" Zimbabwean demining expert Farai Beghede at work on a bleak moorland in the South Atlantic So far, Mudzamiri and his colleagues have cleared more than seven million square metres of mostly rough countryside. But now, Phase 5 of the demining programme is seeing sensitive sites of environmental concern, such as Yorke Bay, come up for clearance. The Falkland Islands Government is part of the way through drawing up an environmental impact assessment, examining the risks and benefits from demining wildlife-rich sites. Listen toExploding Penguinspresented by Peter Gibbs and produced by Matthew Teller, on Costing the Earth, at 15:30 on Tuesday 9 May, on BBC Radio 4 Orcatch up afterwards on the iPlayer Yorke Bay is particularly difficult, since in 1982 mines were placed on top of the sand dunes, but, over 35 years, the dunes have changed shape and shifted with the wind. Even with the detailed charts handed over by Argentina to the UK after the war, it's impossible now to know where the mines might be - they could have drifted far from their original position or become buried deep below the surface. The deminers are facing having to dig up the entire beach, perhaps with armoured machinery, and sift it all. The idea is to do that during the winter, while the penguins are out at sea. But their habitat, and the wider ecosystem, could be entirely destroyed. Another potential hazard is tourism, a key driver of the Falklands economy. About 50,000 people visit the islands annually, most of them day-trippers from cruise ships plying the waters around South America and Antarctica. Each time a cruise ship docks, hundreds of passengers at a time come ashore to see the wildlife. If Yorke Bay is reopened, its easy-to-reach location - barely 10 minutes' drive from Stanley - could make it a magnet for tourist traffic. Another source of worry comes from the locals. Most beaches in the Falklands are on private land. But Yorke Bay is publicly owned - and opening it up could revive its pre-war status as one of Stanley's most popular getaways. There are already concerns about quad-biking and livestock grazing on public land outside the Yorke Bay fences. Whether the rejuvenated land within the minefield could be protected when the fences come down remains uncertain. In 2010 Marot oversaw the clearance of Surf Bay, another beach near Stanley, which held 1,800 mines. Today, as locals ramble over dunes and on to its sandy beach to walk their dogs, it's hard to discern the damage that was done. ""The re-establishment is remarkable,"" says Marot. ""The processes used at the time included blowing up the anti-tank mines in situ. The holes here were 10m deep in some places - this was a moonscape. But then we put all the sand back on top, and tried to do it in a way that would allow nature to eventually recover completely, which is what you see now."" So the Falklands is facing a head-on clash between the obligation to clear mines and the imperative for environmental conservation. Meanwhile the honking jackasses behind the Yorke Bay fences are thriving, ironically because of one of the worst things humanity can do - start a war. @matthewteller,external Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.
