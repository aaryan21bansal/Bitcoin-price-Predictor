"Big pay rises could push prices up, says minister","A Treasury minister has warned employees not to expect their wages to rise along with the soaring rate of inflation. Simon Clarke said that big increases in salaries to meet the rising cost of living could end up in a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"". This happens when wage rises help push up the cost of living. But unions said that energy prices, not wages, were driving up the cost of living. Mr Clarke said that employers should be ""very careful"" in setting pay rises that help drive up the cost of living. He warned that inflation could become a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"". Inflation measures an overall increase in pricesover time. For example, if a loaf of bread costs Â£1 one year and Â£1.09 the next year, then that's an annual inflation rate of 9%. On Thursday the Bank of England said that inflation could reach more than 11%. People cut back on food, fuel and clothes as prices rise, BBC survey suggests Three things we're cutting back on as prices rise Petrol cost hit new high every day for past month In a BBC-commissioned survey of more than 4,000 people, 82% said they thought their wages should increase to match the rising price of goods and services. But Mr Clarke, who is chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC that ""unrealistic expectations around pay"" could ""intensify this endless inflation problem"". However, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said: ""Energy prices are pushing up inflation - not wages."" Paul Nowak, TUC deputy general secretary, said Mr Clarke's claims were ""nonsense"". ""The government has cynically abandoned its commitment to a high-wage economy. ""The only way to give families long-term financial security is to get pay rising across the economy. ""British workers are suffering the longest wage squeeze in more than 200 hours years. They urgently need more money in their pockets."" The public sector pay review bodies are due to report in the coming weeks on the level of increase for workers - including employees in health, schools and prisons. Unions are pressing to have the pay increases reflect the rising cost of living. Mr Clarke is the Treasury minister in charge of the pay review body process. His comments are the clearest steer that public sector workers in general will not get settlements close to the current rate of inflation. The Unison union said that essential workers aren't being offered big pay increases, ""so it's not public sector wages causing inflation to spiral"". Unison general secretary Christina McAnea said: ""Ministers must realise the damage that will be done to public services if health, care, police and school staff don't receive a decent pay rise this year. ""Without one that protects against rising prices, many will quit for better paid and less stressful work elsewhere, leaving the public struggling to access vital services."" The independent bodies have begun to report back to relevant government departments about appropriate pay and recruitment difficulties. The Treasury says those departments will have to find the cash from existing budgets for any pay rises above what is already planned. Mr Clarke said there was no automatic link between inflation and pay setting and that inflation could ""run away from us"". Earlier this week, the ONS said thatregular pay is falling at the fastest rate in more than a decadewhen taking into account rising prices. Between February and April, pay excluding bonuses was down 2.2% from a year earlier when adjusted for inflation, according to the ONS. However, pay including bonuses is outpacing price rises, rising by 0.4% when taking inflation into account.

Sign language 999 service launched for deaf people,"A new service has launched to allow people to make 999 calls using British Sign Language (BSL) for the first time. The new service, 999 BSL, will allow deaf people to make emergency calls using an app or website, connecting callers with a BSL interpreter. It is free to use and operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Ofcom announced telephone and broadband companies must carry the service last June, estimating it would save two lives a year. The system, which launched on Friday, is the first time a 999 emergency service will be available in British Sign Language, though a similar process exists for the NHS 111 number. People who use the service will be put through to a BSL interpreter, who will then relay the conversation to a 999 operator. British Sign Language set for legal recognition My son is profoundly deaf - but passed a hearing test Deaf woman takes legal action over Covid briefings A text service for 999 already exists, though users have had to register for that prior to use. The new sign language-based service does not require registration, meaning callers can use it as long as the app or webpage is open. To make a call with 999 BSL, users need to open the app or webpage, then press a red button that will connect them to an interpreter. A number of charities and organisations have been campaigning for the service. Abigail Gorman, public affairs and policy manager at SignHealth, the deaf health charity, said: ""This is a breakthrough for deaf people that will save lives and means one more step forward towards equality. ""We won't be satisfied until deaf people have full and equal access, particularly to life saving health services."" James Watson-O'Neill, the chief executive of SignHealth, said the service was important for everyone and not just the deaf community. ""Deaf people can now contact emergency services directly and assist anyone in need of help. This is a huge breakthrough in terms of access and a moment worth celebrating,"" he said.

UK in talks to host Eurovision instead of Ukraine,"The UK's Sam Ryder was recently pictured in a pink Kalush Orchestra hat, in a nod to this year's Ukrainian winners The BBC is in talks with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the UK - not Ukraine. The show's organisers decided, after a ""full assessment and feasibility study"", that the event cannot be held in the winning country, Ukraine. This is due to the ongoing war following Russia's invasion. So, they turned to the UK, which came second. But Kyiv said it disagreed with the EBU's decision and would appeal. Traditionally, the winning country is asked to host the following year's contest. UK cities volunteer to host Eurovision 2023 Reacting to the EBU's decision, Ukrainian Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said Kyiv ""believes that it has grounds for conducting further talks on finding a solution that will satisfy all."" ""Hosting Eurovision 2023 in Ukraine is a powerful signal to all the world, which is supporting Ukraine now. We will be demanding to change the decision, because we believe that we will be able to fulfil all our obligations"". Meanwhile, Mykola Chernotytskyi, head of the managing board of Ukrainian broadcaster UA: PBC, said: ""Security is, of course, our first priority. The team of UA: PBC, state and local authorities did a thorough job and offered different options."" He added: ""It is a pity to see such an unappealable statement, therefore, we ask our partners to hold further negotiations."" Sam Ryder came second for the UK, the country's best result since 1998, at this year's event in May. Ryder topped the jury vote in Turin in May, but rap-folk band Kalush Orchestra, who were given special permission to leave the war-torn country to compete, soared to first place with 631 points in a symbolic show of public support. The UK hashosted Eurovision eight times,external- more than any other country. It has taken over hosting duties for other countries four times. It hosted for the Netherlands in 1960, for France in 1963, for Monaco in 1972; and Luxembourg in 1974. The UK last hosted in 1998, from Birmingham, after Katrina and the Waves' win. Harrogate, Brighton, Edinburgh and London have also been host cities. Israel was the last country that declined to host, in 1980, having also won the year before. The EBU saidin a statement,externalit had conducted the study with Ukrainian state broadcaster UA:PBC and external specialists, amid the conflict, but that the ""security and operational guarantees"" required to host the event cannot be fulfilled in the war-torn country. The organisation thanked the winning nation's broadcaster for its ""wholehearted cooperation and commitment in exploring all scenarios"" and said it shared in ""their sadness and disappointment"", adding it would continue to support them. ""As a result of this decision, in accordance with the rules and to ensure the continuity of the event, the EBU will now begin discussions with the BBC, as this year's runner-up, to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the United Kingdom,"" the statement read. ""It is our full intention that Ukraine's win will be reflected in next year's shows. This will be a priority for us in our discussions with the eventual hosts."" This video can not be played The UK won the jury vote before Ukraine stormed into the lead following huge public support A BBC spokesman added: ""We have seen the announcement from the EBU. Clearly these aren't a set of circumstances that anyone would want. Following their decision, we will of course discuss the BBC hosting the Eurovision Song Contest."" Katrina Leskanich, lead singer for the UK's winning 1997 Eurovision entry Katrina and the Waves with their song Love Shine A Light,tweeted,external: ""Practically hysterical over the announcement that the UK could host!"" Downing Street welcomed the possibility of the UK hosting Eurovision if Ukraine cannot, pledging to ensure it would ""overwhelmingly reflect Ukraine's rich culture, heritage and creativity"". Which UK cities could host 2023 contest? Eurovision win brings Ukraine 'incredible happiness' ""Ukraine's victory... was richly deserved and as the rightful winner the government's firm wish has been to see next year's contest hosted there,"" said a government spokesperson. ""If the EBU decides the competition can't go ahead in Ukraine, we would of course welcome the opportunity to work closely with Ukraine and the BBC to host it here in the UK."" They added the government was also committed to ""building on the ongoing partnership between our two countries"". Asked if the government would help the BBC with the costs, the spokesman said ""we're slightly getting ahead of ourselves in terms of the process"". Norway's Give That Wolf A Banana were an eye-catching act at this year's contest A number of locationshave put their hats in the ring if the UK does end up hosting the contest. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid she,externalwished Eurovision could be in Ukraine, but ""understand that in circumstances this isn't possible"". ""However, I can think of a perfect venue on banks of the River Clyde!"" she added, apparently suggesting the 14,300-capacity riverside OVO Hydro arena in Glasgow as a venue. Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester City Council, also threw the city's hat in the ring,saying,external: ""Not the circumstances that anyone would want given the war in Ukraine. But if it's to be a UK city - I can't think of anywhere better, a great music city and fittingly home to a large Ukrainian community."" Leeds had hoped to be European Capital of Culture in 2023, before Brexit prevented UK cities from entering that contest. The city is ploughing on with staging a year of culture anyway, and Leeds City Council said having Eurovision in the city ""could not come at a better time"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khantweeted,externalthat the UK capital ""would welcome Eurovision with open arms"", adding: ""We're ready to step up and support Ukraine by hosting a contest that pays tribute to and honours the Ukrainian people, and also celebrates the very best of Britain too."" Liverpool, Cardiff, Aberdeen, Brighton, Belfast and Birmingham have also all been suggested as possibilities. If the UK is confirmed as the host country, cities would have to prove they have the right facilities and go through a bidding process. Which UK cities could host Eurovision 2023?

Concerts and large public gatherings have been called off in the Gironde department around Bordeaux. Yesterday, parts of France hit 40C earlier in the year than usual, with temperatures expected to peak tomorrow. Scientists say periods of intense heat are becoming more frequent and longer lasting as a result of global warming. In Gironde, officials said public events, including some of the official 18 June Resistance celebrations, will be prohibited from Friday at 14:00 (12:00 GMT) ""until the end of the heat wave"". Indoor events at venues without air conditioning are also banned. The weather has been kind for festival-goers on the Isle of Wight, with no wellies needed.

If the overnight temperature doesnât drop below 20C then thatâs defined as a tropical night and thereâs a chance of that somewhere in south-east England tonight.What is a tropical night? Harry LowBBC London News Itâs hotting up here at this lido as the sunbathers soak up the sunshine in south-east London. Since sunrise swimmers have been flocking to Charlton: all 1,000 slots sold out as people look for some respite from the high temperatures brought about by the arrival of the Spanish plume. Picnickers have set up camp beside this Olympic-sized swimming pool as the trees surrounding the pool gently sway in the breeze. A number of fair-weather swimmers have visited throughout the day, much to the chagrin of some regulars who are not used to sharing with crowds, especially during those long, cold winter months. If you're heading out to make the most of the summer sunshine today, spare a thought for some of our hairy-coated friends. As the temperature rises, it's not just us humans that need to keep cool. At the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon, the animals are being looked after with specially made ice lollies - the perfect way to cool down in the heat. The sanctuary's Simon Horn says: ""The ice
blocks are made from fruit and vegetables in water. ""They not only provide a
welcome treat during the sizzling temperatures, but they also provide a
valuable form of enrichment. ""Donkeys love exploring, and this activity allows
them to exhibit their natural foraging behaviours - a key factor in improving
donkey welfare."" It is officially the hottest day of the year in the UK for the third day in a row. Heathrow in west London recorded 32.4C (90F) this afternoon andtemperatures could climb furtherto 34C in parts of the South East. Today's record temperature surpassed the previous day's high of 29.5C (85.1F) recorded at Northolt in west London. The Met Office also predicts it could be the ""hottest Royal Ascot on record"" at the Berkshire racecourse. In Santon Downham, Suffolk, temperatures reached 31.1C, and Wisley, Surrey, recorded 30.4C. But the picture changes further north, with the Met Office pointing out a marked difference in temperatures, with Glasgow recording 13.7C just after midday. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter While parts of South East England will have another very warm to hot day on Saturday, elsewhere in England and Wales things will feel very different as temperatures drop significantly. For example, Leeds will fall from a high near 27C today to just 16C tomorrow. This photo of a tranquil spot in Leeds was taken a short while ago by BBC Weather Watcher Martin King. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Livestock cool off in a pond to beat the heat in Pakistan where temperatures reached 40C last month If youâre in
the southern half of the UK youâll certainly be feeling the heat - but spare a
thought for Spain and France, they are experiencing a punishing heatwave. This week
France saw temperatures hit 40C - the earliest in the year than ever before. Spain is
enduring its second heatwave this year and there are warnings it could reach
43C in the next couple of days. That did not used to happen until July or
August. It is this
type of intense heat that scientists warn will become more common as global
warming heats the planet. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the 19th century and temperatures continue to rise. The last seven years have been
the hottest years ever recorded and, if no action is taken to curb climate
change, scientists warn a rise of 4C is possible. In the US
now, more than 100 million people are being warned to stay indoors as scorching
temperatures settle over large parts of the country. India and
Pakistan suffered even more brutal heat last month with temperatures in
Pakistan reaching 50C while the Indian capital, New Delhi, hit 49.2C â
an all-time high. While periods
of hot weather have always occurred naturally, the increased intensity and
frequency of extreme heat now is a warning bell for the impacts ofclimate change. To place the current hot weather in context, we've drawn up a map of some peak temperatures hit around the UK - both in the month of June and overall. Some historical high points for thermometers include the hottest temperature recorded in June, when Southampton peaked at 35.6C in 1976. In more recent times, Cambridge experienced a sweltering 38.7C in July 2019, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

In the words of Billy Idol, it's hot in the city. In the words of The Clash, London's burning. In the words of Glen Frey, the heat is on. A high of 34C (93.2F) is expected in the capital on Friday. So are Londoners coping with the heatwave - or is it too hot to handle? Before the inevitable rainclouds return to empty over our optimistic barbecues - we take a look at some ""snaps-hots"" from around the city.

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council says it expects tens of thousands of visitors over the next few days to head to the seaside to enjoy the heat and sunshine. Beachgoers flocked to the resort town on the south coast of England when the first Covid-19 lockdown was eased in June 2020, which led to the councildeclaring a major incident. Since the incident, the council has developed a freebeach check appshowing people which areas are crowded, gives the location of public toilets and lifeguards, and says which areas dogs can use. Security cameras, a hub for emergency services and more rangers have also since been brought in. Read morehere. If the hot weather is becoming oppressive, there are some basic principles to help stop it becoming too much. During the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out and close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out. Open all the windows before you go to bed to get a through breeze. Using even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather as it encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. If you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. Alternatively, cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body, so try chilling your socks in the fridge before wearing. And of course, keep hydrated. A Level 3 heat-health alert has been issued for London, the east of England and the south-east to help protect health services, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says. The alert, called 'heatwave action', is to help protect the NHS and to inform its partners that they should prepare their services for possible increases in demand due to increases in temperatures, Agostinho Sousa of the UKHSA tells BBC Breakfast. âWe also have a Level 2 that is currently active in the South West and East of England that is to inform our partners that they should prepare their services in case they need to enter into action in case we see an increase in temperatures. âRight now the situation is stable, and we expect the temperatures to drop tomorrow.â Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals can cause muscle cramps and shock due to cold water temperatures, the fire service says People have been warnednot to swim in open water as temperatures soar. Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals could cause muscle cramps and shock as the water often remained cold even in heatwaves, says Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Fresh water could be polluted and cause serious illness, it said. People who fall into water by accident should lean back, extend their legs and arms, and use slow, gentle movements to stay afloat. Once you have controlled your breathing, attempt to swim to safety and call for help, the service adds. Anyone seeing a person or animal in trouble around water was asked to phone 999. If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's the latest on the extreme weather hitting parts of the UK and Europe: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37.5C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave. But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it. You can read more by James on the dangers of heat and what to do about themhere. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter At midday, the temperature at Heathrow Airport was 30.3C, which is the highest for England and the UK so far this year. Wales has also recorded its highest temperature so far - 26.7C at Cardiff Bute Park. This heatwave has been building across western Europe - last weekSpainsaw temperatures above 40C - and now that heat has started to move
northwards. Spain is used to heatwaves â just not this
early in the summer season and certainly not this hot. And with the high temperatures come the inevitable
wildfires. InItaly, the soaring
heat is leading to growing concerns about water shortages. As we reported earlier, large stretches of the countryâs largest river, the Po, the
water is so low that locals can walk through the middle of the expanse of sand -
and wartime shipwrecks are even resurfacing. Across thePyrenees, straddling the border
of France and Spain, outdoor public events are being banned from tomorrow until
the end of the heatwave. Teachers in the region are watering
playgrounds in order to prevent pupils getting heatstroke in the extreme heat. Portugalsaw its hottest May since 1931, and yesterdayFrance recorded a temperature of over 40C - the earliest hot spell ever to hit the country. And French officials say the peak of the heatwave is yet to be reached. The hot zone is expected to move intocentral Europe, ItalytheAlpine countriesand the south ofGermany. The peak of the heatwave in theUKarrives today acrossEnglandandWales, with temperatures set to reach 33C. But inScotlandandNorthern Ireland, temperatures are expected to peak at a more comfortable 23C Across the whole of the UK, cooler and fresher conditions are expected over the weekend Scientists warn that as global temperatures rise over time heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent, more intense and longer lasting - and their impact more widespread.

Passenger dies after leaving flight at Gatwick,"Gatwick said a formal investigation was under way A passenger with restricted mobility has died at Gatwick Airport after leaving an aircraft. Gatwick said staff were helping to disembark three passengers with restricted mobility at the time, including the man's partner. He decided to leave the EasyJet plane rather than wait for staff to return and fell while going up an escalator, an airport spokesman said. Sussex Police confirmed the 82-year-old man died at 12:50 BST on Wednesday. Gatwick cuts summer flights after staff shortages The Gatwick spokesman said the passenger made a short walk to the escalator from the runway to the Skybridge, which takes passengers to the north terminal. He said EasyJet cabin crew were closest to the man, so provided medical attention before the airport's medical staff arrived. An airline spokesman said: ""A number of our cabin crew provided medical assistance to a passenger at Gatwick Airport whilst waiting for paramedics to arrive. ""However the passenger sadly later passed away."" Details are still emerging on exactly how this tragedy occurred at Gatwick but my thoughts are with this poor passenger and his family. I know all too well the sense of immense frustration as you watch all the other passengers disembark and you are left stranded on an empty plane waiting for ground staff to retrieve your wheelchair and get you off. This is not the first time a passenger with restricted mobility has taken matters into their own hands. In August 2017, Justin Levene famously dragged himself across the floor of Luton Airport after staff were unable to retrieve his wheelchair. They had offered to strap him into an airport chair and push him through the terminal but Levene, a fitness enthusiast, declined, saying this compromised his independence. This incident is now being investigated. However, it raises more questions about the treatment of disabled passengers and those with restricted mobility. Historically their needs do not appear to have been a high priority at many British airports. Gatwick said a formal investigation was under way. It said when the aircraft arrived a member of staff was deployed from Wilson James, a company which provides assistance for passengers with restricted mobility (PRM). The staff member ""was in the process of disembarking the three PRM passengers when the incident occurred,"" it said. ""Staff shortages were not a factor in this incident. ""It is normal for one staff member to disembark three passengers who require assistance by taking them one at a time the short distance to the waiting buggy."" Wilson James said the passenger was not left waiting to disembark. In a statement the company said: ""The agent was at the gate within one minute of the aircraft parking on its stand, and the incident itself only happened 10 minutes after the aircraft landed. ""The agent who handled the passenger is very experienced, has been working in this service for a number of years and has a background working with people with complex disabilities and needs in the care sector.""

Ex-banker faked cancer as part of Â£1.8m fraud,"Rajesh Ghedia lived a ""lavish lifestyle"", the court was told A former banker who faked terminal pancreatic cancer as part of a series of scams worth Â£1.8m has been jailed. Rajesh Ghedia, 42, said he would be dead in a year in a Â£1.2m insurance scam, Southwark Crown Court heard. He also swindled seven people - including a relative - out of huge sums of money by encouraging them to invest in non-existent financial products. Ghedia, of Addlestone, Surrey, admitted more than 30 counts of fraud at an earlier hearing. Judge Deborah Taylor told him he was a persistent fraudster who caused victims devastation and had left them scarred. The court was told Ghedia faked medical letters from a consultant to claim insurance. He made fraudulent claims about his Bank of America position to encourage people, including a cousin, to invest in non-existent products with the company and Goldman Sachs, the court heard. Ghedia had also falsely claimed his daughter had been killed in a car crash to avoid communicating with victims, the court was told. Prosecuting, Jack Talbot said Ghedia had ""high value"" property and vehicles, privately-educated his children, and lived a ""lavish lifestyle"". Defending, Benjamin Waidhofer said Ghedia had a good character, adding he ""entirely accepts responsibility"". Jailing Ghedia for six years and nine months, the judge said the offences were significant, with extensive planning. On the investment fraud, she said: ""You have caused them (victims) devastation, showing utter disregard for their mental wellbeing and finances."" After the hearing, Det Con Daniel Weller, from City of London Police, said Ghedia, from Parkside, New Haw, showed ""no sign of having a moral compass"". Det Con Simon Andrews said fraudsters often hid behind social media but ""Ghedia was far more brazen... presenting himself in person to acquaintances as a senior trader at one of the world's biggest investment banks"". Police said Ghedia would now face confiscation proceedings. Follow BBC South East onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, and onInstagram,external.Send your story ideas tosoutheasttoday@bbc.co.uk.

This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city.

Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it.

LiveLiveUK pledges to train thousands of Ukrainian troops2 minutes ago,"Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a ""front-line city,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the conflict could last for years In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Stoltenberg adds that the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the Donbas region Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the Sunday Times that ""we need to steel ourselves for a long war"" Ukrainian authorities say their air defence systems in the Kyiv Region shot down a Russian âair objectâ on Sunday morning Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre, but no casualties were reported Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now wrapping up our day of live coverage of events in Ukraine. This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai.

At the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon, the animals are being looked after with specially made ice lollies - the perfect way to cool down in the heat. The sanctuary's Simon Horn says: ""The ice
blocks are made from fruit and vegetables in water. ""They not only provide a
welcome treat during the sizzling temperatures, but they also provide a
valuable form of enrichment. ""Donkeys love exploring, and this activity allows
them to exhibit their natural foraging behaviours - a key factor in improving
donkey welfare."" It is officially the hottest day of the year in the UK for the third day in a row. Heathrow in west London recorded 32.4C (90F) this afternoon andtemperatures could climb furtherto 34C in parts of the South East. Today's record temperature surpassed the previous day's high of 29.5C (85.1F) recorded at Northolt in west London. The Met Office also predicts it could be the ""hottest Royal Ascot on record"" at the Berkshire racecourse. In Santon Downham, Suffolk, temperatures reached 31.1C, and Wisley, Surrey, recorded 30.4C. But the picture changes further north, with the Met Office pointing out a marked difference in temperatures, with Glasgow recording 13.7C just after midday. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter While parts of South East England will have another very warm to hot day on Saturday, elsewhere in England and Wales things will feel very different as temperatures drop significantly. For example, Leeds will fall from a high near 27C today to just 16C tomorrow. This photo of a tranquil spot in Leeds was taken a short while ago by BBC Weather Watcher Martin King. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Livestock cool off in a pond to beat the heat in Pakistan where temperatures reached 40C last month If youâre in
the southern half of the UK youâll certainly be feeling the heat - but spare a
thought for Spain and France, they are experiencing a punishing heatwave. This week
France saw temperatures hit 40C - the earliest in the year than ever before. Spain is
enduring its second heatwave this year and there are warnings it could reach
43C in the next couple of days. That did not used to happen until July or
August. It is this
type of intense heat that scientists warn will become more common as global
warming heats the planet. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the 19th century and temperatures continue to rise. The last seven years have been
the hottest years ever recorded and, if no action is taken to curb climate
change, scientists warn a rise of 4C is possible. In the US
now, more than 100 million people are being warned to stay indoors as scorching
temperatures settle over large parts of the country. India and
Pakistan suffered even more brutal heat last month with temperatures in
Pakistan reaching 50C while the Indian capital, New Delhi, hit 49.2C â
an all-time high. While periods
of hot weather have always occurred naturally, the increased intensity and
frequency of extreme heat now is a warning bell for the impacts ofclimate change. To place the current hot weather in context, we've drawn up a map of some peak temperatures hit around the UK - both in the month of June and overall. Some historical high points for thermometers include the hottest temperature recorded in June, when Southampton peaked at 35.6C in 1976. In more recent times, Cambridge experienced a sweltering 38.7C in July 2019, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

In the words of Billy Idol, it's hot in the city. In the words of The Clash, London's burning. In the words of Glen Frey, the heat is on. A high of 34C (93.2F) is expected in the capital on Friday. So are Londoners coping with the heatwave - or is it too hot to handle? Before the inevitable rainclouds return to empty over our optimistic barbecues - we take a look at some ""snaps-hots"" from around the city. Ladies take to the cooling waters at Parliament Hill Lido It's hot hot hot in Trafalgar Square They can't be British - neither appears to have brought a jacket ""just in case"" A hydrofoil rider takes off at Royal Docks in east London The new incarnation of Mary Poppins prepares to take off at London Fields Lido in Hackney Don't just carry it. Drink it Bournemouth's beaches are ready for an expected influx of thousands of visitors over the weekend, the local council says. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council says it expects tens of thousands of visitors over the next few days to head to the seaside to enjoy the heat and sunshine. Beachgoers flocked to the resort town on the south coast of England when the first Covid-19 lockdown was eased in June 2020, which led to the councildeclaring a major incident. Since the incident, the council has developed a freebeach check appshowing people which areas are crowded, gives the location of public toilets and lifeguards, and says which areas dogs can use. Security cameras, a hub for emergency services and more rangers have also since been brought in. Read morehere. If the hot weather is becoming oppressive, there are some basic principles to help stop it becoming too much. During the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out and close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out. Open all the windows before you go to bed to get a through breeze. Using even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather as it encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. If you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. Alternatively, cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body, so try chilling your socks in the fridge before wearing. And of course, keep hydrated. A Level 3 heat-health alert has been issued for London, the east of England and the south-east to help protect health services, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says. The alert, called 'heatwave action', is to help protect the NHS and to inform its partners that they should prepare their services for possible increases in demand due to increases in temperatures, Agostinho Sousa of the UKHSA tells BBC Breakfast. âWe also have a Level 2 that is currently active in the South West and East of England that is to inform our partners that they should prepare their services in case they need to enter into action in case we see an increase in temperatures. âRight now the situation is stable, and we expect the temperatures to drop tomorrow.â Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals can cause muscle cramps and shock due to cold water temperatures, the fire service says People have been warnednot to swim in open water as temperatures soar. Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals could cause muscle cramps and shock as the water often remained cold even in heatwaves, says Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Fresh water could be polluted and cause serious illness, it said. People who fall into water by accident should lean back, extend their legs and arms, and use slow, gentle movements to stay afloat. Once you have controlled your breathing, attempt to swim to safety and call for help, the service adds. Anyone seeing a person or animal in trouble around water was asked to phone 999. If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's the latest on the extreme weather hitting parts of the UK and Europe: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37.5C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave. But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it. You can read more by James on the dangers of heat and what to do about themhere. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter At midday, the temperature at Heathrow Airport was 30.3C, which is the highest for England and the UK so far this year. Wales has also recorded its highest temperature so far - 26.7C at Cardiff Bute Park. This heatwave has been building across western Europe - last weekSpainsaw temperatures above 40C - and now that heat has started to move
northwards. Spain is used to heatwaves â just not this
early in the summer season and certainly not this hot. And with the high temperatures come the inevitable
wildfires. InItaly, the soaring
heat is leading to growing concerns about water shortages. As we reported earlier, large stretches of the countryâs largest river, the Po, the
water is so low that locals can walk through the middle of the expanse of sand -
and wartime shipwrecks are even resurfacing. Across thePyrenees, straddling the border
of France and Spain, outdoor public events are being banned from tomorrow until
the end of the heatwave. Teachers in the region are watering
playgrounds in order to prevent pupils getting heatstroke in the extreme heat. Portugalsaw its hottest May since 1931, and yesterdayFrance recorded a temperature of over 40C - the earliest hot spell ever to hit the country. And French officials say the peak of the heatwave is yet to be reached. The hot zone is expected to move intocentral Europe, ItalytheAlpine countriesand the south ofGermany. The peak of the heatwave in theUKarrives today acrossEnglandandWales, with temperatures set to reach 33C. But inScotlandandNorthern Ireland, temperatures are expected to peak at a more comfortable 23C Across the whole of the UK, cooler and fresher conditions are expected over the weekend Scientists warn that as global temperatures rise over time heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent, more intense and longer lasting - and their impact more widespread.

"Passenger dies after leaving flight at GatwickThe man, a restricted mobility passenger, left an EasyJet plane and later fell on an escalator.SussexEx-banker faked cancer as part of Â£1.8m fraudRajesh Ghedia said he had pancreatic cancer and he would be dead within a year in an insurance scam.Surrey","Gatwick said a formal investigation was under way A passenger with restricted mobility has died at Gatwick Airport after leaving an aircraft. Gatwick said staff were helping to disembark three passengers with restricted mobility at the time, including the man's partner. He decided to leave the EasyJet plane rather than wait for staff to return and fell while going up an escalator, an airport spokesman said. Sussex Police confirmed the 82-year-old man died at 12:50 BST on Wednesday. Gatwick cuts summer flights after staff shortages The Gatwick spokesman said the passenger made a short walk to the escalator from the runway to the Skybridge, which takes passengers to the north terminal. He said EasyJet cabin crew were closest to the man, so provided medical attention before the airport's medical staff arrived. An airline spokesman said: ""A number of our cabin crew provided medical assistance to a passenger at Gatwick Airport whilst waiting for paramedics to arrive. ""However the passenger sadly later passed away."" Details are still emerging on exactly how this tragedy occurred at Gatwick but my thoughts are with this poor passenger and his family. I know all too well the sense of immense frustration as you watch all the other passengers disembark and you are left stranded on an empty plane waiting for ground staff to retrieve your wheelchair and get you off. This is not the first time a passenger with restricted mobility has taken matters into their own hands. In August 2017, Justin Levene famously dragged himself across the floor of Luton Airport after staff were unable to retrieve his wheelchair. They had offered to strap him into an airport chair and push him through the terminal but Levene, a fitness enthusiast, declined, saying this compromised his independence. This incident is now being investigated. However, it raises more questions about the treatment of disabled passengers and those with restricted mobility. Historically their needs do not appear to have been a high priority at many British airports. Gatwick said a formal investigation was under way. It said when the aircraft arrived a member of staff was deployed from Wilson James, a company which provides assistance for passengers with restricted mobility (PRM). The staff member ""was in the process of disembarking the three PRM passengers when the incident occurred,"" it said. ""Staff shortages were not a factor in this incident. ""It is normal for one staff member to disembark three passengers who require assistance by taking them one at a time the short distance to the waiting buggy."" Wilson James said the passenger was not left waiting to disembark. In a statement the company said: ""The agent was at the gate within one minute of the aircraft parking on its stand, and the incident itself only happened 10 minutes after the aircraft landed. ""The agent who handled the passenger is very experienced, has been working in this service for a number of years and has a background working with people with complex disabilities and needs in the care sector.""

Ex-banker faked cancer as part of Â£1.8m fraudRajesh Ghedia said he had pancreatic cancer and he would be dead within a year in an insurance scam.Surrey,"Rajesh Ghedia lived a ""lavish lifestyle"", the court was told A former banker who faked terminal pancreatic cancer as part of a series of scams worth Â£1.8m has been jailed. Rajesh Ghedia, 42, said he would be dead in a year in a Â£1.2m insurance scam, Southwark Crown Court heard. He also swindled seven people - including a relative - out of huge sums of money by encouraging them to invest in non-existent financial products. Ghedia, of Addlestone, Surrey, admitted more than 30 counts of fraud at an earlier hearing. Judge Deborah Taylor told him he was a persistent fraudster who caused victims devastation and had left them scarred. The court was told Ghedia faked medical letters from a consultant to claim insurance. He made fraudulent claims about his Bank of America position to encourage people, including a cousin, to invest in non-existent products with the company and Goldman Sachs, the court heard. Ghedia had also falsely claimed his daughter had been killed in a car crash to avoid communicating with victims, the court was told. Prosecuting, Jack Talbot said Ghedia had ""high value"" property and vehicles, privately-educated his children, and lived a ""lavish lifestyle"". Defending, Benjamin Waidhofer said Ghedia had a good character, adding he ""entirely accepts responsibility"". Jailing Ghedia for six years and nine months, the judge said the offences were significant, with extensive planning. On the investment fraud, she said: ""You have caused them (victims) devastation, showing utter disregard for their mental wellbeing and finances."" After the hearing, Det Con Daniel Weller, from City of London Police, said Ghedia, from Parkside, New Haw, showed ""no sign of having a moral compass"". Det Con Simon Andrews said fraudsters often hid behind social media but ""Ghedia was far more brazen... presenting himself in person to acquaintances as a senior trader at one of the world's biggest investment banks"". Police said Ghedia would now face confiscation proceedings. Follow BBC South East onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, and onInstagram,external.Send your story ideas tosoutheasttoday@bbc.co.uk.

LiveLivePutin criticises 'mad and thoughtless' Russia sanctions3 minutes ago,"Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a ""front-line city,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the conflict could last for years In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Stoltenberg adds that the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the Donbas region Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the Sunday Times that ""we need to steel ourselves for a long war"" Ukrainian authorities say their air defence systems in the Kyiv Region shot down a Russian âair objectâ on Sunday morning Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre, but no casualties were reported Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now wrapping up our day of live coverage of events in Ukraine. This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

Airlines told to cancel flights,"UK airlines have been told to cancel flights they can't deliver this summer to stop a rerun of May's travel chaos. The government and the aviation regulator wrote to carriers on Tuesday telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable"". They added that earlier cancellations were ""better"" than axing flights at the last minute. It comes after tens of thousands of passengers have been affected by cancellations and delays at airports. The problem was particularly bad during Easter and last month's half-term school holiday, and British Airways, TUI and Easyjet have apologised. Why are so many flights being cancelled? Cancelled flights fuel summer holiday fears Children and teachers stuck abroad as term starts Staff shortages have been blamed, after thousands of airline jobs were cut during the pandemic and have yet to be replaced despite a spike in post-pandemic travel demand. In their joint letter, the Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority set out five ""specific expectations"" for the sector. They wrote: ""We think it's important that each airline reviews afresh its plans for the remainder of the summer season until the end of September to develop a schedule that is deliverable. ""Your schedules must be based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available, and should be resilient for the unplanned and inevitable operational challenges that you will face. ""While cancellations at any time are a regrettable inconvenience to passengers, it is our view that cancellations at the earliest possibility to deliver a more robust schedule are better for consumers than late notice on-the-day cancellations."" EasyJet is one of the airlines to have cancelled flights The letter stated that airlines must ""keep consumers informed"" about their rights during disruption, such as having ""sufficiently staffed call centres and user-friendly digital channels"". It also urged airlines, ground handlers, air traffic control and the Border Force work more closely to try to prevent problems. Airlines and unions told MPs on the Commons Business Committee on Tuesday that the staffing shortages blighting the industry were likely to persist this summer. Oliver Richardson, national officer for civil air transport at the Unite union, told MPs it was unlikely the situation would be fixed ""unless we work together"". Representatives from BA, Easyjet and ground handling firm Swissport said they also faced long delays to get security clearance for new staff. Swissport's UK boss, Jude Winstanley, said it had hired 3,000 people since the start of the year, but it was taking up to 90 days to get them a full airside pass due to the referencing process. According to the CAA, up to 4% of UK flights were cancelled during half term and the Platinum Jubilee weekend - up from the usual rate of 1%. Boss Richard Moriarty called the situation distressing and unacceptable, adding that the industry needed to get a grip - although he said it was ""not solely a UK specific issue"". There have been calls for EU aviation workers to be added to the government's shortage occupation list, but aviation minister Robert Courts denied this would help. He told the committee that EU HGV drivers - another industry facing shortages - had been offered up to 5,000 visas to fill gaps in the UK, and only 27 had come forward. ""If there were spare workers in Europe they would be in Schiphol [Amsterdam airport],"" he said. Do you work in the aviation industry? Are you a passenger affected?

Your questions answeredWith prices rising for food and fuel, our correspondent answers your questions about the cost of living crisis.UK","Inflation in the UK is expected to top 11% this year as energy, food and fuel prices soar We've been finding out how people are coping with rising prices, and our personal finance correspondent has been answering your questions The BBC's Kevin Peachey has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade The rising cost of living is being blamed on economies rebounding after the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and pressures on supply chains The AA says petrol prices in the UK his a new record yesterday, with a litre of unleaded reaching 187.51p A BBC survey of 4,011 people suggests 8 in 10 people are worried about the cost of living, and more than half said they had skipped meals to save money Two-thirds of those surveyed suggested government support provided so far was insufficient Jen Meierhans, Andrew Humphrey and Rob Corp That's all for our Q&A on the cost of living for today. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions and shared how rising prices have been affecting your lives. Thanks also, of course, to our personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey, for providing plenty of really useful of answers. We're going to wrap up this live coverage shortly but you canread more about the rising cost of living, and what support you can get here. We're nearly at the end of today's live coverage on the cost of living. Here's a recap on what we know:  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Christine asks if her mother, who is 93 and receives a state pension, Pension Credit and Attendance Allowance, will get any payments to help pay for her care home costs? First things first, not everyone is as organised as Christine and her mum. An estimated 850,000 pensioner households fail to claim pension credit â which tops up the income of those who donât have much money coming in, and is a gateway to other payments. Moving into a care home can affect your benefit entitlement. In this case, the receipt of Pension Credit should mean an entitlement to the Â£650 cost of living payment for those on means-tested benefits. People on Attendance Allowance should also qualify for an extra Â£150 paid to people with disabilities in September. We have aguideon how this works. These payments are designed to help with energy bills but, in practice, can be spent as you wish. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Sketchley is a pensioner living in Spain and wants to know if UK citizens who have retired abroad will receive the Â£300 payment to pensioners? The Â£300 referred to here by Simon is a top-up to the Winter Fuel Payment paid in November or December to pensioner households. People living in Spain are not eligible for either â because of the higher winter temperatures. The same is true for those living in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta and Portugal. Those living in other parts of Europe may be entitled to it though. Thegovernment website,externaloutlines eligibility. Fuengirola beach in the Costa del Sol Matthew Homes worked for a financial services company before being made redundant at the beginning of June and says he feels his family have been overlooked by the government. The 22-year-old and his wife, who came to the UK from Ukraine last summer, have a six-month-old baby and say they have been struggling financially since her birth. ""Weâre seeing our budget squeezed day-to-day. With the baby we have seen how the formula and purees have gone up and baby wipes and nappies have gone up. I used to get them on Amazon but now itâs like a treasure hunt for cheaper options. ""Weâre not in a position to pay for our daughter to go to nursery and we donât get help with that."" Matthew says they fall into a ""certain group of people who havenât been considered"" and believes that government help in general came too late. ""Weâre cut out from accessing any financial support from our governmentâ¦ itâs for people on some kind of benefits but that doesnât include us. ""My daughter hasnât been able to see her grandparents because we canât afford to go."" Jeff Cottrell asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Jeff, it appears, is one of many people who pay their energy bill to a landlord or park owner, rather than directly to an energy supplier. It is fair to say that some of these details are yet to be fully ironed out, ahead of the discount paid from October. In fact, they are part of a government consultation. Concerns have been raised, for example, that some landlords may not pass on the full discount to private renters. In time, organisations such as Citizens Advice could offer help and advice, once the policy is finalised. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Peter Scouse, 68, from London, says with things like milk increasing from Â£1 to Â£1.35, petrol from Â£1.20 to Â£1.90 and gas up by more than 50%, his personal rate of inflation is about 30% not the 9% quoted in the news. Peter raises an important point, which is that there is an official rate of inflation â calculated by the Office for National Statistics, based on a typical âbasketâ of goods and services. There is also an individualâs own personal inflation rate. For example, if you drive a lot, or spend much of your time in a poorly insulated home, then you may well have been hit harder than others by recent price rises. There is an expectation for pensioners like Peter that, owing to the way the uprating of benefits is calculated, the state pension looks set for a double-digit increase next April â although that probably still feels a long way away. Paul and Amanda both work so haven't had to watch what they're spending before. ""Now we're doing it on a daily basis,"" says Paul. They do still get takeaways and go out for meals, but not as often and now they order a jug of tap water to keep the bill down. At the supermarket, instead of buying branded products like they used to, they are looking at own-brand items, and are looking for deals. ""We have to look at: What do we really want? What do we really need? Do we really need that luxury? Do we really need those sweets?"" Find out three of the main ways people are changing their spending habitshere. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Michelle Massetti is worried about her son who is a university student. His maintenance loan doesnât cover his Â£6000 a year rent. The rising cost of living is affecting all sorts of people across all walks of life. Students are no strangers to new debt, and â of course â they are seeing rising prices too when it comes to eating and heating. If they are in a student house, they should expect to see their gas and electricity bill rise this winter. However, the government is taking some of the sting out of that increase with a Â£400 discount on everyoneâs domestic energy bill from October. One striking finding in our survey is that 83% of young adults asked, who said they were worried about the rising cost of living, said it was having an impact on their mental health. Haizea Cacho asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent As Haizea is all too aware, maternity leave can mean a drop in your income, just as you face a host of new baby-related expenses. There is support at any time for those who are pregnant or who have just had a baby. For example, you can get free dental care across the UK. There are a host of other benefits and grants that may be claimed for those on low incomes. They can vary in different parts of the UK. This guide,externalfrom the independent MoneyHelper website should help. As well as sending in questions for Kevin, BBC News readers have been getting in touch with their experiences of the rising cost of living. Fiona Stevenson, from Lingdale, worked as a teacher for 27 years until leaving last October due to ill health. Sheâs set to claim her occupational pension in December and relies on her husbandâs part-time job as a school technician. Fiona is also able to make some money through her hobby of crafting. They are owner-occupiers of their home but are finding it hard to make ends meet. ""Not only are costs of all goods and food rising rapidly but fuel costs are now out of control and plans for summer camping trips have had to be cancelled due to the cost of diesel,"" she says. ""We do not even have our lights on in the evening and are dreading the winter months,"" she says. ""The government must step in and reduce the costs for the people they represent. Cut VAT on fuel, increase benefits and provide windfall payments to businesses and households."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent David Wellbelove asks why, when you buy a loaf of bread in a supermarket anywhere in the UK the price is roughly the same, is fuel different? Actually, prices for many goods and services do differ by location - it is just that the huge signs on petrol forecourts make it more obvious. It is less well known, for example, that your domestic energy bill will vary depending on where you live in the country. On vehicle fuel specifically, local prices are influenced by location and competition. If the petrol station is close to storage and convenient for deliveries, then the price will tend to be lower. Drivers also generally pay less in areas where local supermarkets are competing on price. But, as itnow costs more than Â£100 to fill the tank of a family car, it is no surprise our survey suggests people have decided to take fewer journeys to save money. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Rhonda Cowland asks what to do if you were unaware you might be entitled to the cost of living payment. The good news for you Rhonda is that much of this support is automatically paid to those who are eligible, without the need to claim. Without exactly knowing your situation, it is hard to answer your question directly. However, there is one deadline to be aware of, particularly if you are newly-unemployed. Only those who are entitled to and received their first Universal Credit payment by 25 May will be eligible for the first Â£326 instalment of support for those on means-tested benefits. The second will be paid later in the year. Amanda Leeds asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent There are different payments for different groups of people - and so eligibility does vary. However, it is important to say that they will pretty much all be made automatically. That assumes people have claimed the benefits to which they are entitled, because without claiming those, you could miss out on the extra payments. For example, those on means-tested benefits will receive their first cost of living payment automatically into their bank, building society or credit union account by the end of July. We have aguideand there is also sometechnical guidance,externalfrom the Treasury. It's time now for our personal finance correspondent to join us and answer some of your questions about rising prices and what help is available. We'll be putting your questions to the BBCâs Kevin Peachey. He has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected there's a form at the bottom ofthis story. Sabrina Omar, 20, has emailed us to say she thinks the government should do more to help students struggling with the cost of living crisis. The second year diagnostic radiography student at the University of Hertfordshire says living away from home makes things difficult. ""Just with the
basic stuff like food and bills the costs are going up and up and we donât get
any extra student loan or extra help from anywhere else,"" she says. Her fuel reimbursement for travelling to her placement is 28p a mile and with thecost of filling the average tankmore than Â£100 it's ""not making much of a difference"", she says. âAnything that the government can do to help... I
would offer the same support that they are offering other households or just
some sort of support specifically for students. ""Even with a part-time job Iâm struggling because thereâs only
so many hours I can do,"" she says. ""I have been thinking
about the possibility of commuting in next year just to find the cheapest way possible to complete my
course, itâs really made me evaluate everything.â Back to theBBC's cost of living survey, and perhaps unsurprisingly more than 80% of working adults said they thought their wages should match the increase in inflation. Though when it came to asking directly for pay rises, just over half said they would be requesting more money, and only 35% told the survey that they would be demanding 9% or more. Expectations of pay matching inflation seems to be low, with nearly half of those responding to the BBC saying their financial outlook would get worse in the second half of the year. We'll be joined at 13:00 BST by the BBCâs personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey to answer some of your questions about the cost of living crisis. Kevin has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade.

Let's go back to the BBC's survey of how people across the UK are experiencing the rising cost of living. As we've previously mentioned, pollsters Savanta questioned 4,011 people at the beginning of this month. They were asked about aseries of paymentsannounced by the government aimed at taking the sting out of rising household costs. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said the support was insufficient. Just 24% of people who responded to the BBC thought the package of payments was enough to help people with the rising cost of living. When asked how long government support should last 64% of people said help should be available ""as long as necessary"". Our colleagues atRadio 5 Livehave been visiting the New Parks area of Leicester since the cost of living crisis began. Donna runs a food bank in the area and says ""more and more people"" are coming for help, but she and her partner are struggling to keep it open. ""We're having to cut down on our voluntary work in the community because we can't afford the petrol, we need it ourselves for the shopping,"" she says. ""I personally do 300 miles a week, so that's not feasible any more... I can't afford to help the community and it makes me feel really bad.""My family comes before anyone else and as much as I want to help somebody, it's coming to a time where I can't."" Shaun is a dad to three young boys. He says a lack of money is causing arguments in his house. ""[The kids] don't understand that once you've paid your bills, there's nothing extra to play with,"" he says. ""We as a family go out probably once a month because that's all we can do... they don't understand it and it's hard, but once they're older I suppose they'll understand."" Â© 2025 BBC.

William and Kate - who have not attended the Berkshire meet for a number of years - arrived in the traditional royal carriage procession to cheers from the crowds. The Queen has not made an appearance today with other members of the Royal Family. Thanks to the soaring temperatures, the event's organisers earlier announced that the strict dress code would not be enforced in all enclosures. Punters have been reminded to stay cool and a message broadcast on the public address system said: ""Please drink plenty of water all afternoon and keep hydrated."" Race-goers shelter from the sun's rays under parasols Carrie Johnson, wife of the PM, made an appearance dressed in white Punters enjoy a picnic - complete with tablecloth - under a bit of shade Racing fans with fans If all else fails, a large hat provides a bit of shade Outdoor public events have beenbanned in an area of France as a record-breaking heatwavesweeps across Europe. Concerts and large public gatherings have been called off in the Gironde department around Bordeaux. Yesterday, parts of France hit 40C earlier in the year than usual, with temperatures expected to peak tomorrow. Scientists say periods of intense heat are becoming more frequent and longer lasting as a result of global warming. In Gironde, officials said public events, including some of the official 18 June Resistance celebrations, will be prohibited from Friday at 14:00 (12:00 GMT) ""until the end of the heat wave"". Indoor events at venues without air conditioning are also banned. The weather has been kind for festival-goers on the Isle of Wight, with no wellies needed. Organisers havewarned people at the Isle of Wight Festival to stay safeduring the heat and recommended they take precautions - including avoiding excess alcohol consumption. As a result of the soaring temperatures suncream is the order of the day - and the only shelter being sought is to get out of the sun. This video can not be played Isle of Wight Festival: Hot weather warnings for revellers Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter Hot days are often followed by very warm nights. If the overnight temperature doesnât drop below 20C then thatâs defined as a tropical night and thereâs a chance of that somewhere in south-east England tonight.What is a tropical night? Harry LowBBC London News Itâs hotting up here at this lido as the sunbathers soak up the sunshine in south-east London. Since sunrise swimmers have been flocking to Charlton: all 1,000 slots sold out as people look for some respite from the high temperatures brought about by the arrival of the Spanish plume. Picnickers have set up camp beside this Olympic-sized swimming pool as the trees surrounding the pool gently sway in the breeze. A number of fair-weather swimmers have visited throughout the day, much to the chagrin of some regulars who are not used to sharing with crowds, especially during those long, cold winter months. If you're heading out to make the most of the summer sunshine today, spare a thought for some of our hairy-coated friends. As the temperature rises, it's not just us humans that need to keep cool. At the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon, the animals are being looked after with specially made ice lollies - the perfect way to cool down in the heat. The sanctuary's Simon Horn says: ""The ice
blocks are made from fruit and vegetables in water. ""They not only provide a
welcome treat during the sizzling temperatures, but they also provide a
valuable form of enrichment. ""Donkeys love exploring, and this activity allows
them to exhibit their natural foraging behaviours - a key factor in improving
donkey welfare."" It is officially the hottest day of the year in the UK for the third day in a row. Heathrow in west London recorded 32.4C (90F) this afternoon andtemperatures could climb furtherto 34C in parts of the South East. Today's record temperature surpassed the previous day's high of 29.5C (85.1F) recorded at Northolt in west London. The Met Office also predicts it could be the ""hottest Royal Ascot on record"" at the Berkshire racecourse. In Santon Downham, Suffolk, temperatures reached 31.1C, and Wisley, Surrey, recorded 30.4C. But the picture changes further north, with the Met Office pointing out a marked difference in temperatures, with Glasgow recording 13.7C just after midday. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter While parts of South East England will have another very warm to hot day on Saturday, elsewhere in England and Wales things will feel very different as temperatures drop significantly. For example, Leeds will fall from a high near 27C today to just 16C tomorrow. This photo of a tranquil spot in Leeds was taken a short while ago by BBC Weather Watcher Martin King. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Livestock cool off in a pond to beat the heat in Pakistan where temperatures reached 40C last month If youâre in
the southern half of the UK youâll certainly be feeling the heat - but spare a
thought for Spain and France, they are experiencing a punishing heatwave. This week
France saw temperatures hit 40C - the earliest in the year than ever before. Spain is
enduring its second heatwave this year and there are warnings it could reach
43C in the next couple of days. That did not used to happen until July or
August. It is this
type of intense heat that scientists warn will become more common as global
warming heats the planet. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the 19th century and temperatures continue to rise. The last seven years have been
the hottest years ever recorded and, if no action is taken to curb climate
change, scientists warn a rise of 4C is possible. In the US
now, more than 100 million people are being warned to stay indoors as scorching
temperatures settle over large parts of the country. India and
Pakistan suffered even more brutal heat last month with temperatures in
Pakistan reaching 50C while the Indian capital, New Delhi, hit 49.2C â
an all-time high. While periods
of hot weather have always occurred naturally, the increased intensity and
frequency of extreme heat now is a warning bell for the impacts ofclimate change. To place the current hot weather in context, we've drawn up a map of some peak temperatures hit around the UK - both in the month of June and overall. Some historical high points for thermometers include the hottest temperature recorded in June, when Southampton peaked at 35.6C in 1976. In more recent times, Cambridge experienced a sweltering 38.7C in July 2019, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

In the words of Billy Idol, it's hot in the city. In the words of The Clash, London's burning. In the words of Glen Frey, the heat is on. A high of 34C (93.2F) is expected in the capital on Friday. So are Londoners coping with the heatwave - or is it too hot to handle? Before the inevitable rainclouds return to empty over our optimistic barbecues - we take a look at some ""snaps-hots"" from around the city.

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council says it expects tens of thousands of visitors over the next few days to head to the seaside to enjoy the heat and sunshine. Beachgoers flocked to the resort town on the south coast of England when the first Covid-19 lockdown was eased in June 2020, which led to the councildeclaring a major incident. Since the incident, the council has developed a freebeach check appshowing people which areas are crowded, gives the location of public toilets and lifeguards, and says which areas dogs can use. Security cameras, a hub for emergency services and more rangers have also since been brought in. Read morehere. If the hot weather is becoming oppressive, there are some basic principles to help stop it becoming too much. During the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out and close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out. Open all the windows before you go to bed to get a through breeze. Using even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather as it encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. If you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. Alternatively, cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body, so try chilling your socks in the fridge before wearing. And of course, keep hydrated. A Level 3 heat-health alert has been issued for London, the east of England and the south-east to help protect health services, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says. The alert, called 'heatwave action', is to help protect the NHS and to inform its partners that they should prepare their services for possible increases in demand due to increases in temperatures, Agostinho Sousa of the UKHSA tells BBC Breakfast. âWe also have a Level 2 that is currently active in the South West and East of England that is to inform our partners that they should prepare their services in case they need to enter into action in case we see an increase in temperatures. âRight now the situation is stable, and we expect the temperatures to drop tomorrow.â Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals can cause muscle cramps and shock due to cold water temperatures, the fire service says People have been warnednot to swim in open water as temperatures soar. Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals could cause muscle cramps and shock as the water often remained cold even in heatwaves, says Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Fresh water could be polluted and cause serious illness, it said. People who fall into water by accident should lean back, extend their legs and arms, and use slow, gentle movements to stay afloat. Once you have controlled your breathing, attempt to swim to safety and call for help, the service adds. Anyone seeing a person or animal in trouble around water was asked to phone 999. If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's the latest on the extreme weather hitting parts of the UK and Europe: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37.5C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave. But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it. You can read more by James on the dangers of heat and what to do about themhere. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter At midday, the temperature at Heathrow Airport was 30.3C, which is the highest for England and the UK so far this year. Wales has also recorded its highest temperature so far - 26.7C at Cardiff Bute Park. This heatwave has been building across western Europe - last weekSpainsaw temperatures above 40C - and now that heat has started to move
northwards. Spain is used to heatwaves â just not this
early in the summer season and certainly not this hot. And with the high temperatures come the inevitable
wildfires. InItaly, the soaring
heat is leading to growing concerns about water shortages. As we reported earlier, large stretches of the countryâs largest river, the Po, the
water is so low that locals can walk through the middle of the expanse of sand -
and wartime shipwrecks are even resurfacing. Across thePyrenees, straddling the border
of France and Spain, outdoor public events are being banned from tomorrow until
the end of the heatwave. Teachers in the region are watering
playgrounds in order to prevent pupils getting heatstroke in the extreme heat. Portugalsaw its hottest May since 1931, and yesterdayFrance recorded a temperature of over 40C - the earliest hot spell ever to hit the country. And French officials say the peak of the heatwave is yet to be reached. The hot zone is expected to move intocentral Europe, ItalytheAlpine countriesand the south ofGermany. The peak of the heatwave in theUKarrives today acrossEnglandandWales, with temperatures set to reach 33C. But inScotlandandNorthern Ireland, temperatures are expected to peak at a more comfortable 23C Across the whole of the UK, cooler and fresher conditions are expected over the weekend Scientists warn that as global temperatures rise over time heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent, more intense and longer lasting - and their impact more widespread.

People cut back on food and fuel as prices rise,"People struggling with the soaring cost of living are cutting back on food and car journeys to save money, according to a BBC-commissioned survey. More than half (56%) the 4,011 people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. The findings reveal the widespread impact of prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. Many people have cut spending on clothes and socialising. Some say their mental health has been affected. Two-thirds of those surveyed also suggested government support provided so far was insufficient. The BBC-commissioned survey of 4,011 UK adults in early June lifts a lid on how the economic climate is affecting lives and financial, physical and mental health. The cost of domestic energy, petrol, and food have all increased significantly in recent months, and the findings suggest more than eight in 10 people (81%) are worried about the rising cost of living. 'We can't just go in there and buy what we like now' Why are prices rising so quickly? Five things that are going up in price and why Why chicken is getting more and more expensive Concern has grown since the start of the year when 69% of those asked said they were worried in a similar BBC survey. In the latest results, two thirds (66%) of those with worries said this was having a negative effect on their mental health. Nearly half (45%) said their physical health had been affected. Day-to-day, individuals are making further changes to manage their budgets. The survey suggests this can be as simple as going on fewer nights out, or getting a haircut less often. For charity worker Janine Colwill, from Easington, and those she talks to, the changes have been more fundamental. ""We get together with the family every Sunday, religiously, for Sunday roast - but my family and other families are starting to grow their own vegetables,"" she said. Janine Colwill says people in her area are constantly looking for ways to save money ""Those people who may not have worried about these things before are now worrying about them constantly. ""With advances in technology, I never would have thought that people would be relying on a food bank or growing their own - and just penny-pinching,"" she said. The survey suggests people are finding various ways to manage and save their money. The findings include: Some 82% of those asked had switched off lights in the previous week to save money Trips taken in the car had been limited to varying degrees in the previous six months by 72% of those asked A large majority (84%) said they had spent less on their clothes at some point in the previous six months About half (52%) expect to work more hours in the next six months to help to pay the bills. Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, said in a trading update for the three months to 28 May that it was seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to inflation, such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. Chief executive Ken Murphy also said people are switching to cheaper own-label brands for goods including bread and pastawhich have seen prices soardue to the war between Ukraine and Russia, both of which are major wheat exporters. Prices, as measured by inflation, are rising at a rate of 9% a year, the fastest for 40 years. Interest rates, which also affect the cost of living,were increased to 1.25%on Thursday by the Bank of England - the highest they have been for 13 years. The situation is being driven, to a significant degree, by global factors such as the cost of oil, gas and food. But there are UK-specific issues which are adding to inflation such as the tight labour market. Job vacancies are at a record high of 1.3 million meaning employers face paying higher wages to fill roles. Also, the UK's dominant services sector - which includes the likes of accountancy and law firms, as well as restaurants and pubs - is seeing price rises. Drivers now have to spendÂ£103 for petrol and Â£106 for diesel to fill a family car, according to the RAC. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) has predicted food priceswill rise at a rate of 15%this summer as households pay more for staples such as bread, meat, dairy and fruit and vegetables. A typical household in England, Wales and Scotland is likely to see a rise in its annual domestic gas and electricity bill of Â£800 in October, on top of a Â£700 rise in April. The surge in inflation is hitting wide and hitting deep, with the effects leading to significant changes in the way lives are being lived well beyond those on low incomes. Large swathes of Britain's middle income working households are having to make material cutbacks and even after that are part of a new class of those ""just about managing"". In practice this has meant energy bill direct debits wiping out people's entire disposable income, some food banks running out of food donations, or their donors becoming users. And it may be changing attitudes, with nearly two-thirds of those asked saying even after the recent package of support for energy bills from the government, that it is not enough. And the numbers suggest a similar proportion think the support in place needs to last at least a year longer. Inflation this high certainly changes the economy and our spending behaviour. But the figures raise a question about whether the high levels of government support in the pandemic and in this energy crisis too, are now becoming baked into public expectations. Soaring prices have led the government to announcea package of financial supportdirected primarily at those on low incomes. This includes a Â£400 discount on all energy bills in October, in addition to payments totalling Â£650 to people on means-tested benefits. Pensioners will get more this winter, as will billpayers with disabilities. However, the BBC survey reveals that 64% of those asked said this support was insufficient to help people with the rising cost of living. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said vulnerable households would receive Â£1,200 which he said was part of a ""very large"" amount of support, on top of what had already been provided. He said the first payments would come in July, and would continue into the autumn to offset the key driver of the rising cost of living for households, which was energy bills. ""That, of course, is yet to filter through to people, which is why I suspect people are saying they want more support,"" he told the BBC. ""As this gathers pace, it will be clear to people that this will be a comprehensive package."" The impact of rising household costs has already led to the financial regulator warning lenders that they need to do more to help those in financial difficulty and support vulnerable customers. ""Early action is important for those struggling with debt,"" said Sheldon Mills, of the Financial Conduct Authority. Three things we're cutting back on as prices rise What are cost of living payments and who gets them?

This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

Putin criticises 'mad and thoughtless' Russia sanctions,"Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a ""front-line city,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the conflict could last for years In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Stoltenberg adds that the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the Donbas region Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the Sunday Times that ""we need to steel ourselves for a long war"" Ukrainian authorities say their air defence systems in the Kyiv Region shot down a Russian âair objectâ on Sunday morning Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre, but no casualties were reported Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now wrapping up our day of live coverage of events in Ukraine. This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse.

"LiveLiveWhat can I do about cost of living? Your questions answeredWith prices rising for food and fuel, our correspondent answers your questions about the cost of living crisis.","Inflation in the UK is expected to top 11% this year as energy, food and fuel prices soar We've been finding out how people are coping with rising prices, and our personal finance correspondent has been answering your questions The BBC's Kevin Peachey has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade The rising cost of living is being blamed on economies rebounding after the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and pressures on supply chains The AA says petrol prices in the UK his a new record yesterday, with a litre of unleaded reaching 187.51p A BBC survey of 4,011 people suggests 8 in 10 people are worried about the cost of living, and more than half said they had skipped meals to save money Two-thirds of those surveyed suggested government support provided so far was insufficient Jen Meierhans, Andrew Humphrey and Rob Corp That's all for our Q&A on the cost of living for today. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions and shared how rising prices have been affecting your lives. Thanks also, of course, to our personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey, for providing plenty of really useful of answers. We're going to wrap up this live coverage shortly but you canread more about the rising cost of living, and what support you can get here. We're nearly at the end of today's live coverage on the cost of living. Here's a recap on what we know:  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Christine asks if her mother, who is 93 and receives a state pension, Pension Credit and Attendance Allowance, will get any payments to help pay for her care home costs? First things first, not everyone is as organised as Christine and her mum. An estimated 850,000 pensioner households fail to claim pension credit â which tops up the income of those who donât have much money coming in, and is a gateway to other payments. Moving into a care home can affect your benefit entitlement. In this case, the receipt of Pension Credit should mean an entitlement to the Â£650 cost of living payment for those on means-tested benefits. People on Attendance Allowance should also qualify for an extra Â£150 paid to people with disabilities in September. We have aguideon how this works. These payments are designed to help with energy bills but, in practice, can be spent as you wish. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Sketchley is a pensioner living in Spain and wants to know if UK citizens who have retired abroad will receive the Â£300 payment to pensioners? The Â£300 referred to here by Simon is a top-up to the Winter Fuel Payment paid in November or December to pensioner households. People living in Spain are not eligible for either â because of the higher winter temperatures. The same is true for those living in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta and Portugal. Those living in other parts of Europe may be entitled to it though. Thegovernment website,externaloutlines eligibility. Fuengirola beach in the Costa del Sol Matthew Homes worked for a financial services company before being made redundant at the beginning of June and says he feels his family have been overlooked by the government. The 22-year-old and his wife, who came to the UK from Ukraine last summer, have a six-month-old baby and say they have been struggling financially since her birth. ""Weâre seeing our budget squeezed day-to-day. With the baby we have seen how the formula and purees have gone up and baby wipes and nappies have gone up. I used to get them on Amazon but now itâs like a treasure hunt for cheaper options. ""Weâre not in a position to pay for our daughter to go to nursery and we donât get help with that."" Matthew says they fall into a ""certain group of people who havenât been considered"" and believes that government help in general came too late. ""Weâre cut out from accessing any financial support from our governmentâ¦ itâs for people on some kind of benefits but that doesnât include us. ""My daughter hasnât been able to see her grandparents because we canât afford to go."" Jeff Cottrell asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Jeff, it appears, is one of many people who pay their energy bill to a landlord or park owner, rather than directly to an energy supplier. It is fair to say that some of these details are yet to be fully ironed out, ahead of the discount paid from October. In fact, they are part of a government consultation. Concerns have been raised, for example, that some landlords may not pass on the full discount to private renters. In time, organisations such as Citizens Advice could offer help and advice, once the policy is finalised. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Peter Scouse, 68, from London, says with things like milk increasing from Â£1 to Â£1.35, petrol from Â£1.20 to Â£1.90 and gas up by more than 50%, his personal rate of inflation is about 30% not the 9% quoted in the news. Peter raises an important point, which is that there is an official rate of inflation â calculated by the Office for National Statistics, based on a typical âbasketâ of goods and services. There is also an individualâs own personal inflation rate. For example, if you drive a lot, or spend much of your time in a poorly insulated home, then you may well have been hit harder than others by recent price rises. There is an expectation for pensioners like Peter that, owing to the way the uprating of benefits is calculated, the state pension looks set for a double-digit increase next April â although that probably still feels a long way away. Paul and Amanda both work so haven't had to watch what they're spending before. ""Now we're doing it on a daily basis,"" says Paul. They do still get takeaways and go out for meals, but not as often and now they order a jug of tap water to keep the bill down. At the supermarket, instead of buying branded products like they used to, they are looking at own-brand items, and are looking for deals. ""We have to look at: What do we really want? What do we really need? Do we really need that luxury? Do we really need those sweets?"" Find out three of the main ways people are changing their spending habitshere. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Michelle Massetti is worried about her son who is a university student. His maintenance loan doesnât cover his Â£6000 a year rent. The rising cost of living is affecting all sorts of people across all walks of life. Students are no strangers to new debt, and â of course â they are seeing rising prices too when it comes to eating and heating. If they are in a student house, they should expect to see their gas and electricity bill rise this winter. However, the government is taking some of the sting out of that increase with a Â£400 discount on everyoneâs domestic energy bill from October. One striking finding in our survey is that 83% of young adults asked, who said they were worried about the rising cost of living, said it was having an impact on their mental health. Haizea Cacho asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent As Haizea is all too aware, maternity leave can mean a drop in your income, just as you face a host of new baby-related expenses. There is support at any time for those who are pregnant or who have just had a baby. For example, you can get free dental care across the UK. There are a host of other benefits and grants that may be claimed for those on low incomes. They can vary in different parts of the UK. This guide,externalfrom the independent MoneyHelper website should help. As well as sending in questions for Kevin, BBC News readers have been getting in touch with their experiences of the rising cost of living. Fiona Stevenson, from Lingdale, worked as a teacher for 27 years until leaving last October due to ill health. Sheâs set to claim her occupational pension in December and relies on her husbandâs part-time job as a school technician. Fiona is also able to make some money through her hobby of crafting. They are owner-occupiers of their home but are finding it hard to make ends meet. ""Not only are costs of all goods and food rising rapidly but fuel costs are now out of control and plans for summer camping trips have had to be cancelled due to the cost of diesel,"" she says. ""We do not even have our lights on in the evening and are dreading the winter months,"" she says. ""The government must step in and reduce the costs for the people they represent. Cut VAT on fuel, increase benefits and provide windfall payments to businesses and households."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent David Wellbelove asks why, when you buy a loaf of bread in a supermarket anywhere in the UK the price is roughly the same, is fuel different? Actually, prices for many goods and services do differ by location - it is just that the huge signs on petrol forecourts make it more obvious. It is less well known, for example, that your domestic energy bill will vary depending on where you live in the country. On vehicle fuel specifically, local prices are influenced by location and competition. If the petrol station is close to storage and convenient for deliveries, then the price will tend to be lower. Drivers also generally pay less in areas where local supermarkets are competing on price. But, as itnow costs more than Â£100 to fill the tank of a family car, it is no surprise our survey suggests people have decided to take fewer journeys to save money. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Rhonda Cowland asks what to do if you were unaware you might be entitled to the cost of living payment. The good news for you Rhonda is that much of this support is automatically paid to those who are eligible, without the need to claim. Without exactly knowing your situation, it is hard to answer your question directly. However, there is one deadline to be aware of, particularly if you are newly-unemployed. Only those who are entitled to and received their first Universal Credit payment by 25 May will be eligible for the first Â£326 instalment of support for those on means-tested benefits. The second will be paid later in the year. Amanda Leeds asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent There are different payments for different groups of people - and so eligibility does vary. However, it is important to say that they will pretty much all be made automatically. That assumes people have claimed the benefits to which they are entitled, because without claiming those, you could miss out on the extra payments. For example, those on means-tested benefits will receive their first cost of living payment automatically into their bank, building society or credit union account by the end of July. We have aguideand there is also sometechnical guidance,externalfrom the Treasury. It's time now for our personal finance correspondent to join us and answer some of your questions about rising prices and what help is available. We'll be putting your questions to the BBCâs Kevin Peachey. He has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected there's a form at the bottom ofthis story. Sabrina Omar, 20, has emailed us to say she thinks the government should do more to help students struggling with the cost of living crisis. The second year diagnostic radiography student at the University of Hertfordshire says living away from home makes things difficult. ""Just with the
basic stuff like food and bills the costs are going up and up and we donât get
any extra student loan or extra help from anywhere else,"" she says. Her fuel reimbursement for travelling to her placement is 28p a mile and with thecost of filling the average tankmore than Â£100 it's ""not making much of a difference"", she says. âAnything that the government can do to help... I
would offer the same support that they are offering other households or just
some sort of support specifically for students. ""Even with a part-time job Iâm struggling because thereâs only
so many hours I can do,"" she says. ""I have been thinking
about the possibility of commuting in next year just to find the cheapest way possible to complete my
course, itâs really made me evaluate everything.â Back to theBBC's cost of living survey, and perhaps unsurprisingly more than 80% of working adults said they thought their wages should match the increase in inflation. Though when it came to asking directly for pay rises, just over half said they would be requesting more money, and only 35% told the survey that they would be demanding 9% or more. Expectations of pay matching inflation seems to be low, with nearly half of those responding to the BBC saying their financial outlook would get worse in the second half of the year. We'll be joined at 13:00 BST by the BBCâs personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey to answer some of your questions about the cost of living crisis. Kevin has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected, click the 'Get Involved' button at the top of this page or email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Let's go back to the BBC's survey of how people across the UK are experiencing the rising cost of living. As we've previously mentioned, pollsters Savanta questioned 4,011 people at the beginning of this month. They were asked about aseries of paymentsannounced by the government aimed at taking the sting out of rising household costs. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said the support was insufficient. Just 24% of people who responded to the BBC thought the package of payments was enough to help people with the rising cost of living. When asked how long government support should last 64% of people said help should be available ""as long as necessary"". Our colleagues atRadio 5 Livehave been visiting the New Parks area of Leicester since the cost of living crisis began. Donna runs a food bank in the area and says ""more and more people"" are coming for help, but she and her partner are struggling to keep it open. ""We're having to cut down on our voluntary work in the community because we can't afford the petrol, we need it ourselves for the shopping,"" she says. ""I personally do 300 miles a week, so that's not feasible any more... I can't afford to help the community and it makes me feel really bad.""My family comes before anyone else and as much as I want to help somebody, it's coming to a time where I can't."" Shaun is a dad to three young boys. He says a lack of money is causing arguments in his house. ""[The kids] don't understand that once you've paid your bills, there's nothing extra to play with,"" he says.

This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK could host Eurovision 2023, organisers say","The UK's Sam Ryder was recently pictured in a pink Kalush Orchestra hat, in a nod to this year's Ukrainian winners The BBC is in talks with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the UK - not Ukraine. The show's organisers decided, after a ""full assessment and feasibility study"", that the event cannot be held in the winning country, Ukraine. This is due to the ongoing war following Russia's invasion. So, they turned to the UK, which came second. But Kyiv said it disagreed with the EBU's decision and would appeal. Traditionally, the winning country is asked to host the following year's contest. UK cities volunteer to host Eurovision 2023 Reacting to the EBU's decision, Ukrainian Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said Kyiv ""believes that it has grounds for conducting further talks on finding a solution that will satisfy all."" ""Hosting Eurovision 2023 in Ukraine is a powerful signal to all the world, which is supporting Ukraine now. We will be demanding to change the decision, because we believe that we will be able to fulfil all our obligations"". Meanwhile, Mykola Chernotytskyi, head of the managing board of Ukrainian broadcaster UA: PBC, said: ""Security is, of course, our first priority. The team of UA: PBC, state and local authorities did a thorough job and offered different options."" He added: ""It is a pity to see such an unappealable statement, therefore, we ask our partners to hold further negotiations."" Sam Ryder came second for the UK, the country's best result since 1998, at this year's event in May. Ryder topped the jury vote in Turin in May, but rap-folk band Kalush Orchestra, who were given special permission to leave the war-torn country to compete, soared to first place with 631 points in a symbolic show of public support. The UK hashosted Eurovision eight times,external- more than any other country. It has taken over hosting duties for other countries four times. It hosted for the Netherlands in 1960, for France in 1963, for Monaco in 1972; and Luxembourg in 1974. The UK last hosted in 1998, from Birmingham, after Katrina and the Waves' win. Harrogate, Brighton, Edinburgh and London have also been host cities. Israel was the last country that declined to host, in 1980, having also won the year before. The EBU saidin a statement,externalit had conducted the study with Ukrainian state broadcaster UA:PBC and external specialists, amid the conflict, but that the ""security and operational guarantees"" required to host the event cannot be fulfilled in the war-torn country. The organisation thanked the winning nation's broadcaster for its ""wholehearted cooperation and commitment in exploring all scenarios"" and said it shared in ""their sadness and disappointment"", adding it would continue to support them. ""As a result of this decision, in accordance with the rules and to ensure the continuity of the event, the EBU will now begin discussions with the BBC, as this year's runner-up, to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the United Kingdom,"" the statement read. ""It is our full intention that Ukraine's win will be reflected in next year's shows. This will be a priority for us in our discussions with the eventual hosts."" This video can not be played The UK won the jury vote before Ukraine stormed into the lead following huge public support A BBC spokesman added: ""We have seen the announcement from the EBU. Clearly these aren't a set of circumstances that anyone would want. Following their decision, we will of course discuss the BBC hosting the Eurovision Song Contest."" Katrina Leskanich, lead singer for the UK's winning 1997 Eurovision entry Katrina and the Waves with their song Love Shine A Light,tweeted,external: ""Practically hysterical over the announcement that the UK could host!"" Downing Street welcomed the possibility of the UK hosting Eurovision if Ukraine cannot, pledging to ensure it would ""overwhelmingly reflect Ukraine's rich culture, heritage and creativity"". Which UK cities could host 2023 contest? Eurovision win brings Ukraine 'incredible happiness' ""Ukraine's victory... was richly deserved and as the rightful winner the government's firm wish has been to see next year's contest hosted there,"" said a government spokesperson. ""If the EBU decides the competition can't go ahead in Ukraine, we would of course welcome the opportunity to work closely with Ukraine and the BBC to host it here in the UK."" They added the government was also committed to ""building on the ongoing partnership between our two countries"". Asked if the government would help the BBC with the costs, the spokesman said ""we're slightly getting ahead of ourselves in terms of the process"". Norway's Give That Wolf A Banana were an eye-catching act at this year's contest A number of locationshave put their hats in the ring if the UK does end up hosting the contest. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid she,externalwished Eurovision could be in Ukraine, but ""understand that in circumstances this isn't possible"". ""However, I can think of a perfect venue on banks of the River Clyde!"" she added, apparently suggesting the 14,300-capacity riverside OVO Hydro arena in Glasgow as a venue. Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester City Council, also threw the city's hat in the ring,saying,external: ""Not the circumstances that anyone would want given the war in Ukraine. But if it's to be a UK city - I can't think of anywhere better, a great music city and fittingly home to a large Ukrainian community."" Leeds had hoped to be European Capital of Culture in 2023, before Brexit prevented UK cities from entering that contest. The city is ploughing on with staging a year of culture anyway, and Leeds City Council said having Eurovision in the city ""could not come at a better time"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khantweeted,externalthat the UK capital ""would welcome Eurovision with open arms"", adding: ""We're ready to step up and support Ukraine by hosting a contest that pays tribute to and honours the Ukrainian people, and also celebrates the very best of Britain too."" Liverpool, Cardiff, Aberdeen, Brighton, Belfast and Birmingham have also all been suggested as possibilities. If the UK is confirmed as the host country, cities would have to prove they have the right facilities and go through a bidding process. Which UK cities could host Eurovision 2023?

Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor.

Concerts and large public gatherings have been called off in the Gironde department around Bordeaux. Yesterday, parts of France hit 40C earlier in the year than usual, with temperatures expected to peak tomorrow. Scientists say periods of intense heat are becoming more frequent and longer lasting as a result of global warming. In Gironde, officials said public events, including some of the official 18 June Resistance celebrations, will be prohibited from Friday at 14:00 (12:00 GMT) ""until the end of the heat wave"". Indoor events at venues without air conditioning are also banned. The weather has been kind for festival-goers on the Isle of Wight, with no wellies needed. Organisers havewarned people at the Isle of Wight Festival to stay safeduring the heat and recommended they take precautions - including avoiding excess alcohol consumption. As a result of the soaring temperatures suncream is the order of the day - and the only shelter being sought is to get out of the sun.

If the overnight temperature doesnât drop below 20C then thatâs defined as a tropical night and thereâs a chance of that somewhere in south-east England tonight.What is a tropical night? Harry LowBBC London News Itâs hotting up here at this lido as the sunbathers soak up the sunshine in south-east London. Since sunrise swimmers have been flocking to Charlton: all 1,000 slots sold out as people look for some respite from the high temperatures brought about by the arrival of the Spanish plume. Picnickers have set up camp beside this Olympic-sized swimming pool as the trees surrounding the pool gently sway in the breeze. A number of fair-weather swimmers have visited throughout the day, much to the chagrin of some regulars who are not used to sharing with crowds, especially during those long, cold winter months. If you're heading out to make the most of the summer sunshine today, spare a thought for some of our hairy-coated friends. As the temperature rises, it's not just us humans that need to keep cool. At the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon, the animals are being looked after with specially made ice lollies - the perfect way to cool down in the heat. The sanctuary's Simon Horn says: ""The ice
blocks are made from fruit and vegetables in water. ""They not only provide a
welcome treat during the sizzling temperatures, but they also provide a
valuable form of enrichment. ""Donkeys love exploring, and this activity allows
them to exhibit their natural foraging behaviours - a key factor in improving
donkey welfare."" It is officially the hottest day of the year in the UK for the third day in a row. Heathrow in west London recorded 32.4C (90F) this afternoon andtemperatures could climb furtherto 34C in parts of the South East. Today's record temperature surpassed the previous day's high of 29.5C (85.1F) recorded at Northolt in west London. The Met Office also predicts it could be the ""hottest Royal Ascot on record"" at the Berkshire racecourse. In Santon Downham, Suffolk, temperatures reached 31.1C, and Wisley, Surrey, recorded 30.4C. But the picture changes further north, with the Met Office pointing out a marked difference in temperatures, with Glasgow recording 13.7C just after midday. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter While parts of South East England will have another very warm to hot day on Saturday, elsewhere in England and Wales things will feel very different as temperatures drop significantly. For example, Leeds will fall from a high near 27C today to just 16C tomorrow. This photo of a tranquil spot in Leeds was taken a short while ago by BBC Weather Watcher Martin King. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Livestock cool off in a pond to beat the heat in Pakistan where temperatures reached 40C last month If youâre in
the southern half of the UK youâll certainly be feeling the heat - but spare a
thought for Spain and France, they are experiencing a punishing heatwave. This week
France saw temperatures hit 40C - the earliest in the year than ever before. Spain is
enduring its second heatwave this year and there are warnings it could reach
43C in the next couple of days. That did not used to happen until July or
August. It is this
type of intense heat that scientists warn will become more common as global
warming heats the planet. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the 19th century and temperatures continue to rise. The last seven years have been
the hottest years ever recorded and, if no action is taken to curb climate
change, scientists warn a rise of 4C is possible. In the US
now, more than 100 million people are being warned to stay indoors as scorching
temperatures settle over large parts of the country. India and
Pakistan suffered even more brutal heat last month with temperatures in
Pakistan reaching 50C while the Indian capital, New Delhi, hit 49.2C â
an all-time high. While periods
of hot weather have always occurred naturally, the increased intensity and
frequency of extreme heat now is a warning bell for the impacts ofclimate change. To place the current hot weather in context, we've drawn up a map of some peak temperatures hit around the UK - both in the month of June and overall. Some historical high points for thermometers include the hottest temperature recorded in June, when Southampton peaked at 35.6C in 1976. In more recent times, Cambridge experienced a sweltering 38.7C in July 2019, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

In the words of Billy Idol, it's hot in the city. In the words of The Clash, London's burning. In the words of Glen Frey, the heat is on. A high of 34C (93.2F) is expected in the capital on Friday. So are Londoners coping with the heatwave - or is it too hot to handle? Before the inevitable rainclouds return to empty over our optimistic barbecues - we take a look at some ""snaps-hots"" from around the city. Ladies take to the cooling waters at Parliament Hill Lido It's hot hot hot in Trafalgar Square They can't be British - neither appears to have brought a jacket ""just in case"" A hydrofoil rider takes off at Royal Docks in east London The new incarnation of Mary Poppins prepares to take off at London Fields Lido in Hackney Don't just carry it.

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council says it expects tens of thousands of visitors over the next few days to head to the seaside to enjoy the heat and sunshine. Beachgoers flocked to the resort town on the south coast of England when the first Covid-19 lockdown was eased in June 2020, which led to the councildeclaring a major incident. Since the incident, the council has developed a freebeach check appshowing people which areas are crowded, gives the location of public toilets and lifeguards, and says which areas dogs can use. Security cameras, a hub for emergency services and more rangers have also since been brought in. Read morehere. If the hot weather is becoming oppressive, there are some basic principles to help stop it becoming too much. During the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out and close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out. Open all the windows before you go to bed to get a through breeze. Using even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather as it encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. If you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. Alternatively, cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body, so try chilling your socks in the fridge before wearing. And of course, keep hydrated. A Level 3 heat-health alert has been issued for London, the east of England and the south-east to help protect health services, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says. The alert, called 'heatwave action', is to help protect the NHS and to inform its partners that they should prepare their services for possible increases in demand due to increases in temperatures, Agostinho Sousa of the UKHSA tells BBC Breakfast. âWe also have a Level 2 that is currently active in the South West and East of England that is to inform our partners that they should prepare their services in case they need to enter into action in case we see an increase in temperatures. âRight now the situation is stable, and we expect the temperatures to drop tomorrow.â Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals can cause muscle cramps and shock due to cold water temperatures, the fire service says People have been warnednot to swim in open water as temperatures soar. Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals could cause muscle cramps and shock as the water often remained cold even in heatwaves, says Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Fresh water could be polluted and cause serious illness, it said. People who fall into water by accident should lean back, extend their legs and arms, and use slow, gentle movements to stay afloat. Once you have controlled your breathing, attempt to swim to safety and call for help, the service adds. Anyone seeing a person or animal in trouble around water was asked to phone 999. If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's the latest on the extreme weather hitting parts of the UK and Europe: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37.5C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave. But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it. You can read more by James on the dangers of heat and what to do about themhere. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter At midday, the temperature at Heathrow Airport was 30.3C, which is the highest for England and the UK so far this year. Wales has also recorded its highest temperature so far - 26.7C at Cardiff Bute Park. This heatwave has been building across western Europe - last weekSpainsaw temperatures above 40C - and now that heat has started to move
northwards. Spain is used to heatwaves â just not this
early in the summer season and certainly not this hot. And with the high temperatures come the inevitable
wildfires. InItaly, the soaring
heat is leading to growing concerns about water shortages. As we reported earlier, large stretches of the countryâs largest river, the Po, the
water is so low that locals can walk through the middle of the expanse of sand -
and wartime shipwrecks are even resurfacing. Across thePyrenees, straddling the border
of France and Spain, outdoor public events are being banned from tomorrow until
the end of the heatwave. Teachers in the region are watering
playgrounds in order to prevent pupils getting heatstroke in the extreme heat. Portugalsaw its hottest May since 1931, and yesterdayFrance recorded a temperature of over 40C - the earliest hot spell ever to hit the country. And French officials say the peak of the heatwave is yet to be reached. The hot zone is expected to move intocentral Europe, ItalytheAlpine countriesand the south ofGermany. The peak of the heatwave in theUKarrives today acrossEnglandandWales, with temperatures set to reach 33C. But inScotlandandNorthern Ireland, temperatures are expected to peak at a more comfortable 23C Across the whole of the UK, cooler and fresher conditions are expected over the weekend Scientists warn that as global temperatures rise over time heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent, more intense and longer lasting - and their impact more widespread.

Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"People cut back on food and fuel as prices riseMore than eight in 10 people say they are worried about the cost-of-living, a BBC survey suggests.Business","People struggling with the soaring cost of living are cutting back on food and car journeys to save money, according to a BBC-commissioned survey. More than half (56%) the 4,011 people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. The findings reveal the widespread impact of prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. Many people have cut spending on clothes and socialising. Some say their mental health has been affected. Two-thirds of those surveyed also suggested government support provided so far was insufficient. The BBC-commissioned survey of 4,011 UK adults in early June lifts a lid on how the economic climate is affecting lives and financial, physical and mental health. The cost of domestic energy, petrol, and food have all increased significantly in recent months, and the findings suggest more than eight in 10 people (81%) are worried about the rising cost of living. 'We can't just go in there and buy what we like now' Why are prices rising so quickly? Five things that are going up in price and why Why chicken is getting more and more expensive Concern has grown since the start of the year when 69% of those asked said they were worried in a similar BBC survey. In the latest results, two thirds (66%) of those with worries said this was having a negative effect on their mental health. Nearly half (45%) said their physical health had been affected. Day-to-day, individuals are making further changes to manage their budgets. The survey suggests this can be as simple as going on fewer nights out, or getting a haircut less often. For charity worker Janine Colwill, from Easington, and those she talks to, the changes have been more fundamental. ""We get together with the family every Sunday, religiously, for Sunday roast - but my family and other families are starting to grow their own vegetables,"" she said. Janine Colwill says people in her area are constantly looking for ways to save money ""Those people who may not have worried about these things before are now worrying about them constantly. ""With advances in technology, I never would have thought that people would be relying on a food bank or growing their own - and just penny-pinching,"" she said. The survey suggests people are finding various ways to manage and save their money. The findings include: Some 82% of those asked had switched off lights in the previous week to save money Trips taken in the car had been limited to varying degrees in the previous six months by 72% of those asked A large majority (84%) said they had spent less on their clothes at some point in the previous six months About half (52%) expect to work more hours in the next six months to help to pay the bills. Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, said in a trading update for the three months to 28 May that it was seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to inflation, such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. Chief executive Ken Murphy also said people are switching to cheaper own-label brands for goods including bread and pastawhich have seen prices soardue to the war between Ukraine and Russia, both of which are major wheat exporters. Prices, as measured by inflation, are rising at a rate of 9% a year, the fastest for 40 years. Interest rates, which also affect the cost of living,were increased to 1.25%on Thursday by the Bank of England - the highest they have been for 13 years. The situation is being driven, to a significant degree, by global factors such as the cost of oil, gas and food. But there are UK-specific issues which are adding to inflation such as the tight labour market. Job vacancies are at a record high of 1.3 million meaning employers face paying higher wages to fill roles. Also, the UK's dominant services sector - which includes the likes of accountancy and law firms, as well as restaurants and pubs - is seeing price rises. Drivers now have to spendÂ£103 for petrol and Â£106 for diesel to fill a family car, according to the RAC. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) has predicted food priceswill rise at a rate of 15%this summer as households pay more for staples such as bread, meat, dairy and fruit and vegetables. A typical household in England, Wales and Scotland is likely to see a rise in its annual domestic gas and electricity bill of Â£800 in October, on top of a Â£700 rise in April. The surge in inflation is hitting wide and hitting deep, with the effects leading to significant changes in the way lives are being lived well beyond those on low incomes. Large swathes of Britain's middle income working households are having to make material cutbacks and even after that are part of a new class of those ""just about managing"". In practice this has meant energy bill direct debits wiping out people's entire disposable income, some food banks running out of food donations, or their donors becoming users. And it may be changing attitudes, with nearly two-thirds of those asked saying even after the recent package of support for energy bills from the government, that it is not enough. And the numbers suggest a similar proportion think the support in place needs to last at least a year longer. Inflation this high certainly changes the economy and our spending behaviour. But the figures raise a question about whether the high levels of government support in the pandemic and in this energy crisis too, are now becoming baked into public expectations. Soaring prices have led the government to announcea package of financial supportdirected primarily at those on low incomes. This includes a Â£400 discount on all energy bills in October, in addition to payments totalling Â£650 to people on means-tested benefits. Pensioners will get more this winter, as will billpayers with disabilities. However, the BBC survey reveals that 64% of those asked said this support was insufficient to help people with the rising cost of living. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said vulnerable households would receive Â£1,200 which he said was part of a ""very large"" amount of support, on top of what had already been provided. He said the first payments would come in July, and would continue into the autumn to offset the key driver of the rising cost of living for households, which was energy bills. ""That, of course, is yet to filter through to people, which is why I suspect people are saying they want more support,"" he told the BBC. ""As this gathers pace, it will be clear to people that this will be a comprehensive package."" The impact of rising household costs has already led to the financial regulator warning lenders that they need to do more to help those in financial difficulty and support vulnerable customers. ""Early action is important for those struggling with debt,"" said Sheldon Mills, of the Financial Conduct Authority.

LiveLiveWhat can I do about cost of living? Your questions answered10 minutes ago,"Inflation in the UK is expected to top 11% this year as energy, food and fuel prices soar We've been finding out how people are coping with rising prices, and our personal finance correspondent has been answering your questions The BBC's Kevin Peachey has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade The rising cost of living is being blamed on economies rebounding after the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and pressures on supply chains The AA says petrol prices in the UK his a new record yesterday, with a litre of unleaded reaching 187.51p A BBC survey of 4,011 people suggests 8 in 10 people are worried about the cost of living, and more than half said they had skipped meals to save money Two-thirds of those surveyed suggested government support provided so far was insufficient Jen Meierhans, Andrew Humphrey and Rob Corp That's all for our Q&A on the cost of living for today. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions and shared how rising prices have been affecting your lives. Thanks also, of course, to our personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey, for providing plenty of really useful of answers. We're going to wrap up this live coverage shortly but you canread more about the rising cost of living, and what support you can get here. We're nearly at the end of today's live coverage on the cost of living. Here's a recap on what we know:  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Christine asks if her mother, who is 93 and receives a state pension, Pension Credit and Attendance Allowance, will get any payments to help pay for her care home costs? First things first, not everyone is as organised as Christine and her mum. An estimated 850,000 pensioner households fail to claim pension credit â which tops up the income of those who donât have much money coming in, and is a gateway to other payments. Moving into a care home can affect your benefit entitlement. In this case, the receipt of Pension Credit should mean an entitlement to the Â£650 cost of living payment for those on means-tested benefits. People on Attendance Allowance should also qualify for an extra Â£150 paid to people with disabilities in September. We have aguideon how this works. These payments are designed to help with energy bills but, in practice, can be spent as you wish. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Sketchley is a pensioner living in Spain and wants to know if UK citizens who have retired abroad will receive the Â£300 payment to pensioners? The Â£300 referred to here by Simon is a top-up to the Winter Fuel Payment paid in November or December to pensioner households. People living in Spain are not eligible for either â because of the higher winter temperatures. The same is true for those living in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta and Portugal. Those living in other parts of Europe may be entitled to it though. Thegovernment website,externaloutlines eligibility. Fuengirola beach in the Costa del Sol Matthew Homes worked for a financial services company before being made redundant at the beginning of June and says he feels his family have been overlooked by the government. The 22-year-old and his wife, who came to the UK from Ukraine last summer, have a six-month-old baby and say they have been struggling financially since her birth. ""Weâre seeing our budget squeezed day-to-day. With the baby we have seen how the formula and purees have gone up and baby wipes and nappies have gone up. I used to get them on Amazon but now itâs like a treasure hunt for cheaper options. ""Weâre not in a position to pay for our daughter to go to nursery and we donât get help with that."" Matthew says they fall into a ""certain group of people who havenât been considered"" and believes that government help in general came too late. ""Weâre cut out from accessing any financial support from our governmentâ¦ itâs for people on some kind of benefits but that doesnât include us. ""My daughter hasnât been able to see her grandparents because we canât afford to go."" Jeff Cottrell asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Jeff, it appears, is one of many people who pay their energy bill to a landlord or park owner, rather than directly to an energy supplier. It is fair to say that some of these details are yet to be fully ironed out, ahead of the discount paid from October. In fact, they are part of a government consultation. Concerns have been raised, for example, that some landlords may not pass on the full discount to private renters. In time, organisations such as Citizens Advice could offer help and advice, once the policy is finalised. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Peter Scouse, 68, from London, says with things like milk increasing from Â£1 to Â£1.35, petrol from Â£1.20 to Â£1.90 and gas up by more than 50%, his personal rate of inflation is about 30% not the 9% quoted in the news. Peter raises an important point, which is that there is an official rate of inflation â calculated by the Office for National Statistics, based on a typical âbasketâ of goods and services. There is also an individualâs own personal inflation rate. For example, if you drive a lot, or spend much of your time in a poorly insulated home, then you may well have been hit harder than others by recent price rises. There is an expectation for pensioners like Peter that, owing to the way the uprating of benefits is calculated, the state pension looks set for a double-digit increase next April â although that probably still feels a long way away. Paul and Amanda both work so haven't had to watch what they're spending before. ""Now we're doing it on a daily basis,"" says Paul. They do still get takeaways and go out for meals, but not as often and now they order a jug of tap water to keep the bill down. At the supermarket, instead of buying branded products like they used to, they are looking at own-brand items, and are looking for deals. ""We have to look at: What do we really want? What do we really need? Do we really need that luxury? Do we really need those sweets?"" Find out three of the main ways people are changing their spending habitshere. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Michelle Massetti is worried about her son who is a university student. His maintenance loan doesnât cover his Â£6000 a year rent. The rising cost of living is affecting all sorts of people across all walks of life. Students are no strangers to new debt, and â of course â they are seeing rising prices too when it comes to eating and heating. If they are in a student house, they should expect to see their gas and electricity bill rise this winter. However, the government is taking some of the sting out of that increase with a Â£400 discount on everyoneâs domestic energy bill from October. One striking finding in our survey is that 83% of young adults asked, who said they were worried about the rising cost of living, said it was having an impact on their mental health. Haizea Cacho asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent As Haizea is all too aware, maternity leave can mean a drop in your income, just as you face a host of new baby-related expenses. There is support at any time for those who are pregnant or who have just had a baby. For example, you can get free dental care across the UK. There are a host of other benefits and grants that may be claimed for those on low incomes. They can vary in different parts of the UK. This guide,externalfrom the independent MoneyHelper website should help. As well as sending in questions for Kevin, BBC News readers have been getting in touch with their experiences of the rising cost of living. Fiona Stevenson, from Lingdale, worked as a teacher for 27 years until leaving last October due to ill health. Sheâs set to claim her occupational pension in December and relies on her husbandâs part-time job as a school technician. Fiona is also able to make some money through her hobby of crafting. They are owner-occupiers of their home but are finding it hard to make ends meet. ""Not only are costs of all goods and food rising rapidly but fuel costs are now out of control and plans for summer camping trips have had to be cancelled due to the cost of diesel,"" she says. ""We do not even have our lights on in the evening and are dreading the winter months,"" she says. ""The government must step in and reduce the costs for the people they represent. Cut VAT on fuel, increase benefits and provide windfall payments to businesses and households."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent David Wellbelove asks why, when you buy a loaf of bread in a supermarket anywhere in the UK the price is roughly the same, is fuel different? Actually, prices for many goods and services do differ by location - it is just that the huge signs on petrol forecourts make it more obvious. It is less well known, for example, that your domestic energy bill will vary depending on where you live in the country. On vehicle fuel specifically, local prices are influenced by location and competition. If the petrol station is close to storage and convenient for deliveries, then the price will tend to be lower. Drivers also generally pay less in areas where local supermarkets are competing on price. But, as itnow costs more than Â£100 to fill the tank of a family car, it is no surprise our survey suggests people have decided to take fewer journeys to save money. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Rhonda Cowland asks what to do if you were unaware you might be entitled to the cost of living payment. The good news for you Rhonda is that much of this support is automatically paid to those who are eligible, without the need to claim. Without exactly knowing your situation, it is hard to answer your question directly. However, there is one deadline to be aware of, particularly if you are newly-unemployed. Only those who are entitled to and received their first Universal Credit payment by 25 May will be eligible for the first Â£326 instalment of support for those on means-tested benefits. The second will be paid later in the year. Amanda Leeds asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent There are different payments for different groups of people - and so eligibility does vary. However, it is important to say that they will pretty much all be made automatically. That assumes people have claimed the benefits to which they are entitled, because without claiming those, you could miss out on the extra payments. For example, those on means-tested benefits will receive their first cost of living payment automatically into their bank, building society or credit union account by the end of July. We have aguideand there is also sometechnical guidance,externalfrom the Treasury. It's time now for our personal finance correspondent to join us and answer some of your questions about rising prices and what help is available. We'll be putting your questions to the BBCâs Kevin Peachey. He has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected there's a form at the bottom ofthis story. Sabrina Omar, 20, has emailed us to say she thinks the government should do more to help students struggling with the cost of living crisis. The second year diagnostic radiography student at the University of Hertfordshire says living away from home makes things difficult. ""Just with the
basic stuff like food and bills the costs are going up and up and we donât get
any extra student loan or extra help from anywhere else,"" she says. Her fuel reimbursement for travelling to her placement is 28p a mile and with thecost of filling the average tankmore than Â£100 it's ""not making much of a difference"", she says. âAnything that the government can do to help... I
would offer the same support that they are offering other households or just
some sort of support specifically for students. ""Even with a part-time job Iâm struggling because thereâs only
so many hours I can do,"" she says. ""I have been thinking
about the possibility of commuting in next year just to find the cheapest way possible to complete my
course, itâs really made me evaluate everything.â Back to theBBC's cost of living survey, and perhaps unsurprisingly more than 80% of working adults said they thought their wages should match the increase in inflation. Though when it came to asking directly for pay rises, just over half said they would be requesting more money, and only 35% told the survey that they would be demanding 9% or more. Expectations of pay matching inflation seems to be low, with nearly half of those responding to the BBC saying their financial outlook would get worse in the second half of the year. We'll be joined at 13:00 BST by the BBCâs personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey to answer some of your questions about the cost of living crisis. Kevin has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade.

Let's go back to the BBC's survey of how people across the UK are experiencing the rising cost of living. As we've previously mentioned, pollsters Savanta questioned 4,011 people at the beginning of this month. They were asked about aseries of paymentsannounced by the government aimed at taking the sting out of rising household costs. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said the support was insufficient. Just 24% of people who responded to the BBC thought the package of payments was enough to help people with the rising cost of living.

""I personally do 300 miles a week, so that's not feasible any more...

"Sight loss warning over missed diabetes eye testsThe RNIB warns that attendance rates at eye test clinics are ""alarmingly low"".Northern IrelandAssange can be extradited, says UK home secretaryWikileaks founder Julian Assangeâs extradition to the US is approved by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel.UK","Regular eye testing is important for diabetics Diabetes patients have been warned that non-attendance at eye-test appointments puts them at greater risk of developing unnecessary sight loss. The Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) has described the attendance rates at clinics in Northern Ireland as ""alarmingly low"" . It said 20% to 40% of patients were not showing up for their appointments on any given day. On Saturday afternoons that figure can be even higher. Prof Tunde Peto, clinical lead for the NI Diabetic Eye Screening Programme, said the most common of many complications caused by diabetes was diabetic eye disease. Diabetes can cause cataracts early on but it can also affect the retina at the back of the eye, ""which will eventually lead to sight loss if not treated on time,"" Prof Peto explained. ""Diabetic retinopathy causes no symptoms until it can be just about too late to treat,"" she said. The good news is that, if the disease is caught early enough through screening, treatments are available. Prof Tunde Peto says the diabetic eye disease doesn't show symptoms until it has already developed Ian Catlin from Ballymoney has experienced sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy. He has had Type 1 diabetes since childhood and became aware of problems with his eyesight in his mid-30s. ""Probably when I was about 33, I started having problems and it's been slowly getting worse,"" he said. ""I'm totally blind in the left eye and I'm losing the vision in right eye slowly."" Mr Catlin explained that the blood vessels at the back of his eye burst due to the high level of blood sugars. ""I'm a joiner by trade and I can't do that anymore,"" the County Antrim man said, adding that he's lucky to have his wife and children to help him cope. Ian Catlin says some people don't attend eye clinics because of fear of the unknown Mr Catlin said he put off asking for medical help because of the fear of what he would be told. ""I did eventually go, but you're scared and you put your head in the sand,"" he said. Diabetes patients are sent a number of reminders of their appointments, including letters and day-before texts, Prof Peto explained. She said appointment slots that could have been used by another patient are lost if someone doesn't turn up. There are about 115,000 people with diabetes in Northern Ireland and that figure is increasing by 5% to 7% annually. The eye screening programme has put on evening and weekend clinics to help deal with the numbers. ""People usually prioritise things that give them symptoms and because eye disease doesn't give symptoms until it's really late, sometimes people don't appreciate that they should be coming,"" said Prof Peto. ""If you absolutely cannot come then please cancel on time so we can give the appointment to someone else,"" she added. Mr Catlin advised people who receive appointments to overcome their fears. ""Go. You need to go and you need to find if there are any abnormalities,"" he said. ""You can catch it and you can stop any severe problems happening.""

LiveLiveWhat can I do about cost of living? Your questions answered2 minutes ago,"Inflation in the UK is expected to top 11% this year as energy, food and fuel prices soar We've been finding out how people are coping with rising prices, and our personal finance correspondent has been answering your questions The BBC's Kevin Peachey has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade The rising cost of living is being blamed on economies rebounding after the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and pressures on supply chains The AA says petrol prices in the UK his a new record yesterday, with a litre of unleaded reaching 187.51p A BBC survey of 4,011 people suggests 8 in 10 people are worried about the cost of living, and more than half said they had skipped meals to save money Two-thirds of those surveyed suggested government support provided so far was insufficient Jen Meierhans, Andrew Humphrey and Rob Corp That's all for our Q&A on the cost of living for today. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions and shared how rising prices have been affecting your lives. Thanks also, of course, to our personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey, for providing plenty of really useful of answers. We're going to wrap up this live coverage shortly but you canread more about the rising cost of living, and what support you can get here. We're nearly at the end of today's live coverage on the cost of living. Here's a recap on what we know:  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Christine asks if her mother, who is 93 and receives a state pension, Pension Credit and Attendance Allowance, will get any payments to help pay for her care home costs? First things first, not everyone is as organised as Christine and her mum. An estimated 850,000 pensioner households fail to claim pension credit â which tops up the income of those who donât have much money coming in, and is a gateway to other payments. Moving into a care home can affect your benefit entitlement. In this case, the receipt of Pension Credit should mean an entitlement to the Â£650 cost of living payment for those on means-tested benefits. People on Attendance Allowance should also qualify for an extra Â£150 paid to people with disabilities in September. We have aguideon how this works. These payments are designed to help with energy bills but, in practice, can be spent as you wish. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Sketchley is a pensioner living in Spain and wants to know if UK citizens who have retired abroad will receive the Â£300 payment to pensioners? The Â£300 referred to here by Simon is a top-up to the Winter Fuel Payment paid in November or December to pensioner households. People living in Spain are not eligible for either â because of the higher winter temperatures. The same is true for those living in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta and Portugal. Those living in other parts of Europe may be entitled to it though. Thegovernment website,externaloutlines eligibility. Fuengirola beach in the Costa del Sol Matthew Homes worked for a financial services company before being made redundant at the beginning of June and says he feels his family have been overlooked by the government. The 22-year-old and his wife, who came to the UK from Ukraine last summer, have a six-month-old baby and say they have been struggling financially since her birth. ""Weâre seeing our budget squeezed day-to-day. With the baby we have seen how the formula and purees have gone up and baby wipes and nappies have gone up. I used to get them on Amazon but now itâs like a treasure hunt for cheaper options. ""Weâre not in a position to pay for our daughter to go to nursery and we donât get help with that."" Matthew says they fall into a ""certain group of people who havenât been considered"" and believes that government help in general came too late. ""Weâre cut out from accessing any financial support from our governmentâ¦ itâs for people on some kind of benefits but that doesnât include us. ""My daughter hasnât been able to see her grandparents because we canât afford to go."" Jeff Cottrell asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Jeff, it appears, is one of many people who pay their energy bill to a landlord or park owner, rather than directly to an energy supplier. It is fair to say that some of these details are yet to be fully ironed out, ahead of the discount paid from October. In fact, they are part of a government consultation. Concerns have been raised, for example, that some landlords may not pass on the full discount to private renters. In time, organisations such as Citizens Advice could offer help and advice, once the policy is finalised. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Peter Scouse, 68, from London, says with things like milk increasing from Â£1 to Â£1.35, petrol from Â£1.20 to Â£1.90 and gas up by more than 50%, his personal rate of inflation is about 30% not the 9% quoted in the news. Peter raises an important point, which is that there is an official rate of inflation â calculated by the Office for National Statistics, based on a typical âbasketâ of goods and services. There is also an individualâs own personal inflation rate. For example, if you drive a lot, or spend much of your time in a poorly insulated home, then you may well have been hit harder than others by recent price rises. There is an expectation for pensioners like Peter that, owing to the way the uprating of benefits is calculated, the state pension looks set for a double-digit increase next April â although that probably still feels a long way away. Paul and Amanda both work so haven't had to watch what they're spending before. ""Now we're doing it on a daily basis,"" says Paul. They do still get takeaways and go out for meals, but not as often and now they order a jug of tap water to keep the bill down. At the supermarket, instead of buying branded products like they used to, they are looking at own-brand items, and are looking for deals. ""We have to look at: What do we really want? What do we really need? Do we really need that luxury? Do we really need those sweets?"" Find out three of the main ways people are changing their spending habitshere. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Michelle Massetti is worried about her son who is a university student. His maintenance loan doesnât cover his Â£6000 a year rent. The rising cost of living is affecting all sorts of people across all walks of life. Students are no strangers to new debt, and â of course â they are seeing rising prices too when it comes to eating and heating. If they are in a student house, they should expect to see their gas and electricity bill rise this winter. However, the government is taking some of the sting out of that increase with a Â£400 discount on everyoneâs domestic energy bill from October. One striking finding in our survey is that 83% of young adults asked, who said they were worried about the rising cost of living, said it was having an impact on their mental health. Haizea Cacho asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent As Haizea is all too aware, maternity leave can mean a drop in your income, just as you face a host of new baby-related expenses. There is support at any time for those who are pregnant or who have just had a baby. For example, you can get free dental care across the UK. There are a host of other benefits and grants that may be claimed for those on low incomes. They can vary in different parts of the UK. This guide,externalfrom the independent MoneyHelper website should help. As well as sending in questions for Kevin, BBC News readers have been getting in touch with their experiences of the rising cost of living. Fiona Stevenson, from Lingdale, worked as a teacher for 27 years until leaving last October due to ill health. Sheâs set to claim her occupational pension in December and relies on her husbandâs part-time job as a school technician. Fiona is also able to make some money through her hobby of crafting. They are owner-occupiers of their home but are finding it hard to make ends meet. ""Not only are costs of all goods and food rising rapidly but fuel costs are now out of control and plans for summer camping trips have had to be cancelled due to the cost of diesel,"" she says. ""We do not even have our lights on in the evening and are dreading the winter months,"" she says. ""The government must step in and reduce the costs for the people they represent. Cut VAT on fuel, increase benefits and provide windfall payments to businesses and households."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent David Wellbelove asks why, when you buy a loaf of bread in a supermarket anywhere in the UK the price is roughly the same, is fuel different? Actually, prices for many goods and services do differ by location - it is just that the huge signs on petrol forecourts make it more obvious. It is less well known, for example, that your domestic energy bill will vary depending on where you live in the country. On vehicle fuel specifically, local prices are influenced by location and competition. If the petrol station is close to storage and convenient for deliveries, then the price will tend to be lower. Drivers also generally pay less in areas where local supermarkets are competing on price. But, as itnow costs more than Â£100 to fill the tank of a family car, it is no surprise our survey suggests people have decided to take fewer journeys to save money. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Rhonda Cowland asks what to do if you were unaware you might be entitled to the cost of living payment. The good news for you Rhonda is that much of this support is automatically paid to those who are eligible, without the need to claim. Without exactly knowing your situation, it is hard to answer your question directly. However, there is one deadline to be aware of, particularly if you are newly-unemployed. Only those who are entitled to and received their first Universal Credit payment by 25 May will be eligible for the first Â£326 instalment of support for those on means-tested benefits. The second will be paid later in the year. Amanda Leeds asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent There are different payments for different groups of people - and so eligibility does vary. However, it is important to say that they will pretty much all be made automatically. That assumes people have claimed the benefits to which they are entitled, because without claiming those, you could miss out on the extra payments. For example, those on means-tested benefits will receive their first cost of living payment automatically into their bank, building society or credit union account by the end of July. We have aguideand there is also sometechnical guidance,externalfrom the Treasury. It's time now for our personal finance correspondent to join us and answer some of your questions about rising prices and what help is available. We'll be putting your questions to the BBCâs Kevin Peachey. He has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected there's a form at the bottom ofthis story. Sabrina Omar, 20, has emailed us to say she thinks the government should do more to help students struggling with the cost of living crisis. The second year diagnostic radiography student at the University of Hertfordshire says living away from home makes things difficult. ""Just with the
basic stuff like food and bills the costs are going up and up and we donât get
any extra student loan or extra help from anywhere else,"" she says. Her fuel reimbursement for travelling to her placement is 28p a mile and with thecost of filling the average tankmore than Â£100 it's ""not making much of a difference"", she says. âAnything that the government can do to help... I
would offer the same support that they are offering other households or just
some sort of support specifically for students. ""Even with a part-time job Iâm struggling because thereâs only
so many hours I can do,"" she says. ""I have been thinking
about the possibility of commuting in next year just to find the cheapest way possible to complete my
course, itâs really made me evaluate everything.â Back to theBBC's cost of living survey, and perhaps unsurprisingly more than 80% of working adults said they thought their wages should match the increase in inflation. Though when it came to asking directly for pay rises, just over half said they would be requesting more money, and only 35% told the survey that they would be demanding 9% or more. Expectations of pay matching inflation seems to be low, with nearly half of those responding to the BBC saying their financial outlook would get worse in the second half of the year. We'll be joined at 13:00 BST by the BBCâs personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey to answer some of your questions about the cost of living crisis. Kevin has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected, click the 'Get Involved' button at the top of this page or email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Let's go back to the BBC's survey of how people across the UK are experiencing the rising cost of living. As we've previously mentioned, pollsters Savanta questioned 4,011 people at the beginning of this month. They were asked about aseries of paymentsannounced by the government aimed at taking the sting out of rising household costs. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said the support was insufficient. Just 24% of people who responded to the BBC thought the package of payments was enough to help people with the rising cost of living. When asked how long government support should last 64% of people said help should be available ""as long as necessary"". Our colleagues atRadio 5 Livehave been visiting the New Parks area of Leicester since the cost of living crisis began. Donna runs a food bank in the area and says ""more and more people"" are coming for help, but she and her partner are struggling to keep it open. ""We're having to cut down on our voluntary work in the community because we can't afford the petrol, we need it ourselves for the shopping,"" she says. ""I personally do 300 miles a week, so that's not feasible any more... I can't afford to help the community and it makes me feel really bad.""My family comes before anyone else and as much as I want to help somebody, it's coming to a time where I can't."" Shaun is a dad to three young boys. He says a lack of money is causing arguments in his house. ""[The kids] don't understand that once you've paid your bills, there's nothing extra to play with,"" he says. ""We as a family go out probably once a month because that's all we can do... they don't understand it and it's hard, but once they're older I suppose they'll understand."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK could host Eurovision 2023, organisers sayOfficials are in talks with BBC after concluding contest cannot be held in winning country Ukraine.","The UK's Sam Ryder was recently pictured in a pink Kalush Orchestra hat, in a nod to this year's Ukrainian winners The BBC is in talks with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the UK - not Ukraine. The show's organisers decided, after a ""full assessment and feasibility study"", that the event cannot be held in the winning country, Ukraine. This is due to the ongoing war following Russia's invasion. So, they turned to the UK, which came second. But Kyiv said it disagreed with the EBU's decision and would appeal. Traditionally, the winning country is asked to host the following year's contest. UK cities volunteer to host Eurovision 2023 Reacting to the EBU's decision, Ukrainian Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said Kyiv ""believes that it has grounds for conducting further talks on finding a solution that will satisfy all."" ""Hosting Eurovision 2023 in Ukraine is a powerful signal to all the world, which is supporting Ukraine now. We will be demanding to change the decision, because we believe that we will be able to fulfil all our obligations"". Meanwhile, Mykola Chernotytskyi, head of the managing board of Ukrainian broadcaster UA: PBC, said: ""Security is, of course, our first priority. The team of UA: PBC, state and local authorities did a thorough job and offered different options."" He added: ""It is a pity to see such an unappealable statement, therefore, we ask our partners to hold further negotiations."" Sam Ryder came second for the UK, the country's best result since 1998, at this year's event in May. Ryder topped the jury vote in Turin in May, but rap-folk band Kalush Orchestra, who were given special permission to leave the war-torn country to compete, soared to first place with 631 points in a symbolic show of public support. The UK hashosted Eurovision eight times,external- more than any other country. It has taken over hosting duties for other countries four times. It hosted for the Netherlands in 1960, for France in 1963, for Monaco in 1972; and Luxembourg in 1974. The UK last hosted in 1998, from Birmingham, after Katrina and the Waves' win. Harrogate, Brighton, Edinburgh and London have also been host cities. Israel was the last country that declined to host, in 1980, having also won the year before. The EBU saidin a statement,externalit had conducted the study with Ukrainian state broadcaster UA:PBC and external specialists, amid the conflict, but that the ""security and operational guarantees"" required to host the event cannot be fulfilled in the war-torn country. The organisation thanked the winning nation's broadcaster for its ""wholehearted cooperation and commitment in exploring all scenarios"" and said it shared in ""their sadness and disappointment"", adding it would continue to support them. ""As a result of this decision, in accordance with the rules and to ensure the continuity of the event, the EBU will now begin discussions with the BBC, as this year's runner-up, to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the United Kingdom,"" the statement read. ""It is our full intention that Ukraine's win will be reflected in next year's shows. This will be a priority for us in our discussions with the eventual hosts."" This video can not be played The UK won the jury vote before Ukraine stormed into the lead following huge public support A BBC spokesman added: ""We have seen the announcement from the EBU. Clearly these aren't a set of circumstances that anyone would want. Following their decision, we will of course discuss the BBC hosting the Eurovision Song Contest."" Katrina Leskanich, lead singer for the UK's winning 1997 Eurovision entry Katrina and the Waves with their song Love Shine A Light,tweeted,external: ""Practically hysterical over the announcement that the UK could host!"" Downing Street welcomed the possibility of the UK hosting Eurovision if Ukraine cannot, pledging to ensure it would ""overwhelmingly reflect Ukraine's rich culture, heritage and creativity"". Which UK cities could host 2023 contest? Eurovision win brings Ukraine 'incredible happiness' ""Ukraine's victory... was richly deserved and as the rightful winner the government's firm wish has been to see next year's contest hosted there,"" said a government spokesperson. ""If the EBU decides the competition can't go ahead in Ukraine, we would of course welcome the opportunity to work closely with Ukraine and the BBC to host it here in the UK."" They added the government was also committed to ""building on the ongoing partnership between our two countries"". Asked if the government would help the BBC with the costs, the spokesman said ""we're slightly getting ahead of ourselves in terms of the process"". Norway's Give That Wolf A Banana were an eye-catching act at this year's contest A number of locationshave put their hats in the ring if the UK does end up hosting the contest. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid she,externalwished Eurovision could be in Ukraine, but ""understand that in circumstances this isn't possible"". ""However, I can think of a perfect venue on banks of the River Clyde!"" she added, apparently suggesting the 14,300-capacity riverside OVO Hydro arena in Glasgow as a venue. Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester City Council, also threw the city's hat in the ring,saying,external: ""Not the circumstances that anyone would want given the war in Ukraine. But if it's to be a UK city - I can't think of anywhere better, a great music city and fittingly home to a large Ukrainian community."" Leeds had hoped to be European Capital of Culture in 2023, before Brexit prevented UK cities from entering that contest. The city is ploughing on with staging a year of culture anyway, and Leeds City Council said having Eurovision in the city ""could not come at a better time"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khantweeted,externalthat the UK capital ""would welcome Eurovision with open arms"", adding: ""We're ready to step up and support Ukraine by hosting a contest that pays tribute to and honours the Ukrainian people, and also celebrates the very best of Britain too."" Liverpool, Cardiff, Aberdeen, Brighton, Belfast and Birmingham have also all been suggested as possibilities. If the UK is confirmed as the host country, cities would have to prove they have the right facilities and go through a bidding process. Which UK cities could host Eurovision 2023?

Thanks to everyone who sent in questions and shared how rising prices have been affecting your lives. Thanks also, of course, to our personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey, for providing plenty of really useful of answers. We're going to wrap up this live coverage shortly but you canread more about the rising cost of living, and what support you can get here. We're nearly at the end of today's live coverage on the cost of living. Here's a recap on what we know:  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Christine asks if her mother, who is 93 and receives a state pension, Pension Credit and Attendance Allowance, will get any payments to help pay for her care home costs? First things first, not everyone is as organised as Christine and her mum. An estimated 850,000 pensioner households fail to claim pension credit â which tops up the income of those who donât have much money coming in, and is a gateway to other payments. Moving into a care home can affect your benefit entitlement. In this case, the receipt of Pension Credit should mean an entitlement to the Â£650 cost of living payment for those on means-tested benefits. People on Attendance Allowance should also qualify for an extra Â£150 paid to people with disabilities in September. We have aguideon how this works. These payments are designed to help with energy bills but, in practice, can be spent as you wish. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Sketchley is a pensioner living in Spain and wants to know if UK citizens who have retired abroad will receive the Â£300 payment to pensioners? The Â£300 referred to here by Simon is a top-up to the Winter Fuel Payment paid in November or December to pensioner households. People living in Spain are not eligible for either â because of the higher winter temperatures. The same is true for those living in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta and Portugal. Those living in other parts of Europe may be entitled to it though. Thegovernment website,externaloutlines eligibility. Fuengirola beach in the Costa del Sol Matthew Homes worked for a financial services company before being made redundant at the beginning of June and says he feels his family have been overlooked by the government. The 22-year-old and his wife, who came to the UK from Ukraine last summer, have a six-month-old baby and say they have been struggling financially since her birth. ""Weâre seeing our budget squeezed day-to-day. With the baby we have seen how the formula and purees have gone up and baby wipes and nappies have gone up. I used to get them on Amazon but now itâs like a treasure hunt for cheaper options. ""Weâre not in a position to pay for our daughter to go to nursery and we donât get help with that."" Matthew says they fall into a ""certain group of people who havenât been considered"" and believes that government help in general came too late. ""Weâre cut out from accessing any financial support from our governmentâ¦ itâs for people on some kind of benefits but that doesnât include us. ""My daughter hasnât been able to see her grandparents because we canât afford to go."" Jeff Cottrell asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Jeff, it appears, is one of many people who pay their energy bill to a landlord or park owner, rather than directly to an energy supplier. It is fair to say that some of these details are yet to be fully ironed out, ahead of the discount paid from October. In fact, they are part of a government consultation. Concerns have been raised, for example, that some landlords may not pass on the full discount to private renters. In time, organisations such as Citizens Advice could offer help and advice, once the policy is finalised. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Peter Scouse, 68, from London, says with things like milk increasing from Â£1 to Â£1.35, petrol from Â£1.20 to Â£1.90 and gas up by more than 50%, his personal rate of inflation is about 30% not the 9% quoted in the news. Peter raises an important point, which is that there is an official rate of inflation â calculated by the Office for National Statistics, based on a typical âbasketâ of goods and services. There is also an individualâs own personal inflation rate. For example, if you drive a lot, or spend much of your time in a poorly insulated home, then you may well have been hit harder than others by recent price rises. There is an expectation for pensioners like Peter that, owing to the way the uprating of benefits is calculated, the state pension looks set for a double-digit increase next April â although that probably still feels a long way away. Paul and Amanda both work so haven't had to watch what they're spending before. ""Now we're doing it on a daily basis,"" says Paul. They do still get takeaways and go out for meals, but not as often and now they order a jug of tap water to keep the bill down. At the supermarket, instead of buying branded products like they used to, they are looking at own-brand items, and are looking for deals. ""We have to look at: What do we really want? What do we really need? Do we really need that luxury? Do we really need those sweets?"" Find out three of the main ways people are changing their spending habitshere. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Michelle Massetti is worried about her son who is a university student. His maintenance loan doesnât cover his Â£6000 a year rent. The rising cost of living is affecting all sorts of people across all walks of life. Students are no strangers to new debt, and â of course â they are seeing rising prices too when it comes to eating and heating. If they are in a student house, they should expect to see their gas and electricity bill rise this winter. However, the government is taking some of the sting out of that increase with a Â£400 discount on everyoneâs domestic energy bill from October. One striking finding in our survey is that 83% of young adults asked, who said they were worried about the rising cost of living, said it was having an impact on their mental health. Haizea Cacho asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent As Haizea is all too aware, maternity leave can mean a drop in your income, just as you face a host of new baby-related expenses. There is support at any time for those who are pregnant or who have just had a baby. For example, you can get free dental care across the UK. There are a host of other benefits and grants that may be claimed for those on low incomes. They can vary in different parts of the UK. This guide,externalfrom the independent MoneyHelper website should help. As well as sending in questions for Kevin, BBC News readers have been getting in touch with their experiences of the rising cost of living. Fiona Stevenson, from Lingdale, worked as a teacher for 27 years until leaving last October due to ill health. Sheâs set to claim her occupational pension in December and relies on her husbandâs part-time job as a school technician. Fiona is also able to make some money through her hobby of crafting. They are owner-occupiers of their home but are finding it hard to make ends meet. ""Not only are costs of all goods and food rising rapidly but fuel costs are now out of control and plans for summer camping trips have had to be cancelled due to the cost of diesel,"" she says. ""We do not even have our lights on in the evening and are dreading the winter months,"" she says. ""The government must step in and reduce the costs for the people they represent. Cut VAT on fuel, increase benefits and provide windfall payments to businesses and households."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent David Wellbelove asks why, when you buy a loaf of bread in a supermarket anywhere in the UK the price is roughly the same, is fuel different? Actually, prices for many goods and services do differ by location - it is just that the huge signs on petrol forecourts make it more obvious. It is less well known, for example, that your domestic energy bill will vary depending on where you live in the country. On vehicle fuel specifically, local prices are influenced by location and competition. If the petrol station is close to storage and convenient for deliveries, then the price will tend to be lower. Drivers also generally pay less in areas where local supermarkets are competing on price. But, as itnow costs more than Â£100 to fill the tank of a family car, it is no surprise our survey suggests people have decided to take fewer journeys to save money. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Rhonda Cowland asks what to do if you were unaware you might be entitled to the cost of living payment. The good news for you Rhonda is that much of this support is automatically paid to those who are eligible, without the need to claim. Without exactly knowing your situation, it is hard to answer your question directly. However, there is one deadline to be aware of, particularly if you are newly-unemployed. Only those who are entitled to and received their first Universal Credit payment by 25 May will be eligible for the first Â£326 instalment of support for those on means-tested benefits. The second will be paid later in the year. Amanda Leeds asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent There are different payments for different groups of people - and so eligibility does vary. However, it is important to say that they will pretty much all be made automatically. That assumes people have claimed the benefits to which they are entitled, because without claiming those, you could miss out on the extra payments. For example, those on means-tested benefits will receive their first cost of living payment automatically into their bank, building society or credit union account by the end of July. We have aguideand there is also sometechnical guidance,externalfrom the Treasury. It's time now for our personal finance correspondent to join us and answer some of your questions about rising prices and what help is available. We'll be putting your questions to the BBCâs Kevin Peachey. He has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected there's a form at the bottom ofthis story. Sabrina Omar, 20, has emailed us to say she thinks the government should do more to help students struggling with the cost of living crisis. The second year diagnostic radiography student at the University of Hertfordshire says living away from home makes things difficult. ""Just with the
basic stuff like food and bills the costs are going up and up and we donât get
any extra student loan or extra help from anywhere else,"" she says. Her fuel reimbursement for travelling to her placement is 28p a mile and with thecost of filling the average tankmore than Â£100 it's ""not making much of a difference"", she says. âAnything that the government can do to help... I
would offer the same support that they are offering other households or just
some sort of support specifically for students. ""Even with a part-time job Iâm struggling because thereâs only
so many hours I can do,"" she says. ""I have been thinking
about the possibility of commuting in next year just to find the cheapest way possible to complete my
course, itâs really made me evaluate everything.â Back to theBBC's cost of living survey, and perhaps unsurprisingly more than 80% of working adults said they thought their wages should match the increase in inflation. Though when it came to asking directly for pay rises, just over half said they would be requesting more money, and only 35% told the survey that they would be demanding 9% or more.

This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

How are people coping with the soaring cost of living?,"Inflation in the UK is expected to top 11% this year as energy, food and fuel prices soar We've been finding out how people are coping with rising prices, and our personal finance correspondent has been answering your questions The BBC's Kevin Peachey has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade The rising cost of living is being blamed on economies rebounding after the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and pressures on supply chains The AA says petrol prices in the UK his a new record yesterday, with a litre of unleaded reaching 187.51p A BBC survey of 4,011 people suggests 8 in 10 people are worried about the cost of living, and more than half said they had skipped meals to save money Two-thirds of those surveyed suggested government support provided so far was insufficient Jen Meierhans, Andrew Humphrey and Rob Corp That's all for our Q&A on the cost of living for today. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions and shared how rising prices have been affecting your lives. Thanks also, of course, to our personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey, for providing plenty of really useful of answers. We're going to wrap up this live coverage shortly but you canread more about the rising cost of living, and what support you can get here. We're nearly at the end of today's live coverage on the cost of living. Here's a recap on what we know:  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Christine asks if her mother, who is 93 and receives a state pension, Pension Credit and Attendance Allowance, will get any payments to help pay for her care home costs? First things first, not everyone is as organised as Christine and her mum. An estimated 850,000 pensioner households fail to claim pension credit â which tops up the income of those who donât have much money coming in, and is a gateway to other payments. Moving into a care home can affect your benefit entitlement. In this case, the receipt of Pension Credit should mean an entitlement to the Â£650 cost of living payment for those on means-tested benefits. People on Attendance Allowance should also qualify for an extra Â£150 paid to people with disabilities in September. We have aguideon how this works. These payments are designed to help with energy bills but, in practice, can be spent as you wish. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Sketchley is a pensioner living in Spain and wants to know if UK citizens who have retired abroad will receive the Â£300 payment to pensioners? The Â£300 referred to here by Simon is a top-up to the Winter Fuel Payment paid in November or December to pensioner households. People living in Spain are not eligible for either â because of the higher winter temperatures. The same is true for those living in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta and Portugal. Those living in other parts of Europe may be entitled to it though. Thegovernment website,externaloutlines eligibility. Fuengirola beach in the Costa del Sol Matthew Homes worked for a financial services company before being made redundant at the beginning of June and says he feels his family have been overlooked by the government. The 22-year-old and his wife, who came to the UK from Ukraine last summer, have a six-month-old baby and say they have been struggling financially since her birth. ""Weâre seeing our budget squeezed day-to-day. With the baby we have seen how the formula and purees have gone up and baby wipes and nappies have gone up. I used to get them on Amazon but now itâs like a treasure hunt for cheaper options. ""Weâre not in a position to pay for our daughter to go to nursery and we donât get help with that."" Matthew says they fall into a ""certain group of people who havenât been considered"" and believes that government help in general came too late. ""Weâre cut out from accessing any financial support from our governmentâ¦ itâs for people on some kind of benefits but that doesnât include us. ""My daughter hasnât been able to see her grandparents because we canât afford to go."" Jeff Cottrell asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Jeff, it appears, is one of many people who pay their energy bill to a landlord or park owner, rather than directly to an energy supplier. It is fair to say that some of these details are yet to be fully ironed out, ahead of the discount paid from October. In fact, they are part of a government consultation. Concerns have been raised, for example, that some landlords may not pass on the full discount to private renters. In time, organisations such as Citizens Advice could offer help and advice, once the policy is finalised. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Peter Scouse, 68, from London, says with things like milk increasing from Â£1 to Â£1.35, petrol from Â£1.20 to Â£1.90 and gas up by more than 50%, his personal rate of inflation is about 30% not the 9% quoted in the news. Peter raises an important point, which is that there is an official rate of inflation â calculated by the Office for National Statistics, based on a typical âbasketâ of goods and services. There is also an individualâs own personal inflation rate. For example, if you drive a lot, or spend much of your time in a poorly insulated home, then you may well have been hit harder than others by recent price rises. There is an expectation for pensioners like Peter that, owing to the way the uprating of benefits is calculated, the state pension looks set for a double-digit increase next April â although that probably still feels a long way away. Paul and Amanda both work so haven't had to watch what they're spending before. ""Now we're doing it on a daily basis,"" says Paul. They do still get takeaways and go out for meals, but not as often and now they order a jug of tap water to keep the bill down. At the supermarket, instead of buying branded products like they used to, they are looking at own-brand items, and are looking for deals. ""We have to look at: What do we really want? What do we really need? Do we really need that luxury? Do we really need those sweets?"" Find out three of the main ways people are changing their spending habitshere. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Michelle Massetti is worried about her son who is a university student. His maintenance loan doesnât cover his Â£6000 a year rent. The rising cost of living is affecting all sorts of people across all walks of life. Students are no strangers to new debt, and â of course â they are seeing rising prices too when it comes to eating and heating. If they are in a student house, they should expect to see their gas and electricity bill rise this winter. However, the government is taking some of the sting out of that increase with a Â£400 discount on everyoneâs domestic energy bill from October. One striking finding in our survey is that 83% of young adults asked, who said they were worried about the rising cost of living, said it was having an impact on their mental health. Haizea Cacho asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent As Haizea is all too aware, maternity leave can mean a drop in your income, just as you face a host of new baby-related expenses. There is support at any time for those who are pregnant or who have just had a baby. For example, you can get free dental care across the UK. There are a host of other benefits and grants that may be claimed for those on low incomes. They can vary in different parts of the UK. This guide,externalfrom the independent MoneyHelper website should help. As well as sending in questions for Kevin, BBC News readers have been getting in touch with their experiences of the rising cost of living. Fiona Stevenson, from Lingdale, worked as a teacher for 27 years until leaving last October due to ill health. Sheâs set to claim her occupational pension in December and relies on her husbandâs part-time job as a school technician. Fiona is also able to make some money through her hobby of crafting. They are owner-occupiers of their home but are finding it hard to make ends meet. ""Not only are costs of all goods and food rising rapidly but fuel costs are now out of control and plans for summer camping trips have had to be cancelled due to the cost of diesel,"" she says. ""We do not even have our lights on in the evening and are dreading the winter months,"" she says. ""The government must step in and reduce the costs for the people they represent. Cut VAT on fuel, increase benefits and provide windfall payments to businesses and households."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent David Wellbelove asks why, when you buy a loaf of bread in a supermarket anywhere in the UK the price is roughly the same, is fuel different? Actually, prices for many goods and services do differ by location - it is just that the huge signs on petrol forecourts make it more obvious. It is less well known, for example, that your domestic energy bill will vary depending on where you live in the country. On vehicle fuel specifically, local prices are influenced by location and competition. If the petrol station is close to storage and convenient for deliveries, then the price will tend to be lower. Drivers also generally pay less in areas where local supermarkets are competing on price. But, as itnow costs more than Â£100 to fill the tank of a family car, it is no surprise our survey suggests people have decided to take fewer journeys to save money. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Rhonda Cowland asks what to do if you were unaware you might be entitled to the cost of living payment. The good news for you Rhonda is that much of this support is automatically paid to those who are eligible, without the need to claim. Without exactly knowing your situation, it is hard to answer your question directly. However, there is one deadline to be aware of, particularly if you are newly-unemployed. Only those who are entitled to and received their first Universal Credit payment by 25 May will be eligible for the first Â£326 instalment of support for those on means-tested benefits. The second will be paid later in the year. Amanda Leeds asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent There are different payments for different groups of people - and so eligibility does vary. However, it is important to say that they will pretty much all be made automatically. That assumes people have claimed the benefits to which they are entitled, because without claiming those, you could miss out on the extra payments. For example, those on means-tested benefits will receive their first cost of living payment automatically into their bank, building society or credit union account by the end of July. We have aguideand there is also sometechnical guidance,externalfrom the Treasury. It's time now for our personal finance correspondent to join us and answer some of your questions about rising prices and what help is available. We'll be putting your questions to the BBCâs Kevin Peachey. He has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected there's a form at the bottom ofthis story. Sabrina Omar, 20, has emailed us to say she thinks the government should do more to help students struggling with the cost of living crisis. The second year diagnostic radiography student at the University of Hertfordshire says living away from home makes things difficult. ""Just with the
basic stuff like food and bills the costs are going up and up and we donât get
any extra student loan or extra help from anywhere else,"" she says. Her fuel reimbursement for travelling to her placement is 28p a mile and with thecost of filling the average tankmore than Â£100 it's ""not making much of a difference"", she says. âAnything that the government can do to help... I
would offer the same support that they are offering other households or just
some sort of support specifically for students. ""Even with a part-time job Iâm struggling because thereâs only
so many hours I can do,"" she says. ""I have been thinking
about the possibility of commuting in next year just to find the cheapest way possible to complete my
course, itâs really made me evaluate everything.â Back to theBBC's cost of living survey, and perhaps unsurprisingly more than 80% of working adults said they thought their wages should match the increase in inflation. Though when it came to asking directly for pay rises, just over half said they would be requesting more money, and only 35% told the survey that they would be demanding 9% or more. Expectations of pay matching inflation seems to be low, with nearly half of those responding to the BBC saying their financial outlook would get worse in the second half of the year. We'll be joined at 13:00 BST by the BBCâs personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey to answer some of your questions about the cost of living crisis. Kevin has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected, click the 'Get Involved' button at the top of this page or email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Let's go back to the BBC's survey of how people across the UK are experiencing the rising cost of living. As we've previously mentioned, pollsters Savanta questioned 4,011 people at the beginning of this month. They were asked about aseries of paymentsannounced by the government aimed at taking the sting out of rising household costs. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said the support was insufficient. Just 24% of people who responded to the BBC thought the package of payments was enough to help people with the rising cost of living. When asked how long government support should last 64% of people said help should be available ""as long as necessary"". Our colleagues atRadio 5 Livehave been visiting the New Parks area of Leicester since the cost of living crisis began. Donna runs a food bank in the area and says ""more and more people"" are coming for help, but she and her partner are struggling to keep it open. ""We're having to cut down on our voluntary work in the community because we can't afford the petrol, we need it ourselves for the shopping,"" she says. ""I personally do 300 miles a week, so that's not feasible any more... I can't afford to help the community and it makes me feel really bad.""My family comes before anyone else and as much as I want to help somebody, it's coming to a time where I can't."" Shaun is a dad to three young boys. He says a lack of money is causing arguments in his house. ""[The kids] don't understand that once you've paid your bills, there's nothing extra to play with,"" he says. ""We as a family go out probably once a month because that's all we can do... they don't understand it and it's hard, but once they're older I suppose they'll understand."" Â© 2025 BBC.

We'll be joined at 13:00 BST by the BBCâs personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey to answer some of your questions about the cost of living crisis. Kevin has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected, click the 'Get Involved' button at the top of this page or email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Let's go back to the BBC's survey of how people across the UK are experiencing the rising cost of living. As we've previously mentioned, pollsters Savanta questioned 4,011 people at the beginning of this month. They were asked about aseries of paymentsannounced by the government aimed at taking the sting out of rising household costs. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said the support was insufficient. Just 24% of people who responded to the BBC thought the package of payments was enough to help people with the rising cost of living. When asked how long government support should last 64% of people said help should be available ""as long as necessary"". Our colleagues atRadio 5 Livehave been visiting the New Parks area of Leicester since the cost of living crisis began. Donna runs a food bank in the area and says ""more and more people"" are coming for help, but she and her partner are struggling to keep it open. ""We're having to cut down on our voluntary work in the community because we can't afford the petrol, we need it ourselves for the shopping,"" she says. ""I personally do 300 miles a week, so that's not feasible any more... I can't afford to help the community and it makes me feel really bad.""My family comes before anyone else and as much as I want to help somebody, it's coming to a time where I can't."" Shaun is a dad to three young boys. He says a lack of money is causing arguments in his house. ""[The kids] don't understand that once you've paid your bills, there's nothing extra to play with,"" he says. ""We as a family go out probably once a month because that's all we can do... they don't understand it and it's hard, but once they're older I suppose they'll understand."" Â© 2025 BBC.

This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK could host Eurovision 2023, organisers sayOfficials are in talks with BBC after concluding contest cannot be held in winning country Ukraine.Entertainment & Arts","The UK's Sam Ryder was recently pictured in a pink Kalush Orchestra hat, in a nod to this year's Ukrainian winners The BBC is in talks with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the UK - not Ukraine. The show's organisers decided, after a ""full assessment and feasibility study"", that the event cannot be held in the winning country, Ukraine. This is due to the ongoing war following Russia's invasion. So, they turned to the UK, which came second. But Kyiv said it disagreed with the EBU's decision and would appeal. Traditionally, the winning country is asked to host the following year's contest. UK cities volunteer to host Eurovision 2023 Reacting to the EBU's decision, Ukrainian Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said Kyiv ""believes that it has grounds for conducting further talks on finding a solution that will satisfy all."" ""Hosting Eurovision 2023 in Ukraine is a powerful signal to all the world, which is supporting Ukraine now. We will be demanding to change the decision, because we believe that we will be able to fulfil all our obligations"". Meanwhile, Mykola Chernotytskyi, head of the managing board of Ukrainian broadcaster UA: PBC, said: ""Security is, of course, our first priority. The team of UA: PBC, state and local authorities did a thorough job and offered different options."" He added: ""It is a pity to see such an unappealable statement, therefore, we ask our partners to hold further negotiations."" Sam Ryder came second for the UK, the country's best result since 1998, at this year's event in May. Ryder topped the jury vote in Turin in May, but rap-folk band Kalush Orchestra, who were given special permission to leave the war-torn country to compete, soared to first place with 631 points in a symbolic show of public support. The UK hashosted Eurovision eight times,external- more than any other country. It has taken over hosting duties for other countries four times. It hosted for the Netherlands in 1960, for France in 1963, for Monaco in 1972; and Luxembourg in 1974. The UK last hosted in 1998, from Birmingham, after Katrina and the Waves' win. Harrogate, Brighton, Edinburgh and London have also been host cities. Israel was the last country that declined to host, in 1980, having also won the year before. The EBU saidin a statement,externalit had conducted the study with Ukrainian state broadcaster UA:PBC and external specialists, amid the conflict, but that the ""security and operational guarantees"" required to host the event cannot be fulfilled in the war-torn country. The organisation thanked the winning nation's broadcaster for its ""wholehearted cooperation and commitment in exploring all scenarios"" and said it shared in ""their sadness and disappointment"", adding it would continue to support them. ""As a result of this decision, in accordance with the rules and to ensure the continuity of the event, the EBU will now begin discussions with the BBC, as this year's runner-up, to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the United Kingdom,"" the statement read. ""It is our full intention that Ukraine's win will be reflected in next year's shows. This will be a priority for us in our discussions with the eventual hosts."" This video can not be played The UK won the jury vote before Ukraine stormed into the lead following huge public support A BBC spokesman added: ""We have seen the announcement from the EBU. Clearly these aren't a set of circumstances that anyone would want. Following their decision, we will of course discuss the BBC hosting the Eurovision Song Contest."" Katrina Leskanich, lead singer for the UK's winning 1997 Eurovision entry Katrina and the Waves with their song Love Shine A Light,tweeted,external: ""Practically hysterical over the announcement that the UK could host!"" Downing Street welcomed the possibility of the UK hosting Eurovision if Ukraine cannot, pledging to ensure it would ""overwhelmingly reflect Ukraine's rich culture, heritage and creativity"". Which UK cities could host 2023 contest? Eurovision win brings Ukraine 'incredible happiness' ""Ukraine's victory... was richly deserved and as the rightful winner the government's firm wish has been to see next year's contest hosted there,"" said a government spokesperson. ""If the EBU decides the competition can't go ahead in Ukraine, we would of course welcome the opportunity to work closely with Ukraine and the BBC to host it here in the UK."" They added the government was also committed to ""building on the ongoing partnership between our two countries"". Asked if the government would help the BBC with the costs, the spokesman said ""we're slightly getting ahead of ourselves in terms of the process"". Norway's Give That Wolf A Banana were an eye-catching act at this year's contest A number of locationshave put their hats in the ring if the UK does end up hosting the contest. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid she,externalwished Eurovision could be in Ukraine, but ""understand that in circumstances this isn't possible"". ""However, I can think of a perfect venue on banks of the River Clyde!"" she added, apparently suggesting the 14,300-capacity riverside OVO Hydro arena in Glasgow as a venue. Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester City Council, also threw the city's hat in the ring,saying,external: ""Not the circumstances that anyone would want given the war in Ukraine. But if it's to be a UK city - I can't think of anywhere better, a great music city and fittingly home to a large Ukrainian community."" Leeds had hoped to be European Capital of Culture in 2023, before Brexit prevented UK cities from entering that contest. The city is ploughing on with staging a year of culture anyway, and Leeds City Council said having Eurovision in the city ""could not come at a better time"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khantweeted,externalthat the UK capital ""would welcome Eurovision with open arms"", adding: ""We're ready to step up and support Ukraine by hosting a contest that pays tribute to and honours the Ukrainian people, and also celebrates the very best of Britain too."" Liverpool, Cardiff, Aberdeen, Brighton, Belfast and Birmingham have also all been suggested as possibilities. If the UK is confirmed as the host country, cities would have to prove they have the right facilities and go through a bidding process. Which UK cities could host Eurovision 2023?

Rwanda plan would have deterred me - asylum seeker,"The man known as KN said he was mistreated, could barely breathe and collapsed as staff took him to the flight to Rwanda One of seven asylum seekers taken off Tuesday's cancelled Rwanda flight says he would not have come to the UK if he had known about the deportation policy. But the man, who can only be identified as KN, told the BBC he had been in hiding and did not know about the plan. The Iraqi Kurd, who said he fought alongside the British in the Iraq war, also alleged he had been mistreated on the way to the plane. The Home Office said staff were trained in the appropriate use of force. The Rwanda asylum plan, announced by the government in April, intends to take some asylum seekers who cross the Channel to the UK on a one-way ticket to Rwanda to claim asylum there instead. The government has said the scheme will discourage others from crossing the Channel. KN said he had ""absolutely no idea"" that anyone entering the UK illegally to claim asylum could be deported to Rwanda under the UK government's new policy. ""If I had known about this whole plan I would have never decided to come to the UK,"" he told Radio 4's The World Tonight. ""The thing is that during the past six months, because I was in hiding, I was completely disconnected from the news and the outside world - so I had no idea what was going on. I was just desperately trying to get my way out for my safety."" However, migrants in Calais waiting to make the crossing to the UK have previously told the BBCthe plan to deport people to Rwanda would not deter them. Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? Land of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinion After the first flight scheduled to take asylum seekers to Rwanda was grounded on Tuesday due to legal challenges, KN - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was taken to an immigration detention centre he describes as ""like a prison"". Speaking through an interpreter from the detention centre, he said when he learned he was being transported to the east African country, he informed British officials that he had been part of the Kurdish Peshmerga forces who had helped the UK in Iraq in 2004. He said he had documentary evidence on his phone and had told the officials: ""I really needed this favour to be returned."" A financial problem in his home country had led to threats from ""people connected to the ruling system"", KN said, which meant his life was in danger. He fled to Turkey and found a group of people smugglers. Armed with guns and knives, they transported him hidden in a lorry to the coast of France, before loading him into a small boat. When he learned that he was due to be on the first plane-load of asylum seekers to be transported to Rwanda, KN said he called his children back home: ""They were crying, I was crying too."" He said he was ""extremely mistreated"" by staff during the attempted removal. ""I could barely breathe. At some point I collapsed. My hands and my knees were completely numb,"" he said. KN said he was taken to a doctor and offered ""some pills"", but he refused. Security guards pushed him and bundled him into a van, he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Our staff and escorting providers are rigorously trained to ensure the safety of returnees throughout the removal process, including on the appropriate use of force and restraint."" The news that he was being transported to east Africa ""felt like I was dying"", KN said. He said: ""It was a horrible feeling. I told the security forces I am here to pursue my rights, I have the right to have a better life."" But after a decision by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and a series of judgements in London courts, KN was among the asylum seekers who were removed from the plane on Tuesday evening - before the flight was cancelled altogether. He said he learned of his reprieve at about 22:00 BST. ""I started crying,"" he said. ""I told them I'm just crying for the others who were inside the plane and destined for Rwanda, because those people are helpless, are desperate just like me - they have families to support."" With the High Court due to hear a judicial review challenging the legality of the Rwanda deportation policy next month, KN said he does not know what his future holds. ""I'm still under shock but they are refusing to let me out of this place they are keeping us,"" he said. Although Home Secretary Priti Patel has suggested that work would begin immediately on preparing another flight, KN said the asylum seekers have heard nothing about it. He said they are ""hanging in the balance"". ""We are all in a state of shock and disbelief - we don't know what's happening next,"" he said.

LiveLiveUkraine moves step closer to EU membership11 minutes ago,"Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a ""front-line city,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the conflict could last for years In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Stoltenberg adds that the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the Donbas region Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the Sunday Times that ""we need to steel ourselves for a long war"" Ukrainian authorities say their air defence systems in the Kyiv Region shot down a Russian âair objectâ on Sunday morning Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre, but no casualties were reported Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now wrapping up our day of live coverage of events in Ukraine. This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine.

Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"People cut back on food and fuel as prices riseMore than eight in 10 people say they are worried about the cost-of-living, a BBC survey suggests.","People struggling with the soaring cost of living are cutting back on food and car journeys to save money, according to a BBC-commissioned survey. More than half (56%) the 4,011 people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. The findings reveal the widespread impact of prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. Many people have cut spending on clothes and socialising. Some say their mental health has been affected. Two-thirds of those surveyed also suggested government support provided so far was insufficient. The BBC-commissioned survey of 4,011 UK adults in early June lifts a lid on how the economic climate is affecting lives and financial, physical and mental health. The cost of domestic energy, petrol, and food have all increased significantly in recent months, and the findings suggest more than eight in 10 people (81%) are worried about the rising cost of living. 'We can't just go in there and buy what we like now' Why are prices rising so quickly? Five things that are going up in price and why Why chicken is getting more and more expensive Concern has grown since the start of the year when 69% of those asked said they were worried in a similar BBC survey. In the latest results, two thirds (66%) of those with worries said this was having a negative effect on their mental health. Nearly half (45%) said their physical health had been affected. Day-to-day, individuals are making further changes to manage their budgets. The survey suggests this can be as simple as going on fewer nights out, or getting a haircut less often. For charity worker Janine Colwill, from Easington, and those she talks to, the changes have been more fundamental. ""We get together with the family every Sunday, religiously, for Sunday roast - but my family and other families are starting to grow their own vegetables,"" she said. Janine Colwill says people in her area are constantly looking for ways to save money ""Those people who may not have worried about these things before are now worrying about them constantly. ""With advances in technology, I never would have thought that people would be relying on a food bank or growing their own - and just penny-pinching,"" she said. The survey suggests people are finding various ways to manage and save their money. The findings include: Some 82% of those asked had switched off lights in the previous week to save money Trips taken in the car had been limited to varying degrees in the previous six months by 72% of those asked A large majority (84%) said they had spent less on their clothes at some point in the previous six months About half (52%) expect to work more hours in the next six months to help to pay the bills. Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, said in a trading update for the three months to 28 May that it was seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to inflation, such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. Chief executive Ken Murphy also said people are switching to cheaper own-label brands for goods including bread and pastawhich have seen prices soardue to the war between Ukraine and Russia, both of which are major wheat exporters. Prices, as measured by inflation, are rising at a rate of 9% a year, the fastest for 40 years. Interest rates, which also affect the cost of living,were increased to 1.25%on Thursday by the Bank of England - the highest they have been for 13 years. The situation is being driven, to a significant degree, by global factors such as the cost of oil, gas and food. But there are UK-specific issues which are adding to inflation such as the tight labour market. Job vacancies are at a record high of 1.3 million meaning employers face paying higher wages to fill roles. Also, the UK's dominant services sector - which includes the likes of accountancy and law firms, as well as restaurants and pubs - is seeing price rises. Drivers now have to spendÂ£103 for petrol and Â£106 for diesel to fill a family car, according to the RAC. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) has predicted food priceswill rise at a rate of 15%this summer as households pay more for staples such as bread, meat, dairy and fruit and vegetables. A typical household in England, Wales and Scotland is likely to see a rise in its annual domestic gas and electricity bill of Â£800 in October, on top of a Â£700 rise in April. The surge in inflation is hitting wide and hitting deep, with the effects leading to significant changes in the way lives are being lived well beyond those on low incomes. Large swathes of Britain's middle income working households are having to make material cutbacks and even after that are part of a new class of those ""just about managing"". In practice this has meant energy bill direct debits wiping out people's entire disposable income, some food banks running out of food donations, or their donors becoming users. And it may be changing attitudes, with nearly two-thirds of those asked saying even after the recent package of support for energy bills from the government, that it is not enough. And the numbers suggest a similar proportion think the support in place needs to last at least a year longer. Inflation this high certainly changes the economy and our spending behaviour. But the figures raise a question about whether the high levels of government support in the pandemic and in this energy crisis too, are now becoming baked into public expectations. Soaring prices have led the government to announcea package of financial supportdirected primarily at those on low incomes. This includes a Â£400 discount on all energy bills in October, in addition to payments totalling Â£650 to people on means-tested benefits. Pensioners will get more this winter, as will billpayers with disabilities. However, the BBC survey reveals that 64% of those asked said this support was insufficient to help people with the rising cost of living. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said vulnerable households would receive Â£1,200 which he said was part of a ""very large"" amount of support, on top of what had already been provided. He said the first payments would come in July, and would continue into the autumn to offset the key driver of the rising cost of living for households, which was energy bills. ""That, of course, is yet to filter through to people, which is why I suspect people are saying they want more support,"" he told the BBC. ""As this gathers pace, it will be clear to people that this will be a comprehensive package."" The impact of rising household costs has already led to the financial regulator warning lenders that they need to do more to help those in financial difficulty and support vulnerable customers. ""Early action is important for those struggling with debt,"" said Sheldon Mills, of the Financial Conduct Authority. Three things we're cutting back on as prices rise What are cost of living payments and who gets them? UK interest rates hit highest level for 13 years Rising prices see basic pay fall fastest since 2011 'Iâll walk to the next shop just to save 5p' Energy and food drive US inflation to 40-year high 'Petrol costs so much I might have to quit my job' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over UK economy at PMQs What happens if TikTok is banned?

BBC in talks to host 2023 Eurovision Song ContestThe show's organisers have concluded next year's event cannot be held in winning country Ukraine.Entertainment & Arts,"The UK's Sam Ryder was recently pictured in a pink Kalush Orchestra hat, in a nod to this year's Ukrainian winners The BBC is in talks with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the UK - not Ukraine. The show's organisers decided, after a ""full assessment and feasibility study"", that the event cannot be held in the winning country, Ukraine. This is due to the ongoing war following Russia's invasion. So, they turned to the UK, which came second. But Kyiv said it disagreed with the EBU's decision and would appeal. Traditionally, the winning country is asked to host the following year's contest. UK cities volunteer to host Eurovision 2023 Reacting to the EBU's decision, Ukrainian Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said Kyiv ""believes that it has grounds for conducting further talks on finding a solution that will satisfy all."" ""Hosting Eurovision 2023 in Ukraine is a powerful signal to all the world, which is supporting Ukraine now. We will be demanding to change the decision, because we believe that we will be able to fulfil all our obligations"". Meanwhile, Mykola Chernotytskyi, head of the managing board of Ukrainian broadcaster UA: PBC, said: ""Security is, of course, our first priority. The team of UA: PBC, state and local authorities did a thorough job and offered different options."" He added: ""It is a pity to see such an unappealable statement, therefore, we ask our partners to hold further negotiations."" Sam Ryder came second for the UK, the country's best result since 1998, at this year's event in May. Ryder topped the jury vote in Turin in May, but rap-folk band Kalush Orchestra, who were given special permission to leave the war-torn country to compete, soared to first place with 631 points in a symbolic show of public support. The UK hashosted Eurovision eight times,external- more than any other country. It has taken over hosting duties for other countries four times. It hosted for the Netherlands in 1960, for France in 1963, for Monaco in 1972; and Luxembourg in 1974. The UK last hosted in 1998, from Birmingham, after Katrina and the Waves' win. Harrogate, Brighton, Edinburgh and London have also been host cities. Israel was the last country that declined to host, in 1980, having also won the year before. The EBU saidin a statement,externalit had conducted the study with Ukrainian state broadcaster UA:PBC and external specialists, amid the conflict, but that the ""security and operational guarantees"" required to host the event cannot be fulfilled in the war-torn country. The organisation thanked the winning nation's broadcaster for its ""wholehearted cooperation and commitment in exploring all scenarios"" and said it shared in ""their sadness and disappointment"", adding it would continue to support them. ""As a result of this decision, in accordance with the rules and to ensure the continuity of the event, the EBU will now begin discussions with the BBC, as this year's runner-up, to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the United Kingdom,"" the statement read. ""It is our full intention that Ukraine's win will be reflected in next year's shows. This will be a priority for us in our discussions with the eventual hosts."" This video can not be played The UK won the jury vote before Ukraine stormed into the lead following huge public support A BBC spokesman added: ""We have seen the announcement from the EBU. Clearly these aren't a set of circumstances that anyone would want. Following their decision, we will of course discuss the BBC hosting the Eurovision Song Contest."" Katrina Leskanich, lead singer for the UK's winning 1997 Eurovision entry Katrina and the Waves with their song Love Shine A Light,tweeted,external: ""Practically hysterical over the announcement that the UK could host!"" Downing Street welcomed the possibility of the UK hosting Eurovision if Ukraine cannot, pledging to ensure it would ""overwhelmingly reflect Ukraine's rich culture, heritage and creativity"". Which UK cities could host 2023 contest? Eurovision win brings Ukraine 'incredible happiness' ""Ukraine's victory... was richly deserved and as the rightful winner the government's firm wish has been to see next year's contest hosted there,"" said a government spokesperson. ""If the EBU decides the competition can't go ahead in Ukraine, we would of course welcome the opportunity to work closely with Ukraine and the BBC to host it here in the UK."" They added the government was also committed to ""building on the ongoing partnership between our two countries"". Asked if the government would help the BBC with the costs, the spokesman said ""we're slightly getting ahead of ourselves in terms of the process"". Norway's Give That Wolf A Banana were an eye-catching act at this year's contest A number of locationshave put their hats in the ring if the UK does end up hosting the contest. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid she,externalwished Eurovision could be in Ukraine, but ""understand that in circumstances this isn't possible"". ""However, I can think of a perfect venue on banks of the River Clyde!"" she added, apparently suggesting the 14,300-capacity riverside OVO Hydro arena in Glasgow as a venue. Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester City Council, also threw the city's hat in the ring,saying,external: ""Not the circumstances that anyone would want given the war in Ukraine. But if it's to be a UK city - I can't think of anywhere better, a great music city and fittingly home to a large Ukrainian community."" Leeds had hoped to be European Capital of Culture in 2023, before Brexit prevented UK cities from entering that contest. The city is ploughing on with staging a year of culture anyway, and Leeds City Council said having Eurovision in the city ""could not come at a better time"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khantweeted,externalthat the UK capital ""would welcome Eurovision with open arms"", adding: ""We're ready to step up and support Ukraine by hosting a contest that pays tribute to and honours the Ukrainian people, and also celebrates the very best of Britain too."" Liverpool, Cardiff, Aberdeen, Brighton, Belfast and Birmingham have also all been suggested as possibilities. If the UK is confirmed as the host country, cities would have to prove they have the right facilities and go through a bidding process. Which UK cities could host Eurovision 2023?

William and Kate - who have not attended the Berkshire meet for a number of years - arrived in the traditional royal carriage procession to cheers from the crowds. The Queen has not made an appearance today with other members of the Royal Family. Thanks to the soaring temperatures, the event's organisers earlier announced that the strict dress code would not be enforced in all enclosures. Punters have been reminded to stay cool and a message broadcast on the public address system said: ""Please drink plenty of water all afternoon and keep hydrated.""

Concerts and large public gatherings have been called off in the Gironde department around Bordeaux. Yesterday, parts of France hit 40C earlier in the year than usual, with temperatures expected to peak tomorrow. Scientists say periods of intense heat are becoming more frequent and longer lasting as a result of global warming. In Gironde, officials said public events, including some of the official 18 June Resistance celebrations, will be prohibited from Friday at 14:00 (12:00 GMT) ""until the end of the heat wave"". Indoor events at venues without air conditioning are also banned. The weather has been kind for festival-goers on the Isle of Wight, with no wellies needed. Organisers havewarned people at the Isle of Wight Festival to stay safeduring the heat and recommended they take precautions - including avoiding excess alcohol consumption.

This video can not be played Isle of Wight Festival: Hot weather warnings for revellers Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter Hot days are often followed by very warm nights. If the overnight temperature doesnât drop below 20C then thatâs defined as a tropical night and thereâs a chance of that somewhere in south-east England tonight.What is a tropical night? Harry LowBBC London News Itâs hotting up here at this lido as the sunbathers soak up the sunshine in south-east London. Since sunrise swimmers have been flocking to Charlton: all 1,000 slots sold out as people look for some respite from the high temperatures brought about by the arrival of the Spanish plume. Picnickers have set up camp beside this Olympic-sized swimming pool as the trees surrounding the pool gently sway in the breeze. A number of fair-weather swimmers have visited throughout the day, much to the chagrin of some regulars who are not used to sharing with crowds, especially during those long, cold winter months. If you're heading out to make the most of the summer sunshine today, spare a thought for some of our hairy-coated friends. As the temperature rises, it's not just us humans that need to keep cool. At the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon, the animals are being looked after with specially made ice lollies - the perfect way to cool down in the heat. The sanctuary's Simon Horn says: ""The ice
blocks are made from fruit and vegetables in water. ""They not only provide a
welcome treat during the sizzling temperatures, but they also provide a
valuable form of enrichment. ""Donkeys love exploring, and this activity allows
them to exhibit their natural foraging behaviours - a key factor in improving
donkey welfare."" It is officially the hottest day of the year in the UK for the third day in a row. Heathrow in west London recorded 32.4C (90F) this afternoon andtemperatures could climb furtherto 34C in parts of the South East. Today's record temperature surpassed the previous day's high of 29.5C (85.1F) recorded at Northolt in west London. The Met Office also predicts it could be the ""hottest Royal Ascot on record"" at the Berkshire racecourse. In Santon Downham, Suffolk, temperatures reached 31.1C, and Wisley, Surrey, recorded 30.4C. But the picture changes further north, with the Met Office pointing out a marked difference in temperatures, with Glasgow recording 13.7C just after midday. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter While parts of South East England will have another very warm to hot day on Saturday, elsewhere in England and Wales things will feel very different as temperatures drop significantly. For example, Leeds will fall from a high near 27C today to just 16C tomorrow. This photo of a tranquil spot in Leeds was taken a short while ago by BBC Weather Watcher Martin King. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Livestock cool off in a pond to beat the heat in Pakistan where temperatures reached 40C last month If youâre in
the southern half of the UK youâll certainly be feeling the heat - but spare a
thought for Spain and France, they are experiencing a punishing heatwave. This week
France saw temperatures hit 40C - the earliest in the year than ever before. Spain is
enduring its second heatwave this year and there are warnings it could reach
43C in the next couple of days. That did not used to happen until July or
August. It is this
type of intense heat that scientists warn will become more common as global
warming heats the planet. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the 19th century and temperatures continue to rise. The last seven years have been
the hottest years ever recorded and, if no action is taken to curb climate
change, scientists warn a rise of 4C is possible. In the US
now, more than 100 million people are being warned to stay indoors as scorching
temperatures settle over large parts of the country. India and
Pakistan suffered even more brutal heat last month with temperatures in
Pakistan reaching 50C while the Indian capital, New Delhi, hit 49.2C â
an all-time high. While periods
of hot weather have always occurred naturally, the increased intensity and
frequency of extreme heat now is a warning bell for the impacts ofclimate change. To place the current hot weather in context, we've drawn up a map of some peak temperatures hit around the UK - both in the month of June and overall. Some historical high points for thermometers include the hottest temperature recorded in June, when Southampton peaked at 35.6C in 1976. In more recent times, Cambridge experienced a sweltering 38.7C in July 2019, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

In the words of Billy Idol, it's hot in the city. In the words of The Clash, London's burning. In the words of Glen Frey, the heat is on. A high of 34C (93.2F) is expected in the capital on Friday. So are Londoners coping with the heatwave - or is it too hot to handle? Before the inevitable rainclouds return to empty over our optimistic barbecues - we take a look at some ""snaps-hots"" from around the city.

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council says it expects tens of thousands of visitors over the next few days to head to the seaside to enjoy the heat and sunshine. Beachgoers flocked to the resort town on the south coast of England when the first Covid-19 lockdown was eased in June 2020, which led to the councildeclaring a major incident. Since the incident, the council has developed a freebeach check appshowing people which areas are crowded, gives the location of public toilets and lifeguards, and says which areas dogs can use. Security cameras, a hub for emergency services and more rangers have also since been brought in. Read morehere. If the hot weather is becoming oppressive, there are some basic principles to help stop it becoming too much. During the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out and close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out. Open all the windows before you go to bed to get a through breeze. Using even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather as it encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. If you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. Alternatively, cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body, so try chilling your socks in the fridge before wearing. And of course, keep hydrated. A Level 3 heat-health alert has been issued for London, the east of England and the south-east to help protect health services, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says. The alert, called 'heatwave action', is to help protect the NHS and to inform its partners that they should prepare their services for possible increases in demand due to increases in temperatures, Agostinho Sousa of the UKHSA tells BBC Breakfast. âWe also have a Level 2 that is currently active in the South West and East of England that is to inform our partners that they should prepare their services in case they need to enter into action in case we see an increase in temperatures. âRight now the situation is stable, and we expect the temperatures to drop tomorrow.â Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals can cause muscle cramps and shock due to cold water temperatures, the fire service says People have been warnednot to swim in open water as temperatures soar. Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals could cause muscle cramps and shock as the water often remained cold even in heatwaves, says Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Fresh water could be polluted and cause serious illness, it said. People who fall into water by accident should lean back, extend their legs and arms, and use slow, gentle movements to stay afloat. Once you have controlled your breathing, attempt to swim to safety and call for help, the service adds. Anyone seeing a person or animal in trouble around water was asked to phone 999.

But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it. You can read more by James on the dangers of heat and what to do about themhere. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter At midday, the temperature at Heathrow Airport was 30.3C, which is the highest for England and the UK so far this year. Wales has also recorded its highest temperature so far - 26.7C at Cardiff Bute Park. This heatwave has been building across western Europe - last weekSpainsaw temperatures above 40C - and now that heat has started to move
northwards. Spain is used to heatwaves â just not this
early in the summer season and certainly not this hot. And with the high temperatures come the inevitable
wildfires. InItaly, the soaring
heat is leading to growing concerns about water shortages. As we reported earlier, large stretches of the countryâs largest river, the Po, the
water is so low that locals can walk through the middle of the expanse of sand -
and wartime shipwrecks are even resurfacing. Across thePyrenees, straddling the border
of France and Spain, outdoor public events are being banned from tomorrow until
the end of the heatwave. Teachers in the region are watering
playgrounds in order to prevent pupils getting heatstroke in the extreme heat. Portugalsaw its hottest May since 1931, and yesterdayFrance recorded a temperature of over 40C - the earliest hot spell ever to hit the country. And French officials say the peak of the heatwave is yet to be reached. The hot zone is expected to move intocentral Europe, ItalytheAlpine countriesand the south ofGermany. The peak of the heatwave in theUKarrives today acrossEnglandandWales, with temperatures set to reach 33C. But inScotlandandNorthern Ireland, temperatures are expected to peak at a more comfortable 23C Across the whole of the UK, cooler and fresher conditions are expected over the weekend Scientists warn that as global temperatures rise over time heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent, more intense and longer lasting - and their impact more widespread.

Cosmetics maker Revlon files for bankruptcy in USThe 90-year-old firm says supply chain disruptions have driven up the cost of raw materials.Business,"Cosmetics maker Revlon has filed for bankruptcy in the US, as it says supply chain disruptions have driven up the cost of raw materials for its products. The 90-year-old firm says it has also been struggling with supplier payments, inflation and labour shortages. The company says it expects to receive $575m (Â£466.6m) from its existing lenders to support day-to-day operations. Its shares lost more than 13% in New York trading after the announcement. In a court filing, the company said that supply chain disruptions had prompted intense competition for the ingredients used in its cosmetics. It added that suppliers have also asked to be paid for orders upfront. This has caused ""shortages of necessary ingredients across the company's portfolio,"" Revlon's chief restructuring officer Robert Caruso said in the filing. ""For example, one tube of Revlon lipstick requires 35 to 40 raw materials and component parts, each of which is critical to bringing the product to market,"" he added. Asos shoppers return more as rising prices hit Women wear less make-up since the pandemic As well as the Revlon brand, the company also owns well-known names such as Elizabeth Arden, Almay and Cutex, and fragrances fronted by Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears. In recent years it has faced increased competition from new brands like those backed by celebrities such as Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics and Rihanna's Fenty Beauty. By filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US Revlon will be able to continue to operate while it is working out a plan to repay its creditors. Revlon's president and chief executive Debra Perelman said the bankruptcy filing will allow the company to ""offer our customers the iconic products we have delivered for decades, while providing a clearer path for our future growth"". However, the New York Stock Exchange said on Thursday that it had started the process of removing the company's shares from its platform. Revlon was formed in 1932 by brothers Charles and Joseph Revson and Charles Lachman and started selling nail polish soon after. By the mid-1950s it had become an international brand. It was bought by billionaire businessman Ronald Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes in 1985. Revlon now sells its products in more than 150 countries. Earlier this year, Revlon warned that it was facing ""liquidity constraints brought on by continued global challenges, including supply chain disruption and rising inflation"". It had $3.3bn of long-term debt at the end of March, and reports of its impending bankruptcy last week caused a slide in its share price.

BBC in talks to host 2023 Eurovision Song Contest,"The UK's Sam Ryder was recently pictured in a pink Kalush Orchestra hat, in a nod to this year's Ukrainian winners The BBC is in talks with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the UK - not Ukraine. The show's organisers decided, after a ""full assessment and feasibility study"", that the event cannot be held in the winning country, Ukraine. This is due to the ongoing war following Russia's invasion. So, they turned to the UK, which came second. But Kyiv said it disagreed with the EBU's decision and would appeal. Traditionally, the winning country is asked to host the following year's contest. UK cities volunteer to host Eurovision 2023 Reacting to the EBU's decision, Ukrainian Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said Kyiv ""believes that it has grounds for conducting further talks on finding a solution that will satisfy all."" ""Hosting Eurovision 2023 in Ukraine is a powerful signal to all the world, which is supporting Ukraine now. We will be demanding to change the decision, because we believe that we will be able to fulfil all our obligations"". Meanwhile, Mykola Chernotytskyi, head of the managing board of Ukrainian broadcaster UA: PBC, said: ""Security is, of course, our first priority. The team of UA: PBC, state and local authorities did a thorough job and offered different options."" He added: ""It is a pity to see such an unappealable statement, therefore, we ask our partners to hold further negotiations."" Sam Ryder came second for the UK, the country's best result since 1998, at this year's event in May. Ryder topped the jury vote in Turin in May, but rap-folk band Kalush Orchestra, who were given special permission to leave the war-torn country to compete, soared to first place with 631 points in a symbolic show of public support. The UK hashosted Eurovision eight times,external- more than any other country. It has taken over hosting duties for other countries four times. It hosted for the Netherlands in 1960, for France in 1963, for Monaco in 1972; and Luxembourg in 1974. The UK last hosted in 1998, from Birmingham, after Katrina and the Waves' win. Harrogate, Brighton, Edinburgh and London have also been host cities. Israel was the last country that declined to host, in 1980, having also won the year before. The EBU saidin a statement,externalit had conducted the study with Ukrainian state broadcaster UA:PBC and external specialists, amid the conflict, but that the ""security and operational guarantees"" required to host the event cannot be fulfilled in the war-torn country. The organisation thanked the winning nation's broadcaster for its ""wholehearted cooperation and commitment in exploring all scenarios"" and said it shared in ""their sadness and disappointment"", adding it would continue to support them. ""As a result of this decision, in accordance with the rules and to ensure the continuity of the event, the EBU will now begin discussions with the BBC, as this year's runner-up, to potentially host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in the United Kingdom,"" the statement read. ""It is our full intention that Ukraine's win will be reflected in next year's shows. This will be a priority for us in our discussions with the eventual hosts."" This video can not be played The UK won the jury vote before Ukraine stormed into the lead following huge public support A BBC spokesman added: ""We have seen the announcement from the EBU. Clearly these aren't a set of circumstances that anyone would want. Following their decision, we will of course discuss the BBC hosting the Eurovision Song Contest."" Katrina Leskanich, lead singer for the UK's winning 1997 Eurovision entry Katrina and the Waves with their song Love Shine A Light,tweeted,external: ""Practically hysterical over the announcement that the UK could host!"" Downing Street welcomed the possibility of the UK hosting Eurovision if Ukraine cannot, pledging to ensure it would ""overwhelmingly reflect Ukraine's rich culture, heritage and creativity"". Which UK cities could host 2023 contest? Eurovision win brings Ukraine 'incredible happiness' ""Ukraine's victory... was richly deserved and as the rightful winner the government's firm wish has been to see next year's contest hosted there,"" said a government spokesperson. ""If the EBU decides the competition can't go ahead in Ukraine, we would of course welcome the opportunity to work closely with Ukraine and the BBC to host it here in the UK."" They added the government was also committed to ""building on the ongoing partnership between our two countries"". Asked if the government would help the BBC with the costs, the spokesman said ""we're slightly getting ahead of ourselves in terms of the process"". Norway's Give That Wolf A Banana were an eye-catching act at this year's contest A number of locationshave put their hats in the ring if the UK does end up hosting the contest. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid she,externalwished Eurovision could be in Ukraine, but ""understand that in circumstances this isn't possible"". ""However, I can think of a perfect venue on banks of the River Clyde!"" she added, apparently suggesting the 14,300-capacity riverside OVO Hydro arena in Glasgow as a venue. Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester City Council, also threw the city's hat in the ring,saying,external: ""Not the circumstances that anyone would want given the war in Ukraine. But if it's to be a UK city - I can't think of anywhere better, a great music city and fittingly home to a large Ukrainian community."" Leeds had hoped to be European Capital of Culture in 2023, before Brexit prevented UK cities from entering that contest. The city is ploughing on with staging a year of culture anyway, and Leeds City Council said having Eurovision in the city ""could not come at a better time"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khantweeted,externalthat the UK capital ""would welcome Eurovision with open arms"", adding: ""We're ready to step up and support Ukraine by hosting a contest that pays tribute to and honours the Ukrainian people, and also celebrates the very best of Britain too."" Liverpool, Cardiff, Aberdeen, Brighton, Belfast and Birmingham have also all been suggested as possibilities. If the UK is confirmed as the host country, cities would have to prove they have the right facilities and go through a bidding process. Which UK cities could host Eurovision 2023?

England appoints tsar to shake up women's health,"Dame Lesley has 42 years' experience working in women's health England's first women's health ambassador is calling for ""one-stop shops"" where women can sort out their health needs. Dame Lesley Regan, also a practising doctor, wants to make it easier for women and girls to access care such as contraception and smear tests in the community. Her new role aims to close the ""gender health gap"". She will also support the upcoming government-ledwomen's-health strategy,external. One priority for the government is to improve access to hormone-replacement therapy amidst ongoing shortages across the UK. It recently appointed aHRT Tsar, Madelaine McTernan, to help address this. Waits for gynaecology appointments are also an issue and have risenby 60% during the pandemic- more sharply than any other specialty. Dame Lesley told BBC News: ""At the moment, we waste a lot of resource in telling girls and women that they cannot have things. ""So you might go off to your doctor or gynaecologist or heart specialist and get told, well, you cannot have a smear here, even if it is due, or you need to go somewhere else for this, that and the other. ""We should make it very, very easy for people to access this out in the community - why do you need to go to a secondary or tertiary facility for things that are very easy to provide?"" Women with endometriosis 'finally being believed' 'HRT crisis left me unable to work' England extends at-home abortion pill offer Instead, she wants health hubs where women could ""go for half a day and get all these things sorted out"" and then get on with their lives. ""A one-stop shop is what I want for myself and what I want for my daughters and I'm sure it is what every other girl and woman wants and what every man and boy wants for the women in their lives, to be looked after that way,"" Dame Lesley said. But it would be unreasonable to expect every GP practice to become a women's health hub. Dame Lesley also told BBC News more investment in the midwifery and obstetric workforce was needed. With 42 years' experience working in women's health, she: is currently professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, at Imperial College London was previously president of the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has conducted research on recurrent miscarriages and fibroids has a particular interest in period problems and the menopause Dame Lesley says one area she would like to address is improving the representation of women in drug trials. Many trials for new medicines are based on men. Her work may also focus on improving diagnoses for women with heart disease. Women's symptoms can sometimes be different to the ones men experience and their conditions may go unrecognised. Minister for women's health Maria Caulfield said there was no quick fix to eradicate the gender health gap. ""Since we launched our women's health call for evidence over a year ago, we have made great progress in raising the profile of women's health,"" she said. ""From the formation of the UK-wide menopause taskforce and publication of our vision document, to legislating to ban hymenoplasty and virginity testing and appointing a chair of the HRT [hormone-replacement therapy] taskforce to help more menopausal women access this lifeline medication."" The aims of the women's health strategy include ensuring: all women feel comfortable talking about their health and no longer face taboos all women feel supported in the workplace and can reach their full potential at work better representation in research trials Women to be asked about 'gender health gap' 'HRT crisis left me unable to work' England extends at-home abortion pill offer Women's Health Strategy- Call for Evidence - GOV.UK Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over UK economy at PMQs What happens if TikTok is banned?

William and Kate - who have not attended the Berkshire meet for a number of years - arrived in the traditional royal carriage procession to cheers from the crowds. The Queen has not made an appearance today with other members of the Royal Family. Thanks to the soaring temperatures, the event's organisers earlier announced that the strict dress code would not be enforced in all enclosures.

Concerts and large public gatherings have been called off in the Gironde department around Bordeaux. Yesterday, parts of France hit 40C earlier in the year than usual, with temperatures expected to peak tomorrow. Scientists say periods of intense heat are becoming more frequent and longer lasting as a result of global warming. In Gironde, officials said public events, including some of the official 18 June Resistance celebrations, will be prohibited from Friday at 14:00 (12:00 GMT) ""until the end of the heat wave"". Indoor events at venues without air conditioning are also banned. The weather has been kind for festival-goers on the Isle of Wight, with no wellies needed.

If the overnight temperature doesnât drop below 20C then thatâs defined as a tropical night and thereâs a chance of that somewhere in south-east England tonight.What is a tropical night? Harry LowBBC London News Itâs hotting up here at this lido as the sunbathers soak up the sunshine in south-east London. Since sunrise swimmers have been flocking to Charlton: all 1,000 slots sold out as people look for some respite from the high temperatures brought about by the arrival of the Spanish plume. Picnickers have set up camp beside this Olympic-sized swimming pool as the trees surrounding the pool gently sway in the breeze. A number of fair-weather swimmers have visited throughout the day, much to the chagrin of some regulars who are not used to sharing with crowds, especially during those long, cold winter months. If you're heading out to make the most of the summer sunshine today, spare a thought for some of our hairy-coated friends. As the temperature rises, it's not just us humans that need to keep cool. At the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon, the animals are being looked after with specially made ice lollies - the perfect way to cool down in the heat. The sanctuary's Simon Horn says: ""The ice
blocks are made from fruit and vegetables in water. ""They not only provide a
welcome treat during the sizzling temperatures, but they also provide a
valuable form of enrichment. ""Donkeys love exploring, and this activity allows
them to exhibit their natural foraging behaviours - a key factor in improving
donkey welfare."" It is officially the hottest day of the year in the UK for the third day in a row. Heathrow in west London recorded 32.4C (90F) this afternoon andtemperatures could climb furtherto 34C in parts of the South East. Today's record temperature surpassed the previous day's high of 29.5C (85.1F) recorded at Northolt in west London. The Met Office also predicts it could be the ""hottest Royal Ascot on record"" at the Berkshire racecourse. In Santon Downham, Suffolk, temperatures reached 31.1C, and Wisley, Surrey, recorded 30.4C. But the picture changes further north, with the Met Office pointing out a marked difference in temperatures, with Glasgow recording 13.7C just after midday. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter While parts of South East England will have another very warm to hot day on Saturday, elsewhere in England and Wales things will feel very different as temperatures drop significantly. For example, Leeds will fall from a high near 27C today to just 16C tomorrow. This photo of a tranquil spot in Leeds was taken a short while ago by BBC Weather Watcher Martin King. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Livestock cool off in a pond to beat the heat in Pakistan where temperatures reached 40C last month If youâre in
the southern half of the UK youâll certainly be feeling the heat - but spare a
thought for Spain and France, they are experiencing a punishing heatwave. This week
France saw temperatures hit 40C - the earliest in the year than ever before. Spain is
enduring its second heatwave this year and there are warnings it could reach
43C in the next couple of days. That did not used to happen until July or
August. It is this
type of intense heat that scientists warn will become more common as global
warming heats the planet. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the 19th century and temperatures continue to rise. The last seven years have been
the hottest years ever recorded and, if no action is taken to curb climate
change, scientists warn a rise of 4C is possible. In the US
now, more than 100 million people are being warned to stay indoors as scorching
temperatures settle over large parts of the country. India and
Pakistan suffered even more brutal heat last month with temperatures in
Pakistan reaching 50C while the Indian capital, New Delhi, hit 49.2C â
an all-time high. While periods
of hot weather have always occurred naturally, the increased intensity and
frequency of extreme heat now is a warning bell for the impacts ofclimate change. To place the current hot weather in context, we've drawn up a map of some peak temperatures hit around the UK - both in the month of June and overall. Some historical high points for thermometers include the hottest temperature recorded in June, when Southampton peaked at 35.6C in 1976. In more recent times, Cambridge experienced a sweltering 38.7C in July 2019, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

In the words of Billy Idol, it's hot in the city. In the words of The Clash, London's burning. In the words of Glen Frey, the heat is on. A high of 34C (93.2F) is expected in the capital on Friday. So are Londoners coping with the heatwave - or is it too hot to handle? Before the inevitable rainclouds return to empty over our optimistic barbecues - we take a look at some ""snaps-hots"" from around the city.

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council says it expects tens of thousands of visitors over the next few days to head to the seaside to enjoy the heat and sunshine. Beachgoers flocked to the resort town on the south coast of England when the first Covid-19 lockdown was eased in June 2020, which led to the councildeclaring a major incident. Since the incident, the council has developed a freebeach check appshowing people which areas are crowded, gives the location of public toilets and lifeguards, and says which areas dogs can use. Security cameras, a hub for emergency services and more rangers have also since been brought in. Read morehere. If the hot weather is becoming oppressive, there are some basic principles to help stop it becoming too much. During the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out and close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out. Open all the windows before you go to bed to get a through breeze. Using even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather as it encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. If you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. Alternatively, cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body, so try chilling your socks in the fridge before wearing. And of course, keep hydrated. A Level 3 heat-health alert has been issued for London, the east of England and the south-east to help protect health services, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says. The alert, called 'heatwave action', is to help protect the NHS and to inform its partners that they should prepare their services for possible increases in demand due to increases in temperatures, Agostinho Sousa of the UKHSA tells BBC Breakfast. âWe also have a Level 2 that is currently active in the South West and East of England that is to inform our partners that they should prepare their services in case they need to enter into action in case we see an increase in temperatures. âRight now the situation is stable, and we expect the temperatures to drop tomorrow.â Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals can cause muscle cramps and shock due to cold water temperatures, the fire service says People have been warnednot to swim in open water as temperatures soar. Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals could cause muscle cramps and shock as the water often remained cold even in heatwaves, says Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Fresh water could be polluted and cause serious illness, it said. People who fall into water by accident should lean back, extend their legs and arms, and use slow, gentle movements to stay afloat. Once you have controlled your breathing, attempt to swim to safety and call for help, the service adds. Anyone seeing a person or animal in trouble around water was asked to phone 999. If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's the latest on the extreme weather hitting parts of the UK and Europe: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37.5C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave. But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it. You can read more by James on the dangers of heat and what to do about themhere. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter At midday, the temperature at Heathrow Airport was 30.3C, which is the highest for England and the UK so far this year. Wales has also recorded its highest temperature so far - 26.7C at Cardiff Bute Park. This heatwave has been building across western Europe - last weekSpainsaw temperatures above 40C - and now that heat has started to move
northwards. Spain is used to heatwaves â just not this
early in the summer season and certainly not this hot. And with the high temperatures come the inevitable
wildfires. InItaly, the soaring
heat is leading to growing concerns about water shortages. As we reported earlier, large stretches of the countryâs largest river, the Po, the
water is so low that locals can walk through the middle of the expanse of sand -
and wartime shipwrecks are even resurfacing. Across thePyrenees, straddling the border
of France and Spain, outdoor public events are being banned from tomorrow until
the end of the heatwave. Teachers in the region are watering
playgrounds in order to prevent pupils getting heatstroke in the extreme heat. Portugalsaw its hottest May since 1931, and yesterdayFrance recorded a temperature of over 40C - the earliest hot spell ever to hit the country. And French officials say the peak of the heatwave is yet to be reached. The hot zone is expected to move intocentral Europe, ItalytheAlpine countriesand the south ofGermany. The peak of the heatwave in theUKarrives today acrossEnglandandWales, with temperatures set to reach 33C. But inScotlandandNorthern Ireland, temperatures are expected to peak at a more comfortable 23C Across the whole of the UK, cooler and fresher conditions are expected over the weekend Scientists warn that as global temperatures rise over time heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent, more intense and longer lasting - and their impact more widespread.

How are Britons coping with the soaring cost of living?,"Inflation in the UK is expected to top 11% this year as energy, food and fuel prices soar We've been finding out how people are coping with rising prices, and our personal finance correspondent has been answering your questions The BBC's Kevin Peachey has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade The rising cost of living is being blamed on economies rebounding after the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and pressures on supply chains The AA says petrol prices in the UK his a new record yesterday, with a litre of unleaded reaching 187.51p A BBC survey of 4,011 people suggests 8 in 10 people are worried about the cost of living, and more than half said they had skipped meals to save money Two-thirds of those surveyed suggested government support provided so far was insufficient Jen Meierhans, Andrew Humphrey and Rob Corp That's all for our Q&A on the cost of living for today. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions and shared how rising prices have been affecting your lives. Thanks also, of course, to our personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey, for providing plenty of really useful of answers. We're going to wrap up this live coverage shortly but you canread more about the rising cost of living, and what support you can get here. We're nearly at the end of today's live coverage on the cost of living. Here's a recap on what we know:  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Christine asks if her mother, who is 93 and receives a state pension, Pension Credit and Attendance Allowance, will get any payments to help pay for her care home costs? First things first, not everyone is as organised as Christine and her mum. An estimated 850,000 pensioner households fail to claim pension credit â which tops up the income of those who donât have much money coming in, and is a gateway to other payments. Moving into a care home can affect your benefit entitlement. In this case, the receipt of Pension Credit should mean an entitlement to the Â£650 cost of living payment for those on means-tested benefits. People on Attendance Allowance should also qualify for an extra Â£150 paid to people with disabilities in September. We have aguideon how this works. These payments are designed to help with energy bills but, in practice, can be spent as you wish. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Sketchley is a pensioner living in Spain and wants to know if UK citizens who have retired abroad will receive the Â£300 payment to pensioners? The Â£300 referred to here by Simon is a top-up to the Winter Fuel Payment paid in November or December to pensioner households. People living in Spain are not eligible for either â because of the higher winter temperatures. The same is true for those living in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta and Portugal. Those living in other parts of Europe may be entitled to it though. Thegovernment website,externaloutlines eligibility. Fuengirola beach in the Costa del Sol Matthew Homes worked for a financial services company before being made redundant at the beginning of June and says he feels his family have been overlooked by the government. The 22-year-old and his wife, who came to the UK from Ukraine last summer, have a six-month-old baby and say they have been struggling financially since her birth. ""Weâre seeing our budget squeezed day-to-day. With the baby we have seen how the formula and purees have gone up and baby wipes and nappies have gone up. I used to get them on Amazon but now itâs like a treasure hunt for cheaper options. ""Weâre not in a position to pay for our daughter to go to nursery and we donât get help with that."" Matthew says they fall into a ""certain group of people who havenât been considered"" and believes that government help in general came too late. ""Weâre cut out from accessing any financial support from our governmentâ¦ itâs for people on some kind of benefits but that doesnât include us. ""My daughter hasnât been able to see her grandparents because we canât afford to go."" Jeff Cottrell asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Jeff, it appears, is one of many people who pay their energy bill to a landlord or park owner, rather than directly to an energy supplier. It is fair to say that some of these details are yet to be fully ironed out, ahead of the discount paid from October. In fact, they are part of a government consultation. Concerns have been raised, for example, that some landlords may not pass on the full discount to private renters. In time, organisations such as Citizens Advice could offer help and advice, once the policy is finalised. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Peter Scouse, 68, from London, says with things like milk increasing from Â£1 to Â£1.35, petrol from Â£1.20 to Â£1.90 and gas up by more than 50%, his personal rate of inflation is about 30% not the 9% quoted in the news. Peter raises an important point, which is that there is an official rate of inflation â calculated by the Office for National Statistics, based on a typical âbasketâ of goods and services. There is also an individualâs own personal inflation rate. For example, if you drive a lot, or spend much of your time in a poorly insulated home, then you may well have been hit harder than others by recent price rises. There is an expectation for pensioners like Peter that, owing to the way the uprating of benefits is calculated, the state pension looks set for a double-digit increase next April â although that probably still feels a long way away. Paul and Amanda both work so haven't had to watch what they're spending before. ""Now we're doing it on a daily basis,"" says Paul. They do still get takeaways and go out for meals, but not as often and now they order a jug of tap water to keep the bill down. At the supermarket, instead of buying branded products like they used to, they are looking at own-brand items, and are looking for deals. ""We have to look at: What do we really want? What do we really need? Do we really need that luxury? Do we really need those sweets?"" Find out three of the main ways people are changing their spending habitshere. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Michelle Massetti is worried about her son who is a university student. His maintenance loan doesnât cover his Â£6000 a year rent. The rising cost of living is affecting all sorts of people across all walks of life. Students are no strangers to new debt, and â of course â they are seeing rising prices too when it comes to eating and heating. If they are in a student house, they should expect to see their gas and electricity bill rise this winter. However, the government is taking some of the sting out of that increase with a Â£400 discount on everyoneâs domestic energy bill from October. One striking finding in our survey is that 83% of young adults asked, who said they were worried about the rising cost of living, said it was having an impact on their mental health. Haizea Cacho asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent As Haizea is all too aware, maternity leave can mean a drop in your income, just as you face a host of new baby-related expenses. There is support at any time for those who are pregnant or who have just had a baby. For example, you can get free dental care across the UK. There are a host of other benefits and grants that may be claimed for those on low incomes. They can vary in different parts of the UK. This guide,externalfrom the independent MoneyHelper website should help. As well as sending in questions for Kevin, BBC News readers have been getting in touch with their experiences of the rising cost of living. Fiona Stevenson, from Lingdale, worked as a teacher for 27 years until leaving last October due to ill health. Sheâs set to claim her occupational pension in December and relies on her husbandâs part-time job as a school technician. Fiona is also able to make some money through her hobby of crafting. They are owner-occupiers of their home but are finding it hard to make ends meet. ""Not only are costs of all goods and food rising rapidly but fuel costs are now out of control and plans for summer camping trips have had to be cancelled due to the cost of diesel,"" she says. ""We do not even have our lights on in the evening and are dreading the winter months,"" she says. ""The government must step in and reduce the costs for the people they represent. Cut VAT on fuel, increase benefits and provide windfall payments to businesses and households."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent David Wellbelove asks why, when you buy a loaf of bread in a supermarket anywhere in the UK the price is roughly the same, is fuel different? Actually, prices for many goods and services do differ by location - it is just that the huge signs on petrol forecourts make it more obvious. It is less well known, for example, that your domestic energy bill will vary depending on where you live in the country. On vehicle fuel specifically, local prices are influenced by location and competition. If the petrol station is close to storage and convenient for deliveries, then the price will tend to be lower. Drivers also generally pay less in areas where local supermarkets are competing on price. But, as itnow costs more than Â£100 to fill the tank of a family car, it is no surprise our survey suggests people have decided to take fewer journeys to save money. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Rhonda Cowland asks what to do if you were unaware you might be entitled to the cost of living payment. The good news for you Rhonda is that much of this support is automatically paid to those who are eligible, without the need to claim. Without exactly knowing your situation, it is hard to answer your question directly. However, there is one deadline to be aware of, particularly if you are newly-unemployed. Only those who are entitled to and received their first Universal Credit payment by 25 May will be eligible for the first Â£326 instalment of support for those on means-tested benefits. The second will be paid later in the year. Amanda Leeds asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent There are different payments for different groups of people - and so eligibility does vary. However, it is important to say that they will pretty much all be made automatically. That assumes people have claimed the benefits to which they are entitled, because without claiming those, you could miss out on the extra payments. For example, those on means-tested benefits will receive their first cost of living payment automatically into their bank, building society or credit union account by the end of July. We have aguideand there is also sometechnical guidance,externalfrom the Treasury. It's time now for our personal finance correspondent to join us and answer some of your questions about rising prices and what help is available. We'll be putting your questions to the BBCâs Kevin Peachey. He has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected there's a form at the bottom ofthis story. Sabrina Omar, 20, has emailed us to say she thinks the government should do more to help students struggling with the cost of living crisis. The second year diagnostic radiography student at the University of Hertfordshire says living away from home makes things difficult. ""Just with the
basic stuff like food and bills the costs are going up and up and we donât get
any extra student loan or extra help from anywhere else,"" she says. Her fuel reimbursement for travelling to her placement is 28p a mile and with thecost of filling the average tankmore than Â£100 it's ""not making much of a difference"", she says. âAnything that the government can do to help... I
would offer the same support that they are offering other households or just
some sort of support specifically for students. ""Even with a part-time job Iâm struggling because thereâs only
so many hours I can do,"" she says. ""I have been thinking
about the possibility of commuting in next year just to find the cheapest way possible to complete my
course, itâs really made me evaluate everything.â Back to theBBC's cost of living survey, and perhaps unsurprisingly more than 80% of working adults said they thought their wages should match the increase in inflation. Though when it came to asking directly for pay rises, just over half said they would be requesting more money, and only 35% told the survey that they would be demanding 9% or more. Expectations of pay matching inflation seems to be low, with nearly half of those responding to the BBC saying their financial outlook would get worse in the second half of the year. We'll be joined at 13:00 BST by the BBCâs personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey to answer some of your questions about the cost of living crisis. Kevin has been reporting on the UKâs ability to spend, budget and save for well over a decade. If you have a question or want to share how you are being affected, click the 'Get Involved' button at the top of this page or email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Let's go back to the BBC's survey of how people across the UK are experiencing the rising cost of living. As we've previously mentioned, pollsters Savanta questioned 4,011 people at the beginning of this month. They were asked about aseries of paymentsannounced by the government aimed at taking the sting out of rising household costs. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said the support was insufficient. Just 24% of people who responded to the BBC thought the package of payments was enough to help people with the rising cost of living. When asked how long government support should last 64% of people said help should be available ""as long as necessary"". Our colleagues atRadio 5 Livehave been visiting the New Parks area of Leicester since the cost of living crisis began. Donna runs a food bank in the area and says ""more and more people"" are coming for help, but she and her partner are struggling to keep it open. ""We're having to cut down on our voluntary work in the community because we can't afford the petrol, we need it ourselves for the shopping,"" she says. ""I personally do 300 miles a week, so that's not feasible any more... I can't afford to help the community and it makes me feel really bad.""My family comes before anyone else and as much as I want to help somebody, it's coming to a time where I can't."" Shaun is a dad to three young boys. He says a lack of money is causing arguments in his house. ""[The kids] don't understand that once you've paid your bills, there's nothing extra to play with,"" he says. ""We as a family go out probably once a month because that's all we can do... they don't understand it and it's hard, but once they're older I suppose they'll understand."" Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveEU to announce decision on Ukraine's candidacy5 minutes ago5 minutes ago Will Ukraine get candidate status?Will Ukraine get candidate status?9 minutes ago Welcome to our live coverageWelcome to our live coverageLive EU to announce decision on Ukraine's candidacy  5 minutes ago,"Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a ""front-line city,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the conflict could last for years In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Stoltenberg adds that the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the Donbas region Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the Sunday Times that ""we need to steel ourselves for a long war"" Ukrainian authorities say their air defence systems in the Kyiv Region shot down a Russian âair objectâ on Sunday morning Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre, but no casualties were reported Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now wrapping up our day of live coverage of events in Ukraine. This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it.

This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

William and Kate - who have not attended the Berkshire meet for a number of years - arrived in the traditional royal carriage procession to cheers from the crowds. The Queen has not made an appearance today with other members of the Royal Family. Thanks to the soaring temperatures, the event's organisers earlier announced that the strict dress code would not be enforced in all enclosures. Punters have been reminded to stay cool and a message broadcast on the public address system said: ""Please drink plenty of water all afternoon and keep hydrated.""

Concerts and large public gatherings have been called off in the Gironde department around Bordeaux. Yesterday, parts of France hit 40C earlier in the year than usual, with temperatures expected to peak tomorrow. Scientists say periods of intense heat are becoming more frequent and longer lasting as a result of global warming. In Gironde, officials said public events, including some of the official 18 June Resistance celebrations, will be prohibited from Friday at 14:00 (12:00 GMT) ""until the end of the heat wave"". Indoor events at venues without air conditioning are also banned. The weather has been kind for festival-goers on the Isle of Wight, with no wellies needed. Organisers havewarned people at the Isle of Wight Festival to stay safeduring the heat and recommended they take precautions - including avoiding excess alcohol consumption. As a result of the soaring temperatures suncream is the order of the day - and the only shelter being sought is to get out of the sun. This video can not be played Isle of Wight Festival: Hot weather warnings for revellers Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter Hot days are often followed by very warm nights. If the overnight temperature doesnât drop below 20C then thatâs defined as a tropical night and thereâs a chance of that somewhere in south-east England tonight.What is a tropical night? Harry LowBBC London News Itâs hotting up here at this lido as the sunbathers soak up the sunshine in south-east London. Since sunrise swimmers have been flocking to Charlton: all 1,000 slots sold out as people look for some respite from the high temperatures brought about by the arrival of the Spanish plume. Picnickers have set up camp beside this Olympic-sized swimming pool as the trees surrounding the pool gently sway in the breeze. A number of fair-weather swimmers have visited throughout the day, much to the chagrin of some regulars who are not used to sharing with crowds, especially during those long, cold winter months. If you're heading out to make the most of the summer sunshine today, spare a thought for some of our hairy-coated friends. As the temperature rises, it's not just us humans that need to keep cool. At the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon, the animals are being looked after with specially made ice lollies - the perfect way to cool down in the heat. The sanctuary's Simon Horn says: ""The ice
blocks are made from fruit and vegetables in water. ""They not only provide a
welcome treat during the sizzling temperatures, but they also provide a
valuable form of enrichment. ""Donkeys love exploring, and this activity allows
them to exhibit their natural foraging behaviours - a key factor in improving
donkey welfare."" It is officially the hottest day of the year in the UK for the third day in a row. Heathrow in west London recorded 32.4C (90F) this afternoon andtemperatures could climb furtherto 34C in parts of the South East. Today's record temperature surpassed the previous day's high of 29.5C (85.1F) recorded at Northolt in west London. The Met Office also predicts it could be the ""hottest Royal Ascot on record"" at the Berkshire racecourse. In Santon Downham, Suffolk, temperatures reached 31.1C, and Wisley, Surrey, recorded 30.4C. But the picture changes further north, with the Met Office pointing out a marked difference in temperatures, with Glasgow recording 13.7C just after midday. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter While parts of South East England will have another very warm to hot day on Saturday, elsewhere in England and Wales things will feel very different as temperatures drop significantly. For example, Leeds will fall from a high near 27C today to just 16C tomorrow. This photo of a tranquil spot in Leeds was taken a short while ago by BBC Weather Watcher Martin King. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Livestock cool off in a pond to beat the heat in Pakistan where temperatures reached 40C last month If youâre in
the southern half of the UK youâll certainly be feeling the heat - but spare a
thought for Spain and France, they are experiencing a punishing heatwave. This week
France saw temperatures hit 40C - the earliest in the year than ever before. Spain is
enduring its second heatwave this year and there are warnings it could reach
43C in the next couple of days. That did not used to happen until July or
August. It is this
type of intense heat that scientists warn will become more common as global
warming heats the planet. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the 19th century and temperatures continue to rise. The last seven years have been
the hottest years ever recorded and, if no action is taken to curb climate
change, scientists warn a rise of 4C is possible. In the US
now, more than 100 million people are being warned to stay indoors as scorching
temperatures settle over large parts of the country. India and
Pakistan suffered even more brutal heat last month with temperatures in
Pakistan reaching 50C while the Indian capital, New Delhi, hit 49.2C â
an all-time high. While periods
of hot weather have always occurred naturally, the increased intensity and
frequency of extreme heat now is a warning bell for the impacts ofclimate change. To place the current hot weather in context, we've drawn up a map of some peak temperatures hit around the UK - both in the month of June and overall. Some historical high points for thermometers include the hottest temperature recorded in June, when Southampton peaked at 35.6C in 1976. In more recent times, Cambridge experienced a sweltering 38.7C in July 2019, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

In the words of Billy Idol, it's hot in the city. In the words of The Clash, London's burning. In the words of Glen Frey, the heat is on. A high of 34C (93.2F) is expected in the capital on Friday. So are Londoners coping with the heatwave - or is it too hot to handle? Before the inevitable rainclouds return to empty over our optimistic barbecues - we take a look at some ""snaps-hots"" from around the city. Ladies take to the cooling waters at Parliament Hill Lido It's hot hot hot in Trafalgar Square They can't be British - neither appears to have brought a jacket ""just in case"" A hydrofoil rider takes off at Royal Docks in east London The new incarnation of Mary Poppins prepares to take off at London Fields Lido in Hackney Don't just carry it.

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council says it expects tens of thousands of visitors over the next few days to head to the seaside to enjoy the heat and sunshine. Beachgoers flocked to the resort town on the south coast of England when the first Covid-19 lockdown was eased in June 2020, which led to the councildeclaring a major incident. Since the incident, the council has developed a freebeach check appshowing people which areas are crowded, gives the location of public toilets and lifeguards, and says which areas dogs can use. Security cameras, a hub for emergency services and more rangers have also since been brought in. Read morehere. If the hot weather is becoming oppressive, there are some basic principles to help stop it becoming too much. During the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out and close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out. Open all the windows before you go to bed to get a through breeze. Using even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather as it encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. If you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. Alternatively, cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body, so try chilling your socks in the fridge before wearing. And of course, keep hydrated. A Level 3 heat-health alert has been issued for London, the east of England and the south-east to help protect health services, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says. The alert, called 'heatwave action', is to help protect the NHS and to inform its partners that they should prepare their services for possible increases in demand due to increases in temperatures, Agostinho Sousa of the UKHSA tells BBC Breakfast. âWe also have a Level 2 that is currently active in the South West and East of England that is to inform our partners that they should prepare their services in case they need to enter into action in case we see an increase in temperatures. âRight now the situation is stable, and we expect the temperatures to drop tomorrow.â Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals can cause muscle cramps and shock due to cold water temperatures, the fire service says People have been warnednot to swim in open water as temperatures soar. Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals could cause muscle cramps and shock as the water often remained cold even in heatwaves, says Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Fresh water could be polluted and cause serious illness, it said. People who fall into water by accident should lean back, extend their legs and arms, and use slow, gentle movements to stay afloat. Once you have controlled your breathing, attempt to swim to safety and call for help, the service adds. Anyone seeing a person or animal in trouble around water was asked to phone 999. If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's the latest on the extreme weather hitting parts of the UK and Europe: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37.5C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave. But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it. You can read more by James on the dangers of heat and what to do about themhere. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter At midday, the temperature at Heathrow Airport was 30.3C, which is the highest for England and the UK so far this year. Wales has also recorded its highest temperature so far - 26.7C at Cardiff Bute Park. This heatwave has been building across western Europe - last weekSpainsaw temperatures above 40C - and now that heat has started to move
northwards. Spain is used to heatwaves â just not this
early in the summer season and certainly not this hot. And with the high temperatures come the inevitable
wildfires. InItaly, the soaring
heat is leading to growing concerns about water shortages. As we reported earlier, large stretches of the countryâs largest river, the Po, the
water is so low that locals can walk through the middle of the expanse of sand -
and wartime shipwrecks are even resurfacing. Across thePyrenees, straddling the border
of France and Spain, outdoor public events are being banned from tomorrow until
the end of the heatwave. Teachers in the region are watering
playgrounds in order to prevent pupils getting heatstroke in the extreme heat. Portugalsaw its hottest May since 1931, and yesterdayFrance recorded a temperature of over 40C - the earliest hot spell ever to hit the country. And French officials say the peak of the heatwave is yet to be reached. The hot zone is expected to move intocentral Europe, ItalytheAlpine countriesand the south ofGermany. The peak of the heatwave in theUKarrives today acrossEnglandandWales, with temperatures set to reach 33C. But inScotlandandNorthern Ireland, temperatures are expected to peak at a more comfortable 23C Across the whole of the UK, cooler and fresher conditions are expected over the weekend Scientists warn that as global temperatures rise over time heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent, more intense and longer lasting - and their impact more widespread.

In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

England appoints tsar to shake up women's healthThe aim of the role for England is to help tackle decades of health inequalities.,"Dame Lesley has 42 years' experience working in women's health England's first women's health ambassador is calling for ""one-stop shops"" where women can sort out their health needs. Dame Lesley Regan, also a practising doctor, wants to make it easier for women and girls to access care such as contraception and smear tests in the community. Her new role aims to close the ""gender health gap"". She will also support the upcoming government-ledwomen's-health strategy,external. One priority for the government is to improve access to hormone-replacement therapy amidst ongoing shortages across the UK. It recently appointed aHRT Tsar, Madelaine McTernan, to help address this. Waits for gynaecology appointments are also an issue and have risenby 60% during the pandemic- more sharply than any other specialty. Dame Lesley told BBC News: ""At the moment, we waste a lot of resource in telling girls and women that they cannot have things. ""So you might go off to your doctor or gynaecologist or heart specialist and get told, well, you cannot have a smear here, even if it is due, or you need to go somewhere else for this, that and the other. ""We should make it very, very easy for people to access this out in the community - why do you need to go to a secondary or tertiary facility for things that are very easy to provide?"" Women with endometriosis 'finally being believed' 'HRT crisis left me unable to work' England extends at-home abortion pill offer Instead, she wants health hubs where women could ""go for half a day and get all these things sorted out"" and then get on with their lives. ""A one-stop shop is what I want for myself and what I want for my daughters and I'm sure it is what every other girl and woman wants and what every man and boy wants for the women in their lives, to be looked after that way,"" Dame Lesley said. But it would be unreasonable to expect every GP practice to become a women's health hub. Dame Lesley also told BBC News more investment in the midwifery and obstetric workforce was needed. With 42 years' experience working in women's health, she: is currently professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, at Imperial College London was previously president of the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has conducted research on recurrent miscarriages and fibroids has a particular interest in period problems and the menopause Dame Lesley says one area she would like to address is improving the representation of women in drug trials. Many trials for new medicines are based on men. Her work may also focus on improving diagnoses for women with heart disease. Women's symptoms can sometimes be different to the ones men experience and their conditions may go unrecognised. Minister for women's health Maria Caulfield said there was no quick fix to eradicate the gender health gap. ""Since we launched our women's health call for evidence over a year ago, we have made great progress in raising the profile of women's health,"" she said. ""From the formation of the UK-wide menopause taskforce and publication of our vision document, to legislating to ban hymenoplasty and virginity testing and appointing a chair of the HRT [hormone-replacement therapy] taskforce to help more menopausal women access this lifeline medication."" The aims of the women's health strategy include ensuring: all women feel comfortable talking about their health and no longer face taboos all women feel supported in the workplace and can reach their full potential at work better representation in research trials Women to be asked about 'gender health gap' 'HRT crisis left me unable to work' England extends at-home abortion pill offer Women's Health Strategy- Call for Evidence - GOV.UK Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over UK economy at PMQs What happens if TikTok is banned?

William and Kate - who have not attended the Berkshire meet for a number of years - arrived in the traditional royal carriage procession to cheers from the crowds. The Queen has not made an appearance today with other members of the Royal Family. Thanks to the soaring temperatures, the event's organisers earlier announced that the strict dress code would not be enforced in all enclosures. Punters have been reminded to stay cool and a message broadcast on the public address system said: ""Please drink plenty of water all afternoon and keep hydrated."" Race-goers shelter from the sun's rays under parasols Carrie Johnson, wife of the PM, made an appearance dressed in white Punters enjoy a picnic - complete with tablecloth - under a bit of shade Racing fans with fans If all else fails, a large hat provides a bit of shade Outdoor public events have beenbanned in an area of France as a record-breaking heatwavesweeps across Europe. Concerts and large public gatherings have been called off in the Gironde department around Bordeaux. Yesterday, parts of France hit 40C earlier in the year than usual, with temperatures expected to peak tomorrow. Scientists say periods of intense heat are becoming more frequent and longer lasting as a result of global warming. In Gironde, officials said public events, including some of the official 18 June Resistance celebrations, will be prohibited from Friday at 14:00 (12:00 GMT) ""until the end of the heat wave"". Indoor events at venues without air conditioning are also banned. The weather has been kind for festival-goers on the Isle of Wight, with no wellies needed. Organisers havewarned people at the Isle of Wight Festival to stay safeduring the heat and recommended they take precautions - including avoiding excess alcohol consumption. As a result of the soaring temperatures suncream is the order of the day - and the only shelter being sought is to get out of the sun. This video can not be played Isle of Wight Festival: Hot weather warnings for revellers Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter Hot days are often followed by very warm nights. If the overnight temperature doesnât drop below 20C then thatâs defined as a tropical night and thereâs a chance of that somewhere in south-east England tonight.What is a tropical night? Harry LowBBC London News Itâs hotting up here at this lido as the sunbathers soak up the sunshine in south-east London. Since sunrise swimmers have been flocking to Charlton: all 1,000 slots sold out as people look for some respite from the high temperatures brought about by the arrival of the Spanish plume. Picnickers have set up camp beside this Olympic-sized swimming pool as the trees surrounding the pool gently sway in the breeze. A number of fair-weather swimmers have visited throughout the day, much to the chagrin of some regulars who are not used to sharing with crowds, especially during those long, cold winter months. If you're heading out to make the most of the summer sunshine today, spare a thought for some of our hairy-coated friends. As the temperature rises, it's not just us humans that need to keep cool. At the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon, the animals are being looked after with specially made ice lollies - the perfect way to cool down in the heat. The sanctuary's Simon Horn says: ""The ice
blocks are made from fruit and vegetables in water. ""They not only provide a
welcome treat during the sizzling temperatures, but they also provide a
valuable form of enrichment. ""Donkeys love exploring, and this activity allows
them to exhibit their natural foraging behaviours - a key factor in improving
donkey welfare."" It is officially the hottest day of the year in the UK for the third day in a row. Heathrow in west London recorded 32.4C (90F) this afternoon andtemperatures could climb furtherto 34C in parts of the South East. Today's record temperature surpassed the previous day's high of 29.5C (85.1F) recorded at Northolt in west London. The Met Office also predicts it could be the ""hottest Royal Ascot on record"" at the Berkshire racecourse. In Santon Downham, Suffolk, temperatures reached 31.1C, and Wisley, Surrey, recorded 30.4C. But the picture changes further north, with the Met Office pointing out a marked difference in temperatures, with Glasgow recording 13.7C just after midday. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter While parts of South East England will have another very warm to hot day on Saturday, elsewhere in England and Wales things will feel very different as temperatures drop significantly. For example, Leeds will fall from a high near 27C today to just 16C tomorrow. This photo of a tranquil spot in Leeds was taken a short while ago by BBC Weather Watcher Martin King. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Livestock cool off in a pond to beat the heat in Pakistan where temperatures reached 40C last month If youâre in
the southern half of the UK youâll certainly be feeling the heat - but spare a
thought for Spain and France, they are experiencing a punishing heatwave. This week
France saw temperatures hit 40C - the earliest in the year than ever before. Spain is
enduring its second heatwave this year and there are warnings it could reach
43C in the next couple of days. That did not used to happen until July or
August. It is this
type of intense heat that scientists warn will become more common as global
warming heats the planet. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the 19th century and temperatures continue to rise. The last seven years have been
the hottest years ever recorded and, if no action is taken to curb climate
change, scientists warn a rise of 4C is possible. In the US
now, more than 100 million people are being warned to stay indoors as scorching
temperatures settle over large parts of the country. India and
Pakistan suffered even more brutal heat last month with temperatures in
Pakistan reaching 50C while the Indian capital, New Delhi, hit 49.2C â
an all-time high. While periods
of hot weather have always occurred naturally, the increased intensity and
frequency of extreme heat now is a warning bell for the impacts ofclimate change. To place the current hot weather in context, we've drawn up a map of some peak temperatures hit around the UK - both in the month of June and overall. Some historical high points for thermometers include the hottest temperature recorded in June, when Southampton peaked at 35.6C in 1976. In more recent times, Cambridge experienced a sweltering 38.7C in July 2019, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

In the words of Billy Idol, it's hot in the city. In the words of The Clash, London's burning. In the words of Glen Frey, the heat is on. A high of 34C (93.2F) is expected in the capital on Friday. So are Londoners coping with the heatwave - or is it too hot to handle? Before the inevitable rainclouds return to empty over our optimistic barbecues - we take a look at some ""snaps-hots"" from around the city. Ladies take to the cooling waters at Parliament Hill Lido It's hot hot hot in Trafalgar Square They can't be British - neither appears to have brought a jacket ""just in case"" A hydrofoil rider takes off at Royal Docks in east London The new incarnation of Mary Poppins prepares to take off at London Fields Lido in Hackney Don't just carry it. Drink it Bournemouth's beaches are ready for an expected influx of thousands of visitors over the weekend, the local council says. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council says it expects tens of thousands of visitors over the next few days to head to the seaside to enjoy the heat and sunshine. Beachgoers flocked to the resort town on the south coast of England when the first Covid-19 lockdown was eased in June 2020, which led to the councildeclaring a major incident. Since the incident, the council has developed a freebeach check appshowing people which areas are crowded, gives the location of public toilets and lifeguards, and says which areas dogs can use. Security cameras, a hub for emergency services and more rangers have also since been brought in. Read morehere. If the hot weather is becoming oppressive, there are some basic principles to help stop it becoming too much. During the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out and close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out. Open all the windows before you go to bed to get a through breeze. Using even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather as it encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. If you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. Alternatively, cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body, so try chilling your socks in the fridge before wearing. And of course, keep hydrated. A Level 3 heat-health alert has been issued for London, the east of England and the south-east to help protect health services, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says. The alert, called 'heatwave action', is to help protect the NHS and to inform its partners that they should prepare their services for possible increases in demand due to increases in temperatures, Agostinho Sousa of the UKHSA tells BBC Breakfast. âWe also have a Level 2 that is currently active in the South West and East of England that is to inform our partners that they should prepare their services in case they need to enter into action in case we see an increase in temperatures. âRight now the situation is stable, and we expect the temperatures to drop tomorrow.â Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals can cause muscle cramps and shock due to cold water temperatures, the fire service says People have been warnednot to swim in open water as temperatures soar. Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals could cause muscle cramps and shock as the water often remained cold even in heatwaves, says Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Fresh water could be polluted and cause serious illness, it said. People who fall into water by accident should lean back, extend their legs and arms, and use slow, gentle movements to stay afloat. Once you have controlled your breathing, attempt to swim to safety and call for help, the service adds. Anyone seeing a person or animal in trouble around water was asked to phone 999. If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's the latest on the extreme weather hitting parts of the UK and Europe: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37.5C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave. But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it. You can read more by James on the dangers of heat and what to do about themhere. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter At midday, the temperature at Heathrow Airport was 30.3C, which is the highest for England and the UK so far this year. Wales has also recorded its highest temperature so far - 26.7C at Cardiff Bute Park. This heatwave has been building across western Europe - last weekSpainsaw temperatures above 40C - and now that heat has started to move
northwards. Spain is used to heatwaves â just not this
early in the summer season and certainly not this hot. And with the high temperatures come the inevitable
wildfires. InItaly, the soaring
heat is leading to growing concerns about water shortages. As we reported earlier, large stretches of the countryâs largest river, the Po, the
water is so low that locals can walk through the middle of the expanse of sand -
and wartime shipwrecks are even resurfacing. Across thePyrenees, straddling the border
of France and Spain, outdoor public events are being banned from tomorrow until
the end of the heatwave. Teachers in the region are watering
playgrounds in order to prevent pupils getting heatstroke in the extreme heat. Portugalsaw its hottest May since 1931, and yesterdayFrance recorded a temperature of over 40C - the earliest hot spell ever to hit the country. And French officials say the peak of the heatwave is yet to be reached. The hot zone is expected to move intocentral Europe, ItalytheAlpine countriesand the south ofGermany. The peak of the heatwave in theUKarrives today acrossEnglandandWales, with temperatures set to reach 33C. But inScotlandandNorthern Ireland, temperatures are expected to peak at a more comfortable 23C Across the whole of the UK, cooler and fresher conditions are expected over the weekend Scientists warn that as global temperatures rise over time heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent, more intense and longer lasting - and their impact more widespread.

"Passenger dies leaving flight at Gatwick AirportThe man, a restricted mobility passenger, left the plane and fell on an escalator, Gatwick says.Sussex","Gatwick said a formal investigation was under way A passenger with restricted mobility has died at Gatwick Airport after leaving an aircraft. Gatwick said staff were helping to disembark three passengers with restricted mobility at the time, including the man's partner. He decided to leave the EasyJet plane rather than wait for staff to return and fell while going up an escalator, an airport spokesman said. Sussex Police confirmed the 82-year-old man died at 12:50 BST on Wednesday. Gatwick cuts summer flights after staff shortages The Gatwick spokesman said the passenger made a short walk to the escalator from the runway to the Skybridge, which takes passengers to the north terminal. He said EasyJet cabin crew were closest to the man, so provided medical attention before the airport's medical staff arrived. An airline spokesman said: ""A number of our cabin crew provided medical assistance to a passenger at Gatwick Airport whilst waiting for paramedics to arrive. ""However the passenger sadly later passed away."" Details are still emerging on exactly how this tragedy occurred at Gatwick but my thoughts are with this poor passenger and his family. I know all too well the sense of immense frustration as you watch all the other passengers disembark and you are left stranded on an empty plane waiting for ground staff to retrieve your wheelchair and get you off. This is not the first time a passenger with restricted mobility has taken matters into their own hands. In August 2017, Justin Levene famously dragged himself across the floor of Luton Airport after staff were unable to retrieve his wheelchair. They had offered to strap him into an airport chair and push him through the terminal but Levene, a fitness enthusiast, declined, saying this compromised his independence. This incident is now being investigated. However, it raises more questions about the treatment of disabled passengers and those with restricted mobility. Historically their needs do not appear to have been a high priority at many British airports. Gatwick said a formal investigation was under way. It said when the aircraft arrived a member of staff was deployed from Wilson James, a company which provides assistance for passengers with restricted mobility (PRM). The staff member ""was in the process of disembarking the three PRM passengers when the incident occurred,"" it said. ""Staff shortages were not a factor in this incident. ""It is normal for one staff member to disembark three passengers who require assistance by taking them one at a time the short distance to the waiting buggy."" Wilson James said the passenger was not left waiting to disembark. In a statement the company said: ""The agent was at the gate within one minute of the aircraft parking on its stand, and the incident itself only happened 10 minutes after the aircraft landed. ""The agent who handled the passenger is very experienced, has been working in this service for a number of years and has a background working with people with complex disabilities and needs in the care sector.""

He decided to leave the EasyJet plane rather than wait for staff to return and fell while going up an escalator, an airport spokesman said. Sussex Police confirmed the 82-year-old man died at 12:50 BST on Wednesday. Gatwick cuts summer flights after staff shortages The Gatwick spokesman said the passenger made a short walk to the escalator from the runway to the Skybridge, which takes passengers to the north terminal. He said EasyJet cabin crew were closest to the man, so provided medical attention before the airport's medical staff arrived. An airline spokesman said: ""A number of our cabin crew provided medical assistance to a passenger at Gatwick Airport whilst waiting for paramedics to arrive. ""However the passenger sadly later passed away."" Details are still emerging on exactly how this tragedy occurred at Gatwick but my thoughts are with this poor passenger and his family. I know all too well the sense of immense frustration as you watch all the other passengers disembark and you are left stranded on an empty plane waiting for ground staff to retrieve your wheelchair and get you off. This is not the first time a passenger with restricted mobility has taken matters into their own hands. In August 2017, Justin Levene famously dragged himself across the floor of Luton Airport after staff were unable to retrieve his wheelchair. They had offered to strap him into an airport chair and push him through the terminal but Levene, a fitness enthusiast, declined, saying this compromised his independence. This incident is now being investigated. However, it raises more questions about the treatment of disabled passengers and those with restricted mobility. Historically their needs do not appear to have been a high priority at many British airports. Gatwick said a formal investigation was under way. It said when the aircraft arrived a member of staff was deployed from Wilson James, a company which provides assistance for passengers with restricted mobility (PRM). The staff member ""was in the process of disembarking the three PRM passengers when the incident occurred,"" it said. ""Staff shortages were not a factor in this incident. ""It is normal for one staff member to disembark three passengers who require assistance by taking them one at a time the short distance to the waiting buggy."" Wilson James said the passenger was not left waiting to disembark. In a statement the company said: ""The agent was at the gate within one minute of the aircraft parking on its stand, and the incident itself only happened 10 minutes after the aircraft landed. ""The agent who handled the passenger is very experienced, has been working in this service for a number of years and has a background working with people with complex disabilities and needs in the care sector.""

"People buying less food as prices rise, says survey","People struggling with the soaring cost of living are cutting back on food and car journeys to save money, according to a BBC-commissioned survey. More than half (56%) the 4,011 people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. The findings reveal the widespread impact of prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. Many people have cut spending on clothes and socialising. Some say their mental health has been affected. Two-thirds of those surveyed also suggested government support provided so far was insufficient. The BBC-commissioned survey of 4,011 UK adults in early June lifts a lid on how the economic climate is affecting lives and financial, physical and mental health. The cost of domestic energy, petrol, and food have all increased significantly in recent months, and the findings suggest more than eight in 10 people (81%) are worried about the rising cost of living. 'We can't just go in there and buy what we like now' Why are prices rising so quickly? Five things that are going up in price and why Why chicken is getting more and more expensive Concern has grown since the start of the year when 69% of those asked said they were worried in a similar BBC survey. In the latest results, two thirds (66%) of those with worries said this was having a negative effect on their mental health. Nearly half (45%) said their physical health had been affected. Day-to-day, individuals are making further changes to manage their budgets. The survey suggests this can be as simple as going on fewer nights out, or getting a haircut less often. For charity worker Janine Colwill, from Easington, and those she talks to, the changes have been more fundamental. ""We get together with the family every Sunday, religiously, for Sunday roast - but my family and other families are starting to grow their own vegetables,"" she said. Janine Colwill says people in her area are constantly looking for ways to save money ""Those people who may not have worried about these things before are now worrying about them constantly. ""With advances in technology, I never would have thought that people would be relying on a food bank or growing their own - and just penny-pinching,"" she said. The survey suggests people are finding various ways to manage and save their money. The findings include: Some 82% of those asked had switched off lights in the previous week to save money Trips taken in the car had been limited to varying degrees in the previous six months by 72% of those asked A large majority (84%) said they had spent less on their clothes at some point in the previous six months About half (52%) expect to work more hours in the next six months to help to pay the bills. Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, said in a trading update for the three months to 28 May that it was seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to inflation, such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. Chief executive Ken Murphy also said people are switching to cheaper own-label brands for goods including bread and pastawhich have seen prices soardue to the war between Ukraine and Russia, both of which are major wheat exporters. Prices, as measured by inflation, are rising at a rate of 9% a year, the fastest for 40 years. Interest rates, which also affect the cost of living,were increased to 1.25%on Thursday by the Bank of England - the highest they have been for 13 years. The situation is being driven, to a significant degree, by global factors such as the cost of oil, gas and food. But there are UK-specific issues which are adding to inflation such as the tight labour market. Job vacancies are at a record high of 1.3 million meaning employers face paying higher wages to fill roles. Also, the UK's dominant services sector - which includes the likes of accountancy and law firms, as well as restaurants and pubs - is seeing price rises. Drivers now have to spendÂ£103 for petrol and Â£106 for diesel to fill a family car, according to the RAC. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) has predicted food priceswill rise at a rate of 15%this summer as households pay more for staples such as bread, meat, dairy and fruit and vegetables. A typical household in England, Wales and Scotland is likely to see a rise in its annual domestic gas and electricity bill of Â£800 in October, on top of a Â£700 rise in April. The surge in inflation is hitting wide and hitting deep, with the effects leading to significant changes in the way lives are being lived well beyond those on low incomes. Large swathes of Britain's middle income working households are having to make material cutbacks and even after that are part of a new class of those ""just about managing"". In practice this has meant energy bill direct debits wiping out people's entire disposable income, some food banks running out of food donations, or their donors becoming users. And it may be changing attitudes, with nearly two-thirds of those asked saying even after the recent package of support for energy bills from the government, that it is not enough. And the numbers suggest a similar proportion think the support in place needs to last at least a year longer. Inflation this high certainly changes the economy and our spending behaviour. But the figures raise a question about whether the high levels of government support in the pandemic and in this energy crisis too, are now becoming baked into public expectations. Soaring prices have led the government to announcea package of financial supportdirected primarily at those on low incomes. This includes a Â£400 discount on all energy bills in October, in addition to payments totalling Â£650 to people on means-tested benefits. Pensioners will get more this winter, as will billpayers with disabilities. However, the BBC survey reveals that 64% of those asked said this support was insufficient to help people with the rising cost of living. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said vulnerable households would receive Â£1,200 which he said was part of a ""very large"" amount of support, on top of what had already been provided. He said the first payments would come in July, and would continue into the autumn to offset the key driver of the rising cost of living for households, which was energy bills. ""That, of course, is yet to filter through to people, which is why I suspect people are saying they want more support,"" he told the BBC. ""As this gathers pace, it will be clear to people that this will be a comprehensive package."" The impact of rising household costs has already led to the financial regulator warning lenders that they need to do more to help those in financial difficulty and support vulnerable customers. ""Early action is important for those struggling with debt,"" said Sheldon Mills, of the Financial Conduct Authority. Three things we're cutting back on as prices rise What are cost of living payments and who gets them? UK interest rates hit highest level for 13 years Rising prices see basic pay fall fastest since 2011 'Iâll walk to the next shop just to save 5p' Energy and food drive US inflation to 40-year high 'Petrol costs so much I might have to quit my job' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over UK economy at PMQs What happens if TikTok is banned?

William and Kate - who have not attended the Berkshire meet for a number of years - arrived in the traditional royal carriage procession to cheers from the crowds. The Queen has not made an appearance today with other members of the Royal Family. Thanks to the soaring temperatures, the event's organisers earlier announced that the strict dress code would not be enforced in all enclosures. Punters have been reminded to stay cool and a message broadcast on the public address system said: ""Please drink plenty of water all afternoon and keep hydrated."" Race-goers shelter from the sun's rays under parasols Carrie Johnson, wife of the PM, made an appearance dressed in white Punters enjoy a picnic - complete with tablecloth - under a bit of shade Racing fans with fans If all else fails, a large hat provides a bit of shade Outdoor public events have beenbanned in an area of France as a record-breaking heatwavesweeps across Europe. Concerts and large public gatherings have been called off in the Gironde department around Bordeaux. Yesterday, parts of France hit 40C earlier in the year than usual, with temperatures expected to peak tomorrow. Scientists say periods of intense heat are becoming more frequent and longer lasting as a result of global warming. In Gironde, officials said public events, including some of the official 18 June Resistance celebrations, will be prohibited from Friday at 14:00 (12:00 GMT) ""until the end of the heat wave"". Indoor events at venues without air conditioning are also banned. The weather has been kind for festival-goers on the Isle of Wight, with no wellies needed. Organisers havewarned people at the Isle of Wight Festival to stay safeduring the heat and recommended they take precautions - including avoiding excess alcohol consumption. As a result of the soaring temperatures suncream is the order of the day - and the only shelter being sought is to get out of the sun. This video can not be played Isle of Wight Festival: Hot weather warnings for revellers Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter Hot days are often followed by very warm nights. If the overnight temperature doesnât drop below 20C then thatâs defined as a tropical night and thereâs a chance of that somewhere in south-east England tonight.What is a tropical night? Harry LowBBC London News Itâs hotting up here at this lido as the sunbathers soak up the sunshine in south-east London. Since sunrise swimmers have been flocking to Charlton: all 1,000 slots sold out as people look for some respite from the high temperatures brought about by the arrival of the Spanish plume. Picnickers have set up camp beside this Olympic-sized swimming pool as the trees surrounding the pool gently sway in the breeze. A number of fair-weather swimmers have visited throughout the day, much to the chagrin of some regulars who are not used to sharing with crowds, especially during those long, cold winter months. If you're heading out to make the most of the summer sunshine today, spare a thought for some of our hairy-coated friends. As the temperature rises, it's not just us humans that need to keep cool. At the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon, the animals are being looked after with specially made ice lollies - the perfect way to cool down in the heat. The sanctuary's Simon Horn says: ""The ice
blocks are made from fruit and vegetables in water. ""They not only provide a
welcome treat during the sizzling temperatures, but they also provide a
valuable form of enrichment. ""Donkeys love exploring, and this activity allows
them to exhibit their natural foraging behaviours - a key factor in improving
donkey welfare."" It is officially the hottest day of the year in the UK for the third day in a row. Heathrow in west London recorded 32.4C (90F) this afternoon andtemperatures could climb furtherto 34C in parts of the South East. Today's record temperature surpassed the previous day's high of 29.5C (85.1F) recorded at Northolt in west London. The Met Office also predicts it could be the ""hottest Royal Ascot on record"" at the Berkshire racecourse. In Santon Downham, Suffolk, temperatures reached 31.1C, and Wisley, Surrey, recorded 30.4C. But the picture changes further north, with the Met Office pointing out a marked difference in temperatures, with Glasgow recording 13.7C just after midday. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter While parts of South East England will have another very warm to hot day on Saturday, elsewhere in England and Wales things will feel very different as temperatures drop significantly. For example, Leeds will fall from a high near 27C today to just 16C tomorrow. This photo of a tranquil spot in Leeds was taken a short while ago by BBC Weather Watcher Martin King. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Livestock cool off in a pond to beat the heat in Pakistan where temperatures reached 40C last month If youâre in
the southern half of the UK youâll certainly be feeling the heat - but spare a
thought for Spain and France, they are experiencing a punishing heatwave. This week
France saw temperatures hit 40C - the earliest in the year than ever before. Spain is
enduring its second heatwave this year and there are warnings it could reach
43C in the next couple of days. That did not used to happen until July or
August. It is this
type of intense heat that scientists warn will become more common as global
warming heats the planet. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the 19th century and temperatures continue to rise. The last seven years have been
the hottest years ever recorded and, if no action is taken to curb climate
change, scientists warn a rise of 4C is possible. In the US
now, more than 100 million people are being warned to stay indoors as scorching
temperatures settle over large parts of the country. India and
Pakistan suffered even more brutal heat last month with temperatures in
Pakistan reaching 50C while the Indian capital, New Delhi, hit 49.2C â
an all-time high. While periods
of hot weather have always occurred naturally, the increased intensity and
frequency of extreme heat now is a warning bell for the impacts ofclimate change. To place the current hot weather in context, we've drawn up a map of some peak temperatures hit around the UK - both in the month of June and overall. Some historical high points for thermometers include the hottest temperature recorded in June, when Southampton peaked at 35.6C in 1976. In more recent times, Cambridge experienced a sweltering 38.7C in July 2019, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

In the words of Billy Idol, it's hot in the city. In the words of The Clash, London's burning. In the words of Glen Frey, the heat is on. A high of 34C (93.2F) is expected in the capital on Friday. So are Londoners coping with the heatwave - or is it too hot to handle? Before the inevitable rainclouds return to empty over our optimistic barbecues - we take a look at some ""snaps-hots"" from around the city. Ladies take to the cooling waters at Parliament Hill Lido It's hot hot hot in Trafalgar Square They can't be British - neither appears to have brought a jacket ""just in case"" A hydrofoil rider takes off at Royal Docks in east London The new incarnation of Mary Poppins prepares to take off at London Fields Lido in Hackney Don't just carry it.

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council says it expects tens of thousands of visitors over the next few days to head to the seaside to enjoy the heat and sunshine. Beachgoers flocked to the resort town on the south coast of England when the first Covid-19 lockdown was eased in June 2020, which led to the councildeclaring a major incident. Since the incident, the council has developed a freebeach check appshowing people which areas are crowded, gives the location of public toilets and lifeguards, and says which areas dogs can use. Security cameras, a hub for emergency services and more rangers have also since been brought in. Read morehere. If the hot weather is becoming oppressive, there are some basic principles to help stop it becoming too much. During the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out and close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out. Open all the windows before you go to bed to get a through breeze. Using even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather as it encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. If you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. Alternatively, cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body, so try chilling your socks in the fridge before wearing. And of course, keep hydrated. A Level 3 heat-health alert has been issued for London, the east of England and the south-east to help protect health services, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says. The alert, called 'heatwave action', is to help protect the NHS and to inform its partners that they should prepare their services for possible increases in demand due to increases in temperatures, Agostinho Sousa of the UKHSA tells BBC Breakfast. âWe also have a Level 2 that is currently active in the South West and East of England that is to inform our partners that they should prepare their services in case they need to enter into action in case we see an increase in temperatures. âRight now the situation is stable, and we expect the temperatures to drop tomorrow.â Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals can cause muscle cramps and shock due to cold water temperatures, the fire service says People have been warnednot to swim in open water as temperatures soar. Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals could cause muscle cramps and shock as the water often remained cold even in heatwaves, says Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Fresh water could be polluted and cause serious illness, it said. People who fall into water by accident should lean back, extend their legs and arms, and use slow, gentle movements to stay afloat. Once you have controlled your breathing, attempt to swim to safety and call for help, the service adds. Anyone seeing a person or animal in trouble around water was asked to phone 999. If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's the latest on the extreme weather hitting parts of the UK and Europe: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37.5C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave. But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it.

Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter At midday, the temperature at Heathrow Airport was 30.3C, which is the highest for England and the UK so far this year. Wales has also recorded its highest temperature so far - 26.7C at Cardiff Bute Park. This heatwave has been building across western Europe - last weekSpainsaw temperatures above 40C - and now that heat has started to move
northwards. Spain is used to heatwaves â just not this

the end of the heatwave. Teachers in the region are watering
playgrounds in order to prevent pupils getting heatstroke in the extreme heat. Portugalsaw its hottest May since 1931, and yesterdayFrance recorded a temperature of over 40C - the earliest hot spell ever to hit the country. And French officials say the peak of the heatwave is yet to be reached. The hot zone is expected to move intocentral Europe, ItalytheAlpine countriesand the south ofGermany.

Harry LowBBC London News Itâs hotting up here at this lido as the sunbathers soak up the sunshine in south-east London. Since sunrise swimmers have been flocking to Charlton: all 1,000 slots sold out as people look for some respite from the high temperatures brought about by the arrival of the Spanish plume. Picnickers have set up camp beside this Olympic-sized swimming pool as the trees surrounding the pool gently sway in the breeze.

Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter While parts of South East England will have another very warm to hot day on Saturday, elsewhere in England and Wales things will feel very different as temperatures drop significantly. For example, Leeds will fall from a high near 27C today to just 16C tomorrow. This photo of a tranquil spot in Leeds was taken a short while ago by BBC Weather Watcher Martin King. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Livestock cool off in a pond to beat the heat in Pakistan where temperatures reached 40C last month If youâre in
the southern half of the UK youâll certainly be feeling the heat - but spare a
thought for Spain and France, they are experiencing a punishing heatwave. This week
France saw temperatures hit 40C - the earliest in the year than ever before. Spain is
enduring its second heatwave this year and there are warnings it could reach
43C in the next couple of days. That did not used to happen until July or
August. It is this
type of intense heat that scientists warn will become more common as global
warming heats the planet. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the 19th century and temperatures continue to rise. The last seven years have been
the hottest years ever recorded and, if no action is taken to curb climate
change, scientists warn a rise of 4C is possible. In the US
now, more than 100 million people are being warned to stay indoors as scorching
temperatures settle over large parts of the country. India and
Pakistan suffered even more brutal heat last month with temperatures in
Pakistan reaching 50C while the Indian capital, New Delhi, hit 49.2C â
an all-time high. While periods
of hot weather have always occurred naturally, the increased intensity and
frequency of extreme heat now is a warning bell for the impacts ofclimate change. To place the current hot weather in context, we've drawn up a map of some peak temperatures hit around the UK - both in the month of June and overall. Some historical high points for thermometers include the hottest temperature recorded in June, when Southampton peaked at 35.6C in 1976. In more recent times, Cambridge experienced a sweltering 38.7C in July 2019, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

In the words of Billy Idol, it's hot in the city. In the words of The Clash, London's burning. In the words of Glen Frey, the heat is on. A high of 34C (93.2F) is expected in the capital on Friday. So are Londoners coping with the heatwave - or is it too hot to handle? Before the inevitable rainclouds return to empty over our optimistic barbecues - we take a look at some ""snaps-hots"" from around the city.

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council says it expects tens of thousands of visitors over the next few days to head to the seaside to enjoy the heat and sunshine. Beachgoers flocked to the resort town on the south coast of England when the first Covid-19 lockdown was eased in June 2020, which led to the councildeclaring a major incident. Since the incident, the council has developed a freebeach check appshowing people which areas are crowded, gives the location of public toilets and lifeguards, and says which areas dogs can use. Security cameras, a hub for emergency services and more rangers have also since been brought in. Read morehere. If the hot weather is becoming oppressive, there are some basic principles to help stop it becoming too much. During the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out and close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out. Open all the windows before you go to bed to get a through breeze. Using even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather as it encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. If you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. Alternatively, cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body, so try chilling your socks in the fridge before wearing. And of course, keep hydrated.

"People buying less food as prices rise, says surveyMore than eight in 10 people say they are worried about the cost-of-living, a BBC survey suggests.","People struggling with the soaring cost of living are cutting back on food and car journeys to save money, according to a BBC-commissioned survey. More than half (56%) the 4,011 people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. The findings reveal the widespread impact of prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. Many people have cut spending on clothes and socialising. Some say their mental health has been affected. Two-thirds of those surveyed also suggested government support provided so far was insufficient. The BBC-commissioned survey of 4,011 UK adults in early June lifts a lid on how the economic climate is affecting lives and financial, physical and mental health. The cost of domestic energy, petrol, and food have all increased significantly in recent months, and the findings suggest more than eight in 10 people (81%) are worried about the rising cost of living. 'We can't just go in there and buy what we like now' Why are prices rising so quickly? Five things that are going up in price and why Why chicken is getting more and more expensive Concern has grown since the start of the year when 69% of those asked said they were worried in a similar BBC survey. In the latest results, two thirds (66%) of those with worries said this was having a negative effect on their mental health. Nearly half (45%) said their physical health had been affected. Day-to-day, individuals are making further changes to manage their budgets. The survey suggests this can be as simple as going on fewer nights out, or getting a haircut less often. For charity worker Janine Colwill, from Easington, and those she talks to, the changes have been more fundamental. ""We get together with the family every Sunday, religiously, for Sunday roast - but my family and other families are starting to grow their own vegetables,"" she said. Janine Colwill says people in her area are constantly looking for ways to save money ""Those people who may not have worried about these things before are now worrying about them constantly. ""With advances in technology, I never would have thought that people would be relying on a food bank or growing their own - and just penny-pinching,"" she said. The survey suggests people are finding various ways to manage and save their money. The findings include: Some 82% of those asked had switched off lights in the previous week to save money Trips taken in the car had been limited to varying degrees in the previous six months by 72% of those asked A large majority (84%) said they had spent less on their clothes at some point in the previous six months About half (52%) expect to work more hours in the next six months to help to pay the bills. Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, said in a trading update for the three months to 28 May that it was seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to inflation, such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. Chief executive Ken Murphy also said people are switching to cheaper own-label brands for goods including bread and pastawhich have seen prices soardue to the war between Ukraine and Russia, both of which are major wheat exporters. Prices, as measured by inflation, are rising at a rate of 9% a year, the fastest for 40 years. Interest rates, which also affect the cost of living,were increased to 1.25%on Thursday by the Bank of England - the highest they have been for 13 years. The situation is being driven, to a significant degree, by global factors such as the cost of oil, gas and food. But there are UK-specific issues which are adding to inflation such as the tight labour market. Job vacancies are at a record high of 1.3 million meaning employers face paying higher wages to fill roles. Also, the UK's dominant services sector - which includes the likes of accountancy and law firms, as well as restaurants and pubs - is seeing price rises. Drivers now have to spendÂ£103 for petrol and Â£106 for diesel to fill a family car, according to the RAC. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) has predicted food priceswill rise at a rate of 15%this summer as households pay more for staples such as bread, meat, dairy and fruit and vegetables. A typical household in England, Wales and Scotland is likely to see a rise in its annual domestic gas and electricity bill of Â£800 in October, on top of a Â£700 rise in April. The surge in inflation is hitting wide and hitting deep, with the effects leading to significant changes in the way lives are being lived well beyond those on low incomes. Large swathes of Britain's middle income working households are having to make material cutbacks and even after that are part of a new class of those ""just about managing"". In practice this has meant energy bill direct debits wiping out people's entire disposable income, some food banks running out of food donations, or their donors becoming users. And it may be changing attitudes, with nearly two-thirds of those asked saying even after the recent package of support for energy bills from the government, that it is not enough. And the numbers suggest a similar proportion think the support in place needs to last at least a year longer. Inflation this high certainly changes the economy and our spending behaviour. But the figures raise a question about whether the high levels of government support in the pandemic and in this energy crisis too, are now becoming baked into public expectations. Soaring prices have led the government to announcea package of financial supportdirected primarily at those on low incomes. This includes a Â£400 discount on all energy bills in October, in addition to payments totalling Â£650 to people on means-tested benefits. Pensioners will get more this winter, as will billpayers with disabilities. However, the BBC survey reveals that 64% of those asked said this support was insufficient to help people with the rising cost of living. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said vulnerable households would receive Â£1,200 which he said was part of a ""very large"" amount of support, on top of what had already been provided. He said the first payments would come in July, and would continue into the autumn to offset the key driver of the rising cost of living for households, which was energy bills. ""That, of course, is yet to filter through to people, which is why I suspect people are saying they want more support,"" he told the BBC. ""As this gathers pace, it will be clear to people that this will be a comprehensive package."" The impact of rising household costs has already led to the financial regulator warning lenders that they need to do more to help those in financial difficulty and support vulnerable customers. ""Early action is important for those struggling with debt,"" said Sheldon Mills, of the Financial Conduct Authority. Three things we're cutting back on as prices rise What are cost of living payments and who gets them? UK interest rates hit highest level for 13 years Rising prices see basic pay fall fastest since 2011 'Iâll walk to the next shop just to save 5p' Energy and food drive US inflation to 40-year high 'Petrol costs so much I might have to quit my job' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over UK economy at PMQs What happens if TikTok is banned?

warming heats the planet. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the 19th century and temperatures continue to rise. The last seven years have been
the hottest years ever recorded and, if no action is taken to curb climate
change, scientists warn a rise of 4C is possible. In the US
now, more than 100 million people are being warned to stay indoors as scorching
temperatures settle over large parts of the country. India and
Pakistan suffered even more brutal heat last month with temperatures in
Pakistan reaching 50C while the Indian capital, New Delhi, hit 49.2C â
an all-time high. While periods
of hot weather have always occurred naturally, the increased intensity and
frequency of extreme heat now is a warning bell for the impacts ofclimate change. To place the current hot weather in context, we've drawn up a map of some peak temperatures hit around the UK - both in the month of June and overall. Some historical high points for thermometers include the hottest temperature recorded in June, when Southampton peaked at 35.6C in 1976. In more recent times, Cambridge experienced a sweltering 38.7C in July 2019, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

In the words of Billy Idol, it's hot in the city. In the words of The Clash, London's burning. In the words of Glen Frey, the heat is on. A high of 34C (93.2F) is expected in the capital on Friday. So are Londoners coping with the heatwave - or is it too hot to handle? Before the inevitable rainclouds return to empty over our optimistic barbecues - we take a look at some ""snaps-hots"" from around the city.

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council says it expects tens of thousands of visitors over the next few days to head to the seaside to enjoy the heat and sunshine. Beachgoers flocked to the resort town on the south coast of England when the first Covid-19 lockdown was eased in June 2020, which led to the councildeclaring a major incident. Since the incident, the council has developed a freebeach check appshowing people which areas are crowded, gives the location of public toilets and lifeguards, and says which areas dogs can use. Security cameras, a hub for emergency services and more rangers have also since been brought in. Read morehere. If the hot weather is becoming oppressive, there are some basic principles to help stop it becoming too much. During the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out and close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out. Open all the windows before you go to bed to get a through breeze. Using even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather as it encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. If you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. Alternatively, cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body, so try chilling your socks in the fridge before wearing. And of course, keep hydrated. A Level 3 heat-health alert has been issued for London, the east of England and the south-east to help protect health services, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says. The alert, called 'heatwave action', is to help protect the NHS and to inform its partners that they should prepare their services for possible increases in demand due to increases in temperatures, Agostinho Sousa of the UKHSA tells BBC Breakfast. âWe also have a Level 2 that is currently active in the South West and East of England that is to inform our partners that they should prepare their services in case they need to enter into action in case we see an increase in temperatures. âRight now the situation is stable, and we expect the temperatures to drop tomorrow.â Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals can cause muscle cramps and shock due to cold water temperatures, the fire service says People have been warnednot to swim in open water as temperatures soar. Swimming in lakes, rivers and canals could cause muscle cramps and shock as the water often remained cold even in heatwaves, says Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Fresh water could be polluted and cause serious illness, it said. People who fall into water by accident should lean back, extend their legs and arms, and use slow, gentle movements to stay afloat. Once you have controlled your breathing, attempt to swim to safety and call for help, the service adds. Anyone seeing a person or animal in trouble around water was asked to phone 999. If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's the latest on the extreme weather hitting parts of the UK and Europe: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37.5C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave. But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it. You can read more by James on the dangers of heat and what to do about themhere. Nick MillerBBC Weather presenter At midday, the temperature at Heathrow Airport was 30.3C, which is the highest for England and the UK so far this year. Wales has also recorded its highest temperature so far - 26.7C at Cardiff Bute Park. This heatwave has been building across western Europe - last weekSpainsaw temperatures above 40C - and now that heat has started to move
northwards. Spain is used to heatwaves â just not this
early in the summer season and certainly not this hot. And with the high temperatures come the inevitable
wildfires. InItaly, the soaring
heat is leading to growing concerns about water shortages. As we reported earlier, large stretches of the countryâs largest river, the Po, the
water is so low that locals can walk through the middle of the expanse of sand -
and wartime shipwrecks are even resurfacing. Across thePyrenees, straddling the border
of France and Spain, outdoor public events are being banned from tomorrow until
the end of the heatwave. Teachers in the region are watering
playgrounds in order to prevent pupils getting heatstroke in the extreme heat. Portugalsaw its hottest May since 1931, and yesterdayFrance recorded a temperature of over 40C - the earliest hot spell ever to hit the country. And French officials say the peak of the heatwave is yet to be reached. The hot zone is expected to move intocentral Europe, ItalytheAlpine countriesand the south ofGermany. The peak of the heatwave in theUKarrives today acrossEnglandandWales, with temperatures set to reach 33C. But inScotlandandNorthern Ireland, temperatures are expected to peak at a more comfortable 23C Across the whole of the UK, cooler and fresher conditions are expected over the weekend Scientists warn that as global temperatures rise over time heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent, more intense and longer lasting - and their impact more widespread.

Rappers vent frustration over seaside second homes,"The Mills brothers have taken to rap to vent their frustration It is an idyllic seaside resort with pastel-coloured houses where thousands flock in summer. But some young people from Tenby, Pembrokeshire, have turned to rap to vent their frustration at being priced out by second homes and holiday lets. Will and Niall Mills' music describes the ""collapse"" of the working class community in the town. The Welsh government said it was taking ""immediate and radical action"" to protect communities. Pembrokeshire council said it was using second home levies to develop ""community-led housing development"". ""We don't live in Center Parcs. We don't live in Butlin's, this is a town. It has schools, it has GP surgeries,"" said Will Mills. What's Wales' problem with second homes? Are second home owners selling up in Wales? Tax hikes will make holiday lets unviable - owners The 27-year-old is rapping in his mum's spare room in Pentlepoir, on the outskirts of Saundersfoot. ""If you've got two homes then you need one less."" This video can not be played Young people in seaside towns like Tenby can not afford to buy their own homes His sister, who works for the council, has had to leave her flat and move in and her possessions are in boxes around him as he raps a track from his EP. It means when Will or his siblings are home they have to share a room with his mum while his dad, a business owner in Tenby, lives in a room in a shared house. ""There is a level of anxiety that you could be made homeless within six months and I see that all the time,"" he said. The council's waiting list for social housing has increased to 5,400 and it said the number of people coming to the authority who were homeless had also increased. Will and Niall have produced protest T-shirts Will and his identical twin brother Niall believe second homes and holiday lets are pricing families like theirs out of Tenby and they have turned to music, placards and protest T-shirts to try and raise awareness. Their music both draws on their experiences of being part of a community they feel is being displaced. ""People will walk down the street and listen to it, put their headphones in then that's gonna go way further,"" he said. Will and Niall's obituary T-shirts have been sold to people in coastal towns around the UK who object to the often lower wages in rural areas, compared to high rents and housing shortages. ""What people forget is in purchasing a second home and having two homes you are responsible in some way or another for displacing a family,"" he said. The average house price in Wales increased by 11.7% last year, compared to 15% in Pembrokeshire, according to the Office for National Statistics. The average price of a home in the county has risen to Â£229,882. Will acknowledged the area needed tourism, but questioned ""what's the point of bringing money into a community that I can't live in? ""I think that there's also this misconception that second home owners bring all this money into the town and we're on our hands and knees waiting for this money to come in."" After Gwynedd, latest figures show Pembrokeshire has the second highest number of registered second homes in Wales, and it has increased 15% since last June. In Tenby, even businesses dependent on tourism are feeling the strain. Ebony Lindsay, 26, manages The Dennis CafÃ©, or Den's as it is known locally. It has been in her family for 35 years, but they have never experienced anything like their current staffing shortages. Ebony said it was because people could no longer afford to live near the town, and especially not on local wages in hospitality. ""Most of my friends don't live down here anymore or they move into Cardiff, or have moved to London because that's where the jobs are for that and then also they can actually find somewhere to live."" To compensate she and her father regularly work 74-hour weeks. Neither her, her father or her aunt can afford to buy or rent in Tenby as they are ""local people who do it just to take home a normal wage"". Ebony is trying to buy a house, but said it was impossible as wealthy buyers offered cash above the asking price. She wants to see local people given priority on purchases and rentals, saying homes need to be occupied year-round to keep businesses going in the off-season. ""Even though the second home owners and holiday lets think they're bringing the money into the town, they're necessarily not because their houses are vacant the majority of the time,"" she said. ""The winter is bleak in Tenby now, because there's no one here every house has got no lights on no-one lives there."" The second homes premium councils can charge will increase to 300% from April 2023 after changes made by the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru under their co-operation agreement. Pembrokeshire council charges 100% and the majority of the money goes to the Pembrokeshire Community Fund, which is spent on supporting local schemes and housing initiatives. Councillor Neil Prior said communities were at a ""tipping point"". The council is also exploring community-led housing development, likeCommunity Land Trusts,external. The Welsh government said it was ""committed to taking immediate and radical action using the planning, property and taxation systems to tackle the injustices in the current housing market"". It also promised to have a package of proposals soon to tackle the various problems. ""We also continue to work towards our commitment of delivering 20,000 new low carbon social homes for rent this government term,"" a spokesman added.

UK interest rates hit highest level for 13 years,"UK interest rates have risen further as the Bank of England attempts to stem the pace of soaring prices. Rates have increased from 1% to 1.25%, the fifth consecutive rise, pushing them to the highest level in 13 years. It comes as finances are being squeezed by the rising cost of living, driven by record fuel and energy prices. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently at a 40-year high of 9%, and the Bank warned it could surpass 11% later this year. How high could interest rates go? The Bank said rising energy prices were expected to drive living costs even higher in October, but added it would ""act forcefully"" if necessary should inflation pressures persist. Capital Economics speculates that the Bank could eventually have to raise interest rates to 3%. One way to try to control rising prices - or inflation - is to raise interest rates. This increases the cost of borrowing and encourages people to borrow and spend less. Higher interest rates also motivate people to save more. The June rate rise means that homeowners with a typical tracker mortgage will have to pay about Â£25 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages will see a Â£16 increase. Compared with pre-December 2021 - when the Bank announced the first in this series of rate rises - tracker mortgage customers are paying around Â£115 more a month, and variable mortgage holders about Â£73 more. However, about three-quarters of mortgage-holders have a fixed-rate deal, so have not been affected immediately. Meanwhile, some businesses believe rising borrowing costs may curb customer spending. ""At the moment we're not seeing it directly but we know we are a luxury,"" Julie Dalton, managing director of Gulliver's Theme Park Resorts told the BBC. ""Past experience has told us when interest rates go up we do start to suffer."" Six of the nine members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted to raise rates to 1.25%, but three backed a bigger increase to 1.5%. Minutes from the Bank's meeting also reveal that it expects the UK economy will shrink by 0.3% in the April-to-June period. How will the latest interest rate rise affect you? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy The Bank did not update its outlook for the July-to-September quarter, but it has said previously that expects the economy to grow during this period. If it does, then the UK would avoid a recession this year - with a recession defined as the economy shrinking for two consecutive quarters. However, the Bank has also said previously that it expects the economy to shrink in the final three months of this year, during which the price cap on household energy bills is expected to be increased from Â£1,971 per year to about Â£2,800. The rise in domestic gas and electricity bills will lift the increase in the cost of living to ""slightly above"" 11% in October, the Bank said. It means the rate of inflation will be more than five times the Bank's inflation target of 2%. The Bank of England now expects the economy to be weaker immediately, with a fall in the economy in this quarter, and for inflation to be even higher, going above 11% in the autumn when the energy cap resets. It will flesh out these new forecasts in August. The rise in interest rates to its highest level since February 2009 is intended to stop the global energy price shock becoming entrenched in the UK. The Bank's spies in every region of the economy say they do not pick up any sign of a reduction in demand for labour. Hence the rise to a rate that would still be considered low by historic standards, but may prove rather high to an economy, to homeowners and businesses that have become accustomed to ultra low rates after the financial crisis. The Bank has also stopped giving guidance that more rate increases are on the way, and instead replaced that wording with an assurance that it will respond ""forcefully"" to any signs that inflation is becoming persistent. Three members of the nine member committee voted for an even bigger rise of 0.5%, in the aftermath of the bumper 0.75% rise in rates in the US overnight. The Bank pointed to measures of core inflation, which strip out volatile energy prices for example, being significantly higher in the UK than in the euro area. So the Bank is keeping open a path of further rises. But such is the economic squeeze and the fear of recession, that some economists predict some of these rises could be reversed within a year. It is a very uncertain time. In a letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, the Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, said inflation was largely due to global issues such as rising prices for energy and agricultural goods, which have worsened as a result of Russia's war with Ukraine. But Mr Bailey said ""domestic factors"" also had a role in rising inflation such as the tighter labour market - there are currently a record 1.3 million job vacancies - and rising prices in the services sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the UK's GDP. He also noted that the UK's inflation rate was higher than both the eurozone and the US. Mr Bailey added that because it takes some time for wholesale gas and oil prices to be reflected in household bills - when the energy regulator Ofgem changes the price cap in April and October - ""inflation is likely to peak later in the UK than in many other economies and may therefore fall back later"". Other countries are also raising interest rates in an attempt to cool rising prices. The US central bank has just announcedits biggest interest rate rise in nearly 30 years, with the Federal Reserve increasing rates by three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index shed more than 600 points (2%) following the move while in the UK, the FTSE 100 fell by more than 200 points (3%) after the Bank lifted rates. Brazil, Canada, India, Australia and Switzerland have also raised rates, while the European Central Bank has outlined plans to do so later this summer. In the UK, some urged the Bank of England to show some restraint on raising interest rates. While the manufacturers' association Make UK acknowledged that the Bank is ""caught between a rock and a hard place"", it said: ""Relatively low-cost borrowing is currently one of the few last lines of defence for manufacturers, with cashflow under pressure thanks to a potent cocktail of high energy, transport and raw material costs.""

How high could interest rates go?,"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. Some analysts predict another cut when the Bank meets in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. It was the first drop in more than four years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,was 2.5% in the 12 months to December 2024, down slightly from 2.6% in November. Despite the drop, inflation remains above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The spending and borrowing plans set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgetchanged expectations, in particular an increase inthe minimum wageandthe amount of National Insurance paid by employers. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskas a result of the National Insurance changes. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. Some economists believe the drop in inflation in December strengthens the case for a further cut. Chancellor Reeves vows action on growth amid rising debt costs Chris Mason: Political heat ramps up over the economy Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change has an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.49%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.27%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row, meaning its key lending ratehas a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. However  the Fed has indicated that it will cut rates at a slower pace in 2025.

"PM put me in odious position, says ex-ethics chief","Boris Johnson's ethics adviser says he quit after the PM forced him into an âimpossible and odiousâ position. Lord Geidt's job was to advise the PM on the ministerial code - a set of rules governing standards of behaviour. In his resignation letter,,externalhe said he had come close to quitting over Covid law-breaking in Downing Street. But he said he had been asked for advice this week on another issue he believed would amount to a deliberate breach of the code. In full: Geidt's resignation letter and PM's reply PM's Partygate fine may have broken code, MPs told Listen: Profile of Christopher Geidt ""This request has placed me in an impossible and odious position,"" wrote Lord Geidt in his letter. He said the idea that the prime minister ""might to any degree be in the business of deliberately breaching his own code is an affront"" that would suspend the code ""to suit a political end"". ""This would make a mockery not only of respect for the code but licence the suspension of its provisions in governing the conduct of Her Majesty's ministers,"" Lord Geidt wrote. ""I can have no part in this."" In his response, Mr Johnson said his intention was to seek Lord Geidt's ""advice on the national interest in protecting a crucial industry"". Downing Street said Mr Johnson was reviewing whether or not to fill the vacant position, and declined to comment on suggestions the plan related to maintaining tariffs on Chinese steel despite possibly breaching World Trade Organisation (WTO) commitments. Mr Johnson pictured at a leaving party in November 2020 Lord Geidt is the second ethics adviser to quit under Mr Johnson's premiership. Sir Alex Allan -who resigned from the rolein 2020 - said it was ""dreadful that an honourable man like Lord Geidt has been placed in a position where he felt he had no option but to resign"". He told BBC Newscast that he understood Lord Geidt resigned over a ""combination of the issues"", including breaches of Covid rules in Downing Street during the pandemic. Sir Alex said ""this particular issue about ministers, potentially at any rate, deliberately breaching the code"" was the ""final straw"" for Lord Geidt. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, insisted the issue over which Lord Geidt resigned was one in which the government was ""trying to do its best to support a British industrial sector"" and nothing to do ""with a personal ethics or conduct issue"". This video can not be played Lord Geidt ""wouldn't have taken this decision lightly"" - former PM adviser Labour's shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said the resignation of Alex Allen and now Lord Geidt showed there was ""something really rotten at the heart of Downing Street"". She told reporters Lord Geidt was a ""man at the end of his tether"" who had realised it's ""not possible"" to defend the prime minister and had ""had enough"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Parliament should be allowed to vet the next ethics adviser ""so that Johnson can't simply appoint one of his cronies"". The SNP MP Brendan O'Hara said the resignation was ""another humiliation for the prime minister"". In his resignation letter, Lord Geidt expresses concern about the prime minister's reaction to widespread Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street, as highlighted in Sue Gray's report. He says he had decided it was possible to ""continue credibly"" as the PM's adviser ""albeit by a very small margin"". So it really was a trade issue that triggered Lord Geidt's resignation. The PM's now ex-ethics adviser stunned Westminster on Wednesday night by suddenly announcing his resignation, without explanation. It took No 10 by surprise - who found out when the BBC approached them for comment. He is known to have been unhappy about Boris Johnson's handling of Partygate, and had suggested the PM may have broken the ministerial code. And he had just endured a grilling by MPs over that very issue. In his letter, Lord Geidt also strongly hints at his discontent over the prime minister's leadership - and apparent attempt to shift the blame on to him for not making his concerns clear enough by citing 'miscommunication' between their offices. There was some scepticism when ministers suggested he had gone because of a confidential issue in the national interest, which was magnified by Downing Street's apparent reluctance to publish his resignation letter. Now that the letter has been published, it appears a trade question was the final straw, but many questions remain. In response to Lord Geidt's letter, the prime minister said he had asked about a potential future decision related to the Trade Remedies Authorities. He added the proposal would be in line with ""domestic law but might be seen to conflict with our obligations under the WTO [World Trade Organisation]"". By seeking Lord Geidt's advice, Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""ensure that we acted properly"". The Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) is a relatively new body, established after Brexit to decide whether action needed to be taken to protect UK industries. Its first big decision, which was on the steel industry, wasoverruled by the government, which decided to protect 15 steel products when the authority had recommended only 10. The measures made it more expensive for British companies to buy more than a certain amount of foreign steel. In a statement, theTRA said the letter ""appears to refer"",externalto this case. Now, one reading of Mr Johnson's letter is that ministers suggested taking steps to protect a British industry that were so clearly in breach of World Trade Organization rules and international law that Lord Geidt felt he had to resign. But it is not entirely clear how this could have happened. WTO rules can be unclear. Generally, a country does something, another country complains and some time later the WTO will rule on whether its rules have been broken. You wouldn't necessarily expect ministers to resign if the WTO ruled against them. But also, Lord Geidt's predecessor Sir Alex Allan didn't resign when the government introduced the Internal Market Bill, which Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewisconceded would break international law in a ""specific and limited way""in September 2020. And the European Commission thinks the UK is breaking international law by not carrying out its obligations under the Northern Ireland Protocol. Lord Geidt's job involved providing advice to Mr Johnson about the ministerial code. He could also investigate ministers for breaching the code - but only if asked to do so by the prime minister. The code, which outlines the rules ministers must follow, says there is an ""overarching duty"" on them to comply with the law. If the code is broken, ministers are expected to resign.

"People buying less food as prices rise - surveyMore than eight in 10 people say they are worried about the cost-of-living, a BBC survey suggests.Business","People struggling with the soaring cost of living are cutting back on food and car journeys to save money, according to a BBC-commissioned survey. More than half (56%) the 4,011 people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. The findings reveal the widespread impact of prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. Many people have cut spending on clothes and socialising. Some say their mental health has been affected. Two-thirds of those surveyed also suggested government support provided so far was insufficient. The BBC-commissioned survey of 4,011 UK adults in early June lifts a lid on how the economic climate is affecting lives and financial, physical and mental health. The cost of domestic energy, petrol, and food have all increased significantly in recent months, and the findings suggest more than eight in 10 people (81%) are worried about the rising cost of living. 'We can't just go in there and buy what we like now' Why are prices rising so quickly? Five things that are going up in price and why Why chicken is getting more and more expensive Concern has grown since the start of the year when 69% of those asked said they were worried in a similar BBC survey. In the latest results, two thirds (66%) of those with worries said this was having a negative effect on their mental health. Nearly half (45%) said their physical health had been affected. Day-to-day, individuals are making further changes to manage their budgets. The survey suggests this can be as simple as going on fewer nights out, or getting a haircut less often. For charity worker Janine Colwill, from Easington, and those she talks to, the changes have been more fundamental. ""We get together with the family every Sunday, religiously, for Sunday roast - but my family and other families are starting to grow their own vegetables,"" she said. Janine Colwill says people in her area are constantly looking for ways to save money ""Those people who may not have worried about these things before are now worrying about them constantly. ""With advances in technology, I never would have thought that people would be relying on a food bank or growing their own - and just penny-pinching,"" she said. The survey suggests people are finding various ways to manage and save their money. The findings include: Some 82% of those asked had switched off lights in the previous week to save money Trips taken in the car had been limited to varying degrees in the previous six months by 72% of those asked A large majority (84%) said they had spent less on their clothes at some point in the previous six months About half (52%) expect to work more hours in the next six months to help to pay the bills. Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, said in a trading update for the three months to 28 May that it was seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to inflation, such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. Chief executive Ken Murphy also said people are switching to cheaper own-label brands for goods including bread and pastawhich have seen prices soardue to the war between Ukraine and Russia, both of which are major wheat exporters. Prices, as measured by inflation, are rising at a rate of 9% a year, the fastest for 40 years. Interest rates, which also affect the cost of living,were increased to 1.25%on Thursday by the Bank of England - the highest they have been for 13 years. The situation is being driven, to a significant degree, by global factors such as the cost of oil, gas and food. But there are UK-specific issues which are adding to inflation such as the tight labour market. Job vacancies are at a record high of 1.3 million meaning employers face paying higher wages to fill roles. Also, the UK's dominant services sector - which includes the likes of accountancy and law firms, as well as restaurants and pubs - is seeing price rises. Drivers now have to spendÂ£103 for petrol and Â£106 for diesel to fill a family car, according to the RAC. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) has predicted food priceswill rise at a rate of 15%this summer as households pay more for staples such as bread, meat, dairy and fruit and vegetables. A typical household in England, Wales and Scotland is likely to see a rise in its annual domestic gas and electricity bill of Â£800 in October, on top of a Â£700 rise in April. The surge in inflation is hitting wide and hitting deep, with the effects leading to significant changes in the way lives are being lived well beyond those on low incomes. Large swathes of Britain's middle income working households are having to make material cutbacks and even after that are part of a new class of those ""just about managing"". In practice this has meant energy bill direct debits wiping out people's entire disposable income, some food banks running out of food donations, or their donors becoming users. And it may be changing attitudes, with nearly two-thirds of those asked saying even after the recent package of support for energy bills from the government, that it is not enough. And the numbers suggest a similar proportion think the support in place needs to last at least a year longer. Inflation this high certainly changes the economy and our spending behaviour. But the figures raise a question about whether the high levels of government support in the pandemic and in this energy crisis too, are now becoming baked into public expectations. Soaring prices have led the government to announcea package of financial supportdirected primarily at those on low incomes. This includes a Â£400 discount on all energy bills in October, in addition to payments totalling Â£650 to people on means-tested benefits. Pensioners will get more this winter, as will billpayers with disabilities. However, the BBC survey reveals that 64% of those asked said this support was insufficient to help people with the rising cost of living. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said vulnerable households would receive Â£1,200 which he said was part of a ""very large"" amount of support, on top of what had already been provided. He said the first payments would come in July, and would continue into the autumn to offset the key driver of the rising cost of living for households, which was energy bills. ""That, of course, is yet to filter through to people, which is why I suspect people are saying they want more support,"" he told the BBC. ""As this gathers pace, it will be clear to people that this will be a comprehensive package."" The impact of rising household costs has already led to the financial regulator warning lenders that they need to do more to help those in financial difficulty and support vulnerable customers. ""Early action is important for those struggling with debt,"" said Sheldon Mills, of the Financial Conduct Authority.
