Lecturer jailed in Iran 'moved to remote prison',"Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer at Melbourne University, has been in jail since September 2018 A British-Australian woman serving a 10-year sentence in Iran for espionage has been transferred to a notorious prison in the desert, officials say. Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer at Melbourne University, has been in jail since September 2018. She was tried in secret and strongly denies all the charges against her. The Australian government has said it holds Iran responsible for Ms Moore-Gilbert's ""safety and well-being"" and is ""urgently seeking access"" to her. ""Dr Moore-Gilbert's case is one of the Australian government's highest priorities, including for our embassy officials in Tehran,"" Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement on Tuesday. The statement added that Iran had confirmed earlier reports from human rights activists that she had been moved to the notorious Qarchak prison. The jail is sometimes used as punishment for Iranian political prisoners and conditions have been described by former inmates as abysmal. Before being moved to Qarchak prison, Ms Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer in Middle East politics, had spent almost two years sleeping on the floor of a cell at Evin prison in the capital, Tehran, according to a friend. She has been in solitary confinement and on several hunger strikes, and she is said to have been beaten for trying to comfort new prisoners by passing notes and writing to them on prison walls. On Tuesday, the husband of British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who was jailed in Iran in 2016 on spying charges that she has always denied - said that Qarchak was a place where ""[Iranian] authorities sent women political prisoners when they wanted to break them"". ""It's in the middle of the desert with no clean running water, very poor food with the bread and rice drugged, and gang-ridden, so you can wait months to get a bed,"" Richard Ratcliffe said. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been on hunger strike in solidarity with Ms Moore-Gilbert.

It's overcrowded and some of them are dangerous,"" said Hadi Ghaemi, director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran. Referring to an earlier statement from Ms Moore-Gilbert that she had rejected an offer of freedom in return for becoming a spy for Iran, he added: ""They're not happy with her resilience and her refusal to co-operate."" A friend of the family told BBC World Affairs correspondent Caroline Hawley that Ms Moore-Gilbert ""feels abandoned"". ""The Australian government doesn't seem to have been very proactive - she's been short on money that she needs to buy basic provisions for herself in jail,"" they said. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian ambassador visited Ms Moore-Gilbert in Evin prison recently and had been in telephone contact with her over the past few months. Ms Moore-Gilbert told an Iranian human rights activist in a phone call earlier this week that she had not spoken to her family for about a month. Reza Khandan, the husband of imprisoned human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, said in a Facebook post that Ms Moore-Gilbert was in ""a very bad condition"". He wrote that she had told him: ""I can't eat anything, I don't know, I'm so disappointed. I'm so very depressed."" Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals In letters smuggled out of Tehran's Evin prison in January, the lecturer said she had ""never been a spy"" and feared for her mental health. She said she had rejected an offer from Iran to become a spy. ""I am not a spy. I have never been a spy, and I have no interest to work for a spying organisation in any country."" She also said she feared her health had ""deteriorated significantly"". ""I think I am in the midst of a serious psychological problem,"" she wrote, worsened by ""the ban on having any phone calls with my family"". Ms Moore-Gilbert remains adamant that she is ""an innocent woman... imprisoned for a crime I have not committed"". The Cambridge-educated academic was travelling on an Australian passport and was detained at Tehran airport in 2018 as she tried to leave following a conference. Last year, British-Australian woman Jolie King and her Australian boyfriend Mark Firkin were released after being jailed in Tehran for reportedly flying a drone without a permit.

Amazon takes on supermarkets with free food delivery,"Amazon is ramping up its online grocery service with the aim of serving millions of shoppers across the UK by the end of 2020. Online food sales have almost doubled during the pandemic with grocers struggling to keep up with demand. Amazon is now after a bigger slice of this fast-growing market, which analysts say could increase pressure on rivals such as Ocado. ""It's extremely significant"" says retail analyst, Richard Hyman. ""[Amazon] can be compelling, disruptive and it's a business with gigantic ambitions."" Amazon Fresh offers same or next-day grocery deliveries for customers in London and parts of the Home Counties. Shoppers have to subscribe to Amazon Prime to get it and users currently have to pay an additional monthly fee or a delivery charge per order. It has about 10,000 products including fresh, chilled and frozen food. From Tuesday, this service will now be a free benefit to subscribers in these areas on orders above Â£40. About 40 postcodes in Surrey will also have access to a faster offer, with a possible same-day delivery before midnight if you order by 21:00. Amazon says it will roll out this quicker and unlimited free delivery grocery service to ""multiple cities"" by the end of this year. It's an ambitious move. ""Grocery delivery is one of the fastest growing businesses at Amazon and we think this will be one of the most-loved Prime benefits in the UK, "" says Russell Jones, country manager of Amazon Fresh UK. He says this expansion was on the cards before Covid-19. ""We've been planning this for a long time. It's a big step up in volume. In the early days of lockdown all our capacity was being used. We're confident that we can launch this service now at this point in time,"" he says. Tesco starts online refillable container trial Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent Amazon revealed few specifics about its plans. It launched Amazon Fresh in the UK in 2016 and has never given sales figures or customer numbers. It hasn't even confirmed how many Amazon Prime members it has in the UK. According to market research firm Mintel, there are 15 million subscribers, potentially giving Amazon a huge platform. ""I think they will be a big player in food retailing online. They wouldn't be doing it otherwise. Most of the markets they go into, they want to be the biggest player,"" says Richard Hyman. It's also far more difficult for grocers to make a profit with online sales compared to customers visiting stores. ""The frightening thing for everybody else is that they all really need to make money, whereas Amazon doesn't and that places them at an enormous advantage."" But it won't be easy, says Thomas Brereton, retail analyst at GlobalData. ""At the moment, people don't really consider Amazon for food. They've got to build brand awareness and that takes time and a lot of investment."" ""Food and non-food retailing are two very different concepts, and Amazon must be careful not to underestimate the competitiveness of the UK grocery market."" He adds: ""Also, because of what's happening with the economy, value is going to be the main driver, which is something Tesco's been trying to do with Aldi and its price match campaign. Amazon's target is going to be fairly premium as it has signed a lot of deals with smaller, independent suppliers."" A big battle for upmarket shoppers is set for the autumn. In September, Ocado will start selling M&S products instead of Waitrose food. And it's these players, thinks Richard Hyman, who have most to worry about when it comes to Amazon's latest move. ""If you think about the demographic of Prime, these members are relatively better-off... It's one thing fighting Amazon off when you have an established business, but fighting them off when you've got something completely new in the case of M&S and relatively new in the case of Waitrose flying solo will be more challenging. ""Amazon are very clever at getting the rest of the market to follow their agenda and I think what they will particularly be doing is upping the ante on delivery times,"" he says. All of the established players have been rapidly building online capacity to cope with soaring demand, which many believe will be a permanent shift in shopping behaviour. Amazon's expansion means this part of the Â£119bn grocery market is going to become even more competitive in the coming months.

Men and women's working hours 'nearly equal',"The split between genders in the amount of paid and unpaid work they do has shrunk over the last 40 years, according to a think tank. A new study by the Resolution Foundation found that men in the UK are doing fewer paid hours and women more. The foundation says that women and men are almost equal in terms of overall hours worked, clocking in 50 and 51 hours a week respectively. However, men get paid for 10 more of their weekly hours than women do. Since the 1970s, women have increased their paid working hours by more than five hours to 22 per week, and have cut unpaid hours, which include childcare duties and household chores, by almost three. Meanwhile, men have cut their paid hours by more than eight to 34 per week. The number of unpaid hours worked has increased by more than five a week. Will women have to work harder after the pandemic? 'We value men's work more than women's' How Covid-19 is changing women's lives Women still spend more time on childcare and spend slightly more time on ""personal care"". Men, by contrast, spend more time in front of the TV. Both spend the same amount of hours asleep. The report also highlights what it describes as a ""new divide"" across households. Women in higher-income households have seen the biggest increase in paid work, with men in lower-income households seeing a drop in their working hours - by as much as three hours a day - since the 1970s. The foundation suggests that, as a result, the gap in total hours of paid work between high and low-income households has grown from 40 minutes per week in 1974 to four hours and 20 minutes in 2014-15. One in seven workers in low-income households want to increase their hours of work, compared with just one in 30 workers in high-income households. George Bangham, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said that since the coronavirus outbreak, many households are reconsidering how they structure their days. ""Debates around how people spend their time often focus on a single goal - speeding up the move to a shorter working week to enable more time for socialising, sport and hobbies,"" he said. ""But this isn't how people's lives have changed over the past four decades, desirable as it may be. ""Men are doing less paid work, while women are doing more. Both have less time for 'play' with childcare up and leisure time down. He added that a new ""working time inequality"" has emerged. Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, said: ""The government must carry out and publish an Equality Impact Assessment of the financial and social measures it has taken so far to support people through the pandemic. ""It's vital to prevent lower income households bearing the brunt of the crisis when they were already doing less paid work than high income households and many wanted to be doing more.""

Vouchers and bikes on NHS to boost active travel,"A government scheme offering Â£50 bike repair vouchers will launch in England on Tuesday as part of plans to boost cycling and walking. An initial 50,000 vouchers will bemade available online,externallater in the day on a first-come, first-served basis. The prime minister also announced that access to bikes will be available on the NHS as part of the strategy. But Labour said many of the government's proposals were taking too long to come into effect. It comes after the governmentlaunched its obesity strategy on Monday. GPs in areas of England with poor health will be encouraged to prescribe cycling, with patients able to access bikes through their local surgery. The idea is that GP surgeries will have a stock of bicycles to lend, with training, access to cycling groups and peer support. In some cases, if they used them enough, patients would be allowed to keep them. Recent Public Health England researchfound that being overweight or obese puts people at greater risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19. Government statistics showed nearly 8% of critically ill patients in intensive care units with the virus have been morbidly obese, compared with 2.9% of the general population. Want to start cycling to work? Here's how Have 20 years of obesity policies had any effect? Bike sales surge helps Halfords through lockdown Unhealthy food deals targeted to tackle obesity Prime Minister Boris Johnson said cycling and walking have ""a huge role to play"" in tackling health and environmental challenges. ""But to build a healthier, more active nation, we need the right infrastructure, training and support in place to give people the confidence to travel on two wheels,"" he said. ""That's why now is the time to shift gears and press ahead with our biggest and boldest plans yet to boost active travel - so that everyone can feel the transformative benefits of cycling."" Former Olympic gold medal cyclist Chris Boardman, now a policy adviser to British Cycling, welcomed the plans. ""There's a quarter of households in Britain who don't have access to a car at all and we've got public transport operating at 30%, so 70% of people have got to find another way to travel or not go to work,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""This can be not only provision for people who don't have a car now, it's a consultation for the future."" The government's ""Fix Your Bike"" vouchers are being released in batches ""to help manage capacity"" and so that the scheme can be monitored before being rolled out more widely, the government said. They will typically cover the bill for a standard service and the replacement of a basic component such as an inner tube or cable. During a Downing Street briefing in May, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the initiative would be ""available from next month"". But the Department for Transport (DfT) said in July that it would only begin when maintenance shops could handle the expected spike in demand. Halfords reported a surge in bike sales during lockdown Halfords says it has thousands of slots available each day for customers to bring their bikes into stores to identify potential faults which could be rectified under the scheme. ""We think the government's 'Fix Your Bike' voucher scheme will not only help individuals become more confident about keeping their bikes maintained, but will help speed up the cycling revolution,"" said chief executive Graham Stapleton. The retailer previously reported that bike sales had risen by 57.1%in the 13 weeks to 3 July, as people sought to avoid public transport during lockdown. Thousands of miles of new protected cycle lanes, cycle training for children and adults, and the creation of the UK's first zero-emission transport city are also part of the plans to promote cycling and walking. The initiative has been welcomed by cycling groups and environmentalists. They have long argued that Active Travel - the new phrase for walking and cycling - fulfils twin objectives of improving health and well-being, while also reducing emissions that harm people's health and fuel climate change. But they point out that the investment is less than a 10th of the Â£27bn that the government previously announced would be spent on new roads. There's now increasing pressure for that road budget to be reduced. AA head Edmund King told BBC News in April thatsome of the cash might be better spent on improving broadband. Andenvironmentalists have brought a legal challenge against the plansbecause the construction and use of the roads will increase carbon emissions when ministers are committed to reducing emissions. A recent study,externalsuggested that big carbon savings can be made by constructing cycle lanes in suburbs, to be used by e-bikes. Other measures to improve the well-being of pedestrians and cyclists include strengthening the Highway Code, improving legal protections, increasing lorry safety standards and working with the police and retailers to tackle bike thefts. The plans will be funded by a Â£2bn investment announced in February. Mr Shapps said it was a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a shift in attitudes"" to make cycling or walking part of daily routines. Matt Mallinder, director of the charity Cycling UK, said the plan ""places cycling at the heart of our towns and cities"", but he called for even more funding ""to truly shift gears"". Kerry McCarthy, Labour shadow cycling minister also said that the Conservative party had ""failed to seize the opportunity this crisis has posed"". ""Although funding is welcome, cyclists will be rightly concerned about how long it is going to take to actually put these plans into practice.""

WHO: Covid-19 the 'most severe' crisis we've faced,"Coronavirus is the WHO's sixth global health emergency Covid-19 is easily the most severe global health emergency ever declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), its leader has said. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he would reconvene the WHO's emergency committee this week for a review. There have been five other global health emergencies: Ebola (two outbreaks), Zika, polio and swine flu. More than 16m cases of Covid-19 have been reported since January, and more than 650,000 deaths. ""When I declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January... there were less than 100 cases outside of China, and no deaths,"" Dr Tedros said. ""Covid-19 has changed our world. It has brought people, communities and nations together, and driven them apart."" Spain races to save tourism as cases surge UK in talks over air bridges for Balearic and Canary Islands The total number of cases, he added, had roughly doubled in the past six weeks. Although the world had made a huge effort in fighting the virus, there remained ""a long hard road ahead of us"", he said. In other developments: US President Donald Trump'snational security adviser, Robert O'Brien, has tested positive for coronavirus. He is the highest-ranking official in the administration known to have tested positive Spain insists recent outbreaks of new cases were isolated and the country is safe for tourists to visit, after the UK introduced new measures requiring visitors from Spain to quarantine for 14 days Vietnam has closed the coastal city of Da Nang to tourists, after 15 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases were recorded there - the first in the country since April US biotech company Moderna has begun the final phase of clinical trials for a potential Covid-19 vaccine. Some 30,000 volunteers are taking part in the third and last phase of testing before the vaccine can be submitted to a regulatory authority for evaluation and possible approval Belgium is tightening restrictions to try to avoid another lockdown because of a worrying rise in the number of its cases. From Wednesday, Belgians will be allowed to see a maximum of five people outside of their families. Currently a Belgian individual can meet 15 people in a ""social bubble"" This video can not be played Zhang Hai's father died with coronavirus after travelling to Wuhan, China, for routine surgery just before the lockdown At Monday's briefing in Geneva, Switzerland,  the WHO also said travel restrictions could not be the answer for the long term, and countries had to do more to halt the spread by adopting proven strategies such as social distancing and wearing masks. ""It is going to be almost impossible for individual countries to keep their borders shut for the foreseeable future. Economies have to open up, people have to work, trade has to resume,"" WHO emergencies programme director Mike Ryan said. WHO officials acknowledged however that further lockdowns in countries experiencing renewed outbreaks may be necessary, but suggested they should be as short as possible, and confined to as small a geographic area as possible (ie local lockdowns).

Hilary Mantel leads Booker Prize longlist,"Hilary Mantel has won the Booker Prize twice - for Wolf Hall in 2009 and 2012's Bring Up the Bodies Hilary Mantel's The Mirror & The Light is among the novels longlisted for this year's Booker Prize. It is the third book in the author's Cromwell trilogy, and was selected for its ""masterful exhibition of sly dialogue and exquisite description,"" the judges said. Mantel has previously won the prize twice - for the first two novels in the trilogy. The longlist will be whittled down from 13 to a shortlist of six in September. British nominees this year include Gabriel Krauze, Douglas Stuart and Sophie Ward. Zimbabwean writer Tsitsi Dangarembga was nominated, like Mantel, for the third novel in her own trilogy - entitled This Mournable Body. This year's longlist - nicknamed the 'Booker's dozen' - features eight debut novels. Atwood and Evaristo share Booker Prize Queenie author 'proud' but 'sad' to win book award The prize, which has been going since 1969, was last year won jointly by Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo. The annual longlist was compiled from 162 English-language novels published in the UK or Ireland. Margaret Busby, chair of the 2020 judges, said that each of the titles on this year's list was ""deserving of wide readership"". ""Included are novels carried by the sweep of history with memorable characters brought to life and given visibility, novels that represent a moment of cultural change, or the pressures an individual faces in pre- and post-dystopian society,"" she said in a statement. Atwood praised Evaristo for encouraging black female writers ""Some of the books focus on interpersonal relationships that are complex, nuanced, emotionally charged. There are voices from minorities often unheard, stories that are fresh, bold and absorbing,"" she added. ""The best fiction enables the reader to relate to other people's lives; sharing experiences that we could not ourselves have imagined is as powerful as being able to identify with characters."" The shortlist of six books will be announced on 15 September, with the Â£50,000-prize winning author being revealed in November.

Facebook takes the EU to court over privacy spat,"Facebook will be challenged on whether its current practices respect EU citizens' right to privacy Facebook has pushed back against a European Union investigation into its practices, taking it to court over privacy concerns. Two investigations are being carried out into Facebook to find out if it breaches competition laws. To gather information, the European Commission has demanded internal documents from Facebook that include 2,500 specific key phrases. Facebook says that means handing over unrelated but highly sensitive data. The European Commission says it will defend the case in court, and its investigation into Facebook's potential anticompetitive conduct is ongoing. The social media giant has filed an appeal to the EU courts, arguing against the breadth of the document requests. ""We are cooperating with the commission and would expect to give them hundreds of thousands of documents,"" said Tim Lamb, Facebook's competition lawyer. ""The exceptionally broad nature of the commission's requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the commission's investigations, including highly sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information, personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees."" A Facebook spokesperson stressed the company is not trying to hold up the investigation, saying the firm has been very forthcoming with information so far. He said Brussels' request for any documents which include the phrases ""big question"", ""shut down"" and ""not good for us"" could even force Facebook to hand over confidential security assessments of its California headquarters.

Hamilton deletes vaccine conspiracy theory post,"Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton has issued a statement ""clarifying his thoughts"" and confirming he is not anti-vaccine after sharing a video linked to unfounded conspiracy theories about a coronavirus vaccination. Hamilton originally shared the post about Bill Gates and vaccine trials on his Instagram story to his 18 million followers. It stayed up for 13 hours before he deleted it. The F1 driver has now issued a statement on the same platform, explaining that he ""hadn't actually seen the comment attached"" to the post in question, saying that he's ""only human"". The post that Hamilton shared featured a video of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates being interviewed on US television about progress being made on a coronavirus vaccine. In the interview, Mr Gates addresses concerns about side effects reported during vaccine trials - and also dismisses unfounded rumours that the vaccines are a way of ""microchipping"" people. The account which posted the video, 'Kingbach' (which has more than 19 million followers), has added the caption: ""I remember when I told my first lie"" (along with a laughing emoji). It suggests that Bill Gates's reassurances over vaccine safety and his dismissal of the conspiracy theory are untrue. The original Instagram post shared by Hamilton remains on the site with more than one million views. BBC News has contacted Facebook - which owns Instagram - for comment. Hamilton was widely criticised on Twitter and other social media sites for sharing the post. Bill Gates has found himself at the centre of a number of baseless conspiracy theories during the coronavirus pandemic. Most centre on his support for and funding of vaccine research - and previous comments he's made about pandemics. False claims range from suggestions that Bill Gates and his wife Melinda created Covid-19 in order to profit from a vaccine to the unfounded conspiracy theory that the pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips in humans. The Gates Foundation has called the claims ""false"" andBBC Reality Check has debunked them. In the clarification issued on his Instagram story, Hamilton said he'd ""noticed some comments"" on his original post and could understand why his thoughts ""might have been misinterpreted"". He said he had not seen the comment attached to the video he shared and ""has a lot of respect for the charity work Bill Gates does"". He added: ""I also want to be clear that I'm not against a vaccine and no doubt it will be important in the fight against coronavirus"" - although he did express concerns about potential side effects and how a vaccine might be funded.

Gold hits record high as investor jitters spread,"Gold hit a record high on Monday as increasing numbers of nervous investors sought a safe place to put their money. Rising political tensions between the US and China joined the ever-present worries over the continuing coronavirus pandemic to boost the spot price to $1,944.92 an ounce, Covid-19 cases have risen to more than 16 million globally. Many investors shun gold as it does not pay dividends or earn interest, but its price tends to rise in troubled times, Interest rates are currently near zero and dividend returns from companies are uncertain at best, with so many struggling. So far this year, gold prices have risen 28%. As well as lacking in returns, investing in gold brings costs. Adrian Ash, director of research at precious metals trader BullionVault, says storage costs (with insurance included) are 0.12% of the size of your investment per year. Each bar weighs 400 Troy ounces (12.5kg) and is currently worth Â£600,000 at today's prices, so that would cost about Â£60 per month. It is trading in these large bars that creates the ""spot"" price. The bars are how the wholesale industrial and investment gold markets move metal around, and any other form of gold you buy - whether a bracelet or a coin or the microchips in your smartphone - starts out in this larger form, adding costs at every stage of manufacture. However, Mr Ash says that if you fancy visiting your haul, you cannot. ""It's hard to over-state the level of security at professional bullion vaults, and for the vast majority of people, being shown a shiny yellow brick wouldn't prove much anyway."" He says his customers can take their metal out from the vault if they wish. ""We would arrange delivery, most usually in the form of smaller bars, although that necessarily triggers the extra manufacturing and shipping costs you otherwise avoid by owning wholesale bullion inside secure storage."" Unlike shares and bonds, investors in physical gold products do not get any return on their investment. There are no dividends or interest rates and no protection against inflation. Plus you pay to store it. The value simply rises and falls on investor demand. A fall in the value of the dollar is another factor that boosts the price of gold, which is quoted in the US currency. It means that buyers using other currencies can, in fact, be paying the same for their gold, as they are able to buy more dollars for their money. The dollar index - which measures its value against a range of currencies - has fallen to its lowest since September 2018 following increasing tensions between the US and China. China took over the premises of the US consulate in the south western city of Chengdu. The move was in retaliation for the US closing down China's diplomatic base in Houston, Texas. Later this week, the US central bank, meets to decide on monetary policy. Mihir Kapadia, head of Sun Global Investments, thinks that could also help boost the gold price further. ""With eyes on the upcoming Fed policy meeting later this week and more concerns over geopolitical tensions, further gains can be expected with these factors likely to weigh heavily on the stock markets for a few more weeks to come."" The price of fellow precious metal silver was also higher. It rose more than 6% to $24.36 per ounce, its highest since September 2013. Rare look inside Bank of England's gold vaults.

Vouchers and bikes on NHS to boost active travelThe prime minister says GPs in areas with poor health will be encouraged to prescribe cycling.Business,"A government scheme offering Â£50 bike repair vouchers will launch in England on Tuesday as part of plans to boost cycling and walking. An initial 50,000 vouchers will bemade available online,externallater in the day on a first-come, first-served basis. The prime minister also announced that access to bikes will be available on the NHS as part of the strategy. But Labour said many of the government's proposals were taking too long to come into effect. It comes after the governmentlaunched its obesity strategy on Monday. GPs in areas of England with poor health will be encouraged to prescribe cycling, with patients able to access bikes through their local surgery. The idea is that GP surgeries will have a stock of bicycles to lend, with training, access to cycling groups and peer support. In some cases, if they used them enough, patients would be allowed to keep them. Recent Public Health England researchfound that being overweight or obese puts people at greater risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19. Government statistics showed nearly 8% of critically ill patients in intensive care units with the virus have been morbidly obese, compared with 2.9% of the general population. Want to start cycling to work? Here's how Have 20 years of obesity policies had any effect? Bike sales surge helps Halfords through lockdown Unhealthy food deals targeted to tackle obesity Prime Minister Boris Johnson said cycling and walking have ""a huge role to play"" in tackling health and environmental challenges. ""But to build a healthier, more active nation, we need the right infrastructure, training and support in place to give people the confidence to travel on two wheels,"" he said. ""That's why now is the time to shift gears and press ahead with our biggest and boldest plans yet to boost active travel - so that everyone can feel the transformative benefits of cycling."" Former Olympic gold medal cyclist Chris Boardman, now a policy adviser to British Cycling, welcomed the plans. ""There's a quarter of households in Britain who don't have access to a car at all and we've got public transport operating at 30%, so 70% of people have got to find another way to travel or not go to work,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""This can be not only provision for people who don't have a car now, it's a consultation for the future."" The government's ""Fix Your Bike"" vouchers are being released in batches ""to help manage capacity"" and so that the scheme can be monitored before being rolled out more widely, the government said. They will typically cover the bill for a standard service and the replacement of a basic component such as an inner tube or cable. During a Downing Street briefing in May, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the initiative would be ""available from next month"". But the Department for Transport (DfT) said in July that it would only begin when maintenance shops could handle the expected spike in demand. Halfords reported a surge in bike sales during lockdown Halfords says it has thousands of slots available each day for customers to bring their bikes into stores to identify potential faults which could be rectified under the scheme. ""We think the government's 'Fix Your Bike' voucher scheme will not only help individuals become more confident about keeping their bikes maintained, but will help speed up the cycling revolution,"" said chief executive Graham Stapleton. The retailer previously reported that bike sales had risen by 57.1%in the 13 weeks to 3 July, as people sought to avoid public transport during lockdown. Thousands of miles of new protected cycle lanes, cycle training for children and adults, and the creation of the UK's first zero-emission transport city are also part of the plans to promote cycling and walking. The initiative has been welcomed by cycling groups and environmentalists. They have long argued that Active Travel - the new phrase for walking and cycling - fulfils twin objectives of improving health and well-being, while also reducing emissions that harm people's health and fuel climate change. But they point out that the investment is less than a 10th of the Â£27bn that the government previously announced would be spent on new roads. There's now increasing pressure for that road budget to be reduced. AA head Edmund King told BBC News in April thatsome of the cash might be better spent on improving broadband. Andenvironmentalists have brought a legal challenge against the plansbecause the construction and use of the roads will increase carbon emissions when ministers are committed to reducing emissions. A recent study,externalsuggested that big carbon savings can be made by constructing cycle lanes in suburbs, to be used by e-bikes. Other measures to improve the well-being of pedestrians and cyclists include strengthening the Highway Code, improving legal protections, increasing lorry safety standards and working with the police and retailers to tackle bike thefts. The plans will be funded by a Â£2bn investment announced in February. Mr Shapps said it was a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a shift in attitudes"" to make cycling or walking part of daily routines. Matt Mallinder, director of the charity Cycling UK, said the plan ""places cycling at the heart of our towns and cities"", but he called for even more funding ""to truly shift gears"". Kerry McCarthy, Labour shadow cycling minister also said that the Conservative party had ""failed to seize the opportunity this crisis has posed"". ""Although funding is welcome, cyclists will be rightly concerned about how long it is going to take to actually put these plans into practice.""

Bus builder Alexander Dennis to cut 650 jobs,"Alexander Dennis has been owned by group of Scottish investors since 2004 Bus builder Alexander Dennis Limited is expected to cut 650 jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Falkirk-based firm employs 2,300 people, including 1,000 at its Scottish factory and head office. The workforce were told on Monday that more than quarter of them are at risk of redundancy, following a 45-day consultation. Britain's biggest bus builder wasbought by a Canadian companylast year for Â£320m. But since the lockdown passenger numbers and, as a result, orders for new buses have plummeted. ADL chief executive Colin Robertson said: ""A few short months ago, we were looking at a record year of sales, reaping the benefits of all our investment in new technology, new products and new markets. ""All of this changed with the impact of Covid-19."" Douglas Fraser blog: Bus builders, hold very tight, please Despite the support offered by the UK government's job retention scheme he added that industry is facing an ""unprecedented crisis"". Managers in Falkirk have been appealing to the Scottish and UK governments to step in and save thousands of industry jobs, citing the prime minister's commitment to renewing Britain's bus fleet with lower-emission models. ADL chief executive Colin Robertson (left) with NFI president Paul Soubry after the Canadian company bought Alexander Dennis last year But no special deal for the sector has been agreed. Unite Scotland described the news as ""devastating"" for the workforce and their families. Regional officer Willie Thomson said: ""We believe these actions are premature and urge the company to continue to explore all options to protect jobs and livelihoods. ""We stand ready to work with them to achieve this. ""Covid-19 has had a significant impact on the bus industry with the collapse of new orders from operators due to the crisis."" The union also called on both the Scottish and UK governments to support the industry. Mr Thomson added: ""The Alexander Dennis workforce has a crucial role to play in a cleaner and greener future for both our economy and our communities. ""We will be fully engaging with the company in the coming weeks and we will do all we can to save these jobs. ""Each job is a worker, a family affected, and they shouldn't be the ones to pay the price for this crisis."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the industry was one with ""a bright future, but short-term difficulties"". He added: ""This news is deeply concerning and any redundancies following from this will be a hammer blow, both to the workforce and their families as well as Scotland's manufacturing base. ""That's why no stone should be left unturned to save these jobs."" Scottish Conservative Central Scotland MSP Alison Harris said: ""It's essential both the UK and Scottish governments work together to try and save as many of these jobs as possible, and ensure the company can continue its pioneering work in the future."" ADL's head office is in Larbert and its main factory is in Camelon. It also employs workers in Guildford and Scarborough. Alexander Dennis, which is the world's largest producer of double-decker buses, was acquired by a group of Scottish investors in 2004. Stagecoach founders Sir Brian Souter and Dame Ann Gloag owned more than half the company, which is now part of the NFI Group, which makes buses for the North American market.

'Flexibility' this year over staying on for A-level,"Schools and colleges in England are being told by the exams watchdog to be more lenient this year about letting pupils stay on to take A-levels. Even if pupils do not get the required GCSE grades, Ofqual is calling for ""greater flexibility"". A-levels and GCSE exams were cancelled in the pandemic and exam boards will issue replacement results. The exams watchdog says schools should put ""slightly less weight"" on pupils getting ""one or two lower grades"". If pupils do not get the results they expect they can take written exams in the autumn - but that would be too late for those taking GCSEs who planned to start A-level courses in September. A-levels and GCSE results to be higher this summer Risk of bias in exam results this summer, say MPs Teachers to grade results for cancelled exams Back-up exams for all subjects in autumn Ofqual has written to schools and colleges saying this year they might look beyond specific grades and consider ""other robust evidence"", such as ""if you already know a student and their potential well"". ""You may wish to consider the approach you take for certain students, given they did not have the opportunity to sit exams and other assessments,"" says the letter from the chief regulator, Sally Collier. This summer's results will be based on factors including teachers' predicted grades, results in previous exams, performance of the school in previous years and how the school ranked pupils in order of how well they expected them to achieve. Ofqual warns that teachers could be investigated for malpractice if they tell pupils or parents the predicted grades or rankings submitted by schools before exam boards issue their results. However, the watchdog says this information can be shared after the exam results are published. Last week Ofqual announced that exam results would be more generous this year - with 2% more pupils getting A grades or above at A-level and 1% more getting grade 4 or above at GCSE. Teachers had been even more optimistic in their predicted grades, although the moderation process to keep results in line with previous years means many of these predicted grades will have been lowered. There have been fears of ""unconscious bias"" in the results, but Ofqual says there is no evidence of any widening gaps in terms of ethnicity, gender or deprivation, compared with years when pupils have taken exams. There could still be questions about the results of individual pupils, such as those who perform better in exams than in coursework or in schools which rapidly improve above their performance in previous years.

France announces ban on outside heaters,"Heated terraces became ubiquitous in France in the 1990s, when smoking bans came into force France's government has announced new environmental measures, including a ban on heated terraces for cafes and bars. Ecology Minister Barbara Pompili said outside heating or air conditioning was an ""ecological aberration"". The ban would not come into force until after the winter as restaurants have been hard hit by Covid-19, she added. All heated or air-conditioned buildings open to the public will also have to keep their doors closed to avoid wasting energy. Ms Pompili told reporters it was wrong for shops to ""air-condition the streets"" in summer by keeping their doors open just to spare customers from having to open them. ""Neither should terraces be heated in winter so people can feel warm as they drink coffee,"" she said. Summers could become 'too hot for humans' 'Rising chance' of exceeding 1.5C target Trade groups say more than 75% of restaurants and cafes in the Paris area have a heated terrace. A few French cities have already banned them but Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo refused to do so, saying it would be too much of a blow to businesses. Ms Pompili said officials would talk to owners about ways of implementing the measure after the winter. She was appointed by new Prime Minister Jean Castex, who has pledged â¬20m ($23m; Â£18.2m) for climate-related investment as part of a â¬100m stimulus plan aimed at helping the economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The measures announced by Ms Pompili were proposed by the 150-member Citizens' Convention on Climate, set up by President Emmanuel Macron last year and randomly selected from members of the public. They also include the creation of two natural parks and a national nature reserve. Owners of buildings will be encouraged to improve insulation and banned from installing new coal- or oil-burning furnaces, while limits will be imposed on developments in rural areas.

VIPs and MPs boycott Twitter after Wiley tweets,"Those taking part in the boycott include MPs David Lammy and Rosena Allin-Khan, singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, actor Jason Isaacs, broadcasters Rachel Riley and Maajid Nawaz, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, and entrepreneur Lord Sugar A 48-hour boycott of Twitter by some of its users, protesting at the platform's alleged lack of action on anti-Semitism has begun. It was triggered by the actions of grime music artist Wiley, who shared several posts on Twitter on Friday. Some of the tweets were deleted, but Twitter was criticised for taking time to act and leaving some tweets up. The Prime Minister's official spokesman has said Boris Johnson believes ""Twitter needs to do better"". The offending messages ""should not have been able to remain on Twitter and Instagram for so long"", he added, and ""social media companies need to go further and faster to remove content like this"". Dozens of well-known figures supporting the two-day ""walkout"" are using the hashtags #NoSafeSpaceForJewHate and #48HoursSilence. This video can not be played WATCH: Rapper Wiley's Twitter account has been suspended after anti-Semitic posts Many of those taking part accused Twitter of ""breaking its own policies"" for not having taken a tougher line - Wiley has been temporarily suspended by Twitter but not banned. The protest formally began at 09:00BST. But since that time, other people and organisations have joined, including the accounts of Greenpeace UK, the Royal Opera House, the pop group McFly, sports broadcaster Gary Lineker, as well as members of the public. However, some people have questioned whether keeping silent is the best way to challenge online hate. Police are now investigating Wiley's tweets, and said ""enquiries remain ongoing"". The so-called ""godfather of grime"" has also been temporarily barred from Instagram. Actress and writer Tracy-Ann Oberman, who is one of those leading the movement, tweeted on Saturday that Twitter had ""allowed [Wiley] 48 hours of pure race hate"". She said that Twitter founder Jack Dorsey ""has to stick by [Twitter's] remit of anti racism. Silence is complicity. Please walk out with us."" The rallying cry was taken up by a diverse cross-section of Twitter users, including: television presenter Rachel Riley comedian Robert Webb singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor actor Jason Isaacs radio presenter and activist Maajid Nawaz businessman Lord Sugar Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis Allow Twitter content?

A host of MPs from different parties also said they would take part - including Labour's Rosena Allin-Khan and David Lammy, former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas, acting Lib Dems leader Ed Davey, and Conservative MP Jane Stevenson. Those taking part have vowed not to tweet - or use Twitter at all - from Monday morning to Wednesday morning, reflecting the 48 hours of inaction they accuse Twitter of. Some organisations are also taking part, including the Music Producers Guild, the National Children's Bureau charity, London's Southbank Centre, the Jewish Chronicle newspaper and the American Jewish Committee. Social media firms told off by MPs over hate Could a boycott kill Facebook? Karen Pollock, chief executive of the UK's Holocaust Educational Trust, tweeted her organisation's support for the move, writing that Twitter can be ""abusive, distressing and so draining"". She added: ""It is about time social media companies Twitter [and] Instagram live up to the values their users would expect."" Twitter said: ""Abuse and harassment has no place on Twitter and we strongly condemn it"". The firm highlighted its policies that ban the promotion of violence against people on the basis of religion, race or ethnicity. ""We enforce our rules judiciously and impartially for all and take action if an account violates our rules,"" it said. Wiley began posting a stream of offensive messages on social media before being temporarily banned by Twitter on Saturday Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, meanwhile, has written to Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey and Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, telling them: ""social media companies have a responsibility to act and must do so without delay"". ""This cannot be allowed to stand. Your inaction amounts to complicity."" During his tweet session, Wiley referenced conspiracy theories about Jewish people and other insulting material. He also posted extensively to Facebook-owned Instagram. Many have now been replaced with notices that the tweets are no longer available because they violated Twitter's rules. However, they had already attracted the attention of a number of public figures and the police. On Saturday, London's Metropolitan Police in Tower Hamlets tweeted that they had received ""a number of reports"" about anti-Semitic tweets, and that ""the relevant material is being assessed"". UK Home SecretaryPriti Patel said she had asked Twitter and Instagram for a full explanation, while London mayor Sadiq Khan has written to the firms, criticising their reaction. Wiley's management also dropped the artist over the weekend, saying: ""There is no place in society for anti-Semitism."" The 41-year-old artist, whose real name is Richard Cowie, is a major figure in grime music, and was made an MBE in 2018 for services to music. The anti-Semitism row has also resulted in calls for that honour to be withdrawn.

Garmin begins recovery from ransomware attack,"Garmin's tech powers all kinds of fitness trackers The American GPS and fitness-tracker company Garmin is dealing with the aftermath of a ransomware attack, the BBC has confirmed. Owners of its products had been unable to use its services since Thursday. However, some of its online tools are now being provided in a ""limited"" state,according to its online dashboard,external. Garmin has said it was ""the victim of a cyber-attack that encrypted some of our systems"". But the statement it released avoided any reference to a ransom demand. ""Many of our online services were interrupted including website functions, customer support, customer-facing applications, and company communications,"" it said. ""We have no indication that any customer data, including payment information from Garmin Pay, was accessed, lost or stolen."" The firm added that it expected all its systems to return to normal operation within a few days, but warned that there might be a ""backlog"" of user data to process. It is not known if the firm paid the blackmailers, but a source told the BBC it was in the ""final stage of recovery"". The BBC's cyber reporter Joe Tidy said the malware involved was Wasted Locker - a program that scrambles the target's data, and was first detected in the wild around April. Victims are typically contacted after their computers are infected, and told they must transfer funds if they want to return the files to their original state. Some customers have already reported that Garmin's services appear to be ""partially"" working again. Earlier reports claimed that the company had been asked to pay $10m (Â£7.79m) to get its systems back online. Twitter hack: Bitcoin exchange 'blocked 1,000 transactions' How hackers extorted $1.14m from a US university Pilots who use flyGarmin were unable to download up-to-date aviation databases, which aviation regulators such as the FAA require pilots to have, before they can fly. Customers were also unable to log into Garmin Connect to record and analyse their health and fitness data. There have been many high-profile attacks in recent months, but few victims have been as tight-lipped as Garmin. Even now, despite confirmation from many different sources across different newsrooms, the company is choosing not to admit it was ransomware. The big question is whether or not the company paid the blackmailer what is likely to be a multi-million dollar demand. It seems the company has somehow got the decryption key it needs to start bringing services back online. As well as customers and shareholders, the US authorities will be very keen to know what happened. Members of Evil Corp, the criminal group that's suspected of being behind the hack, were indicted in 2019 by the US Treasury.

Today's live page has been edited by Mal Sirat, Sean Fanning and Lauren Turner, and written by Josh Cheetham, Gareth Evans, Francesca Gillett and Doug Faulkner. Thank you for reading and please join us again tomorrow. The news in the UK has been dominated by the decision to quarantine arrivals from Spain, which was made by the government at the weekend.  You can catch up with the day's news with our evening briefinghere. It's been another busy day of developments as the coronavirus pandemic continues  to affect the lives of millions around the world. As we prepare to pause our live coverage, here are the main global headlines: This video can not be played ""We have to wear more PPE, even though we wear PPE as well on a regular basis,"" says tattooist Jules Lee, who runs a tattoo shop in Bangor. Tattoo parlours have reopened today in Wales for the first time since lockdown, along with beauty salons, spas and tanning shops. They've already opened in England, Scotland and NI. Clients have to make appointments, with no more walk-ins from the street allowed. President Jair Bolsonaro has described the virus as a ""little flu"" Health workers in Brazil have urged the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague to investigate President Jair Bolsonaro's government over its handling of the pandemic. A group claiming to represent more than one million healthcare staff has handed over a dossier of evidence to the court. It alleges that government negligence has contributed to the deaths of tens of thousands of people. The government has not responded to the complaint. Mr Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the virus as a minor threat, ignoring social distancing and calling for lockdown measures to be suspended. But Brazil has recorded nearly 2.5m infections and is second only to the United States in terms of cases and deaths from Covid-19. Traditional hot spring inns are being encouraged to boost their internet connectivity In Japan, the government is urging people to take working holidays to boost the coronavirus-hit economy. The Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said ministries would encourage tourist destinations to become more work-friendly with a new push for WiFi connectivity in hotels and traditional hot spring inns. A government scheme providing financial incentives for domestic holidaymakers is already in force in Japan, where borders remain closed to foreign visitors. But  critics have pointed to the risks of encouraging people to move around the country with the number of infections increasing. The tourism sector had been expecting a boost from the now delayed 2020 Olympic Games. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check False and misleading posts about the global hunt for a vaccine are circulating online. Weâve been fact-checking some widely shared examples. In one video, a US-based osteopath claims that Covid-19 vaccines are designed to make humans into âgenetically modified organismsâ and vaccines will change recipientsâ DNA. This is not true - there are25 different candidate vaccines,externalin clinical trials around the world according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and none of them will alter human DNA. The vaccines are all designed to provoke an immune response by training our bodies to recognise and fight the virus. The video also claims that trials are not following sound scientific protocol and weâve spotted similar concerns in Facebook groups. ""New vaccines undergo rigorous safety checks before they can be recommended for widespread use,"" says Michelle Roberts, the BBC's online health editor. As weâve seen throughout the pandemic, this video uses scientific language which will be unfamiliar to many people, making it difficult for them to assess whatâs accurate or not. We can help - if thereâs a claim youâd like us to investigate,get in touch with the Reality Check team here. And you can read the article in full here. Antwerp is the focus of concern now in Belgium Belgium is tightening restrictions - but avoiding another lockdown - because of a worrying rise in Covid-19 cases. From Wednesday, Belgians will be allowed to see a maximum of five people
outside of their families. Currently a Belgian individual can meet 15 people in a ""social bubble"". The rise in cases has been especially sharp in the city of Antwerp. In the past week an average of 279 people daily have caught coronavirus in Belgium,
compared with 163 a day the week before. The current death toll officially is 9,821. ""Until now, the 'social bubble'
of each person was limited to 15 people per week. From Wednesday, it will be
limited to five people, always the same ones, for the next four weeks, and this
for an entire family,"" said PM Sophie WilmÃ¨s. ""So we are counting for the household and no longer per
person. Children under the age of 12 do not count in those five people."" Belgium is also halving the numbers allowed at public gatherings - to 100 indoors, and 200 outdoors. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter Lewis Hamilton has more than 18 million followers on Instagram F1 Driver Lewis
Hamilton has issued a statement to ""clarify his thoughts"" after sharing a video
that fuels conspiracy theories about Bill Gates and a coronavirus vaccine. He shared the original post on his Instagram story to over 18 million followers for 13 hours - but in
a new post he's now said he ""hadnât seen the comment attached"" and that he's ""only human"". The video was
from a large Instagram account that features Gates being interviewed on US
television about progress being made on a coronavirus vaccine - with the
caption ""I remember when I told my first lie"" (the caption was not written by Hamilton). In the video, Gates addresses concerns about side effects reported during ongoing vaccine
trials - and also dismisses unfounded rumours that the vaccines are a way of
microchipping people (claims which Reality Check has debunked) However, the
caption suggests that both his dismissal and reassurances about the vaccine are
untrue. Hamilton has
since said that he's ""not against a vaccine"" and that it ""will be important in
the fight against coronavirus"". Here are some of the main stories we've been covering today. The Miami Marlins opened their season on Friday but a number of players have since tested positive Less than a week after the Major League Baseball (MLB) season launched, two games have been postponed due to outbreaks of the virus. Games between the Miami Marlins and Baltimore Orioles in Florida, and the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees in Pennsylvania, had been scheduled for Monday but have now been cancelled. The decision followed reports in US media that 10 members of the Marlins - eight players and two coaches - had tested positive for the virus. That would bring the total number of cases on the team to 14. It comes just days after the MLB began its season, which was delayed for four months because of the pandemic The MLB said in a statement that the games were postponed while it ""conducts additional Covid-19 testing"". It is expected to hold an emergency meeting in the coming days. Tour operator Jet2 has cancelled flights to Spain and Portugal following the latest UK government guidance. The company said it was suspending routes to Almeria, Alicante, Malaga and Murcia from Tuesday up to and including August 16, as well as to Faro, in the Algarve region of Portugal. A spokesperson said Jet2 would be monitoring the situation closely and that it would be proactively contacting customers already in the countries to inform them of their options. Its announcement came before the Foreign Office updated its non-essential travel advice for Spain to include the Spanish islands. On Saturday a 14-day quarantine was introduced for visitors returning from Spain after an increase in coronavirus cases there. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesperson said: ""We have considered the overall situation for British nationals travelling to and from the Balearic and Canary Islands, including the impact of the requirement to self-isolate on return to the UK, and concluded that we should advise British nationals against all non-essential travel to the whole of Spain."" The FCO added that while people currently in Spain will have to self-isolate upon their return they are not being advised to cut short their visits. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has updated its travel advice for Spain, stating that people should not make non-essential journeys to any part of the country, including the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands. Read the full advice here.,external Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock wrote in theDaily Telegraph this morning,external: âIf everyone who is overweight lost five pounds it could save the NHS over Â£100 million over the next five years.â That figure is based on the finding inthis research,external, which looked at savings in treating things like cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and strokes if all overweight people lost 2.5kg. What the government has done is to extend those findings across the 27.2 million overweight adults in the UK. The result seems remarkably small. Itâs a saving of less than Â£4 per person over five years. In terms of the overall budget of the NHS itâs also a very small amount of money saved â about one hundredth of a percent. The government hasunveiled a range of measures amid growing evidence of a link between obesity and increased risk from Covid-19. BBC medical drama Holby City has resumed filming for the first time in four months, with a special episode that sees the hospital gripped by the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, the BBC said the drama will be back on screens later this year with slightly shorter 40-minute episodes. It added that, throughout the production, the Holby City team would practice social distancing and have other protocols in place to ensure workplace safety. The UK decision to make arrivals from Spain self-isolate has shocked the tourism industry After the UK imposed a 14-day quarantine on all arrivals
from Spain, a Spanish tourism group has offered to pay for tourists to take
coronavirus tests. Jorge Marichal, head of Spainâs Confederation of Hotels and
Tourist Accommodation (CEHAT), has called for a Europe-wide programme of reciprocal
visitor testing to help the embattled tourism sector. Describing the UK government quarantine order as âa surprise
and a disappointmentâ, he said decisions should be taken ""at a
European levelâ for the âmaximum safety of tourists, workers and residents of
tourist areasâ. A similar debate is brewing in Germany, where the government
is coming under pressure to make testing mandatory for people returning from high-risk
countries. On Friday authorities made free tests available voluntarily
for people coming back from countries like Brazil, Turkey and the US, but some
politicians want it to be compulsory. One of the top stories in the UK today has been about obesity, as the government unveils its new strategy to tackle the health issue in England. The plan includes a ban on ""buy one get one free"" deals on unhealthy food and new rules for displaying calories on menus. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the plans will also help in the ongoing work to control Covid-19. They will ""reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus,"" he said. It comes amid growing evidence of a link between obesity and an increased risk of complications from coronavirus. Government statistics showed nearly 8% of critically ill patients in intensive care units with the virus have been morbidly obese, compared with 2.9% of the general population. Johnson said he had been ""steadily building up my fitness"" after recovering from coronavirus. ""I'm at least a stone down, I'm more than a stone down,"" he said. The mass took place at the Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona The head of the regional government of Catalonia, in north-eastern Spain, has called for the Catholic Church to be penalised over a mass that breached coronavirus restrictions. The gathering in Barcelona's famous Sagrada Familia basilica was held to commemorate victims of the pandemic on Sunday. Social distancing measures were in place, but the numbers attending exceeded the decreed maximum of ten. Catalan President Quim Torra said a collective effort was needed to tackle the region's growing outbreak, which he described as ""very worrying"". Spain's rate of infection has jumped in recent days. While the outbreak remains under control in many parts, certain areas - in particular Catalonia and the neighbouring region of AragÃ³n - have seen a huge spike in infections. Local authorities have issued stay-at-home orders for some four million residents in Catalonia, including in the regional capital Barcelona. Earlier today, Mr Torra said even stricter lockdown measures could be imposed if infection numbers did not improve in the next 10 days. Natalie Sherman & Zoe ThomasBusiness reporters, New York Demand at food banks in the US has surged during the pandemic In the US, the $600 (Â£465) a week additional payment that the government approved to top up unemployment benefits during the pandemic will expire on 31 July. In many states, recipients have already received their last cheque. ""It's pretty dire,"" says Brandon Humberston, who worked as a cook at Mexican restaurant until the pandemic cost him his job. His benefits will be cut from $750 to $150. ""My generation is hanging on by a thread."" Politicians in Washington have yet to act. While Democrats have proposed another $3tn in spending, Republicans have rejected that plan and they are divided about how much more aid - if any - is warranted. The fate of the unemployment benefits that Mr Humberston - and an estimated 30 million other Americans rely on - is giving the debate a sense of urgency. You can read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Coronavirus: Evening updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Monday evening.,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has updated its travel advice to Spain. Britons are now advised against all non-essential travel to the country, including the Balearic and Canary Islands, based on the current assessment of Covid-19 risks there. It comes after a quarantine for travellers returning to the UK from Spain was reintroduced over the weekend. We've been answering your questions about the travel rules for Spainhere. Meanwhile,Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is leaving a family holiday in Spain earlyto return to the UK, after the new restrictions came into force. This video can not be played Expert advice: Alistair Rowland, Pippa Jacks and Kevin Poulter answer quarantine questions Forecasters are warning the UK economy could take until 2024 to return to the size it was before lockdown.Analysis from the EY Item Club, which uses a similar economic model to the Treasury, suggests unemployment will rise to 9% from 3.9%. It also estimates the economy will shrink by 11.5% this year, worse than the 8% it predicted only a month ago. The Item Club says consumers have been more cautious than expected, while growth is also being dampened by low business investment. A pet cathas become the first animal in the UK to test positivefor the strain of coronavirus causing the current pandemic. It's thought the cat caught coronavirus from its owner, who had previously tested positive for the virus. But experts say there's no cause for alarm - they stress the case is very rare and does not mean the disease is being spread to people by their pets. We've looked at the evidence on pets catching Covid-19here. A small number of coronavirus cases in pets have been found in Europe, North America and Asia Men aged 18 to 34 from ethnic minority groups were twice as likely to be fined for breaching lockdown laws as young white men,new figures suggest. Overall, those from minority ethnic groups were 1.6 times more likely to be fined than white people, according to a report by the National Police Chiefs' Council. NPCC chairman Martin Hewitt said it was ""a concern to see disparity"" but it was a ""complex picture"" and each force would work to ""mitigate any risks of bias - conscious or unconscious"". You can read more about the powers police have to enforce lockdown ruleshere. Scottish pilot Stephen Cameron made headlines around the world after surviving for more than two months on a ventilator in Vietnam. Now recovering in hospital back in the UK, the 42-year-old from Motherwellis warning Britons ""not to be blasÃ©"" about the virus. He told the BBC he was a ""living example"" of how serious it can be, while his doctors said he now faces ""a long path"" to recovery.

UK economy 'might not recover until 2024',"The UK economy could take until 2024 to return to the size it was before the coronavirus lockdown, according to analysis from the EY Item Club. The forecasters, who use a similar economic model to the Treasury, suggest unemployment will rise to 9% from 3.9%. They also estimate the economy will shrink by 11.5% this year, worse than the 8% they predicted only a month ago. Consumers have been more cautious than expected, they said, while low business investment will dampen growth. As a result, they now expect the post-coronavirus economic recovery to take 18 months longer than previously forecast. However, the Item Club says it is early days and useful data has only recently been made available. ""Unsurprisingly, without hard data, a wide range of views on the performance and outlook for the UK economy emerged,"" said Mark Gregory, UK chief economist at EY. What jobs are available post-lockdown? Retail sales near pre-lockdown levels in June Rules v fear: What's delaying economic recovery? Last week, the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane told MPsthe UK economy had ""clawed back"" about half the fall in outputit saw during the peak of the coronavirus lockdown in March and April. There had been a V-shaped ""bounceback"", he said, referring tothe shape that indicates a rapid economic recovery. Last month, Mr Haldane said the economy was ""on track for a quick recovery"". However, other economists have expressed doubts about the potential for such a swift recovery in activity. ""Even though lockdown restrictions are easing, consumer caution has been much more pronounced than expected,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ""We believe that consumer confidence is one of three key factors likely to weigh on the UK economy over the rest of the year, alongside the impact of rising unemployment and low levels of business investment. ""The UK economy may be past its low point but it is looking increasingly likely that the climb back is going to be a lot longer than expected."" The government has moved to cut taxes, support wages and offer incentives to spend in an effort to keep the economy going and encourage consumers to spend. Earlier this month,Chancellor Rishi Sunak cut VAT on hospitalityand promised to pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. Buthe also conceded that not every job would be saved, and his Â£30bn package was criticised for helping certain sectors, such as restaurants and tourism, but ignoring others. Last month,the Bank of England said it would pump an extra Â£100bn into the UK economyto help fight the ""unprecedented"" coronavirus-induced downturn. What jobs are available post-lockdown?

"Bus builder Alexander Dennis to cut 650 jobsThe Falkirk-based firm has confirmed a quarter of its 2,300 employees are at risk of redundancy.Scotland business","Alexander Dennis has been owned by group of Scottish investors since 2004 Bus builder Alexander Dennis Limited is expected to cut 650 jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Falkirk-based firm employs 2,300 people, including 1,000 at its Scottish factory and head office. The workforce were told on Monday that more than quarter of them are at risk of redundancy, following a 45-day consultation. Britain's biggest bus builder wasbought by a Canadian companylast year for Â£320m. But since the lockdown passenger numbers and, as a result, orders for new buses have plummeted. ADL chief executive Colin Robertson said: ""A few short months ago, we were looking at a record year of sales, reaping the benefits of all our investment in new technology, new products and new markets. ""All of this changed with the impact of Covid-19."" Douglas Fraser blog: Bus builders, hold very tight, please Despite the support offered by the UK government's job retention scheme he added that industry is facing an ""unprecedented crisis"". Managers in Falkirk have been appealing to the Scottish and UK governments to step in and save thousands of industry jobs, citing the prime minister's commitment to renewing Britain's bus fleet with lower-emission models. ADL chief executive Colin Robertson (left) with NFI president Paul Soubry after the Canadian company bought Alexander Dennis last year But no special deal for the sector has been agreed. Unite Scotland described the news as ""devastating"" for the workforce and their families. Regional officer Willie Thomson said: ""We believe these actions are premature and urge the company to continue to explore all options to protect jobs and livelihoods. ""We stand ready to work with them to achieve this. ""Covid-19 has had a significant impact on the bus industry with the collapse of new orders from operators due to the crisis."" The union also called on both the Scottish and UK governments to support the industry. Mr Thomson added: ""The Alexander Dennis workforce has a crucial role to play in a cleaner and greener future for both our economy and our communities. ""We will be fully engaging with the company in the coming weeks and we will do all we can to save these jobs. ""Each job is a worker, a family affected, and they shouldn't be the ones to pay the price for this crisis."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the industry was one with ""a bright future, but short-term difficulties"". He added: ""This news is deeply concerning and any redundancies following from this will be a hammer blow, both to the workforce and their families as well as Scotland's manufacturing base. ""That's why no stone should be left unturned to save these jobs."" Scottish Conservative Central Scotland MSP Alison Harris said: ""It's essential both the UK and Scottish governments work together to try and save as many of these jobs as possible, and ensure the company can continue its pioneering work in the future."" ADL's head office is in Larbert and its main factory is in Camelon. It also employs workers in Guildford and Scarborough. Alexander Dennis, which is the world's largest producer of double-decker buses, was acquired by a group of Scottish investors in 2004. Stagecoach founders Sir Brian Souter and Dame Ann Gloag owned more than half the company, which is now part of the NFI Group, which makes buses for the North American market.

"Garmin begins recovery from ransomware attackThe fitness-tracking gadget-maker was hit by Wasted Locker, a program that scrambled its data.","Garmin's tech powers all kinds of fitness trackers The American GPS and fitness-tracker company Garmin is dealing with the aftermath of a ransomware attack, the BBC has confirmed. Owners of its products had been unable to use its services since Thursday. However, some of its online tools are now being provided in a ""limited"" state,according to its online dashboard,external. Garmin has said it was ""the victim of a cyber-attack that encrypted some of our systems"". But the statement it released avoided any reference to a ransom demand. ""Many of our online services were interrupted including website functions, customer support, customer-facing applications, and company communications,"" it said. ""We have no indication that any customer data, including payment information from Garmin Pay, was accessed, lost or stolen."" The firm added that it expected all its systems to return to normal operation within a few days, but warned that there might be a ""backlog"" of user data to process. It is not known if the firm paid the blackmailers, but a source told the BBC it was in the ""final stage of recovery"". The BBC's cyber reporter Joe Tidy said the malware involved was Wasted Locker - a program that scrambles the target's data, and was first detected in the wild around April. Victims are typically contacted after their computers are infected, and told they must transfer funds if they want to return the files to their original state. Some customers have already reported that Garmin's services appear to be ""partially"" working again. Earlier reports claimed that the company had been asked to pay $10m (Â£7.79m) to get its systems back online. Twitter hack: Bitcoin exchange 'blocked 1,000 transactions' How hackers extorted $1.14m from a US university Pilots who use flyGarmin were unable to download up-to-date aviation databases, which aviation regulators such as the FAA require pilots to have, before they can fly. Customers were also unable to log into Garmin Connect to record and analyse their health and fitness data. There have been many high-profile attacks in recent months, but few victims have been as tight-lipped as Garmin. Even now, despite confirmation from many different sources across different newsrooms, the company is choosing not to admit it was ransomware. The big question is whether or not the company paid the blackmailer what is likely to be a multi-million dollar demand. It seems the company has somehow got the decryption key it needs to start bringing services back online. As well as customers and shareholders, the US authorities will be very keen to know what happened. Members of Evil Corp, the criminal group that's suspected of being behind the hack, were indicted in 2019 by the US Treasury.

"France announces ban on outside heatersThe new ecology minister says outside heating or air conditioning is an ""ecological aberration"".","Heated terraces became ubiquitous in France in the 1990s, when smoking bans came into force France's government has announced new environmental measures, including a ban on heated terraces for cafes and bars. Ecology Minister Barbara Pompili said outside heating or air conditioning was an ""ecological aberration"". The ban would not come into force until after the winter as restaurants have been hard hit by Covid-19, she added. All heated or air-conditioned buildings open to the public will also have to keep their doors closed to avoid wasting energy. Ms Pompili told reporters it was wrong for shops to ""air-condition the streets"" in summer by keeping their doors open just to spare customers from having to open them. ""Neither should terraces be heated in winter so people can feel warm as they drink coffee,"" she said. Summers could become 'too hot for humans' 'Rising chance' of exceeding 1.5C target Trade groups say more than 75% of restaurants and cafes in the Paris area have a heated terrace. A few French cities have already banned them but Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo refused to do so, saying it would be too much of a blow to businesses. Ms Pompili said officials would talk to owners about ways of implementing the measure after the winter. She was appointed by new Prime Minister Jean Castex, who has pledged â¬20m ($23m; Â£18.2m) for climate-related investment as part of a â¬100m stimulus plan aimed at helping the economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The measures announced by Ms Pompili were proposed by the 150-member Citizens' Convention on Climate, set up by President Emmanuel Macron last year and randomly selected from members of the public. They also include the creation of two natural parks and a national nature reserve. Owners of buildings will be encouraged to improve insulation and banned from installing new coal- or oil-burning furnaces, while limits will be imposed on developments in rural areas.

"Boy, 17, stabbed to death and four others hurt","The 17-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene A 17-year-old has been stabbed to death and four other boys were injured as two groups clashed in Manchester. Police were called to a disturbance in Henbury Street, Moss Side, at about 19:30 BST on Sunday. The boy was pronounced dead at the scene. Two 15-year-olds and a 17-year old were also hurt, as well as a 16-year old who is in hospital with ""potentially life-changing injuries."" A 17-year-old boy arrested at the scene remains in custody, police said. The 15-year-olds and the 17-year-old were also arrested on discharge from hospital. He is being held on suspicion of murder and the injured boys are also in custody awaiting questioning in connection with the killing, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said. Supt Mark Dexter said: ""No parent should ever have to bury their child and my heart goes out to the mother and father who lost their son yesterday evening."" He added: ""Despite us having made four arrests, we are still actively piecing together the circumstances around this incident and I would urge anyone who has any information to please get in touch with us as a matter of absolute urgency.

"Ed Sheeran: 'I'd binge eat until I was sick'The pop star opens up about his addictive personality, and why he's taking a break from music.Entertainment & Arts","The star credited his wife, Cherry, with helping him maintain a more healthy lifestyle Ed Sheeran has revealed how his ""very addictive personality"" led him to binge on food and alcohol during the early days of his success. Speaking at anonline summit on anxiety and wellbeing,external, the star said he had suffered panic attacks and hated the way he looked after becoming famous. He hit a particularly rough patch during his 2014-15 world tour. ""I felt, 'What was the point?' In a dark way, like, 'Why am I around? What is the point?'"" he said. The star credited his wife, Cherry, and a more healthy lifestyle for helping him turn his life around. ""She exercises a lot, so I started going on runs with her. She eats quite healthily so I started eating quite healthily. She doesn't drink that much so I wasn't drinking,"" he said. ""I think that all changed things."" If you're affected by any of the issues raised in this story, the BBC's Action Line can help you find support. In a wide-ranging interview with documentary maker James Sebastiano, Jr, Sheeran also explained his current hiatus from music, and why he has taken up painting. Sheeran said the 180-date world tour to promote his 2014 album X, was his lowest point. ""I would stay up and drink all night and then sleep on the bus,"" he said. ""The buses would park underneath the arenas and I'd sleep on the bus all day, then wake up and then come out, do the show, drink, get back on the bus and I didn't see sunlight for maybe four months. ""It's all fun and games at the start. it's all rock and roll, and then like it starts getting sad. That was probably like the lowest that I've been and I kind of ballooned in weight."" Sheeran is one of the UK's most successful songwriters of the last decade ""I'm covered in tattoos and I don't do things by half,"" the star admitted, ""so if I'm gonna drink... I see no point in having a glass of wine. I'd rather have two bottles"". ""Having a glass of wine is having something in moderation and probably isn't going to affect your day the next day. But two bottles of wine probably might make you quite sad."" But alcohol wasn't the only problem. ""They used to call me two-dinner Teddy because I used to order two meals and eat that,"" he said. ""Then you start putting on loads of weight and hating the way you look. ""I think things like sugar, sweet stuff, junk food, cocaine, alcohol, it feels good the more you do, but it's the worst thing for you."" Sheeran was signed to Elton John's management company at the start of his career - and he said that reading his mentor's autobiography had prompted a few realisations about his own lifestyle. ""There are so many things that he did that I do,"" the star explained. ""He would be like, 'I would just go on an ice cream binge and eat four desserts until I threw up', and I was like, 'I've done that before'. ""Or his martini binges, where he sees how many martinis he can drink. And I'm like, 'I've done that before too'. ""With addiction, its very hard to moderate but moderation is the key."" Sheeran had a number one album last year, with his No. 6 Collaborations Project, but he indicated he'd be stepping back from music for the rest of 2020. ""You can sense when the public are like, 'We've had enough now,'"" he said of the album's reception. ""One of the important things in the industry is to know when not only to give yourself a break, but to give the public a break."" In the meantime, he's taken up art. ""I was like, 'I should probably try and find something else to give me happiness,'"" he explained. ""There's only so many movies you can watch and packets of Monster Munch you can eat. ""So I basically bought 30 canvases and I painted a canvas a day for 30 days and it was really fun."" He said his creations were in the style of abstract impressionist Jackson Pollock - ""I just bought house paint and then I would just layer it up by flicking it"" - but the public would never get to see them. ""I don't sell my art. I just love doing it. No one else needs to judge."" One of the star's more surprising admissions was that he felt very little sense of achievement after hisrecord-breaking run of shows at Wembley Stadium in 2015. ""It sounds weird saying it but you don't really feel anything,"" he said. ""You'd think it would be like, 'A-ha! This is it. I've made it. Oh my God!' [but] you finish it and you're likeâ¦ 'Well, what do I do now?'"" The star says he cherished the early days of his career, playing open mic nights and sleeping on friends' sofas, more than the big-scale stadium shows and festivals he's become accustomed to. ""I started at the bottom and I loved every part of it,"" he said. ""I learned more playing in a room to one person in Exeter when no-one came to my gig in 2009 that I did playing Wembley Stadium for four nights. It's a weird one."" He added that fame had come at a cost. ""When you have success and you find moneyâ¦ you get people getting weird with you. I had family members turn weird and friends fall out with me and people stealing. It's not the key to happiness. ""Fame is an enhancer [of] everyone else's insecurities,"" he added wearily. ""The number of people I don't speak to anymore just because it just turned weird."" His success has also triggered panic attacks, he said, often when he's surrounded by large groups of people. ""I would get it on the tube and planes, supermarkets... It's a weird paranoia in me of assuming that everyone's going to be horrible, when usually people are nice."" Sheeran previously took a hiatus from social media in 2015 Despite taking a sabbatical from releasing music, Sheeran says he's working on new music - treating his studio sessions as a ""nine to five"" job, in an effort to maintain a healthy work-life balance and spend more time with his wife. He's also quit social media, as he did in 2016 while working on the follow-up to the multi-million selling X album. ""I was on my phone probably 19 hours of the day in 2015 and before that, just constantly just flicking, posting, flicking and posting. And it wasn't till the tour ended in 2015 where I was like, 'Oh I'm just gonna try and live without my phone for a bit'. ""I had 1,500 contacts on my phone and people were texting the whole time and it just felt a lot of responsibility to either reply or meet up with them. ""For the first month I felt like a massive weight had been lifted."" After returning to social media to promote his third album, Divide, he found himself falling back into bad habits, so heannounced he'd be ""taking a breather"" again on Christmas Eve 2019.,external He now says he's ""of an age where I'm beyond"" needing to be on social media. ""I don't think I'm going to get the youth [audience] back - because I'm getting into my 30s,"" he explained. ""It's not like 16-year-old people are going to relate to me next time I release an album. So it's not like I need to be on it any more. I can just have someone post it [for me].""

Unhealthy food deals targeted to tackle obesityMinisters will also legislate for calories to appear on menus as part of a strategy to tackle obesity.UK PoliticsComments,"""Buy one get one free"" deals on unhealthy food will be banned as part of the government's bid to tackle obesity in England. The plan,externalalso includes restrictions on where foods high in fat and sugar can be promoted in-store, and new rules for displaying calories on menus. A ban on junk food adverts before 21:00has been confirmed - for the whole UK. Boris Johnson said the plans would help ""reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus"". The prime minister has unveiled the strategy amid growing evidence of a link between obesity and an increased risk from Covid-19. Government statistics showed nearly 8% of critically ill patients in intensive care units with the virus have been morbidly obese, compared with 2.9% of the general population. How bad is our obesity problem? GPs to prescribe cycling in new obesity strategy Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say Has Covid-19 exposed UK's underlying ill health? The other measures being taken are: A national campaign to help people lose weight and eat more healthily after the ""wake-up call"" of coronavirus A consultation on whether to stop fast food adverts online altogether A review of traffic light labelling on food and drinks sold in shops A consultation on making calories labelling on alcohol drinks mandatory Greater incentives for GPs to tackle excess weight, including the use of apps and exercise-on-referral Labelling of calories on menus will apply to any restaurant, cafe or takeaway chain with more than 250 employees, and another new consultation will be launched around plans to provide the same information for alcoholic drinks. The move marks a change in stance by the prime minister, who has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and described his views on tackling obesity as ""libertarian"". This video can not be played Former Labour MP Tom Watson who lost 8 stone, pictured here after and before But Mr Johnson's experience in intensive care during his treatment for Covid-19 is thought to have contributed to his changing position. Writing in the Daily Express, he said: ""We all put things off - I know I have. I've wanted to lose weight for ages and, like many people, I struggle with my weight. ""I go up and down, but during the whole coronavirus epidemic and when I got it too, I realised how important it is not to be overweight."" If implemented this will mean radical changes to the way food is marketed. Most of the proposals were first set out in a policy paper in 2018 and put out to consultation before getting stalled. The key is how businesses react this time, having previously been against the measures. The Food and Drink Federation has again given a hostile response. But what about advertisers whose freedom to promote some food products will be severely limited? A doyen of the industry Sir John Hegarty has come out in favour of a ban on TV ads of unhealthy food before the 9pm watershed. He said there was a growing health crisis. Much of the drinks industry has already accepted the need for calorie labelling. Just as Boris Johnson and other Conservative politicians have moved from a libertarian non-interventionist approach to a call for action on obesity, the business lobby could be shifting as well. This video can not be played The people tackling obesity during lockdown Sue Eustace, director of public affairs at the Advertising Association, said the ""extreme"" and ""unnecessary"" measures would have little effect in reducing obesity, and warned they could have ""wide-ranging ramifications"" for food businesses and online publishers trying to financially recover from the pandemic and the lockdown. ""We have some of the strictest [advertising] rules in the world already and children's exposure to high fat, salt, and sugar adverts on TV has fallen by 70% over the last 15 years or so, but there's been no change to obesity, so we don't think these measures are going to work."" She warned that the measures could affect  a ""whole range"" of household products that people do not necessarily view as junk food, and questioned whether this would restrict businesses like local fish and chip shops from putting their menus online for customers. A calorie is defined as the amount of energy it takes to heat 1g of water by 1 degree Celsius. The calories listed on food products are actually kilocalories (1,000 calories or kcals) - the energy needed to heat 1kg of water by 1 degree Celsius. The calorie content of a food can be found by burning it and measuring how much heat is released. Foods such as fruits and vegetables have fewer calories than, for instance, cakes or biscuits, which have a high fat or sugar content. Fat contains 9 kcal (37 kJ) per gram Alcohol contains 7 kcal (29 kJ) per gram Protein contains 4 kcal (17 kJ) per gram Carbohydrate contains 3.75 kcal (16 kJ) per gram (for the purposes of food labelling this is rounded up to 4 kcal per gram) If we consume more calories than we burn up through everyday activity or exercise, we put on weight. Knowing how many calories are in the products we eat can help us keep track. Source:BNF,external But, writing in The Daily Telegraph, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This deadly virus has given us a wake-up call about the need to tackle the stark inequalities in our nation's health, and obesity is an urgent example of this. ""If everyone who is overweight lost five pounds it could save the NHS more than Â£100 million over the next five years. And, more importantly, given the link between obesity and coronavirus, losing weight could be life-saving. ""Obesity is one of the greatest long-term health challenges that we face as a country."" Health experts have welcomed the moves, but some said the government should go even further, while others questioned whether the Treasury's 'Eat Out to Help Out' initiative - granting everyone 50% off meals in restaurants, including fast food outlets, throughout August - would undermine the effort to get people to lose weight. Adam Briggs, of the Health Foundation think-tank, said the strategy was ""likely to be a missed opportunity"". He said there were multiple factors that contributed to obesity, adding that it was important to also address the role of economic and social factors, like poverty and unemployment which ""drive poor health and inequalities"". He also pointed out that public health budgets held by councils had been cut over the years. The NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's mass in kilograms by the square of their height in metres. Check your BMI using the BBC calculator Another measure of excess fat is waist size - men with a waist of 94cm or more and women with a waist of 80cm or more are more likely to develop obesity-related problems. This video can not be played Campaigner Tasha is on a mission to make it easier for young people to have healthier diet choices Professor Dame Parveen Kumar, chairwoman of the British Medical Association's Board of Science, said: ""The BMA has long been calling for new ways to tackle obesity and we are delighted to see that the government has sat up and listened. ""What we need now is for this strategy to be actioned as quickly as possible, with the promised expansion of NHS services delivered in full, with adequate resources and funding, to ensure that those struggling with their weight can get the support they need and deserve.""

Ed Sheeran: 'I'd binge eat until I was sick',"The star credited his wife, Cherry, with helping him maintain a more healthy lifestyle Ed Sheeran has revealed how his ""very addictive personality"" led him to binge on food and alcohol during the early days of his success. Speaking at anonline summit on anxiety and wellbeing,external, the star said he had suffered panic attacks and hated the way he looked after becoming famous. He hit a particularly rough patch during his 2014-15 world tour. ""I felt, 'What was the point?' In a dark way, like, 'Why am I around? What is the point?'"" he said. The star credited his wife, Cherry, and a more healthy lifestyle for helping him turn his life around. ""She exercises a lot, so I started going on runs with her. She eats quite healthily so I started eating quite healthily. She doesn't drink that much so I wasn't drinking,"" he said. ""I think that all changed things."" If you're affected by any of the issues raised in this story, the BBC's Action Line can help you find support. In a wide-ranging interview with documentary maker James Sebastiano, Jr, Sheeran also explained his current hiatus from music, and why he has taken up painting. Sheeran said the 180-date world tour to promote his 2014 album X, was his lowest point. ""I would stay up and drink all night and then sleep on the bus,"" he said. ""The buses would park underneath the arenas and I'd sleep on the bus all day, then wake up and then come out, do the show, drink, get back on the bus and I didn't see sunlight for maybe four months. ""It's all fun and games at the start. it's all rock and roll, and then like it starts getting sad. That was probably like the lowest that I've been and I kind of ballooned in weight."" Sheeran is one of the UK's most successful songwriters of the last decade ""I'm covered in tattoos and I don't do things by half,"" the star admitted, ""so if I'm gonna drink... I see no point in having a glass of wine. I'd rather have two bottles"". ""Having a glass of wine is having something in moderation and probably isn't going to affect your day the next day. But two bottles of wine probably might make you quite sad."" But alcohol wasn't the only problem. ""They used to call me two-dinner Teddy because I used to order two meals and eat that,"" he said. ""Then you start putting on loads of weight and hating the way you look. ""I think things like sugar, sweet stuff, junk food, cocaine, alcohol, it feels good the more you do, but it's the worst thing for you."" Sheeran was signed to Elton John's management company at the start of his career - and he said that reading his mentor's autobiography had prompted a few realisations about his own lifestyle. ""There are so many things that he did that I do,"" the star explained. ""He would be like, 'I would just go on an ice cream binge and eat four desserts until I threw up', and I was like, 'I've done that before'. ""Or his martini binges, where he sees how many martinis he can drink. And I'm like, 'I've done that before too'. ""With addiction, its very hard to moderate but moderation is the key."" Sheeran had a number one album last year, with his No. 6 Collaborations Project, but he indicated he'd be stepping back from music for the rest of 2020. ""You can sense when the public are like, 'We've had enough now,'"" he said of the album's reception. ""One of the important things in the industry is to know when not only to give yourself a break, but to give the public a break."" In the meantime, he's taken up art. ""I was like, 'I should probably try and find something else to give me happiness,'"" he explained. ""There's only so many movies you can watch and packets of Monster Munch you can eat. ""So I basically bought 30 canvases and I painted a canvas a day for 30 days and it was really fun."" He said his creations were in the style of abstract impressionist Jackson Pollock - ""I just bought house paint and then I would just layer it up by flicking it"" - but the public would never get to see them. ""I don't sell my art. I just love doing it. No one else needs to judge."" One of the star's more surprising admissions was that he felt very little sense of achievement after hisrecord-breaking run of shows at Wembley Stadium in 2015. ""It sounds weird saying it but you don't really feel anything,"" he said. ""You'd think it would be like, 'A-ha! This is it. I've made it. Oh my God!' [but] you finish it and you're likeâ¦ 'Well, what do I do now?'"" The star says he cherished the early days of his career, playing open mic nights and sleeping on friends' sofas, more than the big-scale stadium shows and festivals he's become accustomed to. ""I started at the bottom and I loved every part of it,"" he said. ""I learned more playing in a room to one person in Exeter when no-one came to my gig in 2009 that I did playing Wembley Stadium for four nights. It's a weird one."" He added that fame had come at a cost. ""When you have success and you find moneyâ¦ you get people getting weird with you. I had family members turn weird and friends fall out with me and people stealing. It's not the key to happiness. ""Fame is an enhancer [of] everyone else's insecurities,"" he added wearily. ""The number of people I don't speak to anymore just because it just turned weird."" His success has also triggered panic attacks, he said, often when he's surrounded by large groups of people. ""I would get it on the tube and planes, supermarkets... It's a weird paranoia in me of assuming that everyone's going to be horrible, when usually people are nice."" Sheeran previously took a hiatus from social media in 2015 Despite taking a sabbatical from releasing music, Sheeran says he's working on new music - treating his studio sessions as a ""nine to five"" job, in an effort to maintain a healthy work-life balance and spend more time with his wife. He's also quit social media, as he did in 2016 while working on the follow-up to the multi-million selling X album. ""I was on my phone probably 19 hours of the day in 2015 and before that, just constantly just flicking, posting, flicking and posting. And it wasn't till the tour ended in 2015 where I was like, 'Oh I'm just gonna try and live without my phone for a bit'. ""I had 1,500 contacts on my phone and people were texting the whole time and it just felt a lot of responsibility to either reply or meet up with them. ""For the first month I felt like a massive weight had been lifted."" After returning to social media to promote his third album, Divide, he found himself falling back into bad habits, so heannounced he'd be ""taking a breather"" again on Christmas Eve 2019.,external He now says he's ""of an age where I'm beyond"" needing to be on social media. ""I don't think I'm going to get the youth [audience] back - because I'm getting into my 30s,"" he explained. ""It's not like 16-year-old people are going to relate to me next time I release an album. So it's not like I need to be on it any more. I can just have someone post it [for me].""

"Swimming defector did not have virus, says S Korea","A visitor on Ganghwa Island looking out to the North in April The man suspected of being North Korea's first confirmed Covid-19 patient did not have the virus, South Korea says. The man apparently defected from North to South three years ago, before seemingly deciding to return last week. South Korea said the man reached the North by crawling through a drainpipe on a southern island, and then swimming about a mile. At the weekend, North Korea reported its first suspected case of Covid-19. It said the patient was a North Korean who had ""re-defected"" from the South. On Monday the South Korean military said the 24-year-old man reached the North from Ganghwa Island, near the border. He apparently crawled under barbed wire in a drain which leads to the Yellow Sea, before swimming to the North. ""We spotted the specific location from which he fled, as a bag believed to belong to the man was found,"" Col Kim Jun-rak said, according to Yonhap news agency. N Korea on alert over 'first suspected virus case' Earlier, North Korean state media said the man had defected to South Korea three years ago, before returning earlier this month. He reached the North Korean city of Kaesong, which is near the coast, on 19 July and was ""suspected"" of having ""the vicious virus"". North Korean leader Kim Jong-un reportedly ordered a ""maximum emergency system"" to contain the virus. A North Korean state media photo from the weekend of Kim Jong-un at the emergency meeting held to discuss the ""Covid-19"" patient ""The person is neither registered as a Covid-19 patient, nor classified as a person who came in contact with virus patients,"" said Yoon Tae-ho, a senior health official, according to Yonhap. Virus tests were conducted on two people who had close contact with the defector, and both tested negative. South Korea was one of the first countries outside China to have a Covid-19 outbreak, but now has the virus largely under control. With a population of more than 50 million, the country averages just over50 new cases a day,external- many of them imported and then quarantined. North Korea has not confirmed a single case of Covid-19 - something analysts have long said is unlikely. It is rare for someone to leave the North for the South, and then come back. The South Korean unification ministry told the BBC there had been 11 confirmed cases since 2015, the last of which was in 2017. If confirmed, the man who swam from Ganghwa would be the 12th. This video can not be played Plastic bottles of aid cross Korean border By Subin Kim, BBC News, Seoul Though it said the re-defector was only ""suspected"" of having Covid-19, Pyongyang appears to be keen to stress that the outside world - especially the South - is to be blamed for the possible breach in its anti-epidemic measures. So far, it seems unlikely the man who returned to Kaesong after three years in South Korea really has Covid-19. South Korean authorities have denied it, and Pyongyang has an apparent lack of testing capacity anyway. Experts agree that Pyongyang is trying to divert its people from blaming the regime for the hardship the pandemic has caused in their lives. Whether or not cases are confirmed, it is evident the North Korean economy is faltering from its vigorous prevention measures - including shutting off its border trade route with China. Pyongyang might try to use this incident as an excuse to demand aid from Seoul - such as medical supplies, or food.

Celebs join Twitter anti-Semitism boycott,"Those taking part in the boycott include MPs David Lammy and Rosena Allin-Khan, singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, actor Jason Isaacs, broadcasters Rachel Riley and Maajid Nawaz, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, and entrepreneur Lord Sugar A 48-hour boycott of Twitter by some of its users, protesting at the platform's alleged lack of action on anti-Semitism has begun. It was triggered by the actions of grime music artist Wiley, who shared several posts on Twitter on Friday. Some of the tweets were deleted, but Twitter was criticised for taking time to act and leaving some tweets up. The Prime Minister's official spokesman has said Boris Johnson believes ""Twitter needs to do better"". The offending messages ""should not have been able to remain on Twitter and Instagram for so long"", he added, and ""social media companies need to go further and faster to remove content like this"". Dozens of well-known figures supporting the two-day ""walkout"" are using the hashtags #NoSafeSpaceForJewHate and #48HoursSilence. This video can not be played WATCH: Rapper Wiley's Twitter account has been suspended after anti-Semitic posts Many of those taking part accused Twitter of ""breaking its own policies"" for not having taken a tougher line - Wiley has been temporarily suspended by Twitter but not banned. The protest formally began at 09:00BST. But since that time, other people and organisations have joined, including the accounts of Greenpeace UK, the Royal Opera House, the pop group McFly, sports broadcaster Gary Lineker, as well as members of the public. However, some people have questioned whether keeping silent is the best way to challenge online hate. Police are now investigating Wiley's tweets, and said ""enquiries remain ongoing"". The so-called ""godfather of grime"" has also been temporarily barred from Instagram. Actress and writer Tracy-Ann Oberman, who is one of those leading the movement, tweeted on Saturday that Twitter had ""allowed [Wiley] 48 hours of pure race hate"". She said that Twitter founder Jack Dorsey ""has to stick by [Twitter's] remit of anti racism. Silence is complicity. Please walk out with us."" The rallying cry was taken up by a diverse cross-section of Twitter users, including: television presenter Rachel Riley comedian Robert Webb singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor actor Jason Isaacs radio presenter and activist Maajid Nawaz businessman Lord Sugar Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis Allow Twitter content?

A host of MPs from different parties also said they would take part - including Labour's Rosena Allin-Khan and David Lammy, former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas, acting Lib Dems leader Ed Davey, and Conservative MP Jane Stevenson. Those taking part have vowed not to tweet - or use Twitter at all - from Monday morning to Wednesday morning, reflecting the 48 hours of inaction they accuse Twitter of. Some organisations are also taking part, including the Music Producers Guild, the National Children's Bureau charity, London's Southbank Centre, the Jewish Chronicle newspaper and the American Jewish Committee. Social media firms told off by MPs over hate Could a boycott kill Facebook? Karen Pollock, chief executive of the UK's Holocaust Educational Trust, tweeted her organisation's support for the move, writing that Twitter can be ""abusive, distressing and so draining"". She added: ""It is about time social media companies Twitter [and] Instagram live up to the values their users would expect."" Twitter said: ""Abuse and harassment has no place on Twitter and we strongly condemn it"". The firm highlighted its policies that ban the promotion of violence against people on the basis of religion, race or ethnicity. ""We enforce our rules judiciously and impartially for all and take action if an account violates our rules,"" it said. Wiley began posting a stream of offensive messages on social media before being temporarily banned by Twitter on Saturday Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, meanwhile, has written to Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey and Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, telling them: ""social media companies have a responsibility to act and must do so without delay"". ""This cannot be allowed to stand. Your inaction amounts to complicity."" During his tweet session, Wiley referenced conspiracy theories about Jewish people and other insulting material. He also posted extensively to Facebook-owned Instagram. Many have now been replaced with notices that the tweets are no longer available because they violated Twitter's rules. However, they had already attracted the attention of a number of public figures and the police. On Saturday, London's Metropolitan Police in Tower Hamlets tweeted that they had received ""a number of reports"" about anti-Semitic tweets, and that ""the relevant material is being assessed"". UK Home SecretaryPriti Patel said she had asked Twitter and Instagram for a full explanation, while London mayor Sadiq Khan has written to the firms, criticising their reaction. Wiley's management also dropped the artist over the weekend, saying: ""There is no place in society for anti-Semitism."" The 41-year-old artist, whose real name is Richard Cowie, is a major figure in grime music, and was made an MBE in 2018 for services to music. The anti-Semitism row has also resulted in calls for that honour to be withdrawn.

Beauty salons and tattooists reopen in WalesBeauty salons are reopening but people may have to wait longer for fillers and eyebrow treatments.,"This video can not be played Customers are back in beauty salons and tattoo parlours - but with protective measures in place Beauty salons and tattooists in Wales are allowed to reopen for the first time since lockdown. The Welsh Government's latest easing of restrictions means nail bars, spas, and tanning shops can open again on Monday. But people will have to wait longer for facials and to get their eyebrows and eyelashes done, with guidelines warning the treatments are ""too high risk"". One salon owner in Vale of Glamorgan said she had missed out on trade during her busiest time of year. And a tattooist in Gwynedd opened at midnight to finish off a woman's tattoo she had started before lockdown. This video can not be played Life is ""horrible"" without his fillers and Botox, Iwan Steffan says Welsh Government guidance,externalhas outlined which businesses can open on Monday, and measures they should put in place, including: Beauty salons, including nail bars and tanning shops, can reopen, but facial treatments are not advised Spas can resume business, but only for beauty treatments and not for saunas and pools Tattooists can resume, but walk-in appointments are not allowed Businesses offering piercing, electrolysis and acupuncture have also given the green light to reopen Hairdressers havebeen able to opensince 13 July. But theWelsh Government guidance has ""strongly advised"",externalbeauticians not to perform facial treatments, due to the high risk of people being face-to-face for long periods of time. This includes eyebrow tinting, waxing and threading, fillers, eyelash treatments, dermaplaning and microblading treatments and makeup. If beauticians choose to perform treatments on clients' faces, they must wear a fluid resistant surgical face mask, goggles, disposable gloves and an apron, and be fully trained in using personal protective equipment (PPE) safely, the guidelines say. The Welsh Government said it had ""worked with public health experts and the beauty industry to develop the guidance and make it is as clear as possible for an industry that covers a huge range of different procedures across a wide variety of settings"". The decision to prohibit facial treatments is based on Public Health Wales guidance, it added. Jayne Goodings, owner of Lemon Tree Nails and Beauty Salon, says she has missed out on most of her busiest time of year The owner of a beauty salon said businesses would be trying to make up for a significant loss of income, but predicted some would be unable to open straight away due to receiving the guidance at such short notice. ""Our busiest time of the year is from April to September when we take possibly more than 50% of our annual takings so for us it's been a massive hit on our business,"" said Jayne Goodings, owner of Lemon Tree Nails and Beauty Salon, in Cowbridge. ""The guidance was issued [Friday] and we're due to open on Monday. ""I'm lucky that I've got the measures in place but there could be a lot of salons that haven't and are now trying to source PPE in readiness for Monday."" Ms Goodings added: ""It has been difficult. Sourcing PPE in itself has been a marathon to say the least."" Sarah Bruton said beauty therapists were already well trained in limiting cross-infection Sarah Bruton of Captiva Spa and Lounge in Caerphilly says she will now open seven days a week to cope with demand and allow staff to work the same hours but with more space around them. She has introduced perspex screens, hand-sanitising stations and temperature checks, and removed things like fluffy towels and robes. Sarah said: ""We've changed some of our operating processes so we do treatments in a slightly different way and we've procured lots of PPE, so things like aprons, visors and gloves and masks, to make our working practices as safe as possible."" She added: ""We're trained to do things like limit cross-infection and prevent contamination, so we're already very well placed to be able to protect people against Covid.""

Her first client was a woman whose tattoo was left incomplete when lockdown was announced. Because of the strict hygiene rules governing tattoo shops before the pandemic, Ms Lee said Covid-19 requirements should not be too challenging. ""Tattooists are one of the cleanest places you can be,"" she said. ""There is a need for more PPE - we were already using PPE anyway, but we have to use more now."" Ms Lee finished a tattoo of a rose, inspired by the Disney film Beauty and the Beast, on Louise Pritchard's leg Louise Pritchard, Ms Lee's first customer after reopening, said: ""I have waited for this since Jules had to close, [it] feels like forever. It feels like a lifetime ago. ""I agreed to come at midnight because I've been waiting for ages and I was really looking forward to it. ""I love my ink. I don't like things being half finished and Jules has been great fitting me in, and it is really therapeutic."" Ms Lee said the tattoo, on Ms Pritchard's lower leg, was inspired by the film Beauty and the Beast and was part of a wider piece. ""Louise is a Disney mega fan,"" she said. ""We are working on a Disney-themed leg sleeve for her. ""She's a very loyal client that I've been tattooing for months and she was very eager to get more ink as soon as."" New PPE requirements are the biggest change, Ms Lee says Ms Lee said customers needed to book in advance and must not turn up more than five minutes before their appointment or hang around afterwards. Hand sanitiser will be provided for customers and she will leave an hour between appointments to allow her time to ""deep clean"". After a ""worrying"" time without revenue, Ms Lee said she could not wait to reopen. ""I'm so excited - I just love my job,"" she added.

Garmin services returning after alleged cyber-attack,"Garmin's tech powers all kinds of fitness trackers The American GPS and fitness-tracker company Garmin is dealing with the aftermath of a ransomware attack, the BBC has confirmed. Owners of its products had been unable to use its services since Thursday. However, some of its online tools are now being provided in a ""limited"" state,according to its online dashboard,external. Garmin has said it was ""the victim of a cyber-attack that encrypted some of our systems"". But the statement it released avoided any reference to a ransom demand. ""Many of our online services were interrupted including website functions, customer support, customer-facing applications, and company communications,"" it said. ""We have no indication that any customer data, including payment information from Garmin Pay, was accessed, lost or stolen."" The firm added that it expected all its systems to return to normal operation within a few days, but warned that there might be a ""backlog"" of user data to process. It is not known if the firm paid the blackmailers, but a source told the BBC it was in the ""final stage of recovery"". The BBC's cyber reporter Joe Tidy said the malware involved was Wasted Locker - a program that scrambles the target's data, and was first detected in the wild around April. Victims are typically contacted after their computers are infected, and told they must transfer funds if they want to return the files to their original state. Some customers have already reported that Garmin's services appear to be ""partially"" working again. Earlier reports claimed that the company had been asked to pay $10m (Â£7.79m) to get its systems back online. Twitter hack: Bitcoin exchange 'blocked 1,000 transactions' How hackers extorted $1.14m from a US university Pilots who use flyGarmin were unable to download up-to-date aviation databases, which aviation regulators such as the FAA require pilots to have, before they can fly. Customers were also unable to log into Garmin Connect to record and analyse their health and fitness data. There have been many high-profile attacks in recent months, but few victims have been as tight-lipped as Garmin. Even now, despite confirmation from many different sources across different newsrooms, the company is choosing not to admit it was ransomware. The big question is whether or not the company paid the blackmailer what is likely to be a multi-million dollar demand. It seems the company has somehow got the decryption key it needs to start bringing services back online. As well as customers and shareholders, the US authorities will be very keen to know what happened. Members of Evil Corp, the criminal group that's suspected of being behind the hack, were indicted in 2019 by the US Treasury.

Firms with more female executives 'perform better',"London-listed companies are more profitable when women make up more than one in three executive roles, according to new research. Listed firms where at least one-third of the bosses are women have a profit margin more than 10 times greater than those without, it suggests. Of the 350 largest companies listed, just 14 are led by women, according to gender diversity business The Pipeline. 15% of companies in the FTSE 350 have no female executives at all. The group's co-founder Lorna Fitzsimons said having more women in the decision-making room means businesses are better able to understand their customers. Top 10 tips for diversifying your workplace 'All the good women have been snapped up' Do women make companies richer? The Pipeline'sWomen Count 2020 report,external""shows the stark difference in net profit margins of companies that have diverse gender leaderships compared to those who do not,"" she said. The Pipeline says London-listed companies with no women on their executive committees have a net profit of 1.5%, whereas those with more than one in three women at that level reach 15.2% net profit margin. The report also points out that in the largest 100 London-listed companies, the total number of female chief executives is the same as the number of bosses named Peter - six. When it comes to chief financial officers in those firms, fewer than two out of 10 are women, while men make up 96% of investment managers. The sectors with the lowest number of women in executive roles are construction and retail. ""If you look at retail, entry level jobs are usually 80% women,"" Ms Fitzsimons said. ""But they don't make it to the executive level."" Former Prime Minister Theresa May, who contributed to the report, said there can be no good explanation for the massive underrepresentation of women at the top of British business. ""Every single male CEO who looks around his boardroom table to see nine out of 10 male faces staring back at him needs to ask himself what he is doing to make his business one which his daughter or granddaughter can get on in,"" she wrote. Vanda Murray chairs a FTSE-250 firm. Vanda Murray OBE led Blick PLC in the early 2000s. She currently chairs the board at Marshalls PLC, a FTSE 250 construction firm. While she welcomes recent moves to encourage women to make up 30% of company boards, she says it's in executive, decision-making roles where women are still underrepresented. ""There are talented females out there, no-one could really argue against this,"" she said. Leadership groups with people from mixed backgrounds, ethnicity and gender do better because ""they challenge more, and they have more discussion and debate and that leads to better decision-making,"" she said. Ms Murray said Marshalls has a female HR director, but the rest of the executive committee members are men. ""We have plans in place. We have talent management programmes and training and development so that we can make sure the younger female managers come through.""

US leaves Chengdu consulate amid row with China,"Crowds of curious locals gathered outside the US diplomatic mission American diplomatic staff have left their consulate in the Chinese city of Chengdu, after a 72-hour deadline expired. China ordered the closure in response tothe US closing the Chinese consulate in Houston, Texaslast week. Before Monday's deadline, staff were seen leaving the building, a plaque was removed, and a US flag was lowered. China's foreign ministry said Chinese staff entered the building after the deadline and ""took over"". A US state department spokesperson said: ""The consulate has stood at the centre of our relations with the people in Western China, including Tibet, for 35 years. ""We are disappointed by the Chinese Communist Party's decision and will strive to continue our outreach to the people in this important region through our other posts in China."" As the US consulate closed, local residents gathered outside, with many waving Chinese flags and taking selfies. The Chinese spy who hunted on LinkedIn Last Wednesday the US ordered the Chinese consulate in Houston to close, alleging that it had become a hub for spying and property theft. Tensions have been escalating between the two countries over a number of issues: US President Donald Trump's administration has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over trade and the coronavirus pandemic Washington has also condemned the imposition by China of a controversial new security law in Hong Kong Last week,a Singaporean man pleaded guilty in a US court to working as an agent of China Also last week,four Chinese nationals were charged in a separate case with US visa fraudfor allegedly lying about serving in China's military Workers began to remove the diplomatic plaque from the US consulate on Sunday Chinese state media showed pictures of lorries leaving the consulate and workers removing diplomatic insignia from the building. On Monday morning, state broadcaster CCTV posted a video of the US flag being taken down. Dozens of Chinese police were deployed outside the building, urging onlookers to move on. However, boos were heard when a bus with tinted windows left the building on Sunday, AFP news agency reports. When Chinese diplomats left their mission in Houston last week they were jeered by protesters. Last week the foreign ministry said the closure was a ""legitimate and necessary response"" to the actions taken by the US. Staff at the consulate were ""engaged in activities outside of their capacity, interfered in China's internal affairs, and endangered China's security and interests"", the statement said. The Chengdu consulate, established in 1985, represented US interests over a vast area of south-west China. The consulate was seen as strategically important, because it allowed the US to gather information on Tibet, where there has been long-running pressure for independence. Rights groups have long accused China of religious repression and human rights abuses in Tibet, which Beijing denies. With its industry and growing services sector, Chengdu also is seen by the US as providing opportunities for exports of agricultural products, cars and machinery. Police were guarding the premise from onlookers The majority of the diplomatic mission's more than 200 employees were hired locally. The closure leaves the US with four consulates in mainland China and an embassy in the capital Beijing. It also has a consulate in Hong Kong. China lost its Houston mission last week, but still has four other consulates in the US and an embassy in Washington DC. After a 72-hour deadline for Chinese diplomats to leave the Houston consulate expired on Friday, reporters saw men who appeared to be US officials force open a door to enter the premises. This video can not be played Men using a hose and closing rubbish bins at China's consulate in Houston US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington had acted because Beijing was ""stealing"" intellectual property. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin responded that the US move was based on ""a hodgepodge of anti-Chinese lies"". There are a number of things at play. US officials have blamed China for the global spread of Covid-19. More specifically, President Trump has alleged, without evidence, that the virus originated from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan. And, in unsubstantiated remarks, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said in March that the US military might have brought the virus to Wuhan. The US and China have also been locked in a tariff war since 2018. US-China trade war in 300 words Why US-China relations are at their lowest point in decades The US-China battle behind the scenes What's behind Trump's new strategy on China? Mr Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft, but in Beijing there is a perception that the US is trying to curb its rise as a global economic power. The US has also imposed sanctions on Chinese politicianswho it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.  China is accused of mass detentions, religious persecution and forced sterilisation of Uighurs and others. Beijing denies the allegations and has accused the US of ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs.

UK economy 'could take four years to recover',"The UK economy could take until 2024 to return to the size it was before the coronavirus lockdown, according to analysis from the EY Item Club. The forecasters, who use a similar economic model to the Treasury, suggest unemployment will rise to 9% from 3.9%. They also estimate the economy will shrink by 11.5% this year, worse than the 8% they predicted only a month ago. Consumers have been more cautious than expected, they said, while low business investment will dampen growth. As a result, they now expect the post-coronavirus economic recovery to take 18 months longer than previously forecast. However, the Item Club says it is early days and useful data has only recently been made available. ""Unsurprisingly, without hard data, a wide range of views on the performance and outlook for the UK economy emerged,"" said Mark Gregory, UK chief economist at EY. What jobs are available post-lockdown? Retail sales near pre-lockdown levels in June Rules v fear: What's delaying economic recovery? Last week, the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane told MPsthe UK economy had ""clawed back"" about half the fall in outputit saw during the peak of the coronavirus lockdown in March and April. There had been a V-shaped ""bounceback"", he said, referring tothe shape that indicates a rapid economic recovery. Last month, Mr Haldane said the economy was ""on track for a quick recovery"". However, other economists have expressed doubts about the potential for such a swift recovery in activity. ""Even though lockdown restrictions are easing, consumer caution has been much more pronounced than expected,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ""We believe that consumer confidence is one of three key factors likely to weigh on the UK economy over the rest of the year, alongside the impact of rising unemployment and low levels of business investment. ""The UK economy may be past its low point but it is looking increasingly likely that the climb back is going to be a lot longer than expected."" The government has moved to cut taxes, support wages and offer incentives to spend in an effort to keep the economy going and encourage consumers to spend. Earlier this month,Chancellor Rishi Sunak cut VAT on hospitalityand promised to pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. Buthe also conceded that not every job would be saved, and his Â£30bn package was criticised for helping certain sectors, such as restaurants and tourism, but ignoring others. Last month,the Bank of England said it would pump an extra Â£100bn into the UK economyto help fight the ""unprecedented"" coronavirus-induced downturn. What jobs are available post-lockdown?

Ryanair still flying to Spain despite quarantine,"Ryanair has said it will continue its flights in and out of Spain as normal, despite the UK government's decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on travellers arriving from the country. Neil Sorahan, Ryanair's chief financial officer, told the BBC: ""The schedules remain in place."" The travel industry has been plunged into confusion by the quarantine rule, which was announced over the weekend. Airlines have called it a ""big blow"", throwing travel plans into chaos. But speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Mr Sorahan said: ""As things stand, the market remains open, the schedules remain in place and we continue to operate in and out of Spain as normal."" He added, however, that Ryanair was keeping its entire operation ""under consideration"" as it builds back its route network post-lockdown. UK had to act 'rapidly' on Spain quarantine Spain insists it is safe amid new virus outbreaks Spain quarantine: 'We found out three minutes after landing' What are the quarantine rules for Spain and its islands? Mr Sorahan was questioned about previous remarks by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who has described quarantine measures as a ""political stunt"". He said it was ""a possibility"" that people would not follow the guidance. ""it's extremely difficult to police quarantine. People make their own decisions,"" he said. ""I don't think it's the most effective measure out there, but it's the measure that's been chosen by the UK government."" Earlier, Ryanair revealed that it had fallen into loss in the first three months of the financial year after what it called the most challenging period in its history. With more than 99% of its fleet grounded because of the pandemic, the airline reported a loss of â¬185m (Â£169m) over the April-to-June period, compared with a profit of â¬243m a year earlier. Ryanair said it expected to clear more than 90% of refunds for cancelled flights by the end of July. The airline said it was impossible to predict how long the coronavirus pandemic would persist. ""A second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe in late autumn (when the annual flu season commences) is our biggest fear right now,"" it added. The UK announced a surprise 14-day quarantine for travellers from Spain on Saturday Airlines have been struggling because of global travel restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus. In May, Ryanair announced it was set to cut 3,000 jobs across Europe. However, earlier this month, the company revealed thatit had cut a deal with the Unite union, including temporary pay cuts, so that UK cabin crew jobs would be safeguarded. The airline later said it was shuttingits base at Frankfurt Hahn airportafter German pilots voted to reject pay cuts. In its latest results statement, Ryanair repeated its criticism of rival airlines for receiving what it called ""illegal state aid"" to stay in business. ""Many other airlines are cutting capacity, with the result that air travel in Europe is likely to be depressed for at least the next two or three years,"" it added. ""This will create opportunities for Ryanair... to grow its network and expand its fleet, to take advantage of lower airport and aircraft cost opportunities that will inevitably arise."" The airline said the challenge of Brexit, and in particular a no-deal Brexit, remained high. It said it hoped that the UK and EU would agree a trade deal for air travel that would allow the free movement of people and the deregulated airline market between the UK and Ireland to continue. ""As an EU airline, the Ryanair Group should be less affected by a no-deal Brexit than UK registered airlines.  We still, however, expect adverse trading consequences to arise,"" the airline said. ""Ryanair has put the necessary measures in place to ensure that the group remains majority EU owned, including restricting voting rights of non-EU shareholders, in the event of a 'hard Brexit'"". Ryanair said it remained a committed supporter of the ""game-changer"" Boeing 737 Max plane, which was grounded last year after two crashes killed all 346 people on the flights. It was due to take delivery of its first 737 Max planes more than a year ago and still hopes to do so before the end of 2020. The US aviation regulator has started formal test flights for the troubled planeafter Boeing overhauled its flight control system.

Unhealthy food deals targeted to tackle obesityMinisters will also legislate for calories to appear on menus as part of a strategy to tackle obesity.UK Politics,"""Buy one get one free"" deals on unhealthy food will be banned as part of the government's bid to tackle obesity in England. The plan,externalalso includes restrictions on where foods high in fat and sugar can be promoted in-store, and new rules for displaying calories on menus. A ban on junk food adverts before 21:00has been confirmed - for the whole UK. Boris Johnson said the plans would help ""reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus"". The prime minister has unveiled the strategy amid growing evidence of a link between obesity and an increased risk from Covid-19. Government statistics showed nearly 8% of critically ill patients in intensive care units with the virus have been morbidly obese, compared with 2.9% of the general population. How bad is our obesity problem? GPs to prescribe cycling in new obesity strategy Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say Has Covid-19 exposed UK's underlying ill health? The other measures being taken are: A national campaign to help people lose weight and eat more healthily after the ""wake-up call"" of coronavirus A consultation on whether to stop fast food adverts online altogether A review of traffic light labelling on food and drinks sold in shops A consultation on making calories labelling on alcohol drinks mandatory Greater incentives for GPs to tackle excess weight, including the use of apps and exercise-on-referral Labelling of calories on menus will apply to any restaurant, cafe or takeaway chain with more than 250 employees, and another new consultation will be launched around plans to provide the same information for alcoholic drinks. The move marks a change in stance by the prime minister, who has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and described his views on tackling obesity as ""libertarian"". This video can not be played Former Labour MP Tom Watson who lost 8 stone, pictured here after and before But Mr Johnson's experience in intensive care during his treatment for Covid-19 is thought to have contributed to his changing position. Writing in the Daily Express, he said: ""We all put things off - I know I have. I've wanted to lose weight for ages and, like many people, I struggle with my weight. ""I go up and down, but during the whole coronavirus epidemic and when I got it too, I realised how important it is not to be overweight."" If implemented this will mean radical changes to the way food is marketed. Most of the proposals were first set out in a policy paper in 2018 and put out to consultation before getting stalled. The key is how businesses react this time, having previously been against the measures. The Food and Drink Federation has again given a hostile response. But what about advertisers whose freedom to promote some food products will be severely limited? A doyen of the industry Sir John Hegarty has come out in favour of a ban on TV ads of unhealthy food before the 9pm watershed. He said there was a growing health crisis. Much of the drinks industry has already accepted the need for calorie labelling. Just as Boris Johnson and other Conservative politicians have moved from a libertarian non-interventionist approach to a call for action on obesity, the business lobby could be shifting as well. This video can not be played The people tackling obesity during lockdown Sue Eustace, director of public affairs at the Advertising Association, said the ""extreme"" and ""unnecessary"" measures would have little effect in reducing obesity, and warned they could have ""wide-ranging ramifications"" for food businesses and online publishers trying to financially recover from the pandemic and the lockdown. ""We have some of the strictest [advertising] rules in the world already and children's exposure to high fat, salt, and sugar adverts on TV has fallen by 70% over the last 15 years or so, but there's been no change to obesity, so we don't think these measures are going to work."" She warned that the measures could affect  a ""whole range"" of household products that people do not necessarily view as junk food, and questioned whether this would restrict businesses like local fish and chip shops from putting their menus online for customers. A calorie is defined as the amount of energy it takes to heat 1g of water by 1 degree Celsius. The calories listed on food products are actually kilocalories (1,000 calories or kcals) - the energy needed to heat 1kg of water by 1 degree Celsius. The calorie content of a food can be found by burning it and measuring how much heat is released. Foods such as fruits and vegetables have fewer calories than, for instance, cakes or biscuits, which have a high fat or sugar content. Fat contains 9 kcal (37 kJ) per gram Alcohol contains 7 kcal (29 kJ) per gram Protein contains 4 kcal (17 kJ) per gram Carbohydrate contains 3.75 kcal (16 kJ) per gram (for the purposes of food labelling this is rounded up to 4 kcal per gram) If we consume more calories than we burn up through everyday activity or exercise, we put on weight. Knowing how many calories are in the products we eat can help us keep track. Source:BNF,external But, writing in The Daily Telegraph, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This deadly virus has given us a wake-up call about the need to tackle the stark inequalities in our nation's health, and obesity is an urgent example of this. ""If everyone who is overweight lost five pounds it could save the NHS more than Â£100 million over the next five years. And, more importantly, given the link between obesity and coronavirus, losing weight could be life-saving. ""Obesity is one of the greatest long-term health challenges that we face as a country."" Health experts have welcomed the moves, but some said the government should go even further, while others questioned whether the Treasury's 'Eat Out to Help Out' initiative - granting everyone 50% off meals in restaurants, including fast food outlets, throughout August - would undermine the effort to get people to lose weight. Adam Briggs, of the Health Foundation think-tank, said the strategy was ""likely to be a missed opportunity"". He said there were multiple factors that contributed to obesity, adding that it was important to also address the role of economic and social factors, like poverty and unemployment which ""drive poor health and inequalities"". He also pointed out that public health budgets held by councils had been cut over the years. The NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's mass in kilograms by the square of their height in metres. Check your BMI using the BBC calculator Another measure of excess fat is waist size - men with a waist of 94cm or more and women with a waist of 80cm or more are more likely to develop obesity-related problems. This video can not be played Campaigner Tasha is on a mission to make it easier for young people to have healthier diet choices Professor Dame Parveen Kumar, chairwoman of the British Medical Association's Board of Science, said: ""The BMA has long been calling for new ways to tackle obesity and we are delighted to see that the government has sat up and listened. ""What we need now is for this strategy to be actioned as quickly as possible, with the promised expansion of NHS services delivered in full, with adequate resources and funding, to ensure that those struggling with their weight can get the support they need and deserve.""

Until then, stay safe. The transport secretary decided he had to remain in Spain and observe quarantine restrictions in the UK to avoid a possible public backlash, it is understood. Grant Shapps flew out on Saturday morning aware that a quarantine requirement could be imposed on Sunday. It's understood Mr Shapps felt he could not use inside information to return to the UK before it came into force. Leicester's seven-day infection rate has dropped. It still has the second highest rate in the country,  but it has seen a decrease in cases in the week to 23 July. The city's rate has dropped from 91.5 cases per 100,000 people in the week before to 64.2. This compares to about 7 cases per 100,000 people across England. The next review of Leicester's local lockdown is due before Saturday. One person has been fined by police for breaching quarantine rules after arriving from abroad, new figures from forces in England and Wales show. The data released by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) on Monday comes after holidaymakers in Spain and its islands were told they would have to self-isolate for 14 days when returning to the UK. The ticket for breaching quarantine rules, which was issued by Lincolnshire Police, was one of only eight fixed penalty notices handed out in England in the two weeks to July 20, with none in Wales. NPCC chairman Martin Hewitt said compliance with the rules had been good, but added ""it's really difficult to understand how people will respond"" after Spain was removed from the UK's list of safe destinations over a spike in the number of coronavirus cases. ""You would hope that people would come back and be responsible,"" he said. A total of 18,669 fixed-penalty notices, including 16,029 in England and 2,640 in Wales, have been recorded by forces up to July 20. The figures do not include fines issued during the local Leicester lockdown. Interest-free loans are being offered to people affected by the coronavirus crisis, in a scheme designed to protect people against loan sharks. Bradford District Credit Union has partnered with Bradford Council to offer people furloughed or waiting for benefits a Â£500 loan and grant package. Those eligible will receive Â£50 to save with the credit union, and Â£450 to spend with 0% interest rate. It comes amid warningsabout the risks of increased illegal lending. BBC Sport London Marathon organisershave delayed a decisionon when the 2020 event can be held until 7 August. The 40th edition of the race was originally scheduled for 26 April but waspushed back to 4 Octoberat the start of the coronavirus outbreak. An announcement on it taking place on that date was expected on Tuesday. Passengers have been expressing mixed views on the government's decision to quarantine people arriving in the UK from Spain, after a surge in coronavirus cases there. Laura Martin, an au pair who lives in London, is unable to return to work for 14 days due to the quarantine.
The 27-year-old flew into Heathrow Airport from Madrid, where she was visiting friends and family. ""The quarantine is not a problem. I think it's just for people's safety,"" she said. Meanwhile Tony and Yolanda Schofield, from Leamington Spa, flew into Heathrow Airport from Madrid on Monday morning, having travelled from Mexico. ""We were surprised at the final bit of having to quarantine from Spain, although we knew we would have to, coming back from Mexico,"" Mr Schofield said. ""It has been very smooth, very easy."" Asked about the two-week quarantine, Mrs Schofield said: ""For us it's OK because we don't have to go to work. We've kind of planned it really to do that, and we've got somewhere to quarantine."" BBC Radio Leicester The mother of an 11-year-old girl who uses a ventilator to breathe says shortages of equipment during the coronavirus pandemic has been a ""massive worry"". Lidia
Sherwood's daughter Maddison, from Loughborough, has spinal muscular atrophy and is dependent on a ventilator. The family is being supported by the charity WellChild, who said to address the shortage, some parents have been told to re-use equipment for sometimes twice as long than previously recommended. Ms Sherwood said: ""Our biggest concern is if we do get a second wave and things aren't put in place now and it happens again."" The Department of Health and Social Care said Covid-19 had ""caused a significant increase in demand for clinical consumables and disrupted international supply chains"". ""We have put in place a range of measures to address these challenges,
including making it easier for clinicians to report shortages and identifying
opportunities to open up new supply options and using additional brands,"" a spokesperson added. BBC Hereford and Worcester A family is set to lose Â£1,000 after deciding to cancel their holiday to Spain next month. With peoplearriving back in the UK from Spain having to self-isolate for 14 days,Sarah Hepworth, from Bromsgrove, said they couldn't go on the trip. She told BBC Hereford and Worcester they had been due to go on 8 August but coming back with the added quarantine would have overlapped with her children returning to school. ""It's hard because the children were looking forward to it after having to stay in for such a long time and then have this very last minute, it's a real pain."" Mrs Hepworth added their holiday insurance wouldn't cover the cancellation so their only hope would be if the airline cancelled the flights. There is currently no evidence to suggest pets can transfer coronavirus to their owners,medical experts have said. It comes after a cat tested positive for coronavirus in England. The UK's chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: ""This is a very rare event, with infected animals detected to date only showing mild clinical signs and recovering within a few days."" She added although there was no evidence of the virus transferring the other way, the government would ""continue to monitor this situation closely"" and may update its guidance on pets. A team of scientists at the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research are behind a programme to screen hundreds of samples for Covid-19 infections in the UK cat population. Professor Margaret Hosie, who works on the project, said: ""All available evidence suggests that the cat was infected from its owners, who had previously tested positive. The cat and its owners have since made a full recovery and there was no transmission of the virus to other animals or people in the household."" An artist hopes to give back to the city where he grew up by making face masksinspired by the ""great and the good of Manchester"". Justin Eagleton has designed reusable masks with a portion of the proceeds to be donated to the Greater Manchester Mayor's Charity and Manchester Mind. ""It's about giving back and hopefully making a difference,"" Mr Eagleton said. The project, named Maskchester, comes as face maskswere made compulsoryin shops in England on Friday. Boris Johnson will announce the end of confectionery displays at store checkouts and ban junk food adverts on TV before 21:00as he looks to encourage Britons to lose weight. The prime minister revealed how his own brush with Covid-19 - which saw him require intensive care in April - convinced him of the need to tackle obesity across the country. A Public Health England (PHE) study published on Saturday discovered that being classed as medically obese increased the risk of death from coronavirus by 40%. Some of the other announcements in Mr Johnson's ""Better Health"" campaign will include: A schoolboy with a stammer says he hopes that by explaining his difficulties in communicating during lockdown, he will help others. Thomas Grattoni-May has a blocking stammer, which means his mouth is positioned but no sound comes out. The 15-year-old said using audio digital platforms for lessons meant no-one could see he was trying to speak. He said he was part of a ""silent group... who have struggled in ways that others perhaps will not realise"". Anearlier lockdown would ""likely have saved"" the livesof London bus drivers who died with coronavirus, according to a study. University College London was asked by Transport for London to investigate the high death rate of London bus workers. Thirty-four London bus workers died with Covid-19, including 29 drivers - 3.5 times the rate of other roles. An earlier lockdown ""would likely have saved more lives,"" the report found. With new quarantine rules meaning travellers returning to the UK from Spain will have to quarantine for 14 days, many are asking how this will affect them. Spain's removal from the list of exempt countries follows ""a significant change over the last week in both the level and pace"" of coronavirus cases, the government said. Employment lawyer and partner at Freeths, Kevin Poulter, chair of ABTA, Alistair Rowland, and group editor of Trade Travel Gazette, Pippa Jacks, share their expert advice on how this change will impact holidaymakers. This video can not be played Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. New rules mean face coverings are now mandatory in England in all shops, as well as enclosed public spaces, transport hubs, banks and post offices. Those who break the rules could face a fine of up to Â£100. There are exemptions for children under 11, those with disabilities or certain health conditions such as respiratory or cognitive impairments that make it difficult for them to wear a face covering. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains the correct way to wear your homemade mask or face covering.

Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England (PHE), said: ""This is the first case of a domestic cat testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK but should not be a cause for alarm. ""The investigation into this case suggests that the infection was spread from humans to animal, and not the other way round.""

How bad is our obesity problem?,"Obesity has been linked to deprivation Prime Minister Boris Johnson is promising to set out an ambitious programme to tackle obesity in the coming days. The plan is likely toinclude a ban on junk food advertising before 9pm and restrictions on in-store promotions. It's no coincidence this is being launched in a middle of pandemic, which has seen tens of thousands of people die or left dealing with potentially long-term health problems after being infected with coronavirus. Research suggests being overweightputs people at higher risk of complications from the virus - once again emphasising the toll obesity is taking on the health of the nation. So how bad is the problem? Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? Does being overweight or obese affect how ill people get with coronavirus? Obesity study shows increased disease and death risks Nearly two-thirds of adults are classed as overweight, with more than a quarter deemed obese - according to data from NHS Digital. Rates have risen since the early 1990s - at first rapidly,  although more slowly over the past 10 years, suggesting some of the subsequent measures taken, as well as awareness-raising about the problem, have started to alter our behaviour. Men are slightly more likely to be obese than women. It also differs by age group, with the proportion of people who are overweight rising as people get older, peaking in the mid-50s to mid-60s. As well as putting people at risk of complications from coronavirus, being obese is also linked to a higher risk of other conditions - from heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer, to problems during pregnancy and joint pain. The high rates of obesity take such a toll on our health that 876,000 hospital admissions were linked to weight problems in 2018-19. The rate of those admissions varies quite significantly across the country, with areas in the Midlands and north of England tending to see higher rates than other parts. Wigan, Wirral, York, Stoke-on-Trent and Nottingham all recorded admission rates of over 3,000 per 100,000 population. That compares to the likes of Wokingham and West Berkshire, which both saw rates below 500 per 100,000 population. There is a clear link with deprivation - overall those in the most deprived areas are two-and-a-half times more likely to be admitted to hospital with obesity listed as a factor. And this is not just an issue for adults. Thanks to the National Child Measurement Programme, which tracks obesity rates in schools across the country, we have clear data for primary school children. It shows one in 10 children in reception year are obese, rising to one in five by the end of primary school. If you include children who are overweight, the proportions rise to one in five and one in three respectively. It is why the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has described the obesity issue as ""one of the greatest threats""  to children and society as a whole. And, once again, the highest rates are seen in the most deprived areas. Why is this? There is plenty of debate about the exact causes. But certainly the so-called obesogenic environment plays a crucial role - research shows poorer areas have fewer opportunities for physical activity and a greater concentration of fast food outlets. It goes without saying that obesity is not an England-only problem. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have almost identical levels. But around the world, rates do vary quite significantly. Less than 10% of adults in South Korea and Japan are obese, compared to 40% in the US. The UK's rates are a little above average, greater than a number of our near neighbours, including Germany and France. Attempts to get the rate down have undoubtedly not been helped by the turbulent nature of our politics in recent years and the changes in prime minister. In 2015, David Cameron's government was briefing that an ambitious obesity strategy was being planned. The contents are remarkably similar to what the government is talking about now: bans on TV advertising of junk food before 9pm and restrictions on supermarket in-store promotions, alongside the sugar levy on soft drinks. But the mood music changed when Theresa May took over. A much watered-down plan was published in the middle of summer recess in 2016 and many of the tough measures dropped - although the sugar levy went ahead. But in 2018 a new plan - or updated plan, as it was couched - was published, re-emphasising the need for action. When Boris Johnson became prime minister the following year he sounded unconvinced, calling for a review of so-called sin taxes. It now looks like his appetite for action has changed too.

Thank you for reading and please join us again tomorrow. The news in the UK has been dominated by the decision to quarantine arrivals from Spain, which was made by the government at the weekend.  You can catch up with the day's news with our evening briefinghere. It's been another busy day of developments as the coronavirus pandemic continues  to affect the lives of millions around the world. As we prepare to pause our live coverage, here are the main global headlines: This video can not be played ""We have to wear more PPE, even though we wear PPE as well on a regular basis,"" says tattooist Jules Lee, who runs a tattoo shop in Bangor. Tattoo parlours have reopened today in Wales for the first time since lockdown, along with beauty salons, spas and tanning shops. They've already opened in England, Scotland and NI. Clients have to make appointments, with no more walk-ins from the street allowed. President Jair Bolsonaro has described the virus as a ""little flu"" Health workers in Brazil have urged the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague to investigate President Jair Bolsonaro's government over its handling of the pandemic. A group claiming to represent more than one million healthcare staff has handed over a dossier of evidence to the court. It alleges that government negligence has contributed to the deaths of tens of thousands of people. The government has not responded to the complaint. Mr Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the virus as a minor threat, ignoring social distancing and calling for lockdown measures to be suspended. But Brazil has recorded nearly 2.5m infections and is second only to the United States in terms of cases and deaths from Covid-19. Traditional hot spring inns are being encouraged to boost their internet connectivity In Japan, the government is urging people to take working holidays to boost the coronavirus-hit economy. The Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said ministries would encourage tourist destinations to become more work-friendly with a new push for WiFi connectivity in hotels and traditional hot spring inns. A government scheme providing financial incentives for domestic holidaymakers is already in force in Japan, where borders remain closed to foreign visitors. But  critics have pointed to the risks of encouraging people to move around the country with the number of infections increasing. The tourism sector had been expecting a boost from the now delayed 2020 Olympic Games. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check False and misleading posts about the global hunt for a vaccine are circulating online. Weâve been fact-checking some widely shared examples. In one video, a US-based osteopath claims that Covid-19 vaccines are designed to make humans into âgenetically modified organismsâ and vaccines will change recipientsâ DNA. This is not true - there are25 different candidate vaccines,externalin clinical trials around the world according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and none of them will alter human DNA. The vaccines are all designed to provoke an immune response by training our bodies to recognise and fight the virus. The video also claims that trials are not following sound scientific protocol and weâve spotted similar concerns in Facebook groups. ""New vaccines undergo rigorous safety checks before they can be recommended for widespread use,"" says Michelle Roberts, the BBC's online health editor. As weâve seen throughout the pandemic, this video uses scientific language which will be unfamiliar to many people, making it difficult for them to assess whatâs accurate or not. We can help - if thereâs a claim youâd like us to investigate,get in touch with the Reality Check team here. And you can read the article in full here. Antwerp is the focus of concern now in Belgium Belgium is tightening restrictions - but avoiding another lockdown - because of a worrying rise in Covid-19 cases. From Wednesday, Belgians will be allowed to see a maximum of five people
outside of their families. Currently a Belgian individual can meet 15 people in a ""social bubble"". The rise in cases has been especially sharp in the city of Antwerp. In the past week an average of 279 people daily have caught coronavirus in Belgium,
compared with 163 a day the week before. The current death toll officially is 9,821. ""Until now, the 'social bubble'
of each person was limited to 15 people per week. From Wednesday, it will be
limited to five people, always the same ones, for the next four weeks, and this
for an entire family,"" said PM Sophie WilmÃ¨s. ""So we are counting for the household and no longer per
person. Children under the age of 12 do not count in those five people."" Belgium is also halving the numbers allowed at public gatherings - to 100 indoors, and 200 outdoors. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter Lewis Hamilton has more than 18 million followers on Instagram F1 Driver Lewis
Hamilton has issued a statement to ""clarify his thoughts"" after sharing a video
that fuels conspiracy theories about Bill Gates and a coronavirus vaccine. He shared the original post on his Instagram story to over 18 million followers for 13 hours - but in
a new post he's now said he ""hadnât seen the comment attached"" and that he's ""only human"". The video was
from a large Instagram account that features Gates being interviewed on US
television about progress being made on a coronavirus vaccine - with the
caption ""I remember when I told my first lie"" (the caption was not written by Hamilton). In the video, Gates addresses concerns about side effects reported during ongoing vaccine
trials - and also dismisses unfounded rumours that the vaccines are a way of
microchipping people (claims which Reality Check has debunked) However, the
caption suggests that both his dismissal and reassurances about the vaccine are
untrue. Hamilton has
since said that he's ""not against a vaccine"" and that it ""will be important in
the fight against coronavirus"". Here are some of the main stories we've been covering today. The Miami Marlins opened their season on Friday but a number of players have since tested positive Less than a week after the Major League Baseball (MLB) season launched, two games have been postponed due to outbreaks of the virus. Games between the Miami Marlins and Baltimore Orioles in Florida, and the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees in Pennsylvania, had been scheduled for Monday but have now been cancelled. The decision followed reports in US media that 10 members of the Marlins - eight players and two coaches - had tested positive for the virus. That would bring the total number of cases on the team to 14. It comes just days after the MLB began its season, which was delayed for four months because of the pandemic The MLB said in a statement that the games were postponed while it ""conducts additional Covid-19 testing"". It is expected to hold an emergency meeting in the coming days. Tour operator Jet2 has cancelled flights to Spain and Portugal following the latest UK government guidance. The company said it was suspending routes to Almeria, Alicante, Malaga and Murcia from Tuesday up to and including August 16, as well as to Faro, in the Algarve region of Portugal. A spokesperson said Jet2 would be monitoring the situation closely and that it would be proactively contacting customers already in the countries to inform them of their options. Its announcement came before the Foreign Office updated its non-essential travel advice for Spain to include the Spanish islands. On Saturday a 14-day quarantine was introduced for visitors returning from Spain after an increase in coronavirus cases there. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesperson said: ""We have considered the overall situation for British nationals travelling to and from the Balearic and Canary Islands, including the impact of the requirement to self-isolate on return to the UK, and concluded that we should advise British nationals against all non-essential travel to the whole of Spain."" The FCO added that while people currently in Spain will have to self-isolate upon their return they are not being advised to cut short their visits. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has updated its travel advice for Spain, stating that people should not make non-essential journeys to any part of the country, including the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands. Read the full advice here.,external Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock wrote in theDaily Telegraph this morning,external: âIf everyone who is overweight lost five pounds it could save the NHS over Â£100 million over the next five years.â That figure is based on the finding inthis research,external, which looked at savings in treating things like cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and strokes if all overweight people lost 2.5kg. What the government has done is to extend those findings across the 27.2 million overweight adults in the UK. The result seems remarkably small. Itâs a saving of less than Â£4 per person over five years. In terms of the overall budget of the NHS itâs also a very small amount of money saved â about one hundredth of a percent. The government hasunveiled a range of measures amid growing evidence of a link between obesity and increased risk from Covid-19. BBC medical drama Holby City has resumed filming for the first time in four months, with a special episode that sees the hospital gripped by the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, the BBC said the drama will be back on screens later this year with slightly shorter 40-minute episodes. It added that, throughout the production, the Holby City team would practice social distancing and have other protocols in place to ensure workplace safety. The UK decision to make arrivals from Spain self-isolate has shocked the tourism industry After the UK imposed a 14-day quarantine on all arrivals
from Spain, a Spanish tourism group has offered to pay for tourists to take
coronavirus tests. Jorge Marichal, head of Spainâs Confederation of Hotels and
Tourist Accommodation (CEHAT), has called for a Europe-wide programme of reciprocal
visitor testing to help the embattled tourism sector. Describing the UK government quarantine order as âa surprise
and a disappointmentâ, he said decisions should be taken ""at a
European levelâ for the âmaximum safety of tourists, workers and residents of
tourist areasâ. A similar debate is brewing in Germany, where the government
is coming under pressure to make testing mandatory for people returning from high-risk
countries. On Friday authorities made free tests available voluntarily
for people coming back from countries like Brazil, Turkey and the US, but some
politicians want it to be compulsory. One of the top stories in the UK today has been about obesity, as the government unveils its new strategy to tackle the health issue in England. The plan includes a ban on ""buy one get one free"" deals on unhealthy food and new rules for displaying calories on menus. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the plans will also help in the ongoing work to control Covid-19. They will ""reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus,"" he said. It comes amid growing evidence of a link between obesity and an increased risk of complications from coronavirus. Government statistics showed nearly 8% of critically ill patients in intensive care units with the virus have been morbidly obese, compared with 2.9% of the general population. Johnson said he had been ""steadily building up my fitness"" after recovering from coronavirus. ""I'm at least a stone down, I'm more than a stone down,"" he said. The mass took place at the Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona The head of the regional government of Catalonia, in north-eastern Spain, has called for the Catholic Church to be penalised over a mass that breached coronavirus restrictions. The gathering in Barcelona's famous Sagrada Familia basilica was held to commemorate victims of the pandemic on Sunday. Social distancing measures were in place, but the numbers attending exceeded the decreed maximum of ten. Catalan President Quim Torra said a collective effort was needed to tackle the region's growing outbreak, which he described as ""very worrying"". Spain's rate of infection has jumped in recent days. While the outbreak remains under control in many parts, certain areas - in particular Catalonia and the neighbouring region of AragÃ³n - have seen a huge spike in infections. Local authorities have issued stay-at-home orders for some four million residents in Catalonia, including in the regional capital Barcelona. Earlier today, Mr Torra said even stricter lockdown measures could be imposed if infection numbers did not improve in the next 10 days. Natalie Sherman & Zoe ThomasBusiness reporters, New York Demand at food banks in the US has surged during the pandemic In the US, the $600 (Â£465) a week additional payment that the government approved to top up unemployment benefits during the pandemic will expire on 31 July. In many states, recipients have already received their last cheque. ""It's pretty dire,"" says Brandon Humberston, who worked as a cook at Mexican restaurant until the pandemic cost him his job. His benefits will be cut from $750 to $150. ""My generation is hanging on by a thread."" Politicians in Washington have yet to act. While Democrats have proposed another $3tn in spending, Republicans have rejected that plan and they are divided about how much more aid - if any - is warranted. The fate of the unemployment benefits that Mr Humberston - and an estimated 30 million other Americans rely on - is giving the debate a sense of urgency. You can read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Ryanair swings to loss in 'challenging' pandemic,"Ryanair has said it will continue its flights in and out of Spain as normal, despite the UK government's decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on travellers arriving from the country. Neil Sorahan, Ryanair's chief financial officer, told the BBC: ""The schedules remain in place."" The travel industry has been plunged into confusion by the quarantine rule, which was announced over the weekend. Airlines have called it a ""big blow"", throwing travel plans into chaos. But speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Mr Sorahan said: ""As things stand, the market remains open, the schedules remain in place and we continue to operate in and out of Spain as normal."" He added, however, that Ryanair was keeping its entire operation ""under consideration"" as it builds back its route network post-lockdown. UK had to act 'rapidly' on Spain quarantine Spain insists it is safe amid new virus outbreaks Spain quarantine: 'We found out three minutes after landing' What are the quarantine rules for Spain and its islands? Mr Sorahan was questioned about previous remarks by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who has described quarantine measures as a ""political stunt"". He said it was ""a possibility"" that people would not follow the guidance. ""it's extremely difficult to police quarantine. People make their own decisions,"" he said. ""I don't think it's the most effective measure out there, but it's the measure that's been chosen by the UK government."" Earlier, Ryanair revealed that it had fallen into loss in the first three months of the financial year after what it called the most challenging period in its history. With more than 99% of its fleet grounded because of the pandemic, the airline reported a loss of â¬185m (Â£169m) over the April-to-June period, compared with a profit of â¬243m a year earlier. Ryanair said it expected to clear more than 90% of refunds for cancelled flights by the end of July. The airline said it was impossible to predict how long the coronavirus pandemic would persist. ""A second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe in late autumn (when the annual flu season commences) is our biggest fear right now,"" it added. The UK announced a surprise 14-day quarantine for travellers from Spain on Saturday Airlines have been struggling because of global travel restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus. In May, Ryanair announced it was set to cut 3,000 jobs across Europe. However, earlier this month, the company revealed thatit had cut a deal with the Unite union, including temporary pay cuts, so that UK cabin crew jobs would be safeguarded. The airline later said it was shuttingits base at Frankfurt Hahn airportafter German pilots voted to reject pay cuts. In its latest results statement, Ryanair repeated its criticism of rival airlines for receiving what it called ""illegal state aid"" to stay in business. ""Many other airlines are cutting capacity, with the result that air travel in Europe is likely to be depressed for at least the next two or three years,"" it added. ""This will create opportunities for Ryanair... to grow its network and expand its fleet, to take advantage of lower airport and aircraft cost opportunities that will inevitably arise."" The airline said the challenge of Brexit, and in particular a no-deal Brexit, remained high. It said it hoped that the UK and EU would agree a trade deal for air travel that would allow the free movement of people and the deregulated airline market between the UK and Ireland to continue. ""As an EU airline, the Ryanair Group should be less affected by a no-deal Brexit than UK registered airlines.  We still, however, expect adverse trading consequences to arise,"" the airline said. ""Ryanair has put the necessary measures in place to ensure that the group remains majority EU owned, including restricting voting rights of non-EU shareholders, in the event of a 'hard Brexit'"". Ryanair said it remained a committed supporter of the ""game-changer"" Boeing 737 Max plane, which was grounded last year after two crashes killed all 346 people on the flights. It was due to take delivery of its first 737 Max planes more than a year ago and still hopes to do so before the end of 2020. The US aviation regulator has started formal test flights for the troubled planeafter Boeing overhauled its flight control system.

Hong Kong launches share index of tech giants,"A new share index focused on China's technology giants has been launched by Hong Kong's stock market. The Hang Seng Tech Index went live on Monday and includes internet giants such as Tencent, Alibaba and JD.com. It will feature 30 of the largest tech firms listed in Hong Kong, which are among the world's biggest companies. The new index comes as Chinese tech firms face greater scrutiny in the US, with many looking at listings in both Hong Kong and China. Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of Alibaba, recently announced plans to list its affiliate financial arm Ant Group in Hong Kong. China's Star market aims to take on the Nasdaq Nasdaq to tighten rules amid concerns over Chinese firms The man trying to stop the virus (and fix China's image) Alibaba, NetEase and JD.com are three tech giants that have recently listed in Hong Kong amid growing tensions between the US and China. They are included in the new Hang Seng Tech Index. The Ant Group is described as the world's most valuable unicorn - a start-up that has grown to a value of more than $1bn (Â£778m). Once publicly listed, it should also move into the index. Ant Group, a financial technology (fintech) firm, also wants to list on China's tech-centric Star stock market as it shuns a US stock market listing. Analysts say the Hang Seng Tech index will attract investors to other Hong Kong tech stocks and look beyond the more well-known Hang Seng Index which is dominated by banks, property firms and energy companies. ""The new index aims to rival and beat the Nasdaq in the US market for Chinese tech giants,"" said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research for China Renaissance Securities. The Hang Seng Tech Index will track Hong Kong-listed companies that have high business exposure to selected technology themes, including the internet, fintech, cloud, e-commerce and digital activities. ""The Chinese government wants its technology companies to be able to access foreign capital. Thus, an index in Hong Kong would be better to suit that purpose,"" added Tianjun Wu, deputy economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Investment experts say it will be more convenient for investors who want to buy Chinese tech companies listed in Hong Kong now they have their own index. There is a huge appetite for technology stocks like Alibaba and Tencent, which have generally performed well during the coronavirus pandemic as more people go online for shopping and entertainment. The new index could trigger the launch of specialised investment funds tracking these 30 tech stocks, which are known as Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). ""This is a great and positive new addition, marking the continued growth in China's technology space and its mind and portfolio share of local and international investors alike,"" added Andy Maynard, managing director at China Renaissance investment bank.

"Students back at uni - but with masks and no barsFace-to-face teaching starts again at the University of Nottingham, with safety rules on campus.Family & Education","The trainee vets say they're relieved to be back with their friends again after the long lockdown The first students are beginning to return for face-to-face teaching on UK university campuses - with a new term of compulsory masks and closed bars. Most students won't begin until the autumn, but veterinary students are now back at the University of Nottingham. They are the pioneers for how campuses across the UK could look as they reopen after the Covid-19 lockdown. ""The social experience will be more limited, but these are unprecedented times,"" says registrar Paul Greatrix. The first cohort going back in Nottingham are 150 trainee vets, some of whom will see a great deal of each other - as the university adopts the ""bubble"" system in which small groups will live as well as study together. The university is calling it ""households"" rather than ""bubbles"", but it is the same principle of restricting the spread of infection by keeping people in small groups which are kept separate from each other. University buildings have highly visible messages reminding students about safety messages Within these households of three to 10 students there will be no need for social distancing or wearing masks, but where different households meet the students will have to stay apart. ""Safety has to be the priority,"" says Dr Greatrix. Students might have to stay in protective bubbles Students face full fees for courses taught online Chinese students want reassurance on Covid safety The buildings are mapped out with one-way systems and hand sanitising stations and masks have to be worn, including in lessons, by staff and students. Lectures will be online and there will be in-person teaching for small groups, which is essential for a practical subject such as veterinary science. Sarah Cripps says it was impossible to teach such a practical subject online The student bars are closed and there are posters up for a pizza night that's going to be an online event. ""We can't emulate an all-night club experience through a Zoom chat,"" says Dr Greatrix. But he says the university is doing everything it can to create a sense of involvement. The students at Nottingham just seem very glad to be back and seeing friends, after months of being cooped up at home and having to study online. Registrar Paul Greatrix says it is a huge logistical operation to get ready for 40,000 students and staff in the autumn They don't seem particularly daunted by the safety restrictions or that much of the socialising will be online. ""We were desperate to come back,"" says Amy Thornton. ""It will be different, but it was time to come back."" She will be living in a bubble with five other trainee vets - and isn't worried about the new arrangements or seeing too much of a small number of people. ""It's just nice to see people again,"" says Emily Howell. ""We're going to have to get on with it."" Tom handles a milk snake as part of the training in looking after reptiles The online lectures are useful, she says, because you can rewind them. ""But I can't wait to do practicals."" Her flatmate, Lewis Ashman, says he has no concerns about any risks from going on to the campus. ""It's safe,"" he says. Tom, getting his first chance to hold a snake and a bearded dragon called Barbie, says it's ""great to be back"". The students don't mind the masks, but they're finding that dogs used in training don't like them - and it can set them off barking. It's also a relief to be back teaching in person rather than online, says clinical assistant professor, Sarah Cripps. Nottingham has a one-way system operating across its buildings Universities didn't close, but went online - and the pandemic has shown the limitations of remote teaching, and how much is missed when students and teachers are not there together in person. And in the case of a practical subject such as learning to be a vet, which is all about handling, it's impossible to switch completely online. Dr Greatrix says reopening for the rest of Nottingham's 40,000 students and staff will be one of the biggest projects the university has ever faced. There will be staggered arrival times in September to reduce contacts between students, in what is like a small town turning up. Emily Howell and Lewis Ashman do not have any worries about the safety of being on campus And there are plans if there are further Covid-19 outbreaks, either in halls of residence or in parts of the city where students are living. There is a strong message of reassurance about safety - not least to overseas students, particularly from China, who have been doubtful of how well the pandemic has been handled in the UK. Dr Greatrix says he will be pleased if more than 50% of overseas students turn up as planned - with many universities fearing a financial hit from cancellations. Universities can introduce safety rules, but students are adults and he recognises there is no way of preventing people in separate bubbles from meeting away from the university - such as going to a local pub. And it's not possible to put the same safety controls on students living in private accommodation. ""We'll try to regularly remind students about a sense of responsibility,"" said Dr Greatrix.

Beauty salons and tattooists reopen in WalesBeauty salons are reopening but people may have to wait longer for fillers and eyebrow treatments.Wales,"This video can not be played Customers are back in beauty salons and tattoo parlours - but with protective measures in place Beauty salons and tattooists in Wales are allowed to reopen for the first time since lockdown. The Welsh Government's latest easing of restrictions means nail bars, spas, and tanning shops can open again on Monday. But people will have to wait longer for facials and to get their eyebrows and eyelashes done, with guidelines warning the treatments are ""too high risk"". One salon owner in Vale of Glamorgan said she had missed out on trade during her busiest time of year. And a tattooist in Gwynedd opened at midnight to finish off a woman's tattoo she had started before lockdown. This video can not be played Life is ""horrible"" without his fillers and Botox, Iwan Steffan says Welsh Government guidance,externalhas outlined which businesses can open on Monday, and measures they should put in place, including: Beauty salons, including nail bars and tanning shops, can reopen, but facial treatments are not advised Spas can resume business, but only for beauty treatments and not for saunas and pools Tattooists can resume, but walk-in appointments are not allowed Businesses offering piercing, electrolysis and acupuncture have also given the green light to reopen Hairdressers havebeen able to opensince 13 July. But theWelsh Government guidance has ""strongly advised"",externalbeauticians not to perform facial treatments, due to the high risk of people being face-to-face for long periods of time. This includes eyebrow tinting, waxing and threading, fillers, eyelash treatments, dermaplaning and microblading treatments and makeup. If beauticians choose to perform treatments on clients' faces, they must wear a fluid resistant surgical face mask, goggles, disposable gloves and an apron, and be fully trained in using personal protective equipment (PPE) safely, the guidelines say. The Welsh Government said it had ""worked with public health experts and the beauty industry to develop the guidance and make it is as clear as possible for an industry that covers a huge range of different procedures across a wide variety of settings"". The decision to prohibit facial treatments is based on Public Health Wales guidance, it added. Jayne Goodings, owner of Lemon Tree Nails and Beauty Salon, says she has missed out on most of her busiest time of year The owner of a beauty salon said businesses would be trying to make up for a significant loss of income, but predicted some would be unable to open straight away due to receiving the guidance at such short notice. ""Our busiest time of the year is from April to September when we take possibly more than 50% of our annual takings so for us it's been a massive hit on our business,"" said Jayne Goodings, owner of Lemon Tree Nails and Beauty Salon, in Cowbridge. ""The guidance was issued [Friday] and we're due to open on Monday. ""I'm lucky that I've got the measures in place but there could be a lot of salons that haven't and are now trying to source PPE in readiness for Monday."" Ms Goodings added: ""It has been difficult. Sourcing PPE in itself has been a marathon to say the least."" Sarah Bruton said beauty therapists were already well trained in limiting cross-infection Sarah Bruton of Captiva Spa and Lounge in Caerphilly says she will now open seven days a week to cope with demand and allow staff to work the same hours but with more space around them. She has introduced perspex screens, hand-sanitising stations and temperature checks, and removed things like fluffy towels and robes. Sarah said: ""We've changed some of our operating processes so we do treatments in a slightly different way and we've procured lots of PPE, so things like aprons, visors and gloves and masks, to make our working practices as safe as possible."" She added: ""We're trained to do things like limit cross-infection and prevent contamination, so we're already very well placed to be able to protect people against Covid."" This video can not be played Jules Lee said tattooists were already ""one of the cleanest places"" Jules Lee opened her tattoo shop in Bangor at midnight. Her first client was a woman whose tattoo was left incomplete when lockdown was announced. Because of the strict hygiene rules governing tattoo shops before the pandemic, Ms Lee said Covid-19 requirements should not be too challenging. ""Tattooists are one of the cleanest places you can be,"" she said. ""There is a need for more PPE - we were already using PPE anyway, but we have to use more now."" Ms Lee finished a tattoo of a rose, inspired by the Disney film Beauty and the Beast, on Louise Pritchard's leg Louise Pritchard, Ms Lee's first customer after reopening, said: ""I have waited for this since Jules had to close, [it] feels like forever. It feels like a lifetime ago. ""I agreed to come at midnight because I've been waiting for ages and I was really looking forward to it. ""I love my ink. I don't like things being half finished and Jules has been great fitting me in, and it is really therapeutic."" Ms Lee said the tattoo, on Ms Pritchard's lower leg, was inspired by the film Beauty and the Beast and was part of a wider piece. ""Louise is a Disney mega fan,"" she said. ""We are working on a Disney-themed leg sleeve for her. ""She's a very loyal client that I've been tattooing for months and she was very eager to get more ink as soon as."" New PPE requirements are the biggest change, Ms Lee says Ms Lee said customers needed to book in advance and must not turn up more than five minutes before their appointment or hang around afterwards. Hand sanitiser will be provided for customers and she will leave an hour between appointments to allow her time to ""deep clean"". After a ""worrying"" time without revenue, Ms Lee said she could not wait to reopen. ""I'm so excited - I just love my job,"" she added.

But Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the steps taken by Twitter and Instagram were not enough.

""It takes minutes for content shared on your platform to reach an audience of millions. When someone influential shares hate speech, in that time it may have an impact on the views of many who look up to them.""

"Students back at uni - but with masks and no barsFace-to-face teaching starts again at the University of Nottingham, with safety rules on campus.","The trainee vets say they're relieved to be back with their friends again after the long lockdown The first students are beginning to return for face-to-face teaching on UK university campuses - with a new term of compulsory masks and closed bars. Most students won't begin until the autumn, but veterinary students are now back at the University of Nottingham. They are the pioneers for how campuses across the UK could look as they reopen after the Covid-19 lockdown. ""The social experience will be more limited, but these are unprecedented times,"" says registrar Paul Greatrix. The first cohort going back in Nottingham are 150 trainee vets, some of whom will see a great deal of each other - as the university adopts the ""bubble"" system in which small groups will live as well as study together. The university is calling it ""households"" rather than ""bubbles"", but it is the same principle of restricting the spread of infection by keeping people in small groups which are kept separate from each other. University buildings have highly visible messages reminding students about safety messages Within these households of three to 10 students there will be no need for social distancing or wearing masks, but where different households meet the students will have to stay apart. ""Safety has to be the priority,"" says Dr Greatrix. Students might have to stay in protective bubbles Students face full fees for courses taught online Chinese students want reassurance on Covid safety The buildings are mapped out with one-way systems and hand sanitising stations and masks have to be worn, including in lessons, by staff and students. Lectures will be online and there will be in-person teaching for small groups, which is essential for a practical subject such as veterinary science. Sarah Cripps says it was impossible to teach such a practical subject online The student bars are closed and there are posters up for a pizza night that's going to be an online event. ""We can't emulate an all-night club experience through a Zoom chat,"" says Dr Greatrix. But he says the university is doing everything it can to create a sense of involvement. The students at Nottingham just seem very glad to be back and seeing friends, after months of being cooped up at home and having to study online. Registrar Paul Greatrix says it is a huge logistical operation to get ready for 40,000 students and staff in the autumn They don't seem particularly daunted by the safety restrictions or that much of the socialising will be online. ""We were desperate to come back,"" says Amy Thornton. ""It will be different, but it was time to come back."" She will be living in a bubble with five other trainee vets - and isn't worried about the new arrangements or seeing too much of a small number of people. ""It's just nice to see people again,"" says Emily Howell. ""We're going to have to get on with it."" Tom handles a milk snake as part of the training in looking after reptiles The online lectures are useful, she says, because you can rewind them. ""But I can't wait to do practicals."" Her flatmate, Lewis Ashman, says he has no concerns about any risks from going on to the campus. ""It's safe,"" he says. Tom, getting his first chance to hold a snake and a bearded dragon called Barbie, says it's ""great to be back"". The students don't mind the masks, but they're finding that dogs used in training don't like them - and it can set them off barking. It's also a relief to be back teaching in person rather than online, says clinical assistant professor, Sarah Cripps. Nottingham has a one-way system operating across its buildings Universities didn't close, but went online - and the pandemic has shown the limitations of remote teaching, and how much is missed when students and teachers are not there together in person. And in the case of a practical subject such as learning to be a vet, which is all about handling, it's impossible to switch completely online. Dr Greatrix says reopening for the rest of Nottingham's 40,000 students and staff will be one of the biggest projects the university has ever faced. There will be staggered arrival times in September to reduce contacts between students, in what is like a small town turning up. Emily Howell and Lewis Ashman do not have any worries about the safety of being on campus And there are plans if there are further Covid-19 outbreaks, either in halls of residence or in parts of the city where students are living. There is a strong message of reassurance about safety - not least to overseas students, particularly from China, who have been doubtful of how well the pandemic has been handled in the UK. Dr Greatrix says he will be pleased if more than 50% of overseas students turn up as planned - with many universities fearing a financial hit from cancellations. Universities can introduce safety rules, but students are adults and he recognises there is no way of preventing people in separate bubbles from meeting away from the university - such as going to a local pub. And it's not possible to put the same safety controls on students living in private accommodation. ""We'll try to regularly remind students about a sense of responsibility,"" said Dr Greatrix.

US leaves consulate in China as deadline passes,"Crowds of curious locals gathered outside the US diplomatic mission American diplomatic staff have left their consulate in the Chinese city of Chengdu, after a 72-hour deadline expired. China ordered the closure in response tothe US closing the Chinese consulate in Houston, Texaslast week. Before Monday's deadline, staff were seen leaving the building, a plaque was removed, and a US flag was lowered. China's foreign ministry said Chinese staff entered the building after the deadline and ""took over"". A US state department spokesperson said: ""The consulate has stood at the centre of our relations with the people in Western China, including Tibet, for 35 years. ""We are disappointed by the Chinese Communist Party's decision and will strive to continue our outreach to the people in this important region through our other posts in China."" As the US consulate closed, local residents gathered outside, with many waving Chinese flags and taking selfies. The Chinese spy who hunted on LinkedIn Last Wednesday the US ordered the Chinese consulate in Houston to close, alleging that it had become a hub for spying and property theft. Tensions have been escalating between the two countries over a number of issues: US President Donald Trump's administration has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over trade and the coronavirus pandemic Washington has also condemned the imposition by China of a controversial new security law in Hong Kong Last week,a Singaporean man pleaded guilty in a US court to working as an agent of China Also last week,four Chinese nationals were charged in a separate case with US visa fraudfor allegedly lying about serving in China's military Workers began to remove the diplomatic plaque from the US consulate on Sunday Chinese state media showed pictures of lorries leaving the consulate and workers removing diplomatic insignia from the building. On Monday morning, state broadcaster CCTV posted a video of the US flag being taken down. Dozens of Chinese police were deployed outside the building, urging onlookers to move on. However, boos were heard when a bus with tinted windows left the building on Sunday, AFP news agency reports. When Chinese diplomats left their mission in Houston last week they were jeered by protesters. Last week the foreign ministry said the closure was a ""legitimate and necessary response"" to the actions taken by the US. Staff at the consulate were ""engaged in activities outside of their capacity, interfered in China's internal affairs, and endangered China's security and interests"", the statement said. The Chengdu consulate, established in 1985, represented US interests over a vast area of south-west China. The consulate was seen as strategically important, because it allowed the US to gather information on Tibet, where there has been long-running pressure for independence. Rights groups have long accused China of religious repression and human rights abuses in Tibet, which Beijing denies. With its industry and growing services sector, Chengdu also is seen by the US as providing opportunities for exports of agricultural products, cars and machinery. Police were guarding the premise from onlookers The majority of the diplomatic mission's more than 200 employees were hired locally. The closure leaves the US with four consulates in mainland China and an embassy in the capital Beijing. It also has a consulate in Hong Kong. China lost its Houston mission last week, but still has four other consulates in the US and an embassy in Washington DC. After a 72-hour deadline for Chinese diplomats to leave the Houston consulate expired on Friday, reporters saw men who appeared to be US officials force open a door to enter the premises. This video can not be played Men using a hose and closing rubbish bins at China's consulate in Houston US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington had acted because Beijing was ""stealing"" intellectual property. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin responded that the US move was based on ""a hodgepodge of anti-Chinese lies"". There are a number of things at play. US officials have blamed China for the global spread of Covid-19. More specifically, President Trump has alleged, without evidence, that the virus originated from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan.

China is accused of mass detentions, religious persecution and forced sterilisation of Uighurs and others.

Man Utd beat Leicester to reach Champions League,"Anthony Martial was brought down for the penalty from which Bruno Fernandes gave Manchester United the lead Manchester United secured a place in the Champions League at the expense of Leicester City with victory at King Power Stadium. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side needed a point from this decisive final-day meeting to confirm a place in the top four - and break the hearts of the Foxes, who were in a Champions League spot for so much of the season. Leicester needed victory once Chelsea took command at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers but their dreams were dashed as Bruno Fernandes scored a 71st-minute penalty after Anthony Martial tumbled under challenge from Wes Morgan and Jonny Evans. Both sides had their chances, with Leicester City keeper Kasper Schmeichel saving well from Marcus Rashford in the first half and Jamie Vardy seeing a header glance off the frame of the goal after the break. Leicester pressed but could not break Manchester United down and their misery was compounded when Evans was sent off against his former club for a wild, late lunge on Scott McTominay. Manchester United confirmed the formalities seconds from time when substitute Jesse Lingard robbed Schmeichel and rolled the ball into an empty net. It is a result that fulfils the usual minimum requirement of Champions League qualification for Manchester United. But while Leicester City's fifth-placed finish is highly creditable and earns a place in the Europa League, this will undoubtedly be a huge disappointment and anti-climax after being in a position to reach the Champions League for so long. It will be scant consolation for them that striker Vardy will claim the Golden Boot, as the Premier League's top scorer with 23 goals. Reaction to the Premier League final day Jamie Vardy wins Premier League Golden Boot This video can not be played Leicester 0-2 Man Utd: Solskjaer 'delighted' after Man Utd qualify for Champions League After Fernandes had made an impressive debut in a goalless draw at home to Wolves on 1 February, Manchester United stood 14 points adrift of Leicester City, who were third. Fast forward to his decisive role in this victory that sees United qualify for next season's Champions League by taking that third place, and you can see the extent of his impact. The Portuguese attacker - a mid-season signing from Sporting Lisbon in a deal that could eventually be worth around Â£68m - has provided the missing link for this Manchester United side. He has built a bridge between midfield and a talented attacking array of strikers with his talent and his positive style, looking forward every time he receives possession. Fernandes was not at his best here but he was the man who unlocked Leicester's defence as Martial won the crucial penalty, then performed his usual hop, skip and jump to send Schmeichel the wrong way and ease any lingering United nerves. It capped a remarkable recovery for Manchester United - with credit also due to manager Solskjaer for guiding his side into the top four. This video can not be played Leicester 2-0 Man Utd: We wouldnât be challenging without Vardyâs goals - Brendan Rodgers The scenes at the final whistle here showed the extent of Leicester City's bitter disappointment at being denied the footballing and financial prize that seemed theirs for the taking for so long. Brendan Rodgers' side had started to lose their early-season sparkle even before the campaign was halted in March by the coronavirus pandemic - yet they were still in a powerful position as the finish line approached. They have still had a fine season but there is no point glossing over this huge missed opportunity. Rodgers is left to rue moments such as the inexplicable meltdown at Bournemouth, where they led at half-time only to lose 4-1. The manager faces a big job to pick his players up and remind them of what they have achieved in returning to European football. When they go into next season's Europa League, will they be without players such as Ben Chilwell, a target for Chelsea and reduced here to exhorting his team-mates from the directors' box as he was absent through injury? January signing Bruno Fernandes has transformed Manchester United this season and held his nerve when it mattered against Leicester Leicester finished fifth despite ending 325 days inside the top four places during the season. Manchester United recorded a top-four finish in the Premier League for just the second time in five seasons - and the third time in seven seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers has lost 10 of his 12 meetings with Manchester United across all competitions, suffering defeats in each of the past five. Manchester United extended their unbeaten run to 14 games in the Premier League, their longest run without defeat in the competition since April 2017. Bruno Fernandes' penalty was the 14th Manchester United have been awarded in the Premier League this season, which is the most for a team in a single campaign in the competition's history. Since making his debut in the competition in February, Fernandes has been directly involved in more goals in the competition than any other player (15). Jesse Lingard scored his first Premier League goal for Manchester United since December 2018, when he hit two in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first game in charge against Cardiff. Harry Maguire became the first outfield player since Gary Pallister in 1994-95 to start every game in a Premier League campaign for Manchester United.
