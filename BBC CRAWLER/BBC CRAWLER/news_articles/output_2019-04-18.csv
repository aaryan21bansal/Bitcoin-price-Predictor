Pro climbers believed killed in avalanche,"Banff National Park stands in the Canadian Rockies Three professional climbers are presumed dead after an avalanche in the Canadian Rockies, authorities say. The three mountaineers were attempting to scale Howse Peak and failed to check in on schedule. National park staff flew over the area where they were climbing and saw evidence of ""avalanches and debris containing climbing equipment"". Recovery efforts are on hold because of dangerous conditions and additional avalanches at the scene. Those efforts are likely to be further hampered by bad weather in the coming days. Outdoor clothing company The North Face has identified the men as David Lama and Hansjoerg Auer from Austria, and Jess Roskelley, from the US. The three were sponsored by the firm which said in a statement it was doing everything it could to support their families, friends and the climbing community. The climbers went missing when they were attempting to scale the east side of Howse Peak, which Parks Canada described as a ""remote and an exceptionally difficult objective, with mixed rock and ice routes requiring advanced alpine mountaineering skills"". The route taken by the climbers was rarely traversed, safety specialist Steve Holeczi said during a press conference. Mr Holeczi, who was among those who flew over the avalanche site, estimated the avalanche to be strong enough to destroy a small building. Howse Peak, with a 3,295 metre (10,800 foot) elevation, is in the Canadian province of Alberta, in Banff National Park. Mr Roskelley, 36, from Spokane, Washington state, scaled Mount Everest at age 20. The son of a famous mountaineer, he was the youngest American to reach the summit of the world's highest peak in 2003. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Mr Lama, 28, is also from a climbing family - his father was a mountain guide from Nepal - and his talent was recognised at an early age. He won numerous climbing competitions as a teenager. In 2014, a film was released that documented his attempt to become the first person to free-climb the Compressor Route on Patagonia's Cerro Torre mountain. Austrian David Lama photographed at a climbing competition in 2006 Mr Auer, 35, grew up on a family farm in Austria near the Dolomite mountain range. Among his most recognised climbing achievements are the southwest-face ascent of Pakistan's Kunyang Chhish East in the Karakorum Mountains and the first ascent of the south face on Nilgiri South in Nepal.

Shots fired during Derry trouble,"This video can not be played Lyra McKee was one of Northern Ireland's most promising journalists, says the NUJ One of Northern Ireland's ""most promising"" journalists has been shot dead during rioting that police are treating as a terrorist incident. Dissident republicans are being blamed for killing 29-year-old Lyra McKee after violence broke out during police searches in Londonderry on Thursday. Police said a group known as the New IRA ""are likely to be the ones"" responsible for her murder. Ms McKee's partner said she had been left without ""the love of my life"". Sara Canning, speaking at a vigil in Derry, saidthe journalist's dreams had been ""snuffed out by a single barbaric act"". Profile: Lyra McKee - 'Her commitment to truth was absolute' Murdered journalist's 'dreams snuffed out' Gunman who shot journalist should see heartbreak, says priest Reaction: Journalist's killing condemned by politicians This video can not be played It is understood police were attacked after carrying out searches in Londonderry. Footage courtesy of Leona O'Neill Prime Minister Theresa May said the killing was ""shocking and senseless"". Ms McKee was a journalist who ""died doing her job with great courage"", added Mrs May. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that a gunman fired shots towards police officers in Derry's Creggan area at about 23:00 BST on Thursday. Mobile phone footage taken by a bystander during the rioting appears to show a masked gunman crouching down on the street and opening fire with a handgun. Ms McKee, who was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle, was wounded. This video can not be played Lyra McKee's murder was a horrendous act, says PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton ""She was taken away from the scene in a police Land Rover to Altnagelvin Hospital but unfortunately she has died,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton. The leaders of Northern Ireland's six biggest political parties said they were ""united in rejecting those responsible for this heinous crime"". In a joint statement, they said: ""Lyra's murder was also an attack on all the people of this community, an attack on the peace and democratic processes. ""It was a pointless and futile act to destroy the progress made over the last 20 years, which has the overwhelming support of people everywhere."" Detectives have started a murder inquiry and the PSNI's Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said ""evil people"" had been behind the killing. Police were searching for weapons and ammunition in Derry when the violence started Ms McKee's death has caused a ""wave of shock and sympathy"" and was ""met with global condemnation, horror and revulsion"", he added. ""The gunman and those who share his warped ideology should hang their heads in shame today - they represent no-one."" Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said Ms McKee ""changed lives"" as a journalist and an activist and would continue to do so. Irish people stood in ""solidarity with the people of Derry"" after the murder,"" he said. ""We stand with you as strong as your walls and for as long as they stand,"" he added. ""This was an attack not just on one citizen - it was an attack on all of us, our nation and our freedoms."" This video can not be played Derry does not want dissident republican violence, says PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin Ms McKee was a journalist of ""courage, style and integrity"" and a ""woman of great commitment and passion"", according to the NUJ's SÃ©amus Dooley. ""I have no doubt that it was that commitment which led to her presence on the streets of the Creggan last night, observing a riot situation in the city,"" he added. Filmmaker Alison Millar, who was due to have dinner with Ms McKee on Friday night, said her friend had been ""stolen from us"". ""Lyra was the most beautiful human being,"" she said. ""She was compassionate, she was honest, she was funny... she had so many friends and was loved by so many people."" Dissident republican activity has been increasing of late, with police in Northern Ireland fearful of a spate of violent incidents marking the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. An intelligence-led operation took them into Londonderry's Creggan estate late on Thursday night in a hunt for weapons and ammunition. They were concerned they could be used in the days ahead to attack officers. The group blamed for killing Lyra McKee is known as the New IRA and was behind a bomb attack outside the city's courthouse at the start of the year. Read more:Dissidents had shown violent intentions The violence on Thursday night broke out after police raids on houses in the Mulroy Park and Galliagh areas in Derry. ""Violent dissident republicans are planning attacks in this city and we were carrying out a search operation in Creggan,"" said the PSNI's Mr Hamilton. Rioting began at Fanad Drive - more than 50 petrol bombs were thrown at police and two vehicles were hijacked and set on fire. ""I believe that this was orchestrated - orchestrated to a point that they just want to have violence and attack police,"" said Mr Hamilton. ""Bringing a firearm out is a calculated and callous act."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sore knee? Maybe you have a fabella,"The arrow on the scan shows where the fabella is - behind the knee A little bone in the knee scientists thought was being lost to evolution seems to be making a comeback, say experts from Imperial College London. The fabella is found in some people buried in the tendon just behind their knee. Doctors think it is entirely pointless, and you can happily live without it - many people do. However, people who have arthritis appear more likely to be in possession of a fabella. The Imperial College teamhas published its findings in the Journal of Anatomy.,external In medical terms, the fabella - which means little bean - is a sesamoid bone, meaning it grows in the tendon of a muscle, just like the kneecap or patella. Dr Michael Berthaume and colleagues at Imperial's department of bioengineering have looked back at medical literature on knees over 150 years in 27 countries, including the UK. Most hip and knee replacements 'last longer than thought' The Leicestershire man with a 'brain' in his knee Between 1918 and 2018, reports of the fabella bone's existence in the knee increased to the extent that it is now thought to be three times as common as 100 years ago. The scientists' analysis showed that in 1918, fabellae were present in 11% of the world population, and by 2018, they were present in 39%. The researchers made their estimations using medical scans and medical journals' findings from a growing world population. The fabella is found in the tissues behind the kneecap Dr Berthaume said that no-one really knows the answer to that, because it has never been researched. ""The fabella may behave like other sesamoid bones to help reduce friction within tendons, redirecting muscle forces, or, as in the case of the kneecap, increasing the mechanical force of that muscle,"" he said. ""Or it could be doing nothing at all."" In old world monkeys, the fabella can act as a kneecap, increasing the mechanical advantage of the muscle. But when the ancestors of great apes and humans evolved, it seemed to disappear. Now that it has returned, it is just causing us problems, according to experts. People with osteoarthritis of the knee are twice as likely to have the little bone, but there is no evidence it is actually causing the problem, or how. The fabella can also get in the way of knee replacement surgery and cause pain and discomfort on its own. The theory is that it is all to do with nutrition. The researchers came to the conclusion that better nutrition is making the average human taller and heavier, and this means we have longer shinbones and larger calf muscles. These changes put the knee under more pressure. Because sesamoid bones, like the fabella, are known to grow in response to the movements they make and the forces exerted on them, this could explain why the bone is more common than it used to be. Finding out about this little bone's resurgence could help doctors treat patients with knee issues. It could also give them an insight into human evolution over the past century. But first they want to find out the age, gender and location of people most likely to have a fabella, and if it occurs in one or both knees.

Temporary cathedral plan for Notre-Dame,"Notre-Dame was already undergoing renovation work when the fire broke out A temporary wooden cathedral should be built in the shadow of Notre-Dame's famed towers while the building is being repaired, officials have said. The structure would serve as a home for worshippers and tourists alike, the rector of the Paris landmark, Monsignor Patrick Chauvet, suggested. The 850-year-old Gothic cathedral has been closed after a fire tore through its roof and destroyed its spire. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed it will reopen in five years. But temporary arrangements will need to be made in the meantime, Monsignor Chauvet told France's CNews. ""We mustn't say 'the cathedral is closed for five years and that's it',"" he said. ""Can I not build an ephemeral cathedral on the esplanade [in front of Notre-Dame]?"" he added. How new tech might help rebuild cathedral Could Assassin's Creed help rebuild cathedral? Family in viral photo found after search Notre-Dame booksellers urge donations The wooden structure, Monsignor Chauvet said, should be ""beautiful, symbolic and attractive"". Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo is understood to have given her approval to the idea, which is not the first of its kind. After the cathedral in New Zealand's Christchurch was destroyed in a 2011 earthquake, which left 185 people dead,a temporary structure was built. Meanwhile, some in France have reacted negatively to the government's plan to invitearchitects from around the world to submit their designs for a new spire. The spire, which was added to the cathedral during a 19th Century restoration project led by French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, was completely destroyed when the fire took hold on Monday. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told reporters on Wednesday he hoped for ""a new spire that is adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era"". The story of the fire in graphics Why blaze was difficult to tackle How will cathedral be restored? But Mr Philippe questioned ""whether we should even recreate the spire as it was conceived by Viollet-le-Duc... or if, as is often the case in the evolution of heritage, we should endow Notre-Dame with a new spire"". Jean-Marie Henriquet, 76, a descendant of Mr Viollet-le-Duc, said it needed to be rebuilt. ""Not reconstructing the spire would equate to amputating an element that belongs to it,"" he told news agency AFP. The blaze, which began on Monday evening and was not fully extinguished until almost 15 hours later, destroyed most of the cathedral's roof and led to the collapse of its famous spire. Firefighters have used a drone to survey the scale of the destruction. The cathedral's spire before and during the fire, then after it had collapsed Photos appear to show that at least one of the famed rose windows survived, but there are concerns for some of the other stained-glass windows. The 18th Century organ has not been burned but it is not clear if it is damaged. It was still too early to estimate the cost of the damage, said the Fondation du Patrimoine, an independent non-profit heritage group. The treasures of Notre-Dame The grief that comes from lost buildings Images show damage to cathedral's interior The main structure, including the two bell towers, was saved in a time window of 15 to 30 minutes by a team of 400 firefighters, Deputy Interior Minister Laurent NuÃ±ez said. But on Thursday, Culture Minister Franck Riester revealed there were still fears over the possible collapse of some parts of the building - including a gable between the bell towers, as well as one in the north transept. Investigators trying to establish the cause of the fire have begun questioning workers from five companies involved in the renovations that were under way at the cathedral. Officials believe the works could have accidentally led to the disaster. Offers of help to rebuild the cathedral have come from several world leaders, groups and individuals, including: Billionaire FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of the Kering group that owns the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion brands, who pledged â¬100m Bernard Arnault's family and their company LVMH, a business empire which includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora, who pledged â¬200m French cosmetics giant L'Oreal and its founding Bettencourt family promised to give â¬200m while oil giant Total pledged â¬100m Mr Riester said some of the artworks and religious items rescued would be sent to the Louvre museum where they would be kept and eventually restored. This video can not be played A look inside fire-ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral They include what is said to be the crown of thorns worn by Jesus before his crucifixion and a tunic King Louis IX is said to have worn when he brought the crown to Paris.

Libya's PM condemns 'silence' of allies,"Libya's prime minister (L) has vowed to defend Tripoli from Khalifa Haftar's forces The UN-backed PM of Libya has condemned the ""silence"" of his international allies as opposing forces advance on the capital Tripoli. Fayez al-Serraj is facing down an insurgency led by eastern commander Gen Khalifa Haftar. More than 205 people have been killed since fighting began on 4 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. As violence continues, Mr Serraj told the BBC his people were starting to feel abandoned by the world. Why is Libya so lawless? Who is military strongman Khalifa Haftar? He said failure to support his internationally recognised government could ""lead to other consequences"", citing the risk of the Islamic State group capitalising on the instability. ""The public is frustrated by the silence of the international community,"" he told the BBC's  Orla Guerin. Forces loyal to Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli He bemoaned what he sees as the inaction of the UN Security Council, which is yet to reach a consensus on how to deal with the escalating crisis. ""The Russians won't accept mentioning Haftar's name even though everyone knows he is the one behind this,"" he said. Libya has been torn by violence and political instability since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. The latest crisis started three weeks ago, when Gen Haftar's eastern forces descended on the capital in what Mr Serraj has described as an attempted coup. Gen Haftar's troops are advancing from various directions on the outskirts of the city and say they have seized Tripoli's international airport. Mr Serraj suggested ""division within the international community"" could lead to a repeat of 2011, when he says Libya was abandoned. On Thursday, his administration accused France of supporting Gen Haftar, saying it would sever any ""bilateral security agreements"" with Paris as a result. But France has denied allegations of ""relentless backing"" for the general, whose Libyan National Army (LNA) say they are aiming to restore security in the country. Gen Haftar has ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli Mr Serraj says Gen Haftar must be held to account for the ""savagery and barbarism"" of his forces and has issued a warrant for his arrest. He warned that the Islamic State group - which was driven from its Libyan stronghold in 2016 - could try to exploit the chaos caused by Gen Haftar's forces. ""Definitely there is fear that IS could come back, and take advantage of this void,"" he said. Libya PM 'to defend capital' as rebels near Why is Libya so lawless?

'Struggling' Love Island star took own life,"Sophie Gradon was crowned Miss Newcastle and Miss Great Britain in 2009 A former beauty queen and Love Island star took cocaine and alcohol and then killed herself, an inquest has found. Star of the ITV2 dating show Sophie Gradon hanged herself at her family home in Medburn, Ponteland on 20 June. The 32-year-old was found by her boyfriend Aaron Armstrong, 25, whotook his own life 20 days later. Northumberland South coroner Eric Armstrong said he was ""certain she would not have acted as she did without taking alcohol and cocaine"". Mr Armstrong told North Shields Coroner's Court research in the USA suggested someone was 16 times more likely to take their life if they consumed both. ""The combination is used by those who believe it brings on a so-called high much quicker,"" he said. ""What they do not appreciate is it also gives rise to violent thoughts. ""If Sophie's death is to serve any purpose at all, that message must go out far and wide."" Love Island 'must open its eyes' Love Island aftercare 'can't last forever' Aftercare is 'industry-wide failing' Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton said Ms Gradon was two-and-a-half times the drink-drive limit and under the influence of cocaine. Det Sgt Neill Jobling of Northumbria Police told the hearing Ms Gradon had been exchanging messages with a male friend into the early hours of the day she died. In them she said she had had suicidal thoughts, that she was ""struggling with the world"" and every day with ADHD, and she ""cannot do this any more"". In another message sent at 01:44 BST she said: ""I would never want to do that to my family but if I could escape I would."" She had alcohol and cocaine in her system which increased the likelihood of violent thoughts and actions, Det Sgt Jobling said. Aaron Armstrong died 20 days after his girlfriend Sophie Gradon Ms Gradon, who had more than 400,000 followers on Instagram, was crowned Miss Newcastle and Miss Great Britain in 2009 and appeared on Love Island in 2016. She had been diagnosed with depression and low self-esteem in 2013 and was taking medication for social anxiety disorder at the time of her death, Det Sgt Jobling said. The inquest heard she was found hanging in the living room of her parents' home by Mr Armstrong and his brother. Mr Armstrong attempted CPR for 15 minutes but quickly realised she was dead. He had become concerned after not receiving any messages from his girlfriend during the day. The pair had been exchanging messages until after 02:00 but when he woke up after 11:00 he got no reply from messages or phone calls. Mr Armstrong had been in a relationship with the former beauty queen since May 2018 after meeting her on a night out in Newcastle. He killed himself days after her death, a coroner at his inquest found. The coroner said Mr Armstrong's thinking could have been ""muddled"" by her death.

'Dangerous rapist' caught on video call,"Samuel Fortes has been described as a ""highly dangerous sex offender"" A man who raped a woman while she was on a video call to her boyfriend was caught with the help of a screenshot he took of the attack. Samuel Fortes followed the woman through Leeds city centre before raping and repeatedly punching her last June. The 20-year-old was on a FaceTime call at the time and the screenshot formed a ""key piece of evidence"", West Yorkshire Police said. Fortes was jailed for life and must serve a minimum term of eight years. The woman, who was 19 at the time, was left with extensive facial and dental injuries, as well as cuts and bruises. Fortes, 27, of Ironside Road, Sheffield, followed her to an isolated area before attacking her under a flyover footbridge adjacent to Grace Street in the 15-minute ordeal at 03:15 BST on 23 June, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Fortes followed the woman through Leeds city centre to an isolated street In a victim impact statement read to the court, she said ""I thought I was going to die"". ""It is a feeling that no words could ever describe. ""I have experienced what I hope to be the lowest point, mentally, in my life. ""There were days, at the beginning of my recovery period, where I could not leave my bed and that is simply because I did not see a point in doing so."" More stories across Yorkshire Det Supt Jaz Khan said the screenshot from her boyfriend's FaceTime app was ""a key piece of evidence"", along with DNA and CCTV footage, which helped catch the ""highly dangerous sex offender"". ""Fortes subjected this brave woman to a horrific ordeal and I want to praise her for her bravery in helping to bring her brutal attacker to justice,"" he said. Fortes admitted rape and and grievous bodily harm and was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court.  He was also placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely.

Teachers 'fund resources from own money',"One in five teachers is using their own money to buy classroom resources once a week, a survey by the NASUWT suggests. And 45% of the 4,386 members of the teachers' union surveyed said they had bought essentials such as food or clothing for pupils in the last year. The survey comes as about 7,000 head teachers in England wrote to parents before the Easter holidays highlighting what they call a ""funding crisis"". Ministers say school finances are a priority for the next spending review. ""We are told there is no money for anything, all departmental budgets have been frozen and all the stockrooms are empty,"" one teacher responded in the study. ""Basic resources are rationed out at the beginning of each term and once they are gone, there is no more unless you purchase them yourself."" Another said: ""I've had to purchase small tables, CD player, outdoor provision and storage."" Schools facing 'financial cliff edge' 'Worsening child poverty harms learning' One teacher said: ""Small amounts do add up during the year, all departments are feeling the pinch and books/texts (English GCSE included) are now shared for reading in lessons and not allowed home as they used to be. ""We cannot afford for items to be lost - so we deprive students of the chance for self-directed study for those who are motivated."" Another commented: ""Last time my lesson was observed, by a senior leader, I was graded low for lack of relevant resources - despite having spent Â£20 on stuff. ""The expectation is we purchase things ourselves as our job is a vocation! I'm fed up of hearing this over and over again. It's never enough and am ready to leave."" The NASUWT survey, which is published ahead of the union's annual conference in Belfast over the Easter weekend, covers both primary and secondary schools and also found that teachers were paying for basic necessities such as food, clothing and toiletries for pupils. One teacher said: ""The worst thing to experience as a teacher is watching a hungry child who is in receipt of free school meals, having to stand and watch their friends eat breakfast before school or have snacks at morning break when they are hungry. ""Typically, I have used my credit on the prepayment system to give children cheese on toast or a hot drink, or any other hot food."" Another said: ""I have paid for and supplied materials to resole or repair shoes. Pupils regularly come without the basics such as a pencil to write with."" Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said that teachers were ""shouldering financial burdens to support their pupils"". ""Teachers care deeply about the pupils they teach and will go to great lengths to ensure their needs are being met,"" she said. ""Teachers once again are being left to pick up the pieces of failed education, social and economic policies."" But children's minister Nadhim Zahawi said there was ""more money going into our schools than ever before"". ""However, we recognise the budgeting challenges schools face and have introduced a wide range of practical support to help schools and head teachers make the most of every pound on non-staff costs."" Tackling disadvantage was a ""priority for this government"", he added, which was why ""we are making sure that more than a million of the most disadvantaged children are also accessing free school meals throughout their education"". In his budget in October last year, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that schools in England would receive a one-off Â£400m - on average, Â£10,000 per primary school and Â£50,000 per secondary school - to buy ""that extra bit of kit"". However, his words provoked an angry responseamong some teachers and parents on social media, who said he was out of touch. There have been repeated concerns from schools about funding shortages, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing in July last year that per pupil spending had fallen in real terms by 8% since 2010. Earlier this year, the Education Policy Institute said that almost a third of local authority secondary schools in England were unable to cover their costs, with the proportion of these schools in the red almost quadrupling in four years. The WorthLess? campaign group, which is made up of head teachers across England, has been campaigning for better funding for schools. The group sends letters to parents and carerssetting out their concerns and has protested at Westminster. Their latest letter, sent at the end of term, was circulated by some 7,000 head teachers.

Pet insurance payouts hit Â£785m record,"Payouts by pet insurers hit a record Â£785m in 2018, even though the number of claims submitted fell, according to the industry trade body. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said this was down to the higher cost of increasingly sophisticated medical care. The size of the average claim jumped by Â£36, or nearly 5%, to Â£793. The ABI said the ""overwhelming majority"" of pet insurance payouts were to meet veterinary treatment bills. Less common claims included pet owners asking to be reimbursed for the theft of a pet, the cost of advertising to find a lost animal, as well as liability for when a pet damaged property or injured someone. However, the ABI says these claims were ""tiny"" compared with veterinary treatment bills. Senior policy adviser for pet insurance, Joe Ahern, said: ""There is no NHS for animals, so if you've not got a pet policy in place, you risk having to foot veterinary bills out of your own pocket. ""These can often be in the thousands of pounds and vet treatment is only getting more expensive, not less."" The rise of the dog-napper Dog with seizures costs Â£30,000 to treat The size of the average claim on pet insurance jumped by Â£36, or 4.75%, to Â£793 between 2017 and 2018. However, the number of claims submitted fell to 990,000, down from 1.02 million the previous year. Total payouts increased by Â£10m to Â£785m - a rise of 1.3%. Nearly 4.3 million pets were covered by insurance last year, more than ever before, and an increase of 50,00 on 2017 But the ABI said there was still a ""worrying level of under-insurance"" among cat owners. There are thought to be 7.5 million cats in UK homes, but only 1.3 million are insured, whereas 2.8 million dogs are insured out of an estimated 8.5 million pet pooches. Average premiums fell slightly for the first time in eight years - down from Â£281 in 2017 to Â£279 in 2018. This is the first time there has been any decrease in pet premiums for eight years. Over the past ten years, the average claim has increased by 75%, whilst the average premium has only increased by 50%, according to the ABI. 11-month-old Bertie has already been in hospital twice Veterinary treatment bills come quickly and in full, as I found out when I took Bertie, our Portuguese Water Dog, to the vet. I was terrified - he was obviously in pain, whining, tired and lethargic. The vet recommended he stay in for the day, have some X-rays, an intravenous drip and painkillers. She got out her calculator, did a few sums and asked: ""Is Â£1,600 okay?"" I thought for a second she had said Â£160, which I thought was a bit steep. When reality dawned, I nearly needed to be revived myself. Luckily, we have pet insurance, which pays 90% of our vet bills. But Bertie has had at least three treatments for meningitis, including stays in hospital and is still on medication. Even just 10% of the cost of all that is eye-watering, but he is still worth every penny.

Actor's family at home during gun murder,"Former boxer Bradley Welsh was shot outside his basement apartment The family of a Trainspotting actor who was murdered outside his home were inside the building when he was shot. Bradley Welsh, 48, was killed at his basement apartment in Chester Street, Edinburgh, on Wednesday. Police said his partner and young child were fortunate not to be caught up in the shooting. Detectives believe the murder was a targeted attack on Mr Welsh, who also featured in an episode of Danny Dyer's Deadliest Men. Det Supt Allan Burton said Mr Welsh was returning from the Holyrood Boxing gym he ran in the city when he was shot. Trainspotting actor dies after shooting Profile: Bradley Welsh in his own words He said: ""We know from witnesses who were nearby, and from house-to-house inquiries, that he had exited his motor vehicle and walked towards his home address. ""It's a basement apartment and he was making his way down the stairs and someone has attended at the top of the stairs and shot him. ""His partner and young child were in the house at the time this happened. So if they had been exiting the house, they could have been caught up in that and subjected to seeing their father and their partner die on the front steps."" Forensics officers have been searching for evidence at the scene Det Supt Burton added: ""Any member of the community could have been walking by and been targeted by this individual. ""It's a real threat that someone is running about with a gun on the streets of Edinburgh."" One resident said he was told someone had been shot in the head and people were instructed to stay indoors as the street was cordoned off. Armed officers were sent to the scene after receiving ""multiple reports"" of a firearm discharge. Mr Welsh starred alongside Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle in T2 Trainspotting, playing the gangland figure Mr Doyle. Trainspotting Author Irvine Welsh paid tribute to ""his beautiful friend"" on social media. In Danny Dyer's Deadliest Men on Bravo in 2008, Bradley Welsh described himself as a ""born leader"". He discussed his past as a Hibs Casual football hooligan in the 1980s. Mr Welsh talked about how he ""mobbed and robbed"" and was involved with organised ""smash and grabs"" at stores, including Jenners in Edinburgh. He later spent four years in prison for extorting money from estate agents. Mr Welsh worked with young people at his boxing gym In recent years, the boxer became involved in charity projects in Edinburgh, including helping young people to stay away from a life of crime through his boxing gym. Detectives said they had no reason to believe Mr Welsh's shooting was a random attack and insisted the streets of Edinburgh remained safe for local residents and workers. Det Supt Burton said: ""It's unusual for there to be a shooting in Edinburgh. ""I believe this has been a single incident at this location - a targeted attack on Mr Welsh - and what we need to find out is who set it up and why."" Ch Insp David Robertson, local area commander for Edinburgh city centre, added: ""We recognise and understand the profound impact this incident will have had, both on those connected to the victim and to the local community of the west end. ""There will naturally be a high officer presence in the area over the forthcoming days both to offer reassurance and gather any relevant information that may be of use to the inquiry.""

Police 'stretched' by climate protests,"About half a dozen activists were arrested in a space of 20 minutes at Oxford Circus Police are being diverted from ""core local duties"" that keep London safe by the Extinction Rebellion protesters, Scotland Yard has said. More than 500 people have been arrested since Monday, including three charged with gluing themselves to a train. Police rest days have been cancelled over the bank holiday, as more than 1,000 officers are deployed in London. Sajid Javid said the climate activists had ""no right to cause misery"" and the Met Police ""must take a firm stance"". Officers have also been asked to work 12-hour shifts, while the Violent Crime Task Force has had leave cancelled. ""This will have implications in the weeks and months beyond this protest as officers take back leave and the cost of overtime,"" a Met Police spokesman said. Traffic has been blocked at four sites since Monday British Transport Police said it ""continues to deploy additional officers throughout the London rail network to deter and disrupt further protest activity"". Heathrow Airport said it was ""working with the authorities"" following threats protesters may try to disrupt flights over the Easter weekend. The Met said ""strong plans"" were in place to enable a significant number of officers to be deployed to Heathrow if necessary. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? What is climate change? Police have made further arrests, but activists continue to block traffic at four sites around the capital. Marble Arch, Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge have been occupied by protesters since Monday. Transport for London warned delays around those areas were expected ""throughout the day"". Met Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave has said police may need new powers to deal with non-violent protests on this scale, due to the large number of arrestees for police and courts to deal with. Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters at Marble Arch Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters, saying it was the ""first real hopeful movement I've joined"". Speaking from the blockade at Marble Arch, Ms Thompson said: ""Our Planet is in deep danger, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren are going to face problems the likes of which we cannot even begin to imagine. ""Unfortunately our governments haven't listened to us, so now we have to make them listen."" Activists remain glued to a boat in the middle of Oxford Circus On Wednesday, a man glued himself to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train carriage in Canary Wharf while a man and woman were removed from the roof. Cathy Eastburn, 51, from Lambeth in south London, Mark Ovland, 35 of Somerton in Somerset and Luke Watson, 29, of Manuden in Essex, appeared before Highbury Magistrates' Court charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway. They all pleaded not guilty to the charge and will next appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on 16 May. The Met said a total of 10 people had so far been charged in connection with the protests.

Some protesters have been seen returning to the blockades despite being arrested. Police action to deter activists was having the ""opposite"" effect, according to environmental scientist Dominic Goetz who has returned to Waterloo Bridge following his arrest on Tuesday. ""I don't know whether I will be arrested again or not. If I am, I think the consequences will probably not be particularly severe,"" the 47-year-old said. More than 425 people have been arrested since Monday Met chiefs have also condemned footage of officers dancing with protesters. Thevideos posted on social media,,externalwhich showed police officers joining activists at Oxford Circus on Wednesday evening, have been condemned as ""unacceptable behaviour"". ""We expect our officers to engage with protesters but clearly their actions fall short of the tone of the policing operation,"" Cdr Jane Connors said. Demonstrators have been holding intermittent blockages on Vauxhall Bridge In a letter to the home secretary, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan suggested cuts to police funding were restricting the Met's ability to cope with the demonstrators. A group of demonstrators has been blocking Vauxhall Bridge for short periods of time as part of a ""swarming"" protest. Similar intermittent roadblocks have also been formed by activists at Piccadilly Circus. This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

Man jailed over email threats to MPs,"Jarod Kirkman sent malicious communications to MPs including Yvette Cooper and Nicky Morgan A man who sent ""threatening"" emails to seven MPs, including two ex-cabinet members, has been jailed for 42 weeks. Jarod Kirkman, 51, used a fake email address to target a cross-party selection, including Nicky Morgan, Yvette Cooper and Heidi Allen. Kirkman, of Torquay Drive, Luton, had admitted sending malicious communications at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 8 April. Ms Morgan said the messages were death threats ""related to Brexit"". South Cambridgeshire MP Heidi Allen was also targeted Prosecutors said malicious emails were sent to Labour MPs Ms Cooper and Jenny Chapman, Conservative Ms Morgan, former Tory Nick Boles, as well as Sarah Wollaston, and Heidi Allen interim leader of the Independent Group. Kirkman also pleaded guilty to a charge of racially or religiously aggravated intentional harassment against Labour MP David Lammy. The messages were sent between 4 December and 21 January, police said. The court heard his first email was sent to Ms Allen, MP for South Cambridgeshire on the 4 December 2018. Using the address mp@deadpoliticianwalking.com, Kirkman contacted Mrs Allen via her constituency ""contact form"". In it he wrote, ""your days are numbered"" before musing about whether she would die from polonium or Novichok poisoning. Following subsequent emails sent to six other MPs, he was arrested on 29 January of this year. Former Conservative MP Nick Boles was another victim of Kirkman Kirkman told police he was ""just being a stupid idiot over Brexit"" and had ""no intention of carrying out the threats"". The court heard he described himself  as a ""passionate pro-leaver"" Following sentencing, Ms Allen said: ""MPs are doing a job like everybody else and we deserve to feel safe in our work.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Arkansas People in Arkansas say they are happy the report has been released to
the public - for different reasons. Some Arkansans say that the report will
give the public a chance to see what government officials have been up to and
will help to expose how some of these officials have worked against the
president and tried to damage his reputation. Walter Smith, who is now retired
and lives near Russellville, Arkansas, he says the report will help to shed
light on those in âthe deep stateâ, as he put it. He defines Deep Staters as
âTrump hatersâ such as the former FBI director, James Comey, and âall those
around himâ, says Smith. Smith says he hopes that the Mueller report will help
to ensure that Comey and his associates will âget in trouble and get indictedâ
and be held accountable for the ways they were âworking against the
presidencyâ. Walter Smith Others are also pleased with the fact that the report has been released because it gives them access to more information. âThe more transparency, the better,â says David Cullen, a history professor at Arkansas Tech University in Russellville. Still, Mr Cullen, who is a political independent, says that he was disappointed with the conclusions of Robert Muellerâs report and says he wished Mr Mueller had been able to collect more evidence against the president. Mr Cullenâs own view of the president is clear: âI think he broke the law."" Mr Mueller fell short, Mr Cullen says, in his pursuit of the truth. âHe didnât have hard evidence so he cannot go to court. But he still thought it was in the legal purview of Congress to continue the investigation.â Mr Cullen says he is eager to see what members of Congress will do in their efforts to find out what the president has done. Fayetteville resident Doug Thompson, a Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette political writer, says that the report shows the president may be guilty of crimes. âIt means that all those claims heâs been exonerated are made in bad faith. It clearly does not say that,â says Mr Thompson. âThe money quoteâ, Mr Thompson says, is the line where Mr Mueller says that they would have cleared the president if they could have. According to an analysis by ProPublica, only about 6% of the total report has been blacked out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation paints a decidedly mixed picture of President Donald Trump's conduct, both suspicious and exculpatory, that both sides of the political divide will seize upon. Mr Trump already has the result he insisted on from the outset: no collusion. While it is unclear if the document contains any ""smoking gun"" that might make impeachment proceedings against the president any more likely, there are enough potential red flags in there to keep congressional hearings ticking over for the remainder of his term in office.

Former FBI director James Comey The special counsel's report says that White House adviser Stephen Miller - who has reportedly been encouraging the president's increasingly hard-line stance on immigration recently - was behind Comey's firing letter. Trump apparently told his advisors at a dinner on 5 May that he wanted to fire Comey. According to notes Miller took at the time, Trump said the letter should start: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a Trump-Russia relationship pertaining to the 2016 presidential election, please be informed that I, and I believe the American public - including [Democrats] and [Republicans] - have lost faith in you as Director of the FBI."" Miller wrote the letter after dinner based on Trump's guidance, according to the report. White House adviser Stephen Miller ""You can be the President's defence attorney or America's attorney general, but you can't be both,"" Rep Eric Swalwell - a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful - said in a statement.

Mueller's report divides Trump's actions into ""two distinct phases reflecting a possible shift in the President's motives"". Before firing Comey, Trump had ""been assured"" that the FBI was not investigating him. He ""deemed it critically important to make public that he was not under investigation"" After firing Comey, Trump was aware of the obstruction of justice inquiry into his conduct and he ""launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President"". In private, he ""engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation"" - such as trying to remove the special counsel, pressuring Jeff Sessions to control the inquiry, preventing the leak of information about the Trump Tower meeting and using ""public forums to attack potential witnesses"". ""Judgments about the nature of the President's motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the evidence,"" the report states. Allow Twitter content?

Oil giant exits UK North Sea with ÃÂ£2bn deal,"ConocoPhillips is pulling out of UK exploration and production after selling its North Sea oil and gas assets to Chrysaor for $2.68bn (Â£2bn). The sale will boost Chrysaor's production by about 72,000 barrels a day to 177,000 - making it one of the UK's biggest operators. The deal, expected to complete in late 2019, requires regulatory approval. ConocoPhillips said it would retain its Londonâbased commercial trading business. It will also keep its 40.25% interest in the Teesside oil terminal. The assets being purchased by Chrysaor include two new operated hubs in the UK Central North Sea â Britannia and JâBlock - and an interest in the Clair Field area located west of Shetland. In the UK Southern North Sea, Chrysaor will assume responsibility for an ongoing decommissioning programme on ConocoPhillips UK's endâofâlife assets. As of January 2018, ConocoPhillips UK assets contained more than 280 million barrels of proved and probable oil and gas reserves. The package of assets being acquired by Chrysaor are outlined in the table below: Chrysaor said it would fund the acquisition from existing cash resources and a debt facility underwritten by Bank of Montreal, BNP Paribas, DNB Bank, and ING Bank. Chrysaor chief executive Phil Kirk said: ""This significant acquisition reflects our continuing belief that the UK North Sea has material future potential for oil and gas production. ""Acquiring ConocoPhillips UK accelerates our strategy and further strengthens our position as one of the leading independent exploration and production companies in Europe. ""These assets complement our existing operations and, with operating costs at less than $15 per barrel across the enlarged group, our portfolio delivers high margins and significant positive cash flow."" The latest deal comes after private equity-backed Chrysaor bought up a package of North Sea assets from Shell in 2017 for up to $3.8bn.

""Carson was bright and caring, kind and loving. He was a cheeky little boy. He was the best big brother to Coby and was loved by so many. ""We have been truly overwhelmed by the support we have received locally, nationally and from around the world. ""Thinking of another family going through what we have is unbearable.

Alagiah's 'guilt' over disabled toilet use,"George Alagiah has spoken of his guilt at having to use disabled toilets while having no visible disability. The BBC newsreader, who has stage four bowel cancer, used the facilities in the past because of having a stoma bag attached to his stomach. When disabled people saw him using the toilets he would feel the need to ""apologise and explain"", he said. Talking about living with the bag for the first time, Alagiah said it also required him to get his suits altered. A stoma bag is an opening in the stomach where faeces are collected in a bag after part or all of the bowel is removed due to a disease or obstruction. Alagiah, 63, returned to presenting duties in January this year after his bowel cancer returned in December 2017. He no longer has a stoma bag after undergoing reversal treatment. Alagiah 'overwhelmed' by viewers' support George Alagiah's cancer returns Alagiah: Screening might have caught cancer Why these new signs are appearing on disabled toilets - BBC Newsbeat Speaking about living with a stoma on In Conversation With George Alagiah: A Bowel Cancer UK Podcast, he said: ""I used to find it difficult. I had a stoma but I didn't look disabled, and I would be turning the key in a disabled loo in a motorway service station or something. ""And if there was a queue and somebody obviously disabled (was there), I used to feel guilty and feel like I needed to apologise and explain. ""The reason you need to go into a disabled loo is that you just need a little bit of space, to get the contents of your blue bag out and the sanitising equipment and so on."" The charity Crohn's & Colitis UKhas launched a campaign,externalcalling for companies to install new signs on disabled toilets to explain that not all disabilities are visible. It says people with such ""invisible disabilities"" are subjected to discrimination for using facilities they urgently need. In 2017, Tottenham Hotspurbecame the first football club to feature such a slogan on their disabled toilets. Making the most of life with a stoma House-share struggles with a stoma What it's really like to get a colostomy bag in your 20s - BBC Three Alagiah also spoke of adjusting his clothes and changing his outfits to fit the bag, which included taking his suits out and wearing braces. Speaking about his concerns over returning to work with the bag, he said: ""I [was] always looking around at my colleagues and thinking, 'Can they smell anything, can they hear anything?""' Dr Lisa Wilde, from Bowel Cancer UK, said stomas remained a ""hidden part of living with the disease"". She said: ""We know that many of our supporters face everyday challenges to manage their stoma, and one of these is accessing disabled toilets, as it's not a visible disability. ""We're determined to improve the quality of life of everyone affected by bowel cancer and to help people live well with a stoma."" Alagiah hosts the first series of Bowel Cancer UK's podcasts, interviewing supporters and leading experts on the disease, as well as discussing his own treatment and diagnosis. Bowel cancer is the UK's fourth most common cancer and second biggest killer cancer with more than 16,000 people dying from the disease every year. It is treatable and can be curable, especially if diagnosed early.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Arkansas People in Arkansas say they are happy the report has been released to
the public - for different reasons. Some Arkansans say that the report will
give the public a chance to see what government officials have been up to and
will help to expose how some of these officials have worked against the
president and tried to damage his reputation. Walter Smith, who is now retired
and lives near Russellville, Arkansas, he says the report will help to shed
light on those in âthe deep stateâ, as he put it. He defines Deep Staters as
âTrump hatersâ such as the former FBI director, James Comey, and âall those
around himâ, says Smith. Smith says he hopes that the Mueller report will help
to ensure that Comey and his associates will âget in trouble and get indictedâ
and be held accountable for the ways they were âworking against the
presidencyâ. Walter Smith Others are also pleased with the fact that the report has been released because it gives them access to more information. âThe more transparency, the better,â says David Cullen, a history professor at Arkansas Tech University in Russellville. Still, Mr Cullen, who is a political independent, says that he was disappointed with the conclusions of Robert Muellerâs report and says he wished Mr Mueller had been able to collect more evidence against the president. Mr Cullenâs own view of the president is clear: âI think he broke the law."" Mr Mueller fell short, Mr Cullen says, in his pursuit of the truth. âHe didnât have hard evidence so he cannot go to court. But he still thought it was in the legal purview of Congress to continue the investigation.â Mr Cullen says he is eager to see what members of Congress will do in their efforts to find out what the president has done. Fayetteville resident Doug Thompson, a Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette political writer, says that the report shows the president may be guilty of crimes. âIt means that all those claims heâs been exonerated are made in bad faith. It clearly does not say that,â says Mr Thompson. âThe money quoteâ, Mr Thompson says, is the line where Mr Mueller says that they would have cleared the president if they could have.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation paints a decidedly mixed picture of President Donald Trump's conduct, both suspicious and exculpatory, that both sides of the political divide will seize upon. Mr Trump already has the result he insisted on from the outset: no collusion. While it is unclear if the document contains any ""smoking gun"" that might make impeachment proceedings against the president any more likely, there are enough potential red flags in there to keep congressional hearings ticking over for the remainder of his term in office.

Former FBI director James Comey The special counsel's report says that White House adviser Stephen Miller - who has reportedly been encouraging the president's increasingly hard-line stance on immigration recently - was behind Comey's firing letter. Trump apparently told his advisors at a dinner on 5 May that he wanted to fire Comey. According to notes Miller took at the time, Trump said the letter should start: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a Trump-Russia relationship pertaining to the 2016 presidential election, please be informed that I, and I believe the American public - including [Democrats] and [Republicans] - have lost faith in you as Director of the FBI."" Miller wrote the letter after dinner based on Trump's guidance, according to the report. White House adviser Stephen Miller ""You can be the President's defence attorney or America's attorney general, but you can't be both,"" Rep Eric Swalwell - a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful - said in a statement.

Before firing Comey, Trump had ""been assured"" that the FBI was not investigating him. He ""deemed it critically important to make public that he was not under investigation"" After firing Comey, Trump was aware of the obstruction of justice inquiry into his conduct and he ""launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President"". In private, he ""engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation"" - such as trying to remove the special counsel, pressuring Jeff Sessions to control the inquiry, preventing the leak of information about the Trump Tower meeting and using ""public forums to attack potential witnesses"".

Cat found in sofa ready for incineration,"Six-month-old Tux lived in the sofa for 11 days A lost kitten was found hiding in a sofa as it was about to be incinerated at a waste recycling centre. The cat ""poked his head up out of the cushions"" while heavy machinery was moving the sofa on Wednesday, Slough Borough Council said. Owner Lauren Jones was reunited with her pet after a council appeal. She said the six-month-old kitten, named Tux, was missing for 11 days after the unwanted sofa was collected from her home. Ms Jones said Tux had apparently survived for six days without food or water in a van, before the furniture was taken on Friday to the Chalvey waste and recycling centre. The kitten was rescued by workers at Chalvey waste and recycling centre Waste officer Thomas McGrory said a crew member was using large machinery in one of the transfer sheds when the cat jumped up over the vehicle's shovel. He said: ""It's a miracle it survived as each day tonnes of waste is taken to be incinerated. ""The cat seemed to be in good condition but was obviously frightened, hungry and very thirsty."" Ms Jones said Tux had suffered a broken leg and she was trying to raise funds for an operation through an online appeal. ""It's very upsetting - I've got my little boy back but is he going to be OK?"" she said. ""Everybody says he's a miracle.

Huge 'concreteberg' blocks London sewers,"The ""concreteberg"" is the biggest ever seen by Thames Water A ""concreteberg"", weighing as much as 20 elephants, is blocking three central London sewers. The 330ft-long (100m) mass, weighing 105 tonnes, was caused by people pouring concrete into the sewers. It could take two months and cost Â£150,000 to remove from the Victorian-era sewer under Hall Street, Islington. Thames Water operations manager, Alex Saunders, said the concreteberg was the largest the company had ever seen. Mr Saunders added: ""Normally blockages are caused by fat, oil and wet wipes building up in the sewer, but unfortunately in this case it's rock-hard concrete. ""It's in there and set to the Victorian brickwork, so we need to chip away at it to get it removed. ""This is not the first time damage has been caused by people pouring concrete into our sewers but it's certainly the worst we've seen."" A 250m-long fatberg weighing 130 tonnes was found under Whitechapel in 2017 Workers will have to manually chip away at the mass using tools including jackhammer pneumatic drills and high-pressure jets. Tankers will also be needed to pump out waste 24 hours a day to protect the environment and prevent sewage backed up by the blockage flooding into nearby properties. An investigation into how the concrete got into the sewer and to recover costs is under way. Fatbergs made of congealed fat, wet wipes, nappies, oil and condoms have been found across London over the last few years. What causes fatbergs? Last year Thames Water was called to clear 42,000 blockages caused by fat and non-biodegradable matter, a 6% increase on 2017. In 2013,a bus-size fatberg was foundin a sewer in Kingston-upon-Thames, and a250m-long fatberg weighing 130 tonneswas found in Whitechapel in 2017.

Local resident Alasdair Morton said armed police sealed off the area from Walker Street to Manor Place as someone had suffered a ""gunshot wound to the head"". Mr Morton, 46, said: ""I came out the house and we were told to go back in. Around three police cars and a black van drove along the street and the traffic then stopped. ""I initially thought it was a police escort then when I had a look there must have been a dozen or so police with guns pushing the traffic back. ""We've not been told anything but police waved through some ambulances. ""They said 'there's a gunshot wound to the head somewhere'. We could still hear noises that suggested there was a situation still going on."" A woman, who did not want to be named, was in her flat across the road from the incident when she heard a ""massive bang"". She added: ""I was in the kitchen and heard a bang. I ran through to my boyfriend and said 'what was that?', because it sounded a little bit weird. ""Then there were loads of SWAT teams - the police were here super-quick.""

""Part of this investigation will focus on obtaining CCTV from nearby homes and businesses and we would also urge any motorists who were in the area and may have relevant dashcam footage to share this with us.""

Attenborough fears climate 'catastrophe',"This video can not be played Climate Change - The Facts is available to watch on BBC iPlayer Sir David Attenborough has issued his strongest statement yet on the threat posed to the world by climate change. In the BBC programmeClimate Change - The Facts, the veteran broadcaster outlined the scale of the crisis facing the planet. Sir David said we face ""irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies"". But there is still hope, he said, if dramatic action to limit the effects is taken over the next decade. What is climate change? Talk to our climate change bot Central banks warn of climate dangers Warning from 'Antarctica's last forests' Sir David's new programme laid out the science behind climate change, the impact it is having right now and the steps that can be taken to fight it. ""In the 20 years since I first started talking about the impact of climate change on our world, conditions have changed far faster than I ever imagined,"" Sir David stated in the film. ""It may sound frightening, but the scientific evidence is that if we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies."" Speaking to a range of scientists, the programme highlighted that temperatures are rising quickly, with the world now around 1C warmer than before the industrial revolution. ""There are dips and troughs and there are some years that are not as warm as other years,"" said Dr Peter Stott from the Met Office. ""But what we have seen is the steady and unremitting temperature trend. Twenty of the warmest years on record have all occurred in the last 22 years."" The programme showed dramatic scenes of people escaping from wildfires in the US, as a father and son narrowly escape with their lives when they drive into an inferno. Scientists say that the dry conditions that make wildfires so deadly are increasing as the planet heats up. Greenland is losing ice five times as fast as it was 25 years ago Some of the other impacts highlighted by scientists are irreversible. ""In the last year we've had a global assessment of ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland and they tell us that things are worse than we'd expected,"" said Prof Andrew Shepherd from the University of Leeds. ""The Greenland ice sheet is melting, it's lost four trillion tonnes of ice and it's losing five times as much ice today as it was 25 years ago."" These losses are driving up sea levels around the world. The programme highlights the threat posed by rising waters to people living on the Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana, forcing them from their homes. ""In the US, Louisiana is on the front line of this climate crisis. It's losing land at one of the fastest rates on the planet - at the rate of of a football field every 45 minutes,"" said Colette Pichon Battle, a director of the Gulf Coast Center for Law & Policy. People are moving from parts of Louisiana in the US as a result of rising waters ""The impact on families is going to be something I don't think we could ever prepare for."" Sir David's concern over the impacts of climate change has become a major focus for the naturalist in recent years. This has also been a theme of his Our Planet series on Netflix. His new BBC programme has a strong emphasis on hope. Sir David argues that if dramatic action is taken over the next decade then the world can keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5C this century. This would limit the scale of the damage. ""We are running out of time, but there is still hope,"" said Sir David. ""I believe that if we better understand the threat we face the more likely it is we can avoid such a catastrophic future."" The programme said that rapid progress is being made in renewable energy, with wind now as cheap as fossil fuels in many cases. It showshow technologies to remove and bury carbon dioxideunder the ground are now becoming more viable. But politicians will need to act decisively and rapidly. ""This is the brave political decision that needs to be taken,"" said Chris Stark from the UK's Committee on Climate Change. Teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg has helped spark school strikes all over the world ""Do we incur a small but not insignificant cost now, or do we wait and see the need to adapt. The economics are really clear on this, the costs of action are dwarfed by the costs of inaction."" The programme also highlights the rising generation of young people who are deeply concerned about what's happening to the planet. Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg explained that things can change quickly, despite the scale of the challenge on climate change. ""The first day I sat all alone,"" she said, speaking of her decision to go on strike from school and sit outside the Swedish parliament to highlight the climate crisis. ""But on the second day, people started joining me... I wouldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams that this would have happened so fast."" ""Change is coming whether you like it or not.""

What's new in the Mueller report?The report contains enough potential red flags to spur congressional scrutiny of the president.,"This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation paints a decidedly mixed picture of President Donald Trump's conduct, that provides ample fodder for either side of the political divide. The 448-page report says it did not establish the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 US presidential election. The inquiry also built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the Republican president, though it stopped short of concluding he committed a crime. While there was no immediate ""smoking gun"" to trigger impeachment proceedings, Democrats said the report had plenty of ammunition to keep up congressional scrutiny of Mr Trump. The report details the president's expletive-filled horror as he learned that a special counsel was being appointed in May 2017. According to the Mueller report, when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the president about the coming inquiry, he replied: ""Oh my god. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency."" He added two expletives to describe his situation. Mr Trump added:  ""Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels, it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won't be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me."" Analysis and reaction to Mueller report Trump 'tried to get Mueller fired' The Mueller report details how in June 2017, the president called White House counsel Donald McGahn at home from Camp David and ordered him to have the special counsel removed. On a second call, Mr McGahn said the president stepped up the pressure, saying: ""Call Rod [Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can't be the Special Counsel"", and ""Mueller has to go"" and ""Call me back when you do it."" Mr McGahn was so upset by the interference that he threatened to quit rather than participate in what he predicted would be a Nixon-style ""Saturday Night Massacre"". After media reports in January 2018 revealed Mr Trump's attempts to have Mr Mueller removed, one of the president's lawyers made contact with Mr McGahn, asking him to publicly deny the reports. But McGahn, through his attorney, refused. The report found there were a number of contacts between members of Trump's circle and Russia, and the campaign ""expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts"". The Trump team also ""showed interest"" in the Wikileaks release of hacked emails and ""welcomed their potential to damage"" Hillary Clinton. Unpatriotic and immoral, Democrats say. But the Mueller team makes clear it did not amount to a criminal conspiracy. ""The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to meet in person, invitations for campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking improved US-Russian relations. ""While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or co-ordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" On potential obstruction of justice, the Mueller report is far from the ""total exoneration"" claimed by Mr Trump during a victory lap last month. The report ultimately concludes: ""Unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."" But it also pointedly notes: ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President'sactions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred."" While the report acknowledges a sitting president cannot be indicted, it also mentions Congress' ability to investigate and potentially impeach him. It says: ""Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law."" This video can not be played Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions The report cites 10 instances that were investigated as potential obstruction by Mr Trump. Most have already been well documented, such as Mr Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. But the findings also validate past US media reports that were denied at the time by the White House. When Mr Trump learned the media was asking questions about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr, and a Russian lawyer who was said to be promising ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton, the president crafted a misleading response, says the report: ""Before the emails became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with 'an individual who [Trump Jr] was told might have information helpful to the campaign' and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions of Russian children."" Mr Trump also asked former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to announce publicly that the investigation was ""very unfair"" and Mr Trump had done nothing wrong, says the report. After Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, leaving an enraged Mr Trump feeling that he was losing control of the inquiry, the president pressed his attorney general that if he would only ""unrecuse"" himself he would be the ""hero"". The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Eight legal headaches for Donald Trump The Mueller report found that potential obstruction of justice by the president only failed because members of his administration refused to ""carry out orders"", including former FBI Director James Comey, former White House counsel Don McGahn and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowksi. In one unflattering passage, the document says: ""The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn's prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President's order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President's message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President's direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President's multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President's aides and associates beyond those already filed."" Close followers of the Mueller saga may recall that in January 2018 at the White House, President Trump told reporters that he was ""looking forward"" to sitting down for an interview with Mr Mueller, that he would ""love to do that as soon as possible"", and boasted he would do so under oath. But in the event, the report notes, ""after more than a year of discussion, the President declined to be interviewed"". He agreed to submit written answers to the special counsel's questions to Russia-related matters, but declined to ""provide written answers to questions on obstruction topics or questions on events during his transition"", the report notes. The Mueller report states: ""Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered whether to subpoena for his testimony. We viewed his written answers to be inadequate."" But the Mueller team said they ultimately decided not to subpoena Mr Trump because of the likelihood of litigation would cause a substantial delay at a late stage in the inquiry. The Mueller team did not indict then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for perjury to Congress when he wrongly testified that he had no contact with Russians during the campaign because of the inexact wording of the questions, according to the report. ""The evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false answers to Russia-related questions in light of the wording and context of those questions,"" the report says. It also makes clear Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and other campaign staff were on legally thin ice with their June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer. The Mueller team says they declined to prosecute the president's eldest son and son-in-law for campaign finance violations because they couldn't prove they had ""wilfully"" violated the law.

Mother wants changes over cot death reportsHolly Eastall says she felt suicidal after being falsely accused of abuse following her baby's death.UK,"Holly Eastall and her baby son Louie who died from sudden infant death syndrome A mother who lost her son to cot death says she wants a change in how such cases are reported after misleading headlines left her feeling ""suicidal"". Holly Eastall, 23, from Kingston, south-west London, was grieving her baby when it was reported ""child abuse officers"" were investigating the case. All unexplained infant deaths are probed by child protection teams. Ms Eastall said that as a result of the reports she was accused of abusing her baby and considered suicide. She said she was sworn at in the street by strangers, spat on and ostracised by her friends. Baby sleepers recalled in US after deaths Mother's bid to fund 'cuddle cots' The reports were published just one day after her four-month-old son Louie died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). She is now calling for a change in the way child deaths are reported by journalists and has launched an online petition. Ms Eastall wants rules put in place that would prevent the media from reporting unexplained child deaths or identifying families until there is proof of foul play. But the Society of Editors, which fights for press freedoms, says it is not that simple - and argues media reports of infant deaths ensure fair judicial proceedings for cases which end up in court. The NHS says sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) - known as ""cot death"" - is the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an apparently healthy baby. In the UK more than 200 babies die suddenly and unexpectedly every year. Most deaths happen during the first six months of a baby's life. Infants born prematurely or with a low birth weight are at greater risk. SIDS usually occurs when a baby is asleep, although it can occasionally happen while they are awake. Parents can reduce the risk of SIDS by not smoking while pregnant or after the baby is born, and always placing the baby on their back when they sleep. Mother-of-three Ms Eastall said: ""It really wasn't a nice thing for me to see, literally the day after my son died. ""Some of my friends turned against me, I had people in the street telling me I was disgusting. ""I had people making anonymous Facebook accounts telling me I should kill myself and I shouldn't have children."" The family launched this petition calling for a change in the way child deaths are reported She told the BBC that when she saw the reports she was so distressed she contemplated suicide. Ms Eastall added: ""They [the media] don't think about what they are doing. I wanted to kill myself when I saw it. ""If I didn't have my family, and my mum, and if I wasn't as strong as I am I don't know if I would've got through it."" Ms Eastall also claims that several of the articles published just one day after Louie's death featured pictures of her home - which she says endangered her and her other children. She contacted the seven or eight news organisations which published the story but says she did not hear back from any of them. After she complained one added in a sentence clarifying that all child deaths are investigated by police, but she did not receive an apology. She added: ""We set up this petition in order to help protect other families from having to face this trauma after losing a loved one."" Her petition has already been signed by more than 13,000 people. Ian Murray, director of the Society of Editors, said: ""While no one could do other than sympathise with anyone who has to deal with the terrible circumstances of the loss of a child or any loved one, to create a situation where no deaths can be reported unless foul play is confirmed is impractical in an open and free society. ""The whole process of British law which includes investigations into deaths by the coroner is intended to take place before the eyes of the world. ""This is as much to protect those at the centre of any allegations or investigations as to ensure any victims receive justice. ""At a time when social media is rife with rumour and speculation, to inhibit the media from reporting the actual circumstances surrounding a death would be totally counter-productive."" A spokeswoman for the Lullaby Trust, which provides support for families who have lost a child to SIDS, said: ""It is very important that the media consider the impact their coverage can have on a bereaved family and to ensure that they report accurately and sensitively. ""Sensationalist reporting can cause a family a great deal of additional distress during an immensely difficult time and perpetuate misunderstanding about SIDS."" Social media star Mrs Hinch threw her support behind the campaign, which hopes to garner 100,000 signatures so it can be debated in Parliament.

Cat found in sofa ready for incinerationSix-month-old kitten Tux was hiding in the unwanted furniture when it was taken to the tip.Berkshire,"Six-month-old Tux lived in the sofa for 11 days A lost kitten was found hiding in a sofa as it was about to be incinerated at a waste recycling centre. The cat ""poked his head up out of the cushions"" while heavy machinery was moving the sofa on Wednesday, Slough Borough Council said. Owner Lauren Jones was reunited with her pet after a council appeal. She said the six-month-old kitten, named Tux, was missing for 11 days after the unwanted sofa was collected from her home. Ms Jones said Tux had apparently survived for six days without food or water in a van, before the furniture was taken on Friday to the Chalvey waste and recycling centre. The kitten was rescued by workers at Chalvey waste and recycling centre Waste officer Thomas McGrory said a crew member was using large machinery in one of the transfer sheds when the cat jumped up over the vehicle's shovel. He said: ""It's a miracle it survived as each day tonnes of waste is taken to be incinerated. ""The cat seemed to be in good condition but was obviously frightened, hungry and very thirsty."" Ms Jones said Tux had suffered a broken leg and she was trying to raise funds for an operation through an online appeal. ""It's very upsetting - I've got my little boy back but is he going to be OK?"" she said. ""Everybody says he's a miracle. I don't know how he survived that long without eating in the back of a van.""

Climate protesters 'face full force of law',"About half a dozen activists were arrested in a space of 20 minutes at Oxford Circus Police are being diverted from ""core local duties"" that keep London safe by the Extinction Rebellion protesters, Scotland Yard has said. More than 500 people have been arrested since Monday, including three charged with gluing themselves to a train. Police rest days have been cancelled over the bank holiday, as more than 1,000 officers are deployed in London. Sajid Javid said the climate activists had ""no right to cause misery"" and the Met Police ""must take a firm stance"". Officers have also been asked to work 12-hour shifts, while the Violent Crime Task Force has had leave cancelled. ""This will have implications in the weeks and months beyond this protest as officers take back leave and the cost of overtime,"" a Met Police spokesman said. Traffic has been blocked at four sites since Monday British Transport Police said it ""continues to deploy additional officers throughout the London rail network to deter and disrupt further protest activity"". Heathrow Airport said it was ""working with the authorities"" following threats protesters may try to disrupt flights over the Easter weekend. The Met said ""strong plans"" were in place to enable a significant number of officers to be deployed to Heathrow if necessary. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? What is climate change? Police have made further arrests, but activists continue to block traffic at four sites around the capital. Marble Arch, Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge have been occupied by protesters since Monday. Transport for London warned delays around those areas were expected ""throughout the day"". Met Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave has said police may need new powers to deal with non-violent protests on this scale, due to the large number of arrestees for police and courts to deal with. Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters at Marble Arch Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters, saying it was the ""first real hopeful movement I've joined"". Speaking from the blockade at Marble Arch, Ms Thompson said: ""Our Planet is in deep danger, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren are going to face problems the likes of which we cannot even begin to imagine. ""Unfortunately our governments haven't listened to us, so now we have to make them listen."" Activists remain glued to a boat in the middle of Oxford Circus On Wednesday, a man glued himself to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train carriage in Canary Wharf while a man and woman were removed from the roof. Cathy Eastburn, 51, from Lambeth in south London, Mark Ovland, 35 of Somerton in Somerset and Luke Watson, 29, of Manuden in Essex, appeared before Highbury Magistrates' Court charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway. They all pleaded not guilty to the charge and will next appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on 16 May. The Met said a total of 10 people had so far been charged in connection with the protests.

Some protesters have been seen returning to the blockades despite being arrested. Police action to deter activists was having the ""opposite"" effect, according to environmental scientist Dominic Goetz who has returned to Waterloo Bridge following his arrest on Tuesday. ""I don't know whether I will be arrested again or not. If I am, I think the consequences will probably not be particularly severe,"" the 47-year-old said. More than 425 people have been arrested since Monday Met chiefs have also condemned footage of officers dancing with protesters. Thevideos posted on social media,,externalwhich showed police officers joining activists at Oxford Circus on Wednesday evening, have been condemned as ""unacceptable behaviour"". ""We expect our officers to engage with protesters but clearly their actions fall short of the tone of the policing operation,"" Cdr Jane Connors said. Demonstrators have been holding intermittent blockages on Vauxhall Bridge In a letter to the home secretary, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan suggested cuts to police funding were restricting the Met's ability to cope with the demonstrators. A group of demonstrators has been blocking Vauxhall Bridge for short periods of time as part of a ""swarming"" protest. Similar intermittent roadblocks have also been formed by activists at Piccadilly Circus. This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

Facebook bans far right groups and leaders,"Former BNP leader Nick Griffin and ex-Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen are among those affected Facebook has imposed a ban on a dozen far-right individuals and organisations that it says ""spread hate"". The ban includes the British National Party and Nick Griffin, the English Defence League and the National Front. The list also includes Britain First, which was already banned, but this latest action will prohibit support for it on any of the US firm's services. It said it had taken the action because those involved had proclaimed a ""violent or hateful mission"". ""Individuals and organisations who spread hate, or attack or call for the exclusion of others on the basis of who they are, have no place on Facebook,"" the social network added in a statement. The pages of some organisations named were still present on Facebook before the announcement The ban includes: The British National Party and its ex-leader Nick Griffin Britain First, its leader Paul Golding and former deputy leader Jayda Fransen English Defence League and its founding member Paul Ray Knights Templar International and its promoter Jim Dowson National Front and its leader Tony Martin Jack Renshaw, a neo-Nazi who plotted to murder a Labour MP A spokesman for Facebook clarified what would now be done to the pages the groups and individuals had run on its site. All those named would be prevented from having a presence on any Facebook service. In addition, praise and support for the groups or named individuals would no longer be allowed. The ban was ""long overdue"" said MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select committee. ""For too long social media companies have been facilitating extremist and hateful content online and profiting from the poison,"" she added. ""They have particularly failed on far-right extremism as they don't even have the same co-ordination systems for platforms to work together as they do on Islamist extremism,"" she added. Ms Cooper said the measures were a ""necessary first step"" and should be strengthened by independent regulation and financial penalties for firms that were sluggish to remove material. ""We all know the appalling consequences there can be if hateful, violent and illegal content is allowed to proliferate,"" she said. This current action, said Facebook, went further than the restrictions placed on Britain First last year when its official pages were removed for breaking the site's community standards. The latest move comes soon afterFacebook said it would block""praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism"" on its main app and Instagram.

Oil giant exits UK North Sea with Â£2bn deal,"ConocoPhillips is pulling out of UK exploration and production after selling its North Sea oil and gas assets to Chrysaor for $2.68bn (Â£2bn). The sale will boost Chrysaor's production by about 72,000 barrels a day to 177,000 - making it one of the UK's biggest operators. The deal, expected to complete in late 2019, requires regulatory approval. ConocoPhillips said it would retain its Londonâbased commercial trading business. It will also keep its 40.25% interest in the Teesside oil terminal. The assets being purchased by Chrysaor include two new operated hubs in the UK Central North Sea â Britannia and JâBlock - and an interest in the Clair Field area located west of Shetland. In the UK Southern North Sea, Chrysaor will assume responsibility for an ongoing decommissioning programme on ConocoPhillips UK's endâofâlife assets. As of January 2018, ConocoPhillips UK assets contained more than 280 million barrels of proved and probable oil and gas reserves. The package of assets being acquired by Chrysaor are outlined in the table below: Chrysaor said it would fund the acquisition from existing cash resources and a debt facility underwritten by Bank of Montreal, BNP Paribas, DNB Bank, and ING Bank.

What next after Mueller report lands?,"Finally. At last. The day has come. The Mueller report. It is here. And for all the hype, the expectation that Washington and cable news specialises in, on the one to 10 scale where one is a barely audible whimper and 10 is the eruption of a Krakatoan volcano, this is almost certainly going to be at the lower decibel end. Why do I say that? Because the Attorney general, Bill Barr, blew any cliff-hanger season finale moment with his four-page letter summarising the findings. On collusion with Russia, there was none. On whether the president obstructed justice, the Mueller report was more equivocal. And that is fascinating and why we shouldn't just roll over and go back to sleep. Donald Trump has made clear what he thinks it amounts to: ""Total exoneration."" But the one sentence of the report that was released in the attorney general's summary is far more tantalising. Mueller wrote: ""While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it does not exonerate him."" And what that amounts to is going to engulf debate once this report lands. Jonathan Turley is the incredibly well plugged in professor of law at George Washington University. ""Critics of Trump will come in and they will look specifically at obstruction and find a lot of material there, of conduct that may not be indictable but certainly could be contemptible, or even impeachable. ""For Trump supporters they will look at the collusion section and say 'that's what started all this and they found nothing, and this whole narrative proved to be false.'"" The frustrating part about when we eventually get our hands on the report will be how much of it is redacted. Helpfully the excisions will be colour-coded. One colour if it is intel too sensitive for public consumption; another if it is material being considered by a grand jury; another still if it is criticism of a third party who hasn't been indicted. In other words it might look more like a colouring book than a report. So should we expect Democrats to create a hue and cry? Back to my one is a whimper and 10 is volcanic scale, I think they will be around the seven to eight mark. The best day of Trump's presidency From 'alternative facts' to rewriting history Pugilist or peacemaker: The choice facing President Trump Already Democratic party-controlled committees in the House of Representatives are issuing subpoenas to get access to all sorts of information. They will reject the 'there's nothing to see here, just keep moving along the sidewalk, ladies and gentlemen' - Donald Trump's opponents will insist there are questions to be answered. But out on the stump across the country it feels different - remember in the US you are never far away from an election. At the moment there is a heap of Democratic hopefuls hurtling around the country honing messages for 2020. They are debating jobs, the environment, taxes, health, immigration. But Mueller? Not so much. Nancy Pelosi, the strategically astute Speaker of the House, said this on a trip to Europe this week: ""People are concerned about their kitchen table issues: are they going to be able to pay the bills. So I have not been one of these focusers on impeachment and reports and the rest of that, let the chips fall where they may when we have the evidence and the facts."" Now this needs decoding a bit. She's not giving the president a clean bill of health. What she's saying is the last thing Democrats need is a messy and almost certainly futile attempt at impeachment; much better to have a president who is wounded and weakened by Mueller. One other thing: Timing. It's the day before Good Friday. It is Spring Break. American schoolchildren are on holiday. Some families are at the beach. In the national parks. Enjoying Easter. And on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are never more than a few yards from a microphone, they're in recess. It's no accident that the Justice Department is releasing the Mueller report today.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Arkansas People in Arkansas say they are happy the report has been released to
the public - for different reasons. Some Arkansans say that the report will
give the public a chance to see what government officials have been up to and
will help to expose how some of these officials have worked against the
president and tried to damage his reputation. Walter Smith, who is now retired
and lives near Russellville, Arkansas, he says the report will help to shed
light on those in âthe deep stateâ, as he put it. He defines Deep Staters as
âTrump hatersâ such as the former FBI director, James Comey, and âall those
around himâ, says Smith. Smith says he hopes that the Mueller report will help
to ensure that Comey and his associates will âget in trouble and get indictedâ
and be held accountable for the ways they were âworking against the
presidencyâ. Walter Smith Others are also pleased with the fact that the report has been released because it gives them access to more information. âThe more transparency, the better,â says David Cullen, a history professor at Arkansas Tech University in Russellville. Still, Mr Cullen, who is a political independent, says that he was disappointed with the conclusions of Robert Muellerâs report and says he wished Mr Mueller had been able to collect more evidence against the president. Mr Cullenâs own view of the president is clear: âI think he broke the law."" Mr Mueller fell short, Mr Cullen says, in his pursuit of the truth. âHe didnât have hard evidence so he cannot go to court. But he still thought it was in the legal purview of Congress to continue the investigation.â Mr Cullen says he is eager to see what members of Congress will do in their efforts to find out what the president has done. Fayetteville resident Doug Thompson, a Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette political writer, says that the report shows the president may be guilty of crimes. âIt means that all those claims heâs been exonerated are made in bad faith. It clearly does not say that,â says Mr Thompson. âThe money quoteâ, Mr Thompson says, is the line where Mr Mueller says that they would have cleared the president if they could have. According to an analysis by ProPublica, only about 6% of the total report has been blacked out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told CNN it is not worth the effort to initiate impeachment proceedings. ""Based on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point. Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgment,"" the Maryland congressman said. His comments echoed those of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,who told the Washington Post,externallast month that impeaching Trump is ""just not worth it"". Rick Gates - Paul Manafort's deputy - told the special counsel that Donald Trump Jr had announced ahead of the 9 June meeting at Trump Tower that he had ""a lead on negative information about the Clinton Foundation"". He said that morning meeting had been attended by several members of Trump's family - Don Jr, Eric, Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner - as well as Hope Hicks and Paul Manafort. Gates thought the information came from a group in Kyrgyzstan. ""According to Gates, Manafort warned the group that the meeting likely would not yield vital information and they should be careful,"" the report said. Allow Twitter content?

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation paints a decidedly mixed picture of President Donald Trump's conduct, both suspicious and exculpatory, that both sides of the political divide will seize upon. Mr Trump already has the result he insisted on from the outset: no collusion. While it is unclear if the document contains any ""smoking gun"" that might make impeachment proceedings against the president any more likely, there are enough potential red flags in there to keep congressional hearings ticking over for the remainder of his term in office.

Former FBI director James Comey The special counsel's report says that White House adviser Stephen Miller - who has reportedly been encouraging the president's increasingly hard-line stance on immigration recently - was behind Comey's firing letter. Trump apparently told his advisors at a dinner on 5 May that he wanted to fire Comey. According to notes Miller took at the time, Trump said the letter should start: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a Trump-Russia relationship pertaining to the 2016 presidential election, please be informed that I, and I believe the American public - including [Democrats] and [Republicans] - have lost faith in you as Director of the FBI."" Miller wrote the letter after dinner based on Trump's guidance, according to the report. White House adviser Stephen Miller ""You can be the President's defence attorney or America's attorney general, but you can't be both,"" Rep Eric Swalwell - a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful - said in a statement.

Before firing Comey, Trump had ""been assured"" that the FBI was not investigating him. He ""deemed it critically important to make public that he was not under investigation"" After firing Comey, Trump was aware of the obstruction of justice inquiry into his conduct and he ""launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President"". In private, he ""engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation"" - such as trying to remove the special counsel, pressuring Jeff Sessions to control the inquiry, preventing the leak of information about the Trump Tower meeting and using ""public forums to attack potential witnesses"".

'Giant lion' fossil found in museum drawerThe bones of the huge creature belong to a new species which roamed east Africa 20 million years ago.,"A new species of giant mammal has been identified after researchers investigated bones that had been kept for decades in a Kenyan museum drawer. The species, dubbed ""Simbakubwa kutokaafrika"" meaning ""big African lion"" in Swahili, roamed east Africa about 20 millions years ago. But the huge creature was part of a now extinct group of mammals called hyaenodonts. The discovery could help explain what happened to the group. Hyaenodonts - so called because their teeth resemble those of a modern hyena - were dominant carnivores more than 20 million years ago, National Geographic reports.,external But they are not related to hyenas. Africa Live: More on this and other stories How a shepherd found a dinosaur graveyard Lost history of African dinosaurs revealed ""Based on its massive teeth, Simbakubwa was a specialised hyper-carnivore that was significantly larger than the modern lion and possibly larger than a polar bear,"" researcher Matthew Borths is quoted by AFP news agency as saying. In 2013 he was doing research at the Nairobi National Museum when he asked to look at the contents of a collection labelled ""hyenas"", National Geographic says. The creature's jaw and other bones and teeth had been put there after being found at a dig in western Kenya in the late 1970s. Mr Borths teamed up with another researcher, Nancy Stevens, and in 2017 they began analysing the unusual fossil specimens.

Charges over climate change train protest,"About half a dozen activists were arrested in a space of 20 minutes at Oxford Circus Police are being diverted from ""core local duties"" that keep London safe by the Extinction Rebellion protesters, Scotland Yard has said. More than 500 people have been arrested since Monday, including three charged with gluing themselves to a train. Police rest days have been cancelled over the bank holiday, as more than 1,000 officers are deployed in London. Sajid Javid said the climate activists had ""no right to cause misery"" and the Met Police ""must take a firm stance"". Officers have also been asked to work 12-hour shifts, while the Violent Crime Task Force has had leave cancelled. ""This will have implications in the weeks and months beyond this protest as officers take back leave and the cost of overtime,"" a Met Police spokesman said. Traffic has been blocked at four sites since Monday British Transport Police said it ""continues to deploy additional officers throughout the London rail network to deter and disrupt further protest activity"". Heathrow Airport said it was ""working with the authorities"" following threats protesters may try to disrupt flights over the Easter weekend. The Met said ""strong plans"" were in place to enable a significant number of officers to be deployed to Heathrow if necessary. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? What is climate change? Police have made further arrests, but activists continue to block traffic at four sites around the capital. Marble Arch, Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge have been occupied by protesters since Monday. Transport for London warned delays around those areas were expected ""throughout the day"". Met Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave has said police may need new powers to deal with non-violent protests on this scale, due to the large number of arrestees for police and courts to deal with. Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters at Marble Arch Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters, saying it was the ""first real hopeful movement I've joined"". Speaking from the blockade at Marble Arch, Ms Thompson said: ""Our Planet is in deep danger, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren are going to face problems the likes of which we cannot even begin to imagine. ""Unfortunately our governments haven't listened to us, so now we have to make them listen."" Activists remain glued to a boat in the middle of Oxford Circus On Wednesday, a man glued himself to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train carriage in Canary Wharf while a man and woman were removed from the roof. Cathy Eastburn, 51, from Lambeth in south London, Mark Ovland, 35 of Somerton in Somerset and Luke Watson, 29, of Manuden in Essex, appeared before Highbury Magistrates' Court charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway. They all pleaded not guilty to the charge and will next appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on 16 May. The Met said a total of 10 people had so far been charged in connection with the protests.

Some protesters have been seen returning to the blockades despite being arrested. Police action to deter activists was having the ""opposite"" effect, according to environmental scientist Dominic Goetz who has returned to Waterloo Bridge following his arrest on Tuesday. ""I don't know whether I will be arrested again or not. If I am, I think the consequences will probably not be particularly severe,"" the 47-year-old said. More than 425 people have been arrested since Monday Met chiefs have also condemned footage of officers dancing with protesters. Thevideos posted on social media,,externalwhich showed police officers joining activists at Oxford Circus on Wednesday evening, have been condemned as ""unacceptable behaviour"". ""We expect our officers to engage with protesters but clearly their actions fall short of the tone of the policing operation,"" Cdr Jane Connors said. Demonstrators have been holding intermittent blockages on Vauxhall Bridge In a letter to the home secretary, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan suggested cuts to police funding were restricting the Met's ability to cope with the demonstrators. A group of demonstrators has been blocking Vauxhall Bridge for short periods of time as part of a ""swarming"" protest. Similar intermittent roadblocks have also been formed by activists at Piccadilly Circus. This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

Det Ch Insp Alun Davies: ""Since the tragic events of Friday evening, our investigation team have been conducting many lines of inquiry to establish the circumstances surrounding the death of 13-year-old Carson Price. ""As a result, this morning, Thursday 18th April, specialist Gwent Police officers executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act, at an address in Pontllanfraith, Blackwood. ""A 14-year-old boy from the area has now been arrested on suspicion of supplying class A controlled drugs. ""He currently remains in police custody at Newport Central Police Station and will be interviewed with an appropriate adult as part of our investigation."" Youth workers visited Ystrad Mynach Park on Friday prior to Carson's death Supt Nick McLain thanked members of the community for ""support during this tragic time"".

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Arkansas People in Arkansas say they are happy the report has been released to
the public - for different reasons. Some Arkansans say that the report will
give the public a chance to see what government officials have been up to and
will help to expose how some of these officials have worked against the
president and tried to damage his reputation. Walter Smith, who is now retired
and lives near Russellville, Arkansas, he says the report will help to shed
light on those in âthe deep stateâ, as he put it. He defines Deep Staters as
âTrump hatersâ such as the former FBI director, James Comey, and âall those
around himâ, says Smith. Smith says he hopes that the Mueller report will help
to ensure that Comey and his associates will âget in trouble and get indictedâ
and be held accountable for the ways they were âworking against the
presidencyâ. Walter Smith Others are also pleased with the fact that the report has been released because it gives them access to more information. âThe more transparency, the better,â says David Cullen, a history professor at Arkansas Tech University in Russellville. Still, Mr Cullen, who is a political independent, says that he was disappointed with the conclusions of Robert Muellerâs report and says he wished Mr Mueller had been able to collect more evidence against the president. Mr Cullenâs own view of the president is clear: âI think he broke the law."" Mr Mueller fell short, Mr Cullen says, in his pursuit of the truth. âHe didnât have hard evidence so he cannot go to court. But he still thought it was in the legal purview of Congress to continue the investigation.â Mr Cullen says he is eager to see what members of Congress will do in their efforts to find out what the president has done. Fayetteville resident Doug Thompson, a Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette political writer, says that the report shows the president may be guilty of crimes. âIt means that all those claims heâs been exonerated are made in bad faith. It clearly does not say that,â says Mr Thompson. âThe money quoteâ, Mr Thompson says, is the line where Mr Mueller says that they would have cleared the president if they could have. According to an analysis by ProPublica, only about 6% of the total report has been blacked out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told CNN it is not worth the effort to initiate impeachment proceedings. ""Based on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point. Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgment,"" the Maryland congressman said. His comments echoed those of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,who told the Washington Post,externallast month that impeaching Trump is ""just not worth it"". Rick Gates - Paul Manafort's deputy - told the special counsel that Donald Trump Jr had announced ahead of the 9 June meeting at Trump Tower that he had ""a lead on negative information about the Clinton Foundation"". He said that morning meeting had been attended by several members of Trump's family - Don Jr, Eric, Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner - as well as Hope Hicks and Paul Manafort. Gates thought the information came from a group in Kyrgyzstan.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation paints a decidedly mixed picture of President Donald Trump's conduct, both suspicious and exculpatory, that both sides of the political divide will seize upon. Mr Trump already has the result he insisted on from the outset: no collusion. While it is unclear if the document contains any ""smoking gun"" that might make impeachment proceedings against the president any more likely, there are enough potential red flags in there to keep congressional hearings ticking over for the remainder of his term in office.

Former FBI director James Comey The special counsel's report says that White House adviser Stephen Miller - who has reportedly been encouraging the president's increasingly hard-line stance on immigration recently - was behind Comey's firing letter. Trump apparently told his advisors at a dinner on 5 May that he wanted to fire Comey. According to notes Miller took at the time, Trump said the letter should start: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a Trump-Russia relationship pertaining to the 2016 presidential election, please be informed that I, and I believe the American public - including [Democrats] and [Republicans] - have lost faith in you as Director of the FBI."" Miller wrote the letter after dinner based on Trump's guidance, according to the report. White House adviser Stephen Miller ""You can be the President's defence attorney or America's attorney general, but you can't be both,"" Rep Eric Swalwell - a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful - said in a statement.

Longest-serving garden presenter bows outJim McColl has been presenting BBC Scotland's The Beechgrove Garden since 1978.,"Jim McColl with co-presenter Carole Baxter The BBC's longest-serving gardening presenter is hanging up his trowel after more than 40 years. Jim McColl, 83, has hosted BBC Scotland's The Beechgrove Garden since the popular TV show began in 1978. He said his passion for gardening was undimmed but failing grip in his hands was one of the reasons for leaving now. His words ""Welcome to Beechgrove Garden"" and catchphrase 'Every day's a school day' have been familiar to generations of Scottish viewers. Explaining his decision, he said: ""It is time I retired not because I have lost any interest in gardening or my enthusiasm for gardening but just because I'm getting old. ""I'll be 84 next birthday - so things are going wrong in the sense that if I get down on my knees, I'm not sure I can get back up again."" Jim McColl in the early days of The Beechgrove Garden Jim will announce his retirement when the latest show airs on the new BBC Scotland channel later. During the show, which will look back at his career, he will tell co-presenter Carole Baxter that gardening has shaped his life. ""It is half my life. I just want to grow old in private â¦ but I'll still garden,"" he says. Jim reveals he is getting treatment to help with his loss of grip, but has difficulties and is unable to do things like button his top shirt button. Gardening colleagues watching the show have previously remarked to him that he has been holding gardening tools awkwardly. The cast of the long-running TV gardening show He said: ""One of the things you want to do when you are showing off on telly, is you want to do it properly."" Tributes have been paid to his professionalism and dedication to both horticulture and broadcasting. Beechgrove producer Gwyneth Hardy said: ""It's the end of an era for Jim to be handing over the trowel. ""It's been a big decision, not taken lightly for Jim as he is genuinely passionate about communicating his knowledge of gardening. ""He said to me recently that gardening is like breathing for him; it's an everyday activity."" Jim and his fellow presenters celebrated the 40th anniversary of Beechgrove last year Carole Baxter, who has worked alongside Jim for 36 years, said: ""I am going to miss Jim after working with him for all these years but this is an appropriate time to celebrate his career. ""He is a great gardener and presenter. ""He shares his wealth of gardening knowledge in a way which engages people at all levels of gardening expertise from none to the professionals."" When the BBC began digging up a patch of garden at the back of its studios in Aberdeen, nobody could have imagined that the show would become a hardy perennial like its presenter. His life and achievements were honoured with a Royal Television Society Scotland award in 2016. The late Sir Patrick Moore is hard to eclipse having presented the Sky at Night for 55 years Melvyn Bragg has been the face of The South Bank Show in its various guises for 39 years Sir Terry Wogan was the face of Children in Need from 1980 until his death in 2016 Another gardener, Alan Titchmarsh hosted the Chelsea Flower Show for 30 years Journalist Kirsty Wark has been presenting the BBC's Newsnight since 1993 Naturalist Sir David Attenborough is the rarest of species, holding the record for the longest-serving TV presenter at 65 years He told aBBC Scotland documentary to mark his 80th birthdaythat his father was a gardening supervisor responsible for all the parks in Kilmarnock. ""It was part of the fabric of our lives really,"" he said. ""You are much influenced by your environment and that was part of mine."" After a spell working as a gardening adviser in Reading, he moved to Aberdeenshire where he worked on a ground-breaking distillery project that used waste energy to grow tomatoes. The Beechgrove Garden grew out of his participation in a Radio Scotland series The Scottish Garden. Jim presented the show from BBC Scotland's Aberdeen base alongside George Barron. Jim McColl with former co-presenter George Barron Donalda MacKinnon, director of BBC Scotland, said: ""Many thousands of gardeners have been inspired and coached by Jim via The Beechgrove Garden over many years and on behalf of them all, and also for other viewers who simply love him for his knowledge and warmth, I'd like to thank him.""

Queen joined by Eugenie at Maundy service,"Princess Eugenie attended the service at St George's Chapel, where she was married last year The Queen was joined by Princess Eugenie for this year's Royal Maundy Service as she marked Maundy Thursday by handing out coins to pensioners. Commemorative purses were given to 93 men and 93 women at Windsor Castle's St George's Chapel, referring to the Queen's 93rd birthday on Sunday. The recipients were chosen in recognition of their service to the church and local community. Maundy Thursday is a Christian holy day falling on the Thursday before Easter. When the Queen arrived at the chapel's north door with her granddaughter, they were presented with traditional nosegays - which in ancient times warded off unpleasant smells - before taking their seats at the head of the congregation.

Maundy Thursday, the fifth day of Holy Week  - which runs from Palm Sunday to Easter - is a day when Christians remember Jesus Christ sharing the Last Supper with his disciples before his death on Good Friday. The origins of the ceremony come from the commandment Christ gave after washing his disciples' feet, where according to the Bible, he told them to ""love one another as I have loved you"". Historically, it has involved handing out food and clothing and cleaning the poor. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

YouTuber's Alex Jones interview 'unwise',"Alex Jones laughs and jokes with the podcast hosts during the interview Anti-racism campaigners have called YouTube star Logan Paul ""irresponsible and unwise"" for interviewing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his channel. Mr Jones is currently banned from YouTube for violating the site's policy on abusive behaviour. He is also banned from many other social platforms for breaking conditions governing such behaviour. The Hope Not Hate campaign said it was a mistake for Mr Paul to ""give a platform to an extremist"". A two-hour chat with Mr Jones features on the Logan Paul podcast channel, which currently has about 1.4 million subscribers, many of whom are in their teens and 20s. During the wide-ranging interview Mr Paul laughs and jokes with Mr Jones about his widely contested beliefs, at one point going along with Mr Jones's claim that former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is ""crazy"". However, Mr Paul does challenge Mr Jones, who isbeing sued for defamationby parents of children killed during the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, on his views on the massacre, saying his view of it as a hoax could ""become something dangerous"". Joe Mulhall, senior researcher at Hope Not Hate, criticised the decision to record and air the talk. ""Paul seems to have given a platform to an extremist simply to generate more views and appears to have portrayed his guest as an amusement,"" he said. He added: ""Paul described Jones as ""a far-right conspiracy theorist"" and yet still decided to have him on his show, meaning he knew what he was doing and seemingly didn't seem to care."" Mr Mulhall said the show could mean Mr Jones is exposed to a ""new and younger audience"". The interview looks set to get significant views as Mr Paul has more than four million followers on Twitter, where the chat was previewed. And almost 19 million people subscribe to Mr Paul's main YouTube channel. Mr Paul and YouTube have yet to respond to requests for comment about the interview. Many other social platforms have taken action against Mr Jones and his InfoWars media group. Twitter has permanently banned Mr Jones and his InfoWars channel for repeatedly violating its terms and conditions. Other bans have been imposed by Facebook, Apple, Pinterest and LinkedIn. Paypal has also refused to process payments on behalf of InfoWars.

What to look for in report,"Finally. At last. The day has come. The Mueller report. It is here. And for all the hype, the expectation that Washington and cable news specialises in, on the one to 10 scale where one is a barely audible whimper and 10 is the eruption of a Krakatoan volcano, this is almost certainly going to be at the lower decibel end. Why do I say that? Because the Attorney general, Bill Barr, blew any cliff-hanger season finale moment with his four-page letter summarising the findings. On collusion with Russia, there was none. On whether the president obstructed justice, the Mueller report was more equivocal. And that is fascinating and why we shouldn't just roll over and go back to sleep. Donald Trump has made clear what he thinks it amounts to: ""Total exoneration."" But the one sentence of the report that was released in the attorney general's summary is far more tantalising. Mueller wrote: ""While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it does not exonerate him."" And what that amounts to is going to engulf debate once this report lands. Jonathan Turley is the incredibly well plugged in professor of law at George Washington University. ""Critics of Trump will come in and they will look specifically at obstruction and find a lot of material there, of conduct that may not be indictable but certainly could be contemptible, or even impeachable. ""For Trump supporters they will look at the collusion section and say 'that's what started all this and they found nothing, and this whole narrative proved to be false.'"" The frustrating part about when we eventually get our hands on the report will be how much of it is redacted. Helpfully the excisions will be colour-coded. One colour if it is intel too sensitive for public consumption; another if it is material being considered by a grand jury; another still if it is criticism of a third party who hasn't been indicted. In other words it might look more like a colouring book than a report. So should we expect Democrats to create a hue and cry? Back to my one is a whimper and 10 is volcanic scale, I think they will be around the seven to eight mark. The best day of Trump's presidency From 'alternative facts' to rewriting history Pugilist or peacemaker: The choice facing President Trump Already Democratic party-controlled committees in the House of Representatives are issuing subpoenas to get access to all sorts of information. They will reject the 'there's nothing to see here, just keep moving along the sidewalk, ladies and gentlemen' - Donald Trump's opponents will insist there are questions to be answered. But out on the stump across the country it feels different - remember in the US you are never far away from an election. At the moment there is a heap of Democratic hopefuls hurtling around the country honing messages for 2020. They are debating jobs, the environment, taxes, health, immigration. But Mueller? Not so much. Nancy Pelosi, the strategically astute Speaker of the House, said this on a trip to Europe this week: ""People are concerned about their kitchen table issues: are they going to be able to pay the bills. So I have not been one of these focusers on impeachment and reports and the rest of that, let the chips fall where they may when we have the evidence and the facts."" Now this needs decoding a bit. She's not giving the president a clean bill of health. What she's saying is the last thing Democrats need is a messy and almost certainly futile attempt at impeachment; much better to have a president who is wounded and weakened by Mueller. One other thing: Timing. It's the day before Good Friday. It is Spring Break. American schoolchildren are on holiday. Some families are at the beach. In the national parks. Enjoying Easter. And on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are never more than a few yards from a microphone, they're in recess. It's no accident that the Justice Department is releasing the Mueller report today.

"Facebook bans far right groups and leadersA dozen named groups and individuals will be purged from the social network, it said.","Former BNP leader Nick Griffin and ex-Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen are among those affected Facebook has imposed a ban on a dozen far-right individuals and organisations that it says ""spread hate"". The ban includes the British National Party and Nick Griffin, the English Defence League and the National Front. The list also includes Britain First, which was already banned, but this latest action will prohibit support for it on any of the US firm's services. It said it had taken the action because those involved had proclaimed a ""violent or hateful mission"". ""Individuals and organisations who spread hate, or attack or call for the exclusion of others on the basis of who they are, have no place on Facebook,"" the social network added in a statement. The pages of some organisations named were still present on Facebook before the announcement The ban includes: The British National Party and its ex-leader Nick Griffin Britain First, its leader Paul Golding and former deputy leader Jayda Fransen English Defence League and its founding member Paul Ray Knights Templar International and its promoter Jim Dowson National Front and its leader Tony Martin Jack Renshaw, a neo-Nazi who plotted to murder a Labour MP A spokesman for Facebook clarified what would now be done to the pages the groups and individuals had run on its site. All those named would be prevented from having a presence on any Facebook service. In addition, praise and support for the groups or named individuals would no longer be allowed. The ban was ""long overdue"" said MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select committee. ""For too long social media companies have been facilitating extremist and hateful content online and profiting from the poison,"" she added. ""They have particularly failed on far-right extremism as they don't even have the same co-ordination systems for platforms to work together as they do on Islamist extremism,"" she added. Ms Cooper said the measures were a ""necessary first step"" and should be strengthened by independent regulation and financial penalties for firms that were sluggish to remove material. ""We all know the appalling consequences there can be if hateful, violent and illegal content is allowed to proliferate,"" she said. This current action, said Facebook, went further than the restrictions placed on Britain First last year when its official pages were removed for breaking the site's community standards. The latest move comes soon afterFacebook said it would block""praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism"" on its main app and Instagram. Some controversial figures, such as Tommy Robinson, are already subject to bans on the social network.

Charges over climate change train protestThree people deny obstructing trains during the Extinction Rebellion protest and are remanded in custody.London,"About half a dozen activists were arrested in a space of 20 minutes at Oxford Circus Police are being diverted from ""core local duties"" that keep London safe by the Extinction Rebellion protesters, Scotland Yard has said. More than 500 people have been arrested since Monday, including three charged with gluing themselves to a train. Police rest days have been cancelled over the bank holiday, as more than 1,000 officers are deployed in London. Sajid Javid said the climate activists had ""no right to cause misery"" and the Met Police ""must take a firm stance"". Officers have also been asked to work 12-hour shifts, while the Violent Crime Task Force has had leave cancelled. ""This will have implications in the weeks and months beyond this protest as officers take back leave and the cost of overtime,"" a Met Police spokesman said. Traffic has been blocked at four sites since Monday British Transport Police said it ""continues to deploy additional officers throughout the London rail network to deter and disrupt further protest activity"". Heathrow Airport said it was ""working with the authorities"" following threats protesters may try to disrupt flights over the Easter weekend. The Met said ""strong plans"" were in place to enable a significant number of officers to be deployed to Heathrow if necessary. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? What is climate change? Police have made further arrests, but activists continue to block traffic at four sites around the capital. Marble Arch, Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge have been occupied by protesters since Monday. Transport for London warned delays around those areas were expected ""throughout the day"". Met Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave has said police may need new powers to deal with non-violent protests on this scale, due to the large number of arrestees for police and courts to deal with. Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters at Marble Arch Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters, saying it was the ""first real hopeful movement I've joined"". Speaking from the blockade at Marble Arch, Ms Thompson said: ""Our Planet is in deep danger, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren are going to face problems the likes of which we cannot even begin to imagine. ""Unfortunately our governments haven't listened to us, so now we have to make them listen."" Activists remain glued to a boat in the middle of Oxford Circus On Wednesday, a man glued himself to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train carriage in Canary Wharf while a man and woman were removed from the roof. Cathy Eastburn, 51, from Lambeth in south London, Mark Ovland, 35 of Somerton in Somerset and Luke Watson, 29, of Manuden in Essex, appeared before Highbury Magistrates' Court charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway. They all pleaded not guilty to the charge and will next appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on 16 May. The Met said a total of 10 people had so far been charged in connection with the protests.

Some protesters have been seen returning to the blockades despite being arrested. Police action to deter activists was having the ""opposite"" effect, according to environmental scientist Dominic Goetz who has returned to Waterloo Bridge following his arrest on Tuesday. ""I don't know whether I will be arrested again or not. If I am, I think the consequences will probably not be particularly severe,"" the 47-year-old said. More than 425 people have been arrested since Monday Met chiefs have also condemned footage of officers dancing with protesters. Thevideos posted on social media,,externalwhich showed police officers joining activists at Oxford Circus on Wednesday evening, have been condemned as ""unacceptable behaviour"". ""We expect our officers to engage with protesters but clearly their actions fall short of the tone of the policing operation,"" Cdr Jane Connors said. Demonstrators have been holding intermittent blockages on Vauxhall Bridge In a letter to the home secretary, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan suggested cuts to police funding were restricting the Met's ability to cope with the demonstrators. A group of demonstrators has been blocking Vauxhall Bridge for short periods of time as part of a ""swarming"" protest. Similar intermittent roadblocks have also been formed by activists at Piccadilly Circus. This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

Thai rescue diver freed from caveJosh Bratchley was rescued after being trapped in a flooded cave in the US for 28 hours.Devon,"Josh Bratchely asked for a pizza after being trapped underground for 28 hours One of the British divers who helped to save the Thai cave schoolboys had to be rescued from a cave himself after becoming trapped for 28 hours. Josh Bratchley had been exploring a flooded cave in Jackson County, Tennessee, when he failed to return to the surface on Tuesday. His fellow divers from the UK spent hours searching for their missing friend, but he was nowhere to be found. Expert divers found Mr Bratchley waiting calmly in an air pocket. The alarm was raised after Mr Bratchley failed to return to the surface at 15:00 local time (21:00 BST) on Tuesday. The authorities were notified in the early hours of Wednesday morning and expert divers were flown in from different US states. This video can not be played Josh Bratchley was rescued after being trapped in a flooded cave in the US for 28 hours They entered the 400ft cave system at about 18:00 local time, and Mr Bratchley was back on the surface about an hour later.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Arkansas People in Arkansas say they are happy the report has been released to
the public - for different reasons. Some Arkansans say that the report will
give the public a chance to see what government officials have been up to and
will help to expose how some of these officials have worked against the
president and tried to damage his reputation. Walter Smith, who is now retired
and lives near Russellville, Arkansas, he says the report will help to shed
light on those in âthe deep stateâ, as he put it. He defines Deep Staters as
âTrump hatersâ such as the former FBI director, James Comey, and âall those
around himâ, says Smith. Smith says he hopes that the Mueller report will help
to ensure that Comey and his associates will âget in trouble and get indictedâ
and be held accountable for the ways they were âworking against the
presidencyâ. Walter Smith Others are also pleased with the fact that the report has been released because it gives them access to more information. âThe more transparency, the better,â says David Cullen, a history professor at Arkansas Tech University in Russellville. Still, Mr Cullen, who is a political independent, says that he was disappointed with the conclusions of Robert Muellerâs report and says he wished Mr Mueller had been able to collect more evidence against the president. Mr Cullenâs own view of the president is clear: âI think he broke the law."" Mr Mueller fell short, Mr Cullen says, in his pursuit of the truth. âHe didnât have hard evidence so he cannot go to court. But he still thought it was in the legal purview of Congress to continue the investigation.â Mr Cullen says he is eager to see what members of Congress will do in their efforts to find out what the president has done. Fayetteville resident Doug Thompson, a Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette political writer, says that the report shows the president may be guilty of crimes. âIt means that all those claims heâs been exonerated are made in bad faith. It clearly does not say that,â says Mr Thompson. âThe money quoteâ, Mr Thompson says, is the line where Mr Mueller says that they would have cleared the president if they could have. According to an analysis by ProPublica, only about 6% of the total report has been blacked out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told CNN it is not worth the effort to initiate impeachment proceedings. ""Based on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point. Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgment,"" the Maryland congressman said. His comments echoed those of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,who told the Washington Post,externallast month that impeaching Trump is ""just not worth it"". Rick Gates - Paul Manafort's deputy - told the special counsel that Donald Trump Jr had announced ahead of the 9 June meeting at Trump Tower that he had ""a lead on negative information about the Clinton Foundation"". He said that morning meeting had been attended by several members of Trump's family - Don Jr, Eric, Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner - as well as Hope Hicks and Paul Manafort. Gates thought the information came from a group in Kyrgyzstan. ""According to Gates, Manafort warned the group that the meeting likely would not yield vital information and they should be careful,"" the report said. Allow Twitter content?

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation paints a decidedly mixed picture of President Donald Trump's conduct, both suspicious and exculpatory, that both sides of the political divide will seize upon. Mr Trump already has the result he insisted on from the outset: no collusion. While it is unclear if the document contains any ""smoking gun"" that might make impeachment proceedings against the president any more likely, there are enough potential red flags in there to keep congressional hearings ticking over for the remainder of his term in office.

Former FBI director James Comey The special counsel's report says that White House adviser Stephen Miller - who has reportedly been encouraging the president's increasingly hard-line stance on immigration recently - was behind Comey's firing letter. Trump apparently told his advisors at a dinner on 5 May that he wanted to fire Comey. According to notes Miller took at the time, Trump said the letter should start: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a Trump-Russia relationship pertaining to the 2016 presidential election, please be informed that I, and I believe the American public - including [Democrats] and [Republicans] - have lost faith in you as Director of the FBI."" Miller wrote the letter after dinner based on Trump's guidance, according to the report. White House adviser Stephen Miller ""You can be the President's defence attorney or America's attorney general, but you can't be both,"" Rep Eric Swalwell - a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful - said in a statement.

Before firing Comey, Trump had ""been assured"" that the FBI was not investigating him. He ""deemed it critically important to make public that he was not under investigation"" After firing Comey, Trump was aware of the obstruction of justice inquiry into his conduct and he ""launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President"". In private, he ""engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation"" - such as trying to remove the special counsel, pressuring Jeff Sessions to control the inquiry, preventing the leak of information about the Trump Tower meeting and using ""public forums to attack potential witnesses"".

Tensions high before Mueller report releaseThere is anger over the US attorney general's plans to hold a news conference before the release.US & Canada,"William Barr was chosen by Donald Trump to be US attorney general The US attorney general has been accused of ""waging a media campaign"" for President Donald Trump ahead of the Mueller report's long-awaited release. The 400-page report is the result of an investigation into alleged Russian interference during the 2016 election. William Barr is holding a news conference before it goes public. US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said there is now a ""crisis of confidence"" over Mr Barr's impartiality and independence. During his Thursday press conference, Mr Barr reiterated points made in an earlier summary in which he said Mr Mueller's report cleared Mr Trump of any collusion. However, he clarified Mr Mueller did not go as far as to completely exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. Live updates: US awaits Mueller report Viewpoint: 'Mueller called it (largely) on Trump' The best day of Trump's presidency Both Mr Trump's supporters and detractors are now eagerly awaiting the full - albeit redacted - report's release. It will be sent to Congress between 11:00 and midday local time (15:00 GMT and 16:00 GMT). It will be published online sometime after this. Speaking at a press conference before the release, Mr Barr described redactions to the report as ""limited"". He also confirmed Mr Trump's personal lawyers got a copy of the redacted report earlier this week and said members of congressional committees from both parties would be given almost completely unredacted copies to review. The report contains the findings of a 22-month investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign back in 2016. It was led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was chosen to run the investigation in 2017 following concerns from US intelligence agencies that Russia had tried to tip the election in Mr Trump's favour. The verdict on Mueller from Trump's heartland The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Who's who in the Trump-Russia saga? Mueller: America's most mysterious public figure He also looked into whether Mr Trump obstructed justice when he asked for the inquiry into former national security adviser Michael Flynn to end, and later fired FBI chief James Comey. Mr Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia - one of six former Trump aides and 30 other people, including 12 Russians, charged in connection with the investigation. So far all the public have seen of the report isthe four-page summary released by US Attorney General Barr. It contained Mr Mueller's main conclusions. The first, that Mr Trump did not collude with Russia during the 2016 campaign, and the second, that he did not completely exonerate him of the charge of obstructing justice. He said: ""While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" Exactly what this means is what many hope to discover with the release of the report on Thursday. But it may not be that easy to ascertain. The report has been redacted, with a colour-code indicating the reasons why. As a result, according to the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel, ""it might look more like a colouring book than a report"". Mr Trump and his supporters immediately jumped on the fact that no collusion was found. ""After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead. The collusion delusion is over,"" the president told a cheering crowd in Grand Rapids, Michigan, last month. This video can not be played Mueller report: One summary, two interpretations The Republican president has repeatedly described the investigation as ""a witch hunt"". However, he has not addressed the fact that the report does not completely clear him of the allegation of obstructing justice.

Mr Morton, 46, said: ""I came out the house and we were told to go back in. Around three police cars and a black van drove along the street and the traffic then stopped.

Thai rescue diver freed from cave,"Josh Bratchely asked for a pizza after being trapped underground for 28 hours One of the British divers who helped to save the Thai cave schoolboys had to be rescued from a cave himself after becoming trapped for 28 hours. Josh Bratchley had been exploring a flooded cave in Jackson County, Tennessee, when he failed to return to the surface on Tuesday. His fellow divers from the UK spent hours searching for their missing friend, but he was nowhere to be found. Expert divers found Mr Bratchley waiting calmly in an air pocket. The alarm was raised after Mr Bratchley failed to return to the surface at 15:00 local time (21:00 BST) on Tuesday. The authorities were notified in the early hours of Wednesday morning and expert divers were flown in from different US states. This video can not be played Josh Bratchley was rescued after being trapped in a flooded cave in the US for 28 hours They entered the 400ft cave system at about 18:00 local time, and Mr Bratchley was back on the surface about an hour later.

Crossrail 'could be delayed until 2021',"The Elizabeth Line had been due to open in December 2018 Crossrail could be delayed until 2021, according to a senior source associated with the project to build a new railway underneath central London. The east-west route, officially called the Elizabeth Line, will run between Reading and Shenfield in Essex and had been due to open in December 2018. Crossrail said testing of the trains and signalling was ""progressing well"". But sources told the BBC this phase - known as dynamic testing - was ""proving more difficult than was first thought"". The source said: ""It all depends on how dynamic testing goes between now and the end of this year."" ""The last quarter of this year will be a critical period for the testing."" Once dynamic testing is complete then trial runs will commence. This will effectively be a simulation of the timetable in real time. The source said, with the current state of the project in mind, a ""best case scenario"" would be the new Elizabeth Line opening in spring 2020. A ""middle probability case"" would be the summer of next year. ""A worst case is the spring of 2021."" Two other senior rail sources say this assessment is credible. It also tallies with one of the conclusions in a report written by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee which was published earlier this month. However, there is still uncertainty over when the scheme can be delivered because work to match a new signalling system in the 13-mile stretch of tunnel with software on the new trains is still ongoing. On top of the trains and signalling, all of the new stations along the route are incomplete. Paddington and Bond Street are the furthest behind. A delay to the project only first became public in the summer of last year, just weeks before the railway was supposed to open in December 2018. Crossrail is a new railway that will run beneath London from Reading and Heathrow in the west through central tunnels across to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. Construction began in 2009 and it is Europe's biggest infrastructure project - it had been due to open in December 2018 although last summer that was pushed back to autumn 2019. It has been officially named the Elizabeth Line in honour of the Queen and will serve 41 stations. An estimated 200 million passengers will use the new undergound line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes. Roger Ford at Modern Railways magazine said he believed the failure to come clean about the delay was symptomatic of how politically sensitive the project was. Both Transport for London and the Department for Transport are joint sponsors. ""It was probably a situation where people don't report upwards for fear of getting shot."" He said he believed ""everyone is to blame"" and the fact that the new management had taken several months to assess the scale of the delay ""shows how bad it was"". This video can not be played How to fly a drone through Crossrail's tunnels If there is a further significant delay it will almost inevitably cost more money. In 2010 the budget for Crossrail was scaled back slightly to Â£14.8bn. But when the initial delay became public last year that figure rose to Â£17.6bn. Much of that additional money has been lent to Transport for London by the government. Whitehall officials insist London will ultimately have to cover the extra cost, not UK taxpayers elsewhere. Crossrail to miss December opening date TfL 'removed' Crossrail delay warnings Lack of accountability over Crossrail delay In a statement, Crossrail said London needed the line to be ""completed as quickly as possible and brought into service for passengers"". ""We are working very hard to finalise our new plan to deliver the opening at the earliest opportunity and we will be providing more details later this month.""

HIV used to cure 'bubble boy' disease,"Gael, a patient at St Jude Children's Research Hospital who received treatment, with his mother US scientists say they used HIV to make a gene therapy that cured eight infants of severe combined immunodeficiency, or ""bubble boy"" disease. Results of the research, developed at a Tennessee hospital, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The babies, born with little to no immune protection, now have fully functional immune systems. Untreated babies with this disorder have to live in completely sterile conditions and tend to die as infants. The gene therapy involved collecting the babies' bone marrow and correcting the genetic defect in their DNA soon after their birth. David Vetter, who came to be known in the 1970s as the bubble boy The ""correct"" gene - used to fix the defect - was inserted into an altered version of one of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Researchers said most of the babies were discharged from the hospital within one month. Dr Ewelina Mamcarz of St Jude, an author of the study, saidin a statement,external: ""These patients are toddlers now, who are responding to vaccinations and have immune systems to make all immune cells they need for protection from infections as they explore the world and live normal lives."" ""This is a first for patients with SCID-X1,"" she added, referring to the most common type of SCID. The patients were treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco. Bubble baby gene therapy 'worth the risk' Gene therapy 'success' revealed 'Bubble boy' celebrates 10 years The case of David Vetter is perhaps the most famous case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a disease that made it impossible for him to engage with the world outside a plastic chamber. Nicknamed ""Bubble Boy"", Vetter was born in 1971 with the disease and died at the age of 12 after a failed bone marrow transplant. Within 20 seconds of his birth at the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, he was placed in a plastic isolation chamber, where he lived until the age of six when he was given a special plastic suit designed by Nasa, the US space agency. His parents had already lost one child to the disease before he was born. Currently, the best treatment for SCID-XI is a bone marrow transplant with a tissue-matched sibling donor. But according to St Jude, more than 80% of these patients lack such donors and must rely on blood stem cells from other donors. This process is less likely to cure the bubble boy disease, and is more likely to cause serious side effects as a result of treatment. Previous advancements in gene therapy provided alternatives to a bone marrow transplant, but these treatments sometimes involved chemotherapy and had implications for a range of other diseases, including blood disorders, sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia, and metabolic syndrome.

Tensions rise ahead of Mueller report release,"William Barr was chosen by Donald Trump to be US attorney general The US attorney general has been accused of ""waging a media campaign"" for President Donald Trump ahead of the Mueller report's long-awaited release. The 400-page report is the result of an investigation into alleged Russian interference during the 2016 election. William Barr is holding a news conference before it goes public. US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said there is now a ""crisis of confidence"" over Mr Barr's impartiality and independence. During his Thursday press conference, Mr Barr reiterated points made in an earlier summary in which he said Mr Mueller's report cleared Mr Trump of any collusion. However, he clarified Mr Mueller did not go as far as to completely exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. Live updates: US awaits Mueller report Viewpoint: 'Mueller called it (largely) on Trump' The best day of Trump's presidency Both Mr Trump's supporters and detractors are now eagerly awaiting the full - albeit redacted - report's release. It will be sent to Congress between 11:00 and midday local time (15:00 GMT and 16:00 GMT). It will be published online sometime after this. Speaking at a press conference before the release, Mr Barr described redactions to the report as ""limited"". He also confirmed Mr Trump's personal lawyers got a copy of the redacted report earlier this week and said members of congressional committees from both parties would be given almost completely unredacted copies to review. The report contains the findings of a 22-month investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign back in 2016. It was led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was chosen to run the investigation in 2017 following concerns from US intelligence agencies that Russia had tried to tip the election in Mr Trump's favour. The verdict on Mueller from Trump's heartland The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Who's who in the Trump-Russia saga? Mueller: America's most mysterious public figure He also looked into whether Mr Trump obstructed justice when he asked for the inquiry into former national security adviser Michael Flynn to end, and later fired FBI chief James Comey. Mr Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia - one of six former Trump aides and 30 other people, including 12 Russians, charged in connection with the investigation. So far all the public have seen of the report isthe four-page summary released by US Attorney General Barr. It contained Mr Mueller's main conclusions. The first, that Mr Trump did not collude with Russia during the 2016 campaign, and the second, that he did not completely exonerate him of the charge of obstructing justice. He said: ""While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" Exactly what this means is what many hope to discover with the release of the report on Thursday. But it may not be that easy to ascertain. The report has been redacted, with a colour-code indicating the reasons why. As a result, according to the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel, ""it might look more like a colouring book than a report"". Mr Trump and his supporters immediately jumped on the fact that no collusion was found. ""After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead. The collusion delusion is over,"" the president told a cheering crowd in Grand Rapids, Michigan, last month. This video can not be played Mueller report: One summary, two interpretations The Republican president has repeatedly described the investigation as ""a witch hunt"". However, he has not addressed the fact that the report does not completely clear him of the allegation of obstructing justice. Ahead of the release on Thursday the president posted a flurry of tweets, in which he described the investigation as the ""greatest political hoax of all time"" and said it constituted ""harassment"".

Leading Democrats have called for the Mueller report to be published in full, and pledged to make use of the party's majority control of committees in the House of Representatives to continue investigating the president. Eight other legal headaches for the president They have also raised concerns over Mr Barr's handling of the report since Mr Mueller's team handed it to the Justice Department. A joint statement, signed by the Democratic chairs of five House committees, said the press conference was ""unnecessary and inappropriate, and appears designed to shape public perceptions of the report before anyone can read it"". ""Rather than letting the facts of the report speak for themselves, the Attorney General has taken unprecedented steps to spin Mueller's nearly two-year investigation,"" Mr Nadler, who is the House Judiciary Committee chairman, added while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. Mr Schumer has said the ""American people deserve to hear the truth"" and has called on Mr Mueller to testify personally.

Mental health unit restraint 'shocking',"David Fong says this photo, taken in 2013, was a result of being restrained in Carseview An NHS mental health unit in Dundee restrained patients by pinning them down for too long and in a dangerous position, according to a leaked report. The internal inquiry into the Carseview Centre was commissioned in response to a BBC Scotland documentary last year. It exposed bullying and potentially life-threatening restraint on patients. Prof Peter Tyrer, who chaired the group that wrote the NICE guidelines on restraint in mental health, said the report was ""shocking"". ""I've seen reports like this before but not quite as damning as this,"" he said. Patients 'pinned to floor' and 'bullied' The report has not been made public but has been seen by the BBC. It found that untrained staff were carrying out risky restraints on patients and that the number of restraints was high. It said face-down, and particularly face down in a prone position, are the highest tariff interventions of physical restraint, and the most dangerous techniques to deploy. Carseview Centre was the focus of a BBC documentary last year The report looked at a sample of 40 cases and found more than half were patients being restrained face down on the floor for longer than 30 minutes. The longest restraint was one hour and 45 minutes. ""That is completely against all guidelines,"" Prof Tyrer said. ""You may have to do things for five minutes or up to 10 minutes but to go beyond 40 minutes there is something badly wrong in the organisation of a unit if that is allowed to continue."" Prof Peter Tyrer chaired the group which wrote the guidelines on how to handle mental health patients Carseview is a hospital to care for patients with mental illness from depression and anxiety to schizophrenia and psychosis. In July last year, BBC Scotland broadcast allegations by patients of bullying by staff, illegal drug-taking and being pinned to the floor unnecessarily. Experts called it abusive and said the unit should be closed down. NHS Tayside responded by commissioning an internal report into Carseview to go alongside independent reports into mental health in Tayside. The internal report says a whistleblower has come forward and accused Carseview of ""very serious concerns over leadership, safety and malpractice"". The internal report has not been seen by the public It came up with 11 recommended actions including urgent action on staff training and critical action on illegal drugs on the ward. It said the restraint policy should emphasise the safety of patients as well as staff and that the culture of the unit should be ""based around the caring and compassionate leadership approach"". NHS Tayside said the recommendations covering patient care and culture were ""now being progressed"". Prof Peter Stonebridge, acting medical director for NHS Tayside, said a ""steering group has been established"" to focus on restrictive care practices, including the reduction of face-down restraint. Joy Duxbury said there seemed to be a toxic environment at the unit Joy Duxbury, professor of mental health at Manchester Metropolitan University, told BBC Scotland: ""I think this is a terribly toxic environment. ""The figures on physical restraint are exceptionally worrying. ""These are very vulnerable clients who are being restrained, in my view, unnecessarily and by far too many staff in too many situations. ""For me, given what we know about psychological and physical trauma of the use of restraint in such setting, this is of significant concern."" Marnie Stirling said the unit was supposed to be about recovery not punishment Marnie Stirling, who had two stays in Carseview with anxiety and depression, spoke to the BBC documentary last year. Reacting to the report, she said: ""If you think about mental health, it's supposed to be about recovery. This isn't recovery, it's further punishment for people."" David Fong spent a month in the unit after experiencing psychosis in 2013. He claimed staff used restraint violently and repeatedly during his time there. His mother Lorraine said: ""This is a total and utter disgrace that this has gone on for seven years and maybe longer."" David told BBC Scotland that staff were quick to see frustration and anger arising from detainment as aggression. ""Staff are too keen to initiate restraint and offer little or no de-escalation when no actual aggression has been displayed by the patient,"" he said. Former patient David Fong said he had his face rubbed along the floor during restraint ""I ask how many of these restraints were actually needed and if some are instigated by staff rather than patients? ""I personally was physically assaulted with the application of intense pain through twisting of arms, wrists and fingers or a member of staff's knee being dug into my back, had my face rubbed into the floor causing loss of skin from my face, and had verbal abuse screamed at me during restraint. ""I also could not have been the only patient that these tactics were being used upon."" A separate report looking at the patient experiences came up with separate 23 recommendations in December. It is feeding into an independent inquiry, which was announced in the Scottish Parliament last year, and is still ongoing.

Man caught with petrol in NYC cathedral,"St Patrick's is a Catholic cathedral in Manhattan built in the 19th Century A man has been arrested after walking into New York's St Patrick's Cathedral carrying two full petrol cans, lighter fluid and lighters, police say. They say guards confronted the 37-year-old as he entered the Manhattan church on Wednesday evening. He spilt gasoline on the ground and officers took him into custody. Deputy police commissioner John Miller noted that the ""suspicious"" incident occurred just two days after a fire gutted Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. St Patrick's is the seat of New York's Roman Catholic archdiocese. ""An individual walking into an iconic location like St Patrick's cathedral carrying over four gallons of gasoline, two bottles of lighter fluid and lighters, is something we would have grave concern over,"" Mr Miller told reporters. The NYPD deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism however said it was ""too early to say"" whether terrorism was a motive. How Notre-Dame became the heart of France Notre-Dame: The story of the fire in graphics When confronted outside the cathedral, the man told officers his vehicle had run out of fuel and he was cutting through the cathedral to get to it. He was arrested when police checked the van and saw it was not out of petrol. ""We don't know what his mindset was,"" Mr Miller said. Investigators in Paris say renovation works at Notre-Dame could have accidentally sparked Monday's fire. The disaster has led toa surge in fundraising for black churches destroyed by an arsonist in the USearlier this year. A 21-year-old accused of burning down three African-American churches in Louisianawas on Tuesday charged with hate crimes.

Facebook copied 1.5m users' email contacts,"Facebook ""unintentionally"" uploaded the email contacts of more than 1.5 million users without asking permission to do so, the social network has admitted. The data harvesting happened via a system used to verify the identity of new members, Facebook asked new users to supply the password for their email account, and took a copy of their contacts. Facebook said it had now changed the way it handled new users to stop contacts being uploaded. All those users whose contacts were taken would be notified and all the contacts it had grabbed without consent would be deleted, it said. The information grabbed is believed to have been used by Facebook to help map social and personal connections between users. Anyone who, like me, joined Facebook a decade or more ago, probably clicked ""yes"" when invited to upload all of their contacts. It seemed a good way of making the network more useful and, after all, what could be the harm? But after the various data scandals shattered trust in Facebook, we've become far more cautious. We've woken up to the harms that could come from handing over that precious information about our social connections - for journalists it could mean revealing their contacts, for whistleblowers their dealings with regulators, for just about anyone their contacts with people they might not want their partners to know about. Now we know that Facebook somehow scraped up the email contacts of 1.5 million people over a three year period without their agreement. Now every time the social network suggests ""people you may know"", we will wonder ""How do you know that I may know them?"" To many, the idea that they should trust Facebook with their data seems more old-fashioned by the day. Contacts started being taken without consent in May 2016,the company told Business Insider,external, which broke the story. Before this date, new users were asked if they wanted to verify their identity via their email account. They were also asked if they wanted to upload their address book voluntarily. This option and the text specifying that contacts were being grabbed was changed in May 2016 but the underlying code that actually scraped contacts was left intact, said Facebook. Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner, which oversees Facebook in Europe, is engaged with the firm to understand what happened and its consequences. Rep Ocasio Cortez said social media was a 'health risk' The email contacts case is the latest in a long series in which Facebook has mishandled the data of some of its billions of users. In late March, Facebook found that the passwords of about600 million users were stored internallyin plain text for months. The ongoing breaches and other criticisms of Facebook are also prompting some high-profile users to bow out. The latest is Democrat Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who saidshe had ""quit"" the social network.,external In an interview with aYahoo News podcast,externalshe said: ""I personally gave up Facebook, which was kind of a big deal because I started my campaign on Facebook."" She added that social media posed a ""public health risk"".

'Struggling' Love Island star took own lifeFormer beauty queen Sophie Gradon was found dead by her boyfriend who killed himself days later.Tyne & Wear,"Sophie Gradon was crowned Miss Newcastle and Miss Great Britain in 2009 A former beauty queen and Love Island star took cocaine and alcohol and then killed herself, an inquest has found. Star of the ITV2 dating show Sophie Gradon hanged herself at her family home in Medburn, Ponteland on 20 June. The 32-year-old was found by her boyfriend Aaron Armstrong, 25, whotook his own life 20 days later. Northumberland South coroner Eric Armstrong said he was ""certain she would not have acted as she did without taking alcohol and cocaine"". Mr Armstrong told North Shields Coroner's Court research in the USA suggested someone was 16 times more likely to take their life if they consumed both. ""The combination is used by those who believe it brings on a so-called high much quicker,"" he said. ""What they do not appreciate is it also gives rise to violent thoughts. ""If Sophie's death is to serve any purpose at all, that message must go out far and wide."" Love Island 'must open its eyes' Love Island aftercare 'can't last forever' Aftercare is 'industry-wide failing' Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton said Ms Gradon was two-and-a-half times the drink-drive limit and under the influence of cocaine. Det Sgt Neill Jobling of Northumbria Police told the hearing Ms Gradon had been exchanging messages with a male friend into the early hours of the day she died. In them she said she had had suicidal thoughts, that she was ""struggling with the world"" and every day with ADHD, and she ""cannot do this any more"". In another message sent at 01:44 BST she said: ""I would never want to do that to my family but if I could escape I would."" She had alcohol and cocaine in her system which increased the likelihood of violent thoughts and actions, Det Sgt Jobling said. Aaron Armstrong died 20 days after his girlfriend Sophie Gradon Ms Gradon, who had more than 400,000 followers on Instagram, was crowned Miss Newcastle and Miss Great Britain in 2009 and appeared on Love Island in 2016. She had been diagnosed with depression and low self-esteem in 2013 and was taking medication for social anxiety disorder at the time of her death, Det Sgt Jobling said. The inquest heard she was found hanging in the living room of her parents' home by Mr Armstrong and his brother. Mr Armstrong attempted CPR for 15 minutes but quickly realised she was dead. He had become concerned after not receiving any messages from his girlfriend during the day. The pair had been exchanging messages until after 02:00 but when he woke up after 11:00 he got no reply from messages or phone calls. Mr Armstrong had been in a relationship with the former beauty queen since May 2018 after meeting her on a night out in Newcastle. He killed himself days after her death, a coroner at his inquest found. The coroner said Mr Armstrong's thinking could have been ""muddled"" by her death.

Samsung's folding phone breaks for reviewers,"Samsung's folding phone was shown off for the first time earlier this year Earlier this week, Samsung sent out its remarkable new folding smartphone to a number of media outlets,including the BBC.

Samsung said it had received ""a few reports"" of damage to the main display, and would ""thoroughly inspect these units in person to determine the cause of the matter"". But itâs a significant setback to the companyâs hopes of wowing the world with what, at first glance, was a very impressive feat of engineering. It appears one explanation for the problems is that some reviewers removed a film that went over the screen, thinking it was the typical protective layer you find on all new smartphones to keep the screen in good condition until you buy it. Bloombergâs Mark Gurman removed his, as did the highly-regarded YouTube reviewer, Marques Brownlee. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Steve Kovach, however, didnât remove the film - and said he still had major issues. The device the BBC handled, incidentally, was taken away by Samsung shortly after filming was finished, so our team hasnât had a chance to see these issues for ourselves. Our reviewer Chris Fox said the way the screen folded together - leaving a small gap - made him nervous about accidents that might occur with small objects. But if the device struggles to this degree in the hands of seasoned reviewers, the return-rate could be huge, if and when it goes on sale to the wider public. Remember, this is a $2,000 smartphone. The reviewers having problems insist thereâs been no rough-handling of the devices. ""Whatever happened, it certainly wasnât because I have treated this phone badly,""wrote Mr Bohn at The Verge,external. ""Iâve done normal phone stuff, like opening and closing the hinge and putting it in my pocket. We did stick a tiny piece of moulding clay on the back of the phone yesterday to prop it up for a video shoot, which is something we do in every phone video shoot.â Samsung stole headlines from its competitors by getting its apparently consumer-ready device out there quicker than anyone, a technological two-fingers in the direction of Huawei, the Chinese firm breathing down Samsungâs neck in the smartphone game.

Bone 'shows rabbits were in UK in Roman era',"A bone from a rabbit found at Fishbourne Roman Palace Rabbits have been hopping around the UK since Roman times, experts have been able to prove for the first time. Scientific tests on a rabbit bone, found at Fishbourne Roman Palace in West Sussex, have shown the animal was alive in the first century AD. The 1.6in (4cm) piece of a tibia bone was found in 1964 but it remained in a box until 2017, when a zooarchaeologist realised that it came from a rabbit. Academics believe the animal could have been kept as an exotic pet. Analysis, including radiocarbon dating, was carried out by researchers at the universities of Exeter, Oxford and Leicester. Rabbits are native to Spain and France and it had been thought they were introduced to Britain during the medieval period. Prof Naomi Sykes, from the University of Exeter, said there have been many previous claims of discoveries of Roman rabbits, and even some from the Bronze Age, but they had not been backed up by evidence. ""The bone fragment was very small, meaning it was overlooked for decades, and modern research techniques mean we can learn about its date and genetic background as well,"" she said. Researchers say they believe the rabbit was kept as a pet, as the signature in its bones suggests it ate its own faecal pellets. ""When they are in a hutch they tend to eat their own poo, and that gives them a really interesting signature in their bones, wild rabbits don't do that to the same extent,"" said Prof Sykes. She added: ""This is a tremendously exciting discovery and this very early rabbit is already revealing new insights into the history of the Easter traditions."" The Easter Bunny is part of an annual Easter tradition at the White House It is not clear when, why or how the rabbit became linked to Easter. Rabbits usually give birth to a big litter of babies (called kittens), and so they became a symbol of new life. The first historical mention of an ""Easter Bunny"" is actually an Easter hare, and was found in a German text from 1682. Some believe the association is due to the spread ofChristian religious beliefs and Paganism, when Emperor Constantine merged Pagan rituals with Christian festivals. The story of the Easter Bunny is thought to have become common in the 19th Century. Prof Sykes says that during the Victorian period hare proportions were really low, whereas the rabbit proportions were ""really really high"", which could explain how the hare was ditched for rabbits. Rabbits are the third most popular pet choice, behind cats and dogs,according to PDSA Animal Wellbeing Report 2018.,external It estimates one million are kept as pets in the country. They typically live for eight to 12 years, the RSPCA says. However,the Rabbit Welfare Association and Fund,externalsays rabbits are among the most abused and neglected pets in the country because some owners don't realise what's involved before taking them on. Root vegetables aren't a natural part of a rabbit's diet - carrots are high in sugar so should only be fed occasionally and in small amounts A rabbit hop - when they jump and twist, and kick their feet - is called a binky They can turn their ears 180 degrees, enabling them to pinpoint the exact location of a sound Bunnies have almost 360 degree vision but they are born with their eyes shut Rabbits are banned from some ferries, such as Brittany Ferries. It is believed the superstition against rabbits on ships dates back to the 17th century when - legend has it - a rabbit being carried for food chewed through the hull of a ship, causing the deaths of many sailors Source: Blue Cross,external Jane Bramley, 64, from Pontefract, west Yorkshire, has been breeding rabbits for more than 30 years and says the animals played a big part in helping her overcome two serious illnesses. She was diagnosed with cancer aged 30, shortly after the birth of her son, and it was during her recovery from life-saving surgery that her interest in rabbits started. Jane with two of her rabbits, Spencer and Geneva After taking over a pet shop, she thought she could make some extra money by breeding and selling rabbits. ""Having such a positive hobby to focus my energy on really boosted my recovery,"" she said. Ten years later when she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, she says her rabbits once again aided her recovery.

""I had to get out of bed every day to go and see them. ""I feel very strongly that my rabbits are therapy and I have devoted my life to them.""

AMs told to cut 'homophobic' pastor ties,"Pastor Yang Tuck Yoong (left), Montgomeryshire AM Russell George (above right) and Clwyd West AM Darren Millar (below right) Two assembly members have been urged to sever their links with a controversial pastor who claimed homosexuality is a ""sin"". Yang Tuck Yoong called homosexuality an ""abomination"" during a sermon. Darren Millar and Russell George are trustees of the Evan Roberts Institute which has financial links with the pastor's Cornerstone Community Church. They say they do not share his views but human rights campaigners are calling for all ties to be cut. The pastor was reported to police in 2013 after saying: ""Homosexuality is a sin and it is far more rampant, militant and organised than most of us actually believe it to be."" He also called on the church to ""rise up and take a stand"". The Pisgah chapel in Loughor was brought back to life with money from the pastor's Cornerstone Community Church It has emerged the Pentecostal minister and his church in Singapore have strong ties with Welsh charity, The Evan Roberts Institute. Named after the Welsh revivalist, the institute was formed in 2013 to safeguard sites of religious and spiritual significance in Wales. In 2014 it bought Pisgah chapel in Loughor, Swansea, which had been earmarked for demolition. However the refurbishment work was paid for by Cornerstone Community Church. Mr Yang's church was also granted a 50-year lease by the institute. Peter Tatchell have said the pastors views were ""out of touch"" with public opinion in Wales Clwyd West AM Mr Millar, who helped finance the original Â£20,000 purchase with a loan, visited Asia in 2015 to meet with the leaders of Cornerstone Community Church, according to the institute's annual report. And he ""thanked God"" for Pastor Yang's support for another religious project in Wales, the purchase of the Bible College of Wales. However the pastor's comments have angered human rights groups. Campaigner Peter Tatchell said the views are ""not compatible with humanitarian values"". Religious Studies GCSE- Homosexuality and different faiths - BBC Teach Anti-gay adverts target pink rally - BBC News Clooney calls for Brunei hotels boycott He added: ""The Evans Roberts Institute should not be associated with him or his church in any way. ""These AMs should either stand down from the institute or make sure it has broken all ties with the pastor."" The institute and both Conservative AMs said they do not support the views of Mr Yang on homosexuality. The Welsh Conservatives said they do not condone homophobia or discrimination ""of any sort"". Cai Wilshaw said the politicians should consider standing down if they do not cut all ties with the pastor However Cai Wilshaw of Pink News, which provides news for the LGBT community in the UK and worldwide, described the comments as ""dangerous"". ""The pastor's views are not only homophobic but dangerously so when you think of the message it sends to, for example, a child in Wales who is being bullied for their sexual orientation or gender identity,"" he said. ""It's completely unacceptable for these politicians to have social, financial and legal links with someone who has such dangerous extremist views. ""Cutting those links don't go far enough. They must (act) in the same way they want to be represented in their constituencies. ""If they're not willing to educate themselves about LGBT rights then they should think about resigning."" Welsh Labour AM Jeremy Miles added: ""I'd support calls for Darren Millar and Russell George to sever their links with the pastor. I hope they will reflect on the message it sends to young people in their constituencies. ""Having faith and being gay are not incompatible. Drawing strength from faith should give us a rich understanding of humanity. And remind us that we are all different but equal.""

Thai cave rescue diver freed from cave,"Josh Bratchely asked for a pizza after being trapped underground for 28 hours One of the British divers who helped to save the Thai cave schoolboys had to be rescued from a cave himself after becoming trapped for 28 hours. Josh Bratchley had been exploring a flooded cave in Jackson County, Tennessee, when he failed to return to the surface on Tuesday. His fellow divers from the UK spent hours searching for their missing friend, but he was nowhere to be found. Expert divers found Mr Bratchley waiting calmly in an air pocket. The alarm was raised after Mr Bratchley failed to return to the surface at 15:00 local time (21:00 BST) on Tuesday. The authorities were notified in the early hours of Wednesday morning and expert divers were flown in from different US states. This video can not be played Josh Bratchley was rescued after being trapped in a flooded cave in the US for 28 hours They entered the 400ft cave system at about 18:00 local time, and Mr Bratchley was back on the surface about an hour later.

At least 29 dead in Madeira bus crash,"This video can not be played The bus plunged off a road and overturned near houses At least 29 people have died after a bus carrying German tourists plunged off a road and overturned on the Portuguese island of Madeira. Another 27 were injured in the accident near the town of CaniÃ§o. The accident happened at 18:30 (17:30 GMT) when the driver lost control of the bus at a junction and went off the road, according to Portuguese news agency Lusa. Pictures show how the vehicle stopped just short of destroying a house. ""I have no words to describe what happened. I cannot face the suffering of these people,"" the mayor of CaniÃ§o, Filipe Sousa, told broadcaster SIC TV. He said all the tourists on the bus were German but some local people could also be among the casualties. Eleven of the fatalities were men and 17 women, Mr Sousa added. The bus was reported to be carrying 55 passengers, as well as the driver and a tour guide. Another woman later died of her injuries in hospital. The vice-president of Madeira's regional government Pedro Calado said the bus met safety standards and so it was ""premature to talk about what caused the crash"". The bus appeared to have rolled down a hillside Ambulances ferried the injured to hospital An investigation into the crash has been launched, with the bus company, Madeira Automobile Society (SAM), saying it has a ""deep commitment"" to finding out exactly what happened, local newspaper Diario de Noticias Madeira reported. According to reports, the vehicle was only five or six years old and the driver was experienced. The scene of the crash has been sealed off and the injured transferred to a hospital in the island's capital, Funchal, Lusa said. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is flying to the island to visit the scene, the agency said. Prime Minister Antonio Costa has sent a message of condolence to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Reuters reported. The German government spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted: ""Our deep sorrow goes to all those who lost their lives in the bus accident, our thoughts are with the injured.""

Facebook swiped 1.5m users' email contacts,"Facebook ""unintentionally"" uploaded the email contacts of more than 1.5 million users without asking permission to do so, the social network has admitted. The data harvesting happened via a system used to verify the identity of new members, Facebook asked new users to supply the password for their email account, and took a copy of their contacts. Facebook said it had now changed the way it handled new users to stop contacts being uploaded. All those users whose contacts were taken would be notified and all the contacts it had grabbed without consent would be deleted, it said. The information grabbed is believed to have been used by Facebook to help map social and personal connections between users. Anyone who, like me, joined Facebook a decade or more ago, probably clicked ""yes"" when invited to upload all of their contacts. It seemed a good way of making the network more useful and, after all, what could be the harm? But after the various data scandals shattered trust in Facebook, we've become far more cautious. We've woken up to the harms that could come from handing over that precious information about our social connections - for journalists it could mean revealing their contacts, for whistleblowers their dealings with regulators, for just about anyone their contacts with people they might not want their partners to know about. Now we know that Facebook somehow scraped up the email contacts of 1.5 million people over a three year period without their agreement. Now every time the social network suggests ""people you may know"", we will wonder ""How do you know that I may know them?"" To many, the idea that they should trust Facebook with their data seems more old-fashioned by the day. Contacts started being taken without consent in May 2016,the company told Business Insider,external, which broke the story. Before this date, new users were asked if they wanted to verify their identity via their email account. They were also asked if they wanted to upload their address book voluntarily. This option and the text specifying that contacts were being grabbed was changed in May 2016 but the underlying code that actually scraped contacts was left intact, said Facebook. Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner, which oversees Facebook in Europe, is engaged with the firm to understand what happened and its consequences. Rep Ocasio Cortez said social media was a 'health risk' The email contacts case is the latest in a long series in which Facebook has mishandled the data of some of its billions of users. In late March, Facebook found that the passwords of about600 million users were stored internallyin plain text for months. The ongoing breaches and other criticisms of Facebook are also prompting some high-profile users to bow out. The latest is Democrat Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who saidshe had ""quit"" the social network.,external In an interview with aYahoo News podcast,externalshe said: ""I personally gave up Facebook, which was kind of a big deal because I started my campaign on Facebook.""

North Korea claims test of 'new weapon',"Mike Pompeo (R) travelled to Pyongyang four times last year North Korea has demanded the removal of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from nuclear talks, accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and being ""reckless"". A senior foreign ministry official said that further talks would be ""lousy"" if Mr Pompeo was involved, asking that he be replaced by someone ""more careful"". It comes after North Korea said it had tested a new ""tactical guided weapon"". The test is the first since a February summit in Hanoi between the countries' leaders ended without an agreement. Mr Pompeo visited North Korea four times last year - including for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Last week, during a US Senate subcommittee hearing, Mr Pompeo was asked if he would agree with descriptions of Mr Kim as a ""tyrant"", he then responded: ""Sure, I'm sure I've said that."" This was met with a strong reaction from North Korean foreign ministry official Kwon Jong-gun, who said that Mr Pompeo ""spouted reckless remarks, hurting the dignity of our supreme leadership... to unveil his mean character"". Mr Kwon also blamed Mr Pompeo for the abrupt ending to the Hanoi summit. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? On Thursday, he said that if Mr Pompeo were to be involved in further talks, ""the table will be lousy once again and the talks will become entangled"". ""Even in the case of possible resumption of dialogue with the US, I wish our dialogue counterpart would not be Pompeo but... [another] person who is more careful and mature in communicating with us,"" Mr Kwon said, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). During discussions in Pyongyang in July,Mr Pompeo was condemned for his ""gangster-like"" insistence that the country move towards denuclearisation. State media has given few details on Thursday's reported test of a new ""tactical guided weapon"", but analysts say it is unlikely to be a return to the long-range missile tests seen as a threat to the US. According to KCNA, the test was overseen by Mr Kim himself. It said the test was ""conducted in various modes of firing at different targets"", which analysts believe means the weapon could be launched from land, sea or air. Kim Jong-un attending a flight training of Korean People's Army Air Force on April 16 It is unclear if the weapon was a missile, but most observers agree that it was probably a short-range weapon. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea North Korea crisis in 300 words Last year, Mr Kim said he would stop nuclear testing and would no longer launch intercontinental ballistic missiles. Nuclear activity appears to be continuing, however, and satellite images at North Korea's main nuclear site last week showed movement, suggesting the country could be reprocessing radioactive material into bomb fuel. The country claims it has developed a nuclear bomb small enough to fit on a long-range missile, as well as ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the mainland US. This launch was fairly low-key by North Korean standards. It doesn't appear to be a long-range missile, nor was it a nuclear test. This means Kim Jong-un can say he's keeping his promise not to fire these weapons - while developing new ones. Perhaps it's not a direct challenge to Donald Trump. But it could be designed to provoke some thought in the White House and warn them of what could follow if a deal isn't done soon. The current thinking in Washington seems to be that as long as there's no testing, and the sanctions remain in place, there's no rush. The US also seems to be under the impression that it's holding all the cards in this negotiation. This launch is a reminder that North Korea is continuing to create weapons despite facing tough economic sanctions. Pyongyang appears to be shrugging and saying, pressure? What pressure?! Let's not forget that these launches send a message to the people of North Korea. There are reports that the state is facing food shortages. Kim Jong-un needs to rally his people and his resources.  A show of military strength and a reminder that they face a common enemy will aid that cause. The test may also ensure North Korea's military capabilities remain near the top of Mr Trump's intelligence briefings. As he heads into an election year, he won't want to see headlines on a series of missile tests - a problem the US president claimed to have solved. Very little has moved since the US and North Korean leaders walked out of talks in Hanoi - apart from rhetoric. The North Korea and US summit in Vietnam in February ended without agreement The US said talks broke down because North Korea wanted all sanctions lifted in exchange for scaling back its nuclear capacity, but Pyongyang disputes that. In his most recent comments, Mr Kim urged Mr Trump to pursue a deal that was ""mutually acceptable"" but also spoke of his excellent ties with the US leader. Mr Trump responded by tweeting generous praise of Mr Kim and also welcomed the idea of another summit. Earlier this week the State Department announced that Stephen Biegun, its special envoy for North Korea, was heading to Moscow for meetings ""with Russian officials to discuss efforts to advance the final, fully verified"" denuclearisation of North Korea. It came as speculation of a possible future meeting between Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin intensified. What missiles has North Korea been testing?

Glasgow to limit number of taxis and cabs,"Glasgow City Council is set to take steps to limit the number of new taxis and private hire cabs. The council says it may start turning down applications for new vehicle licences because there are too many taxis and cabs on the road. There are currently 1,420 taxis and almost 3,900 licensed private cabs. The policy is designed to ensure work is not spread too thinly between existing drivers. Applications to renew existing licences will not be affected. Personal licenses - that is, the certificate required to become a driver in a vehicle with an existing license - will also be unaffected. The council was always free to turn down applications for new taxi licences but the new policy makes this explicit. Until recently, licence applications for private hire cabs could only be turned down if the person or company was deemed unsuitable - the number of cabs on the road was not a consideration. Glasgow believes it is the first Scottish council to set upper and lower limits for the number of black cabs and licensed private hire vehicles. In Glasgow, all licensed taxis are black Hackney vehicles. Mayor of London calls for power to limit minicab numbers City of Edinburgh Council currently has a limit on the number of taxi licences but not on the number of private hire licences. The council says there should be: Between 1,278 and 1,420 black taxis Between 3,195 and 3,759 licensed private hire vehicles The numbers are based on research carried out for the council into the demand for taxis and private hire cabs. The council aims to ensure there is a sustainable business for taxis and cabs. However, average figures disguise peaks and troughs - for instance extra demand after a major concert, busy weekend evenings and bad weather. Black taxis can use ranks and pick up customers who hail them off the street. A licensed private hire cab can only accept advance bookings. McDonald's, UberEats and Wetherspoon workers strike over pay Deliveroo reveals big rise in rider numbers Taxis charge fares which are regulated by the council. Licensed private cabs set their own fares so there is competition between different operators. The new policy will not result in a direct cut in the number of taxis and cabs. However the expectation is that the number might fall over time as existing licensees give them up naturally. Some taxi drivers have expressed concern about the amount of trade available in the city, blaming factors such as economic uncertainty.

Facebook scraped email contacts of users,"Facebook ""unintentionally"" uploaded the email contacts of more than 1.5 million users without asking permission to do so, the social network has admitted. The data harvesting happened via a system used to verify the identity of new members, Facebook asked new users to supply the password for their email account, and took a copy of their contacts. Facebook said it had now changed the way it handled new users to stop contacts being uploaded. All those users whose contacts were taken would be notified and all the contacts it had grabbed without consent would be deleted, it said. The information grabbed is believed to have been used by Facebook to help map social and personal connections between users. Anyone who, like me, joined Facebook a decade or more ago, probably clicked ""yes"" when invited to upload all of their contacts. It seemed a good way of making the network more useful and, after all, what could be the harm? But after the various data scandals shattered trust in Facebook, we've become far more cautious. We've woken up to the harms that could come from handing over that precious information about our social connections - for journalists it could mean revealing their contacts, for whistleblowers their dealings with regulators, for just about anyone their contacts with people they might not want their partners to know about. Now we know that Facebook somehow scraped up the email contacts of 1.5 million people over a three year period without their agreement. Now every time the social network suggests ""people you may know"", we will wonder ""How do you know that I may know them?"" To many, the idea that they should trust Facebook with their data seems more old-fashioned by the day. Contacts started being taken without consent in May 2016,the company told Business Insider,external, which broke the story. Before this date, new users were asked if they wanted to verify their identity via their email account. They were also asked if they wanted to upload their address book voluntarily. This option and the text specifying that contacts were being grabbed was changed in May 2016 but the underlying code that actually scraped contacts was left intact, said Facebook. Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner, which oversees Facebook in Europe, is engaged with the firm to understand what happened and its consequences. Rep Ocasio Cortez said social media was a 'health risk' The email contacts case is the latest in a long series in which Facebook has mishandled the data of some of its billions of users. In late March, Facebook found that the passwords of about600 million users were stored internallyin plain text for months. The ongoing breaches and other criticisms of Facebook are also prompting some high-profile users to bow out. The latest is Democrat Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who saidshe had ""quit"" the social network.,external In an interview with aYahoo News podcast,externalshe said: ""I personally gave up Facebook, which was kind of a big deal because I started my campaign on Facebook."" She added that social media posed a ""public health risk"".

Warning over 'unexplained' school moves,"There are warnings that some of the 55,000 ""unexplained"" moves by pupils between schools in England over five years could be driven by schools trying to remove difficult children. The Education Policy Institute has looked at cases where pupils have changed school without moving home. Almost a quarter of these moves have taken place in 330 secondary schools. David Laws, chairman of the think tank, said it raised concerns ""whether some schools are 'off-rolling' pupils"". ""The size of unexplained pupil moves is disturbing,"" said Mr Laws, a former education minister. This is where schools try to remove pupils with challenging behaviour, or whose poor exam results might damage league table performances. Schools are accused of wanting to get them ""off their rolls"" so that they become someone else's problem. Excluded pupils abandoned by schools Is knife crime linked to exclusions? Special needs pupils 'spend years out of school' It can be hard to prove, because it might be not be clear whether such moves are the result of schools pushing out pupils or choices made by parents. Schools will also have to consider the safety and education of other pupils - and arguments over off-rolling have sometimes accompanied new rules over behaviour. But off-rolling has also become part of the debate about what happens to pupils who are removed from mainstream schools, including those with special needs, who end up in ""alternative provision"" of variable quality or who are claimed to be home-schooled. The study from the Education Policy Institute - sponsored by the National Education Union - has examined the movement of pupils between starting secondary school and taking GCSEs in 2017. The researchers show when other factors are accounted for - such as families moving to another part of the country - there are about 10,000 pupils a year whose moves are described as ""unexplained"". These are children, aged between 11 and 16, who have switched to another school, without having moved to another area. The study does not measure how many of these might be the result of off-rolling, but it suggests this could be an explanation for some of them. It could also be that families have chosen to move to another local school for other academic or social reasons or personal preferences, with more than three million children in this age group. The most common time for these moves is in the first three years of secondary school - with fewer moves in the GCSE years. The study says this pattern is the same as six years before - although the peak, between Years 8 and 9, was slightly higher in 2011. The suspicion that some schools are removing more pupils than might be expected is from the concentration of almost a quarter of these unexplained moves in 330 secondary schools. There were similar numbers of girls and boys changing schools, a slightly higher proportion of black pupils and an increased likelihood among those who had been excluded and those in social care. There was no regional breakdown to show whether this might be more common in big cities such as London, with access to a wider range of schools. Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said it was a ""national scandal that tens of thousands of children are falling off school rolls and potentially out of education altogether"". The National Education Union, which commissioned the report, said it was ""shocking if not surprising"". The union's joint general secretary, Mary Bousted, said: ""It is urgent that we move beyond the numbers, analyse the real reasons behind these moves and challenge the government policies which are undermining inclusive and high-quality education"". Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, warned ""not to conflate and condemn all the different reasons a pupil might leave a school's roll. Every individual circumstance is different"". Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said there was an ""uncomfortable reality"" that some of these ""unexplained exits"" could be because of the ""illegitimate"" behaviour of schools. But he said it was also important to ""keep in mind that many parents make the decision to move or home-school their child for their own reasons"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""No head teacher goes into the job to remove a pupil from school - and no head teacher takes the decision to do so lightly. ""It is against the law to remove pupils on the basis of academic results - any school that does it is breaking the law. ""We have written to all schools to remind them of the rules on exclusions, and Edward Timpson is currently reviewing how schools use them and why some groups of children are more likely to be excluded from school than others.""

Thai cave rescue diver trapped in cave,"Josh Bratchely asked for a pizza after being trapped underground for 28 hours One of the British divers who helped to save the Thai cave schoolboys had to be rescued from a cave himself after becoming trapped for 28 hours. Josh Bratchley had been exploring a flooded cave in Jackson County, Tennessee, when he failed to return to the surface on Tuesday. His fellow divers from the UK spent hours searching for their missing friend, but he was nowhere to be found. Expert divers found Mr Bratchley waiting calmly in an air pocket. The alarm was raised after Mr Bratchley failed to return to the surface at 15:00 local time (21:00 BST) on Tuesday. The authorities were notified in the early hours of Wednesday morning and expert divers were flown in from different US states. This video can not be played Josh Bratchley was rescued after being trapped in a flooded cave in the US for 28 hours They entered the 400ft cave system at about 18:00 local time, and Mr Bratchley was back on the surface about an hour later.

HS2 buys properties worth ÃÂ£600m,"The proposed route of the new rail line is expected to be completed by 2034 More than 900 properties worth nearly Â£600m have been bought by the company responsible for delivering High Speed Rail 2 (HS2), figures show. They include Whatcroft Hall, sold by comedian John Bishop for Â£6.8m, the highest price paid for any property. Campaigners opposed to the rail project said some homeowners had been treated badly, claiming homes were routinely undervalued by HS2. HS2 said it had to achieve a fair price for both homeowners and taxpayers. The Â£56bn high-speed rail line is designed to boost the UK's economy by cutting journey times between London and the Midlands and the north of England. The first passenger services are expected to operate between the capital and Birmingham in 2026, with phase two of the project to Manchester and Leeds earmarked for completion by 2034. Doubts about the future of the route have been raised, afterChief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss told the Spectator magazine,externalthe government would be looking again at the project in its next spending review. Homeowners who live in the path of the proposed route are entitled to compensation. Certain residents are able to sell their home to HS2 at the full ""unblighted"" market price but some have claimed HS2 has undervalued their homes. This video can not be played 'I've known marriages break up over HS2' Tracy Stone, from Mexborough in South Yorkshire, lives on the Shimmer Estate, which made headlines when the route was announced because it was so newly-built residents had only just moved in when they learned their homes were at risk of demolition to make way for HS2. She recently sold her house to HS2 after being told the proposed route would go directly through the estate. ""Four days after I moved on to the Shimmer Estate I was told most of the new estate would have to be knocked down,"" she said. ""As we've tried to sell our homes, its felt like HS2 have tried to put obstacles in our way at every turn. ""They've been offering ridiculously low prices and the whole process just feels very unfair."" Is the HS2 rail project in trouble? John Bishop sells mansion to HS2 for Â£6.8m What do we know about HS2? The mother of two said she had recently settled on a valuation of Â£169,000 for her home, Â£5,000 less than the real market value she understands it holds. ""We were promised by the government and HS2 that they would look after people on this estate, but that hasn't happened,"" said Ms Stone. ""We've been let down and lied to."" Figures published by HS2 in response to a freedom of information request from the campaign group Stop HS2, showed 902 residential properties, farms or pieces of land had been bought by the company between 2011 and 2018. The total cost of the acquisitions was nearly Â£600m. Campaigners say identical homes on the Shimmer Estate in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, have been given widely different valuations by HS2 The figures also revealed homeowners in identical homes on the Shimmer estate had received significantly different levels of compensation for their properties. ""There are two properties on this estate, next to each other - one was bought for Â£153,000, the other Â£173,000,"" said Sean Gibbons, a local independent councillor. ""We've got lots of residents who were promised they would get the market rate for their homes and that just hasn't happened."" But Richard Farr, a local surveyor with experience of working with HS2, said it was common for similar houses to receive different valuations. ""A valuation has to take into account the amount of money spent on the home, and its internal fixtures and fittings. It's not just a value of the bricks and mortar of a property,"" said Mr Farr. John Bishop sold his Cheshire mansion to HS2 for Â£6.8m. The comedian has said he thinks the new train line should be scrapped A spokeswoman for HS2 said: ""We are committed to supporting homeowners on the Shimmer Estate, and have reached agreement on values for over 75% of cases where the homeowner has applied to sell their property through our property support schemes. ""Every home is unique and there will often be different opinions about the value of a property. We have a responsibility to establish a price that is fair both for homeowners and the taxpayer."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: ""HS2 Ltd must work closely and constructively with those impacted by the project - this ensures a sensible balance is struck between fair compensation for affected residents and protecting the public purse. ""Where property is needed to deliver this vital project, HS2 Ltd are bound by strict compensation rules and guidelines and we expect them to pay a fair, market price for properties.""

Glasgow to limit number of taxis and cabsThe council believes it is the first in Scotland to set upper and lower limits for cars on the road.Scotland,"Glasgow City Council is set to take steps to limit the number of new taxis and private hire cabs. The council says it may start turning down applications for new vehicle licences because there are too many taxis and cabs on the road. There are currently 1,420 taxis and almost 3,900 licensed private cabs. The policy is designed to ensure work is not spread too thinly between existing drivers. Applications to renew existing licences will not be affected. Personal licenses - that is, the certificate required to become a driver in a vehicle with an existing license - will also be unaffected. The council was always free to turn down applications for new taxi licences but the new policy makes this explicit. Until recently, licence applications for private hire cabs could only be turned down if the person or company was deemed unsuitable - the number of cabs on the road was not a consideration. Glasgow believes it is the first Scottish council to set upper and lower limits for the number of black cabs and licensed private hire vehicles. In Glasgow, all licensed taxis are black Hackney vehicles. Mayor of London calls for power to limit minicab numbers City of Edinburgh Council currently has a limit on the number of taxi licences but not on the number of private hire licences. The council says there should be: Between 1,278 and 1,420 black taxis Between 3,195 and 3,759 licensed private hire vehicles The numbers are based on research carried out for the council into the demand for taxis and private hire cabs. The council aims to ensure there is a sustainable business for taxis and cabs. However, average figures disguise peaks and troughs - for instance extra demand after a major concert, busy weekend evenings and bad weather.

"HIV used to cure 'bubble boy' diseaseAll eight infants now have fully functioning immune systems after undergoing treatment, say experts.","Gael, a patient at St Jude Children's Research Hospital who received treatment, with his mother US scientists say they used HIV to make a gene therapy that cured eight infants of severe combined immunodeficiency, or ""bubble boy"" disease. Results of the research, developed at a Tennessee hospital, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The babies, born with little to no immune protection, now have fully functional immune systems. Untreated babies with this disorder have to live in completely sterile conditions and tend to die as infants. The gene therapy involved collecting the babies' bone marrow and correcting the genetic defect in their DNA soon after their birth. David Vetter, who came to be known in the 1970s as the bubble boy The ""correct"" gene - used to fix the defect - was inserted into an altered version of one of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Researchers said most of the babies were discharged from the hospital within one month. Dr Ewelina Mamcarz of St Jude, an author of the study, saidin a statement,external: ""These patients are toddlers now, who are responding to vaccinations and have immune systems to make all immune cells they need for protection from infections as they explore the world and live normal lives."" ""This is a first for patients with SCID-X1,"" she added, referring to the most common type of SCID. The patients were treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco. Bubble baby gene therapy 'worth the risk' Gene therapy 'success' revealed 'Bubble boy' celebrates 10 years The case of David Vetter is perhaps the most famous case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a disease that made it impossible for him to engage with the world outside a plastic chamber. Nicknamed ""Bubble Boy"", Vetter was born in 1971 with the disease and died at the age of 12 after a failed bone marrow transplant. Within 20 seconds of his birth at the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, he was placed in a plastic isolation chamber, where he lived until the age of six when he was given a special plastic suit designed by Nasa, the US space agency. His parents had already lost one child to the disease before he was born. Currently, the best treatment for SCID-XI is a bone marrow transplant with a tissue-matched sibling donor. But according to St Jude, more than 80% of these patients lack such donors and must rely on blood stem cells from other donors. This process is less likely to cure the bubble boy disease, and is more likely to cause serious side effects as a result of treatment.

HS2 buys properties worth ÃÂ£600mFigures show HS2 has bought over 900 properties that could be affected by the high-speed rail route.England,"The proposed route of the new rail line is expected to be completed by 2034 More than 900 properties worth nearly Â£600m have been bought by the company responsible for delivering High Speed Rail 2 (HS2), figures show. They include Whatcroft Hall, sold by comedian John Bishop for Â£6.8m, the highest price paid for any property. Campaigners opposed to the rail project said some homeowners had been treated badly, claiming homes were routinely undervalued by HS2. HS2 said it had to achieve a fair price for both homeowners and taxpayers. The Â£56bn high-speed rail line is designed to boost the UK's economy by cutting journey times between London and the Midlands and the north of England. The first passenger services are expected to operate between the capital and Birmingham in 2026, with phase two of the project to Manchester and Leeds earmarked for completion by 2034. Doubts about the future of the route have been raised, afterChief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss told the Spectator magazine,externalthe government would be looking again at the project in its next spending review. Homeowners who live in the path of the proposed route are entitled to compensation. Certain residents are able to sell their home to HS2 at the full ""unblighted"" market price but some have claimed HS2 has undervalued their homes. This video can not be played 'I've known marriages break up over HS2' Tracy Stone, from Mexborough in South Yorkshire, lives on the Shimmer Estate, which made headlines when the route was announced because it was so newly-built residents had only just moved in when they learned their homes were at risk of demolition to make way for HS2. She recently sold her house to HS2 after being told the proposed route would go directly through the estate. ""Four days after I moved on to the Shimmer Estate I was told most of the new estate would have to be knocked down,"" she said. ""As we've tried to sell our homes, its felt like HS2 have tried to put obstacles in our way at every turn. ""They've been offering ridiculously low prices and the whole process just feels very unfair."" Is the HS2 rail project in trouble? John Bishop sells mansion to HS2 for Â£6.8m What do we know about HS2? The mother of two said she had recently settled on a valuation of Â£169,000 for her home, Â£5,000 less than the real market value she understands it holds. ""We were promised by the government and HS2 that they would look after people on this estate, but that hasn't happened,"" said Ms Stone. ""We've been let down and lied to."" Figures published by HS2 in response to a freedom of information request from the campaign group Stop HS2, showed 902 residential properties, farms or pieces of land had been bought by the company between 2011 and 2018. The total cost of the acquisitions was nearly Â£600m. Campaigners say identical homes on the Shimmer Estate in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, have been given widely different valuations by HS2 The figures also revealed homeowners in identical homes on the Shimmer estate had received significantly different levels of compensation for their properties. ""There are two properties on this estate, next to each other - one was bought for Â£153,000, the other Â£173,000,"" said Sean Gibbons, a local independent councillor. ""We've got lots of residents who were promised they would get the market rate for their homes and that just hasn't happened."" But Richard Farr, a local surveyor with experience of working with HS2, said it was common for similar houses to receive different valuations. ""A valuation has to take into account the amount of money spent on the home, and its internal fixtures and fittings. It's not just a value of the bricks and mortar of a property,"" said Mr Farr. John Bishop sold his Cheshire mansion to HS2 for Â£6.8m. The comedian has said he thinks the new train line should be scrapped A spokeswoman for HS2 said: ""We are committed to supporting homeowners on the Shimmer Estate, and have reached agreement on values for over 75% of cases where the homeowner has applied to sell their property through our property support schemes. ""Every home is unique and there will often be different opinions about the value of a property. We have a responsibility to establish a price that is fair both for homeowners and the taxpayer."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: ""HS2 Ltd must work closely and constructively with those impacted by the project - this ensures a sensible balance is struck between fair compensation for affected residents and protecting the public purse. ""Where property is needed to deliver this vital project, HS2 Ltd are bound by strict compensation rules and guidelines and we expect them to pay a fair, market price for properties.""

Man charged over police ammonia attack,"The officers had forced entry to a home in Darwen shortly before A man has been charged after seven police officers were sprayed with ammonia during an emergency call. Sgt Andrew Gore was seriously injured during the incident in Ash Grove in Darwen, Lancashire, on Tuesday morning. Paul Elliot, 46, of no fixed address, has appeared in court charged with wounding and attempted wounding plus six counts of ""throwing corrosive fluid on a person"". He has been remanded in custody to appear at Preston Crown Court in May. Mr Elliot is accused of six counts of ""throwing corrosive fluid on a person"" with intent to burn, maim, disfigure or disable any person or to do some grievous bodily harm. No application for bail was made. On Wednesday, the police federation criticised North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) for treating the incident as an urgent, rather than emergency call-out. NWAS gave the response, at about 02:00 BST on Tuesday, category three status, which means paramedics are expected to arrive within two hours. An NWAS spokesman said it was ""looking into this incident to see if any learning can be obtained"". The sergeant suffered serious injuries to his eyes, throat and lungs and is expected to undergo an operation on his left eye next week, Lancashire Constabulary said. 28 sizzling pictures of Blackpool and Preston scorching in heatwaves to remind you of summer days 28 sizzling pictures of Blackpool and Preston scorching in heatwaves to remind you of summer days Lancashire Police search for missing teenager with links to Blackpool Watch: Full list of celebrities who have lost homes in LA fires Plans to convert historic village pub met with opposition from campaigners Escapes returns for 2025 announcing free tickets for Point Break at over 150 scr...

Longest serving garden presenter bows out,"Jim McColl with co-presenter Carole Baxter The BBC's longest-serving gardening presenter is hanging up his trowel after more than 40 years. Jim McColl, 83, has hosted BBC Scotland's The Beechgrove Garden since the popular TV show began in 1978. He said his passion for gardening was undimmed but failing grip in his hands was one of the reasons for leaving now. His words ""Welcome to Beechgrove Garden"" and catchphrase 'Every day's a school day' have been familiar to generations of Scottish viewers. Explaining his decision, he said: ""It is time I retired not because I have lost any interest in gardening or my enthusiasm for gardening but just because I'm getting old. ""I'll be 84 next birthday - so things are going wrong in the sense that if I get down on my knees, I'm not sure I can get back up again."" Jim McColl in the early days of The Beechgrove Garden Jim will announce his retirement when the latest show airs on the new BBC Scotland channel later. During the show, which will look back at his career, he will tell co-presenter Carole Baxter that gardening has shaped his life. ""It is half my life. I just want to grow old in private â¦ but I'll still garden,"" he says. Jim reveals he is getting treatment to help with his loss of grip, but has difficulties and is unable to do things like button his top shirt button. Gardening colleagues watching the show have previously remarked to him that he has been holding gardening tools awkwardly. The cast of the long-running TV gardening show He said: ""One of the things you want to do when you are showing off on telly, is you want to do it properly."" Tributes have been paid to his professionalism and dedication to both horticulture and broadcasting. Beechgrove producer Gwyneth Hardy said: ""It's the end of an era for Jim to be handing over the trowel. ""It's been a big decision, not taken lightly for Jim as he is genuinely passionate about communicating his knowledge of gardening. ""He said to me recently that gardening is like breathing for him; it's an everyday activity."" Jim and his fellow presenters celebrated the 40th anniversary of Beechgrove last year Carole Baxter, who has worked alongside Jim for 36 years, said: ""I am going to miss Jim after working with him for all these years but this is an appropriate time to celebrate his career. ""He is a great gardener and presenter. ""He shares his wealth of gardening knowledge in a way which engages people at all levels of gardening expertise from none to the professionals."" When the BBC began digging up a patch of garden at the back of its studios in Aberdeen, nobody could have imagined that the show would become a hardy perennial like its presenter.

After a spell working as a gardening adviser in Reading, he moved to Aberdeenshire where he worked on a ground-breaking distillery project that used waste energy to grow tomatoes. The Beechgrove Garden grew out of his participation in a Radio Scotland series The Scottish Garden. Jim presented the show from BBC Scotland's Aberdeen base alongside George Barron. Jim McColl with former co-presenter George Barron Donalda MacKinnon, director of BBC Scotland, said: ""Many thousands of gardeners have been inspired and coached by Jim via The Beechgrove Garden over many years and on behalf of them all, and also for other viewers who simply love him for his knowledge and warmth, I'd like to thank him.""

"Man dies after Edinburgh 'shooting'Police confirm a man was found seriously injured after reports of a disturbance in the city's west end.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","A man who starred as a gangland figure in T2 Trainspotting has been shot dead in Edinburgh's west end. Bradley Welsh, 48, who also featured in an episode of Danny Dyer's Deadliest Men, was killed outside his home in Chester Street at 20:00 on Wednesday. Police have confirmed that the death is being treated as murder. One resident said he was told someone had been shot in the head and people were instructed to stay indoors as the street was cordoned off. Profile: Bradley Welsh in his own words Armed officers were sent to the scene after receiving ""multiple reports"" of a firearm discharge. Police later confirmed that a man had died at the scene after being found in a stairwell to a basement apartment with a serious injury. Bradley Welsh helped young people to stay away from a life of crime through his Holyrood Boxing Gym Detectives said early investigations indicated that it was an isolated attack. Welsh starred alongside Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle in T2 Trainspotting, playing the gangland figure Mr Doyle.

In the programme he discussed his past as a Hibs Casual football hooligan in the 1980s. He talked about how he ""mobbed and robbed"" and was involved with organised ""smash and grabs"" at stores, including Jenners in Edinburgh. He later became involved in organising security at hundreds of clubs in Edinburgh. He told the programme: ""I was 17 years old, just turning 18, and I thought I was Don Corleone.

He was the British ABA lightweight boxing champion in 1993. Local resident Alasdair Morton said armed police sealed off the area from Walker Street to Manor Place as someone had suffered a ""gunshot wound to the head"". Mr Morton, 46, said: ""I came out the house and we were told to go back in. Around three police cars and a black van drove along the street and the traffic then stopped. ""I initially thought it was a police escort then when I had a look there must have been a dozen or so police with guns pushing the traffic back. ""We've not been told anything but police waved through some ambulances. ""They said 'there's a gunshot wound to the head somewhere'. We could still hear noises that suggested there was a situation still going on."" A woman, who did not want to be named, was in her flat across the road from the incident when she heard a ""massive bang"". She added: ""I was in the kitchen and heard a bang. I ran through to my boyfriend and said 'what was that?', because it sounded a little bit weird. ""Then there were loads of SWAT teams - the police were here super-quick.""

He said: ""Devastating news about Brad Welsh tonight, a huge character in Scottish amateur boxing and the Hibernian support and someone who contributed a great deal to society through his charitable work and boxing gym. RIP."" Forensic officers have been combing the scene for evidence Det Supt Allan Burton, from Police Scotland's major investigation team, said: ""At this time our deepest sympathies are with this man's family and a significant inquiry is now under way to trace everyone who was involved in the murder. ""I would ask that anyone who was within Chester Street, or the west end of Edinburgh on Wednesday evening, and who saw anyone, or anything suspicious, to contact the police immediately. ""Part of this investigation will focus on obtaining CCTV from nearby homes and businesses and we would also urge any motorists who were in the area and may have relevant dashcam footage to share this with us.""

Samsung's folding phone breaks for reviewersSeveral outlets reviewing Samsung's ground-breaking new folding smartphone have reported major problems with its screen.,"Samsung's folding phone was shown off for the first time earlier this year Earlier this week, Samsung sent out its remarkable new folding smartphone to a number of media outlets,including the BBC. Perhaps now it wishes it hadnât. Bloombergâs Mark Gurman: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Samsung said it had received ""a few reports"" of damage to the main display, and would ""thoroughly inspect these units in person to determine the cause of the matter"". But itâs a significant setback to the companyâs hopes of wowing the world with what, at first glance, was a very impressive feat of engineering. It appears one explanation for the problems is that some reviewers removed a film that went over the screen, thinking it was the typical protective layer you find on all new smartphones to keep the screen in good condition until you buy it. Bloombergâs Mark Gurman removed his, as did the highly-regarded YouTube reviewer, Marques Brownlee. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Steve Kovach, however, didnât remove the film - and said he still had major issues. The device the BBC handled, incidentally, was taken away by Samsung shortly after filming was finished, so our team hasnât had a chance to see these issues for ourselves. Our reviewer Chris Fox said the way the screen folded together - leaving a small gap - made him nervous about accidents that might occur with small objects. But if the device struggles to this degree in the hands of seasoned reviewers, the return-rate could be huge, if and when it goes on sale to the wider public. Remember, this is a $2,000 smartphone. The reviewers having problems insist thereâs been no rough-handling of the devices. ""Whatever happened, it certainly wasnât because I have treated this phone badly,""wrote Mr Bohn at The Verge,external. ""Iâve done normal phone stuff, like opening and closing the hinge and putting it in my pocket. We did stick a tiny piece of moulding clay on the back of the phone yesterday to prop it up for a video shoot, which is something we do in every phone video shoot.â Samsung stole headlines from its competitors by getting its apparently consumer-ready device out there quicker than anyone, a technological two-fingers in the direction of Huawei, the Chinese firm breathing down Samsungâs neck in the smartphone game. But itâs no good being first if you get it wrong - and put out a device that isnât quite ready. Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Fold.

Notre-Dame booksellers urge donations,"This video can not be played Tom Hollander reads an extract from Victor Hugo's novel French booksellers are urging publishers of the novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame to donate funds to help rebuild the burnt-out cathedral. Two bookstore owners are calling on publishers of Victor Hugo's iconic book to join the funding campaign. A fund launched to rebuild the fire-ravaged Gothic cathedral is expected to surpass â¬1bn ($1.1bn; Â£870m). More than â¬800m has already been raised since the monument was engulfed by flames on Monday evening. Now Amandine Ardouin and Antoine Bonnet, whose bookshops are based in Paris, are asking other sellers and publishers to do their part. A share of their income from sales of Hugo's novel, first published in 1831, will be pledged to the restoration project, they told French media. The story of the fire in graphics Why blaze was difficult to tackle How will cathedral be restored? ""It is heartbreaking to make money on this misfortune, so we decided to redistribute these funds to the cathedral repair work,"" Mr Ardouin told Livre Hebdo. Within hours of the devastating blaze, Hugo's epic rocketed to the top of Amazon's best-seller list. A French version of the book, published in 1975 by Le Livre de Poche, remained in first place on the best-seller list of Amazon France on Wednesday. Prices range from â¬4.60 for the pocket edition, to â¬43.04 for the paperback, according to the Amazon listing for Le Livre de Poche's releases. One paperback edition, published by Penguin Classics in 1978, is listed as ""temporarily out of stock"" on the e-commerce giant's website. Scaffolding surrounds Notre-Dame cathedral two days after the devastating fire Other editions by the Folio Society (1998), Flammarion (1984) and other publishers are still available to buy on Amazon and other websites. Speaking to Le Figaro, Mr Ardouin said he would like publishers to emulate his ""symbolic act"" by donating to the cause. ""We would like Folio, Pocket book, Flammarion, who sell this book in pocket format, to do the same,"" he told the paper. ""Literature can save Notre-Dame."" The BBC has approached Penguin, Folio Society, Flammarion and Le Livre de Poche for comment on the calls to donate funds but is yet to receive a reply. Hugo's classic tells the tale of Quasimodo, a deformed and half-blind bell-ringer who falls in love with a beautiful young gypsy woman named Esmeralda. Ashamed of his appearance, he admires her from afar, longing to meet her from the isolated confines of Notre-Dame's bell tower. A chain of events unfolds in which Quasimodo attempts to protect Esmeralda from his jealous master, Archdeacon Claude Frollo, who also lusts after her. The story culminates in their tragic deaths. Literary critics argue that Hugo's main motivation for writing the book was to draw attention to the then-dilapidated cathedral and the value of the Gothic architecture. Warren Clarke as Quasimodo in the 1970s TV series The Hunchback of Notre-Dame Prior to the publication of Hugo's book, sections of Notre-Dame cathedral had fallen into disrepair. He began writing the story, also known as ""Our Lady of Paris"", in 1829, using the building as the backdrop for his dramatic tale. At the time, parts of it lay in ruins, having sustained serious damage during the French Revolution. Hugo's enormously popular novel - set in Notre-Dame's heyday in the 1400s - is partly credited with saving it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Its roaring success emboldened the historical preservation movement in France, leading to the formation of the Commission on Historical Monuments. In 1841, architects EugÃ¨ne Viollet-le-Duc and Jean-Baptiste Lassus led major renovations at Notre-Dame, restoring it to its former glory. ""A commission formed in 1837, in part due to the success of Victor Hugo's novel the Hunchback of Notre-Dame,"" Dr Emily Guerry, lecturer in medieval European history at the University of Kent, told the BBC. ""That's when a collective group of people in Paris and across France fell back in love with the monument."" Colin Jones, a professor at Queen Mary University of London specialising in the history of Paris, told the BBC Hugo ""played an enormous part in the cause of restoration of medieval monuments in the 19th century"". He said the restoration of Notre-Dame cathedral was ""in some ways closely associated"" with Hugo's famous novel.

How Notre-Dame became the heart of France,"Notre-Dame, burning orange against the Parisian sky, was a sight both horrifying and spectacular; unbearable and mesmerising. The audible gasp as if from one single mighty breath whenthe lead spire slipped from sightreflected the global response to the catastrophe. It was seen on screens from China to the US. Built from the late 12th Century, Notre-Dame was a trailblazer in the development of the Gothic style and is one of its most recognisable examples. The uplifting brightness of the interior demonstrates the masons' aspiration to manipulate light and space as well as stone and mortar. Outside the west facade is a vast billboard of sculpted figures composed to harmonise with the architectural structure and to convey the historic might of the medieval church. Notre-Dame is more though than a paean to the Middle Ages. Its foundations rest on the most ancient inhabited site in Paris, the Celtic town of Lutetia, dating back to at least the first century BCE. Notre-Dame ""gargoyles"" look out over the city Its location on an island between two branches of the Seine sets it apart from the city, although in its midst. It breaks the flow of the river and in doing so subdues it. Notre-Dame was built from the 1160s at the instigation of Bishop Maurice de Sully to replace a vast Seventh Century cathedral on more or less the same site. With its innovative floor-plan and complex multi-storied west front, it lies at the forefront of the French Gothic movement. St Denis though, in Paris's northern suburbs, was feeling its ways in that direction some 30 years before. However, the significance of Notre-Dame in terms of public affection surely lies in the role it plays in the emergence of France. If its kings were crowned at Reims and buried in St Denis, geographically and historically Notre-Dame stands at its heart. Engraving showing Notre-Dame shortly before the French Revolution The building grew with the nation. The decades which marked its construction saw Normandy and the South-West absorbed into its political orbit. Its university led intellectual thought in Europe and King Louis IX was recognised and subsequently canonised for his piety. The story of the Notre-Dame fire in graphics Why the blaze was difficult to tackle How will the cathedral be restored? In pictures: The damaged interior Later, in the 1790s, Notre-Dame was again at the centre of change across France. In the same way when France was wracked by revolutionary unrest, the cathedral was ransacked and disfigured by zealots. The physical scars left on Notre-Dame were, almost symbolically, both grave and permanent. Sculptural fragments from the west facade were rescued from the site and are now in the city's MusÃ©e de Cluny. They serve as a ghostly reminder of what Notre-Dame had been, how it had come to represent privilege and the status quo, and why it was reviled by the Paris mob. When stability of a kind returned, it was reincarnated in the Neo-Gothic restoration work of the remarkable EugÃ¨ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, saviour almost singlehandedly of France's Medieval architectural legacy. The famous grotesque ""gargoyles"" that he added to the parapets leer over to the opposite river banks and the new Classically-inspired city layout being created by Baron Haussmann at much the same time. Notre-Dame is not only a mirror of the nation's history but a waymarker in the modern life of the city. It is not simply a thoroughfare across the river but a destination in its own right. The 19th Century system of arrondissements radiates from Notre-Dame; the map of the Metro constellates around the Ãle de la CitÃ© on which it stands; river boats run up on either side, as does traffic by the Seine. Small wonder then that Notre-Dame has an indelible place in the hearts of Parisians, and also in those of her endless stream of visitors. Small wonder too that the burning fireball seemed to so many like a heart wrenched from a body. The image is apt because, in many ways, a great building is like a living thing. Parts of it fall away and are replaced, parts are added and others demolished, parts are joined together and others divided up. Notre-Dame as a Paris landmark One of France's most famous landmarks since it was built 850 years ago A stone outside marks ""Point Zero"" - the official centre of the capital and the marker in France from which all distances to Paris are measured A major symbol of the Catholic faith, the cathedral is home to relics including the crown of thorns said to have been worn by Jesus before the crucifixion Attracts an estimated 13 million visitors a year A history of Paris's beloved cathedral Snapshots taken of such a building, say, every 50 years, would demonstrate visible changes. Someone looking at Canterbury Cathedral in 1100, for example, would see nothing at all in the fabric which remains in the building above ground level now. A building therefore is an elusive concept, and our response to it is as much to do with how we think of it in our hopes and our memories as it to do with its physical appearance. In past centuries these gradual changes were frequently punctuated by catastrophe. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and wife of the French president, Brigitte Macron, attend a service Medieval accounts abound with collapses, earthquakes, and especially fire. In England, the cathedrals at Winchester, Ely and Wells lost their crossing towers; Lincoln was destroyed by an earthquake, leaving just its west facade standing. In France, 12th Century Chartres burnt to the ground, and Beauvais' crossing tower, the highest ever built, fell down within a decade of its construction. Most were rebuilt afresh in the latest fashion. From a great fire, the Gothic cathedral of Chartres with its unprecedented programme of stained glass arose. And from a pile of rubble, the ingenious wooden lantern which is the Ely octagon was constructed. Yet Chartres is still Chartres and Ely is still Ely. Even buildings left as bereft fragments have not lost their identity. Nor is Notre-Dame lost until those who love it have gone.

The strange normality of life in a breakaway state What will happen now? Will that Neo-Gothic lead spire be replaced by a Neo-Neo Gothic one? Or will Paris take a tip from the Middle Ages and rebuild what is ruined in a new way? And there is good news - the rose windows and the organ are saved, many works of art were carried unharmed from the flames; the courage and efficiency of the firefighters is uplifting; the determination to rebuild heart-warming. The signs are that Notre-Dame, like so many great churches in the past, will rise phoenix-like from the ashes. If imagination and boldness are given rein, it may shine even more brightly than before.
