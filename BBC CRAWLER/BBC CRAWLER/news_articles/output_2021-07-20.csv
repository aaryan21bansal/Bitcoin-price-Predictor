Jeff Bezos launches to space aboard rocket ship,"This video can not be played The moment Jeff Bezos and crew launch into space on the first human flight of New Shepard Billionaire Jeff Bezos has made a short journey to space, in the first crewed flight of his rocket ship, New Shepard. He was accompanied by Mark Bezos, his brother, Wally Funk, an 82-year-old pioneer of the space race, and an 18-year-old student. They travelled in a capsule with the biggest windows flown in space, offering stunning views of the Earth. When the capsule touched back down after the 10-minute, 10-second flight, Jeff Bezos exclaimed: ""Best day ever!"" New Shepard, built by Bezos' company Blue Origin, is designed to serve the burgeoning market for space tourism. Amazon founder Mr Bezos - and other participants in the ""billionaire space race"" - have been criticised for offering what some see as joy rides for the super-wealthy. Critics say the money could be spent on pay rises for employees or fighting climate change. However, Mr Bezos insists he has an environmental vision: ""We need to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry and move it into space, and keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is,"" he told MSNBC. ""It's going to take decades and decades to achieve, but you have to start, and big things start with small steps... that's what this sub-orbital tourism mission allows us to do, it allows us to practice over and over."" Jeff Bezos sets date for space sightseeing flight Jeff Bezos and brother to fly to space in July Wally Funk, 82, joins Bezos space flight From left: Mark Bezos, Jeff Bezos, Oliver Daemen, Wally Funk On this flight was the oldest person who has been to space - Ms Funk - and the youngest, student Oliver Daemen. The spacecraft lifted off at 14:12 BST (09:12 EDT) from a private launch site near Van Horn, Texas. At a post-launch news briefing, Jeff Bezos said: ""My expectations were high and they were dramatically exceeded."" Two minutes into the flight, the capsule separated from its rocket and continued upwards towards the Karman Line - the most widely recognised boundary of space, that lies 100km up. The newly minted-astronauts shouted ""wow!"" and cheered. The moment the capsule touched down in the West Texas desert The post-flight briefing was shown video of the occupants performing somersaults and tumbles during four minutes of weightlessness. Stunning views of the Earth could be seen outside. Jeff Bezos said he was surprised by the sensation of microgravity: ""It felt so normal,"" he explained. Ms Funk added: ""It was great, I loved it, I can hardly wait to go again."" In the 1960s, Ms Funk was one member of a group of women called the Mercury 13. They underwent the same screening tests as male astronauts, but never got to fly under the US national space programme. Mr Bezos told CBS News on Monday: ""Wally can outrun all of us. During the Mercury 13, she was better than all the men and I can guarantee that's still true today."" Bezos' brother Mark, 53, is a senior vice president at Robin Hood, a New York-based charity. This video can not be played The Silicon Valley space race Oliver Daemen is the son of a Dutch financier. He had originally secured a seat on the second flight, but was drafted in to replaced the anonymous winner of a public auction who had to pull out from the trip with Bezos. The capsule reached a maximum altitude of around 107km (351,210ft) before starting its descent, parachuting down to a soft landing in the West Texas desert. Mr Bezos was delighted as he stepped out of the capsule after landing The passengers' families were at the landing site to greet them On the way down, Jeff Bezos told mission control: ""You have a very happy crew up here."" Mark revealed that iconic items from aviation history were brought along on the flight. These included a piece of canvas used on the Wright brothers' first plane, a medallion made from the vehicle that performed the first hot air balloon flight in 1783 and a pair of goggles used by pilot Amelia Earhart. Jeff Bezos recently resigned as chief executive of Amazon, the e-commerce giant he founded, in order to concentrate on his other ventures, including Blue Origin.

UK-France deal to tackle rise in Channel crossings,"This video can not be played The BBC's Jon Donnison spoke to some of the migrants trying to make the dangerous journey France will double the number of police patrolling its beaches as part of a deal with the UK to stem the number of migrants crossing the English Channel. It comes as the number of people crossing the Channel this year has now overtaken 2020's total. The UK will pay more than Â£54m as part of the deal, which will also improve intelligence sharing. But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont suggested it would not have an impact as the French coastline is too big. He told the Today programme: ""The fact is, we've seen it before. Having more money, having more police officers, having more controls, will not prevent people to succeed in these crossing attempts. ""We have too many kilometres of shore to monitor."" The funding will also be used for better technology to target those who organise the crossings, the Home Office said. Record 430 migrants cross Channel in single day What happens to migrants who reach the UK? June sees record number of Channel migrants arrive A group of migrants was seen arriving at Dover on Wednesday morning, bringing the total number this year to more than the 8,461 who made the crossing in 2020. On Monday at least 430 migrants crossed the Channel - a record for one day. The previous daily high of 416was set in September last year. The Home Office said on Tuesday 287 people had landed in the UK. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel and French interior minister Gerald Darmanin have agreed to ""strengthen co-operation"" over the crossings. The Home Office said UK support last year helped France double the number of officers deployed daily on the beaches of its northern coast. It said this resulted in France preventing twice as many crossings so far this year compared with the same period in 2020. However, it said the people who facilitated the crossings had now changed their tactics and had moved further up the French coast, ""forcing migrants to take even longer, riskier journeys"". Mr Dumont added that the French are not supposed to intervene at sea - yet former Border Force chief Tony Smith has called for joint patrols. Mr Smith said: ""That seems to be a step too far for the French at the moment. The French position is they are not prepared to intervene on the high seas, only on land."" A group of people thought to be migrants are escorted by Border Patrol in Dungeness on Tuesday The new support announced by the UK would enable France ""to respond by posting more security forces further up the coast, installing and utilising the latest surveillance equipment throughout northern France"", the Home Office said. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins insisted thata Â£28m deal,externalbetween the UK and France last November, to double police patrols on French beaches, had made a difference, saying it had prevented some 7,500 people crossing the Channel. Ms Atkins told Today it was an ""incredibly complicated"" situation and that the UK was trying to work with other countries to make sure ""when people arrive in a safe country, they remain there and do not try to make that hazardous journey"". She said the government wanted ""safe routes for legal migrants"" and to crack down on the gangs bringing people over. Analysis by Simon Jones, BBC reporter, in Dover From the famous White Cliffs of Dover, we watched this morning as another group of migrants was brought to shore by the Border Force, having been picked up in the Channel. Conditions at sea are once again incredibly calm and the sun is shining, so these are unlikely to be the only arrivals today. Almost 1,000 people have reached the UK by boat in the past three days, putting pressure on the home secretary to act. Priti Patel is now pledging more money to the French authorities to try to prevent the crossings. But the deal struck last night is very similar to one agreed between Britain and France last November - which has failed to stem the numbers arriving, though the Home Office points out the number of crossings being prevented by the French authorities has doubled. The government here accepts there is no quick and easy fix to problems with the asylum system, but there's no doubt the home secretary will want to see swift results in return for the increased investment in northern France. Ms Patel has previously pledged to make Channel crossings ""unviable"", with new legislation that will make it a crime to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission. The Nationality and Borders Bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, will mean migrants entering without permission could face up to four years in prison. The government hopes the overhaul of asylum rules will deter migrants from making the crossing. But the plans have been criticised by charities including Refugee Action, which has called them ""extreme and nasty"". A dinghy's arrival being watched over by the crew of an RNLI lifeboat Dan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander for the Home Office, said: ""There is an unacceptable rise in dangerous small boat crossings across the Channel because of a surge in illegal migration across Europe. ""People should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach and not risk their lives making these dangerous crossings. We are continuing to pursue the criminals behind these illegal crossings."" He added that the Nationality and Borders Bill would ""protect lives and break this cycle of illegal crossings"" and the government was continuing to return those with no legal right to remain in the UK. But Amnesty International's Steve Valdez-Symonds told the BBC the new legislation was an ""extremely reckless and dangerous response"" to the issue and would not tackle the problem of people smugglers. Instead, he said it was likely to drive desperate people to avoid the authorities, leaving them vulnerable to further exploitation and slavery. Labour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Home Office announcement was ""yet more empty words from the Conservatives about agreeing a deal with France to address trafficking gangs"". He said ministers promised a plan with France in August 2020, ""yet almost a year later they are still making empty promises, letting down victims, and allowing criminals to continue their evil trade"".

Thousands evacuated as deadly floods hit China,"This video can not be played Commuters and children rescued from China floodwaters Twelve people have died after record-breaking rainfall flooded underground railway tunnels in China, leaving passengers trapped in rising waters. Video shared on social media shows evening commuters just managing to keep their heads above water. Water is seen rushing onto platforms. More than 500 people were eventually rescued from the tunnels in Henan province, officials said. Days of rain have caused widespread damage and led to 200,000 evacuations. Above ground, roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris swept along in fast moving currents. A number ofpedestrians have had to be rescued. In total, 25 people have died in Henan province and more than a dozen cities are affected. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that there had been ""significant loss of life and damage to property"". Several dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels, and soldiers have been mobilised to divert rivers which have burst their banks. Flights and trains in many parts of Henan have also been suspended. In the provincial capital  Zhengzhou, the equivalent of a year's average rainfall has fallen in just three days. On Tuesday, some of the city's flood defences were overwhelmed and water began flowing down into the railway tunnels. Survivors have described how water leaked through the doors, rising slowly from ""our ankles to our knees to our necks"". ""All of us who could, stood on the subway seats,"" one woman wrote on Chinese social network site Weibo. Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes Children were lifted out of the water by their parents, while others threw off anything which might hold them down. After about half an hour, one passenger said it became ""hard to breathe"". An order to shut down the line came at 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) so the evacuation could begin, Zhengzhou government officials said in a statement. Five people are being treated for injuries, with 12 having died. Elsewhere in the central Chinese city, children had to be rescued from a flooded nursery school. State media aired footage of them being floated out in plastic tubs by rescuers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou Hospital also briefly lost power on Tuesday night, though this has now been restored, said a statement on Weibo by the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee. It added that 600 critically ill patients had been transferred to another location. Another resident, identified as Mr Liu, 27, told BBC Chinese he had had ""no water, no electricity, and no internet"". ""Never in my life had I seen so much rain,"" Mr Liu added. ""There was one hour where the rain was just pouring down on us from the heavens, and everything went completely white."" But the rising waters were not just confined to Zhengzhou. A 20-metre (65ft) breach has emerged in the dam in Luoyang city after it was damaged by storms, officials said. Soldiers have been deployed to the area and a statement from the army warned it could ""collapse at any time"". Another user said that residents in Sishui town were stuck on rooftops. ""We don't know how to swimâ¦ the whole village is about to be washed away,"" the person wrote. Henan has experienced ""rare and severe rainfall"" since Saturday, China's meteorological authority said on Wednesday. Zhengzhou saw 624mm of rainfall on Tuesday, with a third of that amount falling between 16:00 and 17:00 alone, which ""smashed historical records"". It forecasted that parts of the region would continue to see ""severe or extremely severe storms"" and that the heavy rain was likely to end only on Thursday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Part of the Yellow River basin in China, Henan has several major river systems running through the province which are prone to flooding. Zhengzhou, which has a population of 12 million, sits on the banks of the Yellow River itself. Scientists have warned that widespread dam construction has exacerbated climate change problems in China's flood zone, says the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell. Connections between rivers and lakes have been cut and disrupted flood plains which once absorbed much of the region's annual summer downpours.

Green and amber arrivals do not need to be checked,"Travellers to England from green and amber list countries may no longer face Covid checks on arrival - according to a union representing border staff. Officers will no longer routinely verify arrivals have tested negative before departure or completed a passenger locator form, the ISU said. The Guardianfirst reported,externalthe change and said it aimed to reduce queues. The government said carriers were checking all necessary requirements including forms and test bookings. A spokesperson added: ""This legal requirement on carriers is underpinned by a robust compliance regime, which is overseen by regulators. ""Compliance with these rules is essential in order to protect the population from new variants of Covid-19, and so there will be tough fines for those who do not follow the rules."" Airlines UK, which represents easyJet, Tui and British Airways among others, said: ""Carriers are committed to working with Border Force on these requirements, which is why compliance has remained consistently extremely high."" But Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the government of ""yet more staggering incompetence"" and added: ""They must - urgently - get a grip."" How have summer holiday rules changed? Your travel guide to seven Mediterranean countries From Monday, carriers were asked to begin checking vaccine status certification. They were already legally required to ensure passengers have completed necessary requirements before travelling. The Guardian said it had seen a leaked memo that told border staff they no longer had to search for a passenger locator form when the computer system failed to find one. The memo also reportedly confirmed that electronic border gates ""will no longer refer passengers to in-person checks by Border Force officers if a passenger locator form is not found"". The memo, which the Guardian said became operational on Monday as other restrictions eased in England, has not been seen by the BBC. Border Force officers were previously instructed to check 100% of passenger Covid documentation at the border - a direction blamed by some for contributing to queues of up to six hours. Previously about 10% of passenger Covid documentation had been checked. But Lucy Moreton, of the ISU trade union, confirmed the reported memo was accurate. ""Ultimately this is a political decision,"" Ms Moreton said. ""Certainly, it will reduce queue times significantly and hopefully also the level of verbal abuse to which Border Force staff are subject. ""That is welcome to us. The impact on the UK's Covid security is ultimately a scientific determination."" Transport Secretary Grant Shappshas warned of continuing disruption to travel, saying passengers should expect much of that to be focused at check-in and before travel, rather than at the border. All arrivals regardless of where they are coming from abroad are required to test negative before departure and have valid proof of their test status. They are also required to conduct another test two days after their arrival, and prove this is organised pre-departure. All travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form with basic details including an address. Those arriving from amber list countries, who are not fully vaccinated, must also complete a further test on day eight and quarantine at an address listed on the form. People who have been fully vaccinated are no longer required to carry out home quarantine when arriving from an amber list country. Arrivals from red list countries must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days, at a cost of at least Â£1,750 per adult. Additional reporting by George Bowden.

UK row with EU over Gibraltar's post-Brexit status,"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab met Chief Minister Fabian Picardo in Gibraltar in March. The foreign secretary has accused the EU of seeking ""to undermine the UK's sovereignty over Gibraltar"". Dominic Raab said he was ""disappointed"" by EU proposals for a post-Brexit deal over the British overseas territory. Mr Raab said a draft mandate from the European Commission ""directly conflicts"" with a framework deal agreed by the UK, Gibraltar and Spain last December. EU leaders must sign off on the EU's mandate before negotiations can begin. Gibraltar's sovereignty is disputed by Spain and Britain. The territory was not included in the trade agreement settled between the EU and the UK last year and a separate deal has to be agreed. It is thought that British objections to the EU plans centre on the nature of proposed new border arrangements in Gibraltar. End to Gibraltar land border prompts joy and trepidation UK Brexit minister says EU negotiations 'a little tense' Last December's political deal between the UK, Gibraltar and Spain gave a prominent role to the EU's border agency Frontex but the Commission's mandate appears to give greater responsibility to Spanish officials. In a statement, the foreign secretary said: ""We have consistently showed pragmatism and flexibility in the search for arrangements that work for all sides, and we are disappointed that this has not been reciprocated. We urge the EU to think again."" The European Commission said the proposed negotiating directives ""put forward solutions to remove physical checks and controls on persons and goods"" at the border between Spain and Gibraltar. ""It is without prejudice to the issues of sovereignty and jurisdiction, and focuses on cooperation in the region,"" the bloc added. The mandate includes rules for establishing responsibility for asylum, visas, residence permits and police cooperation and information exchange. The EU's post-Brexit negotiator, Maros Sefcovic, said its proposals seek to make a ""positive impact"" on those living either side of the border with Spain while protecting the single market. ""By putting forward this draft mandate, we are honouring the political commitment we made to Spain to start the negotiations of a separate agreement between the EU and the UK on Gibraltar. ""This is a detailed mandate, which aims to have a positive impact for those living and working on either side of the border between Spain and Gibraltar, while protecting the integrity of the Schengen Area and the single market."" In March the Foreign Secretary, and Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo agreed a joint approach to the negotiations on a new Gibraltar treaty between the EU and the UK.

US criticises China over climate change efforts,"John Kerry has travelled the world in recent months including going to Moscow last week US climate envoy John Kerry has called on China to increase the speed and depth of its efforts to cut carbon. Without sufficient emissions reductions by China, Mr Kerry said, the global goal of keeping temperatures under 1.5C  was ""essentially impossible"". Mr Kerry said he was convinced that China could do more and the US was willing to work closely to secure a reasonable climate future. Every major economy must now commit to meaningful reductions by 2030, he said. Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity US climate envoy criticised for clean tech optimism Shipping industry calls for new global carbon tax Mr Kerry was speaking at Kew Gardens in London, ahead of a G20 environment ministers meeting in Italy later this week. Referring to the key COP26 gathering in Glasgow in November, the former Secretary of State said that ""in little more than 100 days we can save the next 100 years"". Doing so would not be easy he said. Mr Kerry said that the promises made during and since the Paris climate agreement in 2015 would still see the world's temperature increase by 2.5-3C. ""We're already seeing dramatic consequences with 1.2C of warming,"" he said, referring to recent heatwaves in the US and Canada, and flooding in Europe. ""To contemplate doubling that is to invite catastrophe."" He castigated the efforts of some countries which are still building new coal-fired power stations. He was scornful of nations that are illegally cutting down the rainforest ""They're removing the lungs of the world, destroying irreplaceable biodiversity and destabilising the climate all at the same time."" Observers say that the envoy was likely referring to Brazil and Indonesia. Recent flooding in Germany has put climate change on the top of the political agenda Mr Kerry paid special attention to the efforts of China, saying the country was now ""the largest driver of climate change"". China has promised to peak emissions by 2030 - but the US diplomat said that was not good enough. ""If China sticks with its current plant and does not peak its emissions until 2030, then the entire rest of the world must go to zero by 2040 or even 2035,"" he warned. ""There is simply no alternative because without sufficient reduction by China, the goal of 1.5C is essentially impossible. China's partnership and leadership on this issue of extraordinary international consequence is essential."" Mr Kerry said he was convinced that China could outperform the targets it had set itself and that despite their diplomatic differences, the US was keen to co-operate. Heatwaves are hitting many parts of the world as the climate warms He also said all other major economies would have to step up, with more ambitious targets and plans for the next decade. Mr Kerry's comments come as new research shows that G20 countries are continuing to support fossil fuels in ways that are incompatible with the goals of the Paris agreement. This video can not be played What is behind the extreme heat? According to Bloomberg'sClimate Policy Factbook,external, G20 nations collectively cut fossil fuel funding by 10% from 2015 to 2019. However, eight countries, including the US, Canada and Australia increased their financial support for oil, coal and gas in this period. Last week, Mr Kerry travelled to Moscow where both sides agreed that the climate issue is one of common interest. President Putin said that Moscow ""attaches great importance"" to achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement. In May, Mr Kerry wascriticised by some scientistsfor rejecting the idea that Americans would have to change their consumption habits, for example, eating less meat.

Horse-racing bosses condemn abattoir practices,"This video can not be played Inside the abattoir slaughtering racehorses Irish and British horse-racing authorities have condemned footage that revealed evidence of a UK abattoir breaking welfare rules when slaughtering former racehorses. Horse Racing Ireland said the footage - which featured in a BBC Panorama investigation - was abhorrent. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) met welfare experts earlier to discuss the issue ""as a matter of urgency"". The abattoir told the BBC it did not accept any form of animal abuse. The covert footage, recorded by the anti-horse racing campaign group Animal Aid, showed horses being killed in front of each other and being shot from a distance at Drury and Sons - one of the UK's biggest abattoirs and one of the few licensed to slaughter horses. Veterinary experts said these actions broke guidelines, causing extra pain and trauma for the horses involved. BHA welfare director James Given said: ""We're all clear that the transporting of horses from Ireland to be euthanised in Britain must stop. ""So too should those practices in the abattoir featured in the programme, which appeared to cause distress to horses."" The BHA said a new welfare strategy, published in 2020, specifically sought to address the care of horses after their racing days were over. Horse Racing Ireland chief executive Brian Kavanagh said: ""The images we saw last night were abhorrent to all within Irish racing and in no way reflect the care and attention given to the overwhelming majority of horses in Ireland."" Freedom of Information requests have revealed that 4,000 former racehorses have been slaughtered in Britain and Ireland since the beginning of 2019. The vast majority were trained in Ireland, and some were once owned and trained by some of the biggest names in racing. Thousands of racehorses killed in slaughterhouses The Panorama film also included claims that attempts were being made to get contaminated horse meat into the human food chain by falsifying paperwork and tampering with horse microchips. Horse meat is not popular in the UK, but there is a sizeable export market for it in Europe. Horse passports and matching microchips are important as they show which animals have been treated with medicines that could be harmful to humans, such as the painkiller Bute. Horse Racing Ireland said it had contacted the Irish police about one attempt to tamper with a horse's microchip, as revealed in the Panorama investigation.  At the time, an on-site Foods Standards Agency vet spotted the problem and the horse was not sold for meat. In response to the Panorama investigation, the UK government's Food Standards Agency (FSA), which regulates abattoirs, said: ""Upholding animal welfare and the safety and authenticity of the food we eat is a top priority for the government."" It said it worked closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ""to ensure that animal welfare is maintained at all stages of food production and that all our food is correctly labelled and safe to eat"". The BHA and Horse Racing Ireland said they would support an investigation by UK authorities. The abattoir, Drury and Sons, told Panorama they ""take great care to maintain high welfare conditions and do not accept any form of animal abuse"". They said all horses are ""humanely destroyed',' and that on occasions where issues do occur, they take ''swift action to review and rectify them"".

Crucial for pinged people to self-isolate - No 10,"Downing Street has insisted it is ""crucial"" to self-isolate when sent an alert by the Covid app - and businesses should help employees to do so. It comes after business minister Paul Scully said he would encourage people who are ""pinged"" to self-isolate but they can make an ""informed decision"". The app has always been voluntary to download and any alerts are advisory. Labour accused the government of ""making it up as they go along"" and creating confusion. In recent days, there has been widespread criticism that the app has been sending out so many alerts that hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating and missing work, causing widespread disruption. Pub chains, supermarkets, transport networks and other businesses have warned of the crippling effect blanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations. People who are ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app and told they have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. However, anyone contacted directly byNHS Test and Trace,external- either by phone, text or email - must self-isolate. On Tuesday, the UK reported a further 46,558 new daily Covid cases alongside another 96 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Who could leave self-isolation to go to work? Meanwhile, a ""very small"" number of critical workers - including NHS and care staff - could carry on working even if told to self-isolate under a new government scheme. Industry bodiesreacted to the plan with dismay, describing it as ""simply unworkable"", amid confusion over how it would operate. Downing Street confirmed the first exemptions had been issued under the scheme by government departments. No 10 was unable to say how many people the government will approve for the loosened rules. Plans for the fully vaccinated to be made exempt from self-isolation were delayed until 16 August in England,with ministers warning at the time of a huge knock-onfor the economy and workplaces, including the NHS. In a BBC interview, Mr Scully was asked whether people should self-isolate if they are ""pinged"". ""I would absolutely encourage people to do that. But they can make an informed decision,"" he replied. ""I don't want to have to mandate people and tell people what to do as government any longer than I really have to. ""But they do have a responsibility to themselves, to their families and to their communities. It's by doing the right thing that we can keep Covid at bay."" Who could leave self-isolation to go to work? Should I be working at home or going in? Earlier, he told Times Radio that self-isolating after being told to by the app was a decision for individuals and employers. ""It's important to understand the rules,"" he said. ""You have to legally isolate if you are... contacted by Test and Trace, or if you're trying to claim isolation payments. The app is there to allow you to make informed decisions."" The Times is also reporting thatministers have written to major manufacturers,externalemphasising that staff are not legally obliged to isolate if ""pinged"". Investment minister Lord Grimstone told one large employer the app was only an ""advisory tool"" and that people were not under any ""legal duty"", the paper said. Following the ministers' comments, Downing Street attempted to clarify the government's position, insisting isolation remained the ""most important action"" people can take to stop the spread of the virus. ""Given the risk of having and spreading the virus when people have been in contact with someone with Covid, it is crucial people isolate when they are told to do so, either by NHS Test and Trace or by the NHS Covid app,"" a No 10 spokeswoman said. ""Businesses should be supporting employees to isolate, they should not be encouraging them to break isolation."" Now that legal restrictions have been lifted in England, cases of coronavirus will undoubtedly rise further. But a significant number of adults are not yet fully vaccinated. In the meantime, the test and trace system remains the only way the government can contain the virus to a level it deems acceptable. So the message on how closely people should follow the advice to isolate if ""pinged"" by the app is crucial. Although it's not a legal requirement to do so (only if contacted directly by test and trace) any suggestion that it's up to you, optional, or a judgement call risks undermining the government's entire approach. That's why we saw a junior minister's choice of words was quickly corrected by Downing Street this morning. The rules change next month, allowing double jabbed adults to avoid isolation. Until then the government will have to hope it can keep the public's confidence in the app and its instructions to isolate. John Edmunds, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said contact tracing and self-isolation should be maintained ""as stringently as we can"". ""We have one of the highest rates of cases in the world right now. The NHS has been under strain for a long time and they are busy trying to catch up on operations and are very, very busy. So to put them under more pressure now is going to be awkward,"" he told Times Radio. Justin Madders, Labour's shadow health minister, accused the government of ""making it up as they go along"". ""Yet again there is more confusion and incompetence from the heart of government at the expense of public health. They need to get a grip,"" he said. While the Covid app can only advise people to self-isolate, anyone in England who is called, texted or emailed by NHS Test and Trace must isolate for 10 days. Failure to self-isolate for the full time period can result in a fine, starting from Â£1,000. In other developments: In the week ending 9 July, there were 213 deaths involving Covid reported in England, Scotland and Wales - 82 more than were registered the previous week, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (there were no figures available for Northern Ireland because of a bank holiday) More than one million children in England were out of schoollast week due to Covid-related reasons, government figures show LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Extreme heat warnings for UK to last until Friday,"Extreme heat warnings are in place until Friday as the heatwave continues. Public Health England extended itsheat-health alert,externaluntil Friday, as temperatures hit 32.2C (89.9F) at Heathrow Airport, making it the hottest day of the year again. The Met Office has issued two new-style extreme heat weather warnings and told people to watch out for sunburn and heat exhaustion. It has also warned of thunderstorms for parts of England. One of the amber heat warnings,externalcovers parts of Wales, all of south-west England and parts of southern and central England. It will be in place until Thursday, when temperatures are expected to peak. The second amber warning, which is for Northern Ireland, is in place from 08:00 BST on Wednesday to 23:59 on Friday. Public Health England advises staying out of the sun between 11:00 and 15:00, drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding excess alcohol and physical exertion during the hottest parts of the day. The two amber warnings in place for thunderstorms last until 19:00 on Tuesday. One is in the East of England, taking in Cambridgeshire, Essex and Suffolk, while the other affect parts of London and south-east England, including Greater London, Kent and Medway. The storms could last for two to three hours with a few places may seeing 40 to 60mm (1.6 to 2.4in) of rain in one or two hours. There is a wider yellow weather warning for isolated thunderstorms across south-east England on Tuesday, lasting from 13:00 to midnight, with the Met Office saying there could be torrential rain, lightning, large hail and gusty winds. 10 tips for sleeping in hot weather Heatwaves and the human body The Met Office is warning that over the next few days many people could be at risk of sunburn or heat exhaustion, including dehydration, nausea and fatigue. The more vulnerable are being warned of more adverse health effects. And it has warned that, as temperatures soar, some heat-sensitive systems and equipment may fail, leading to power cuts. There could also be delays to road, rail and air travel, meaning people experiencing long delays might suffer. The Met Office said the high temperatures were expected in the day and at night, meaning disrupted sleep for many. It also warned that as more people visited coastal areas, lakes and rivers, there was an ""increased risk of water safety incidents"". Six people drowned in English lakes and rivers over the weekend,with rescuers warning of the invisible but deadly dangers of open water. And a 13-year-old boydrowned in a lake in County Downon Monday. In Scotland, people watering plants and filling paddling poolsincreased the demand for waterby 200 million litres a day last week, Scottish Water said. Kes Juskowiak, operations general manager at Scottish Water, said the company had ""struggled"" to meet demand in places, with tankers used to ensure supply. People walking on the seafront at Bournemouth on Tuesday BBC Weather forecaster Matt Taylorsaid the high day-time and high night-time temperatures are set to continue for the coming days. Northern Ireland, in particular, is going to see further increases in temperature on Wednesday and Thursday and could get close to breaking the record -set only last weekend- for its hottest day. Thing will start to cool down again over the weekend, with temperatures returning to those expected at this time of year of between 20C and 25C (68-77F). He said hot spells like this one do happen every summer - but that extreme heat episodes in the UK are becoming more frequent, prolonged and hotter. According to the Met Office, warm spells have more than doubled in length, from 5.3 days in 1960-1991 to more than 13 days between 2008 and 2017.

The Met Office launched its new extreme heat warning,externalat the start of June 2021 to highlight potential widespread disruption and adverse health effects. Amber is the second-highest level in the system. It comes after a record-breaking number of heatwave deaths were recorded in England last summer. Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world take steep cuts to emissions. If they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious. The NHS advice is to: Move them to a cool place. Get them to lie down and raise their feet slightly Get them to drink plenty of water - sports or rehydration drinks are also OK Cool their skin - spray or sponge them with cool water and fan them. Cold packs around the armpits or neck are good too However, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heat stroke. It is a medical emergency and you should call 999. People with heat stroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot, their temperature could have passed 40C and they may have seizures or lose consciousness.

Backlash as pinged staff rules called unworkable,"Industry bodies have reacted with dismay at the government's plan for firms to apply for staff to be exempt from coronavirus self-isolation rules. The government has said there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be ""considered on a case-by-case basis"". Karen Dee, chief executive of the airport operators association, said the scheme was ""simply unworkable"". The food supply industry called for clarity on how the scheme would work. The new policy comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that fully-vaccinated people in critical roles in England would be able to continue workingeven if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid.The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms. Individual businesses will have to contact their relevant government department to apply for any exemption. Those deemed eligible, which includes NHS and care staff, will be able to take daily tests instead. Downing Street said that the first exemptions around self-isolation have been given in some critical sectors. The number of exceptions outside of the NHS is expected to be relatively small, and not reach the high tens of thousands. There are ongoing discussions with companies in critical industries. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""A number of those exemptions are in process of being granted or have been granted."" 'Pingdemic' Firms have warned of increasing staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app.Iceland and Greene King saidon Monday they had had to shut shops and pubs as a result. Business lobby group the CBI has warned that the problem could hamper the economic recovery. Rod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said the plan felt like it had been ""thought up on the hoof without proper organisation or thought"". ""Truckers were classed as essential workers at the start of the pandemic; now they may be or may not be,"" he said. ""It's too confusing. The criteria isn't clear and it risks being both unfair and devastating to an already creaking supply chain."" Ms Dee, of the airport operators association, said the government ""must reconsider and exempt categories of workers"", such as airport security staff  and air traffic controllers from the requirement to self-isolate. ""As 24-hour operations, we need clear rules that are workable and easy to implement or there is a risk of unnecessary temporary closures,"" she said. ""Applying for each individual for an exemption from self-quarantine if they are 'pinged' is simply unworkable."" 'Pingdemic' shuts Iceland and Greene King sites Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said: ""What is the application process for businesses to use this? Who will qualify? Do you have to prove you are severely affected? How long will it take? ""If it's not simple and quick, it will not help and most businesses will have to ignore it. He said the number of people absent in the food sector due to isolation requests was ""growing exponentially across the food supply chain"". Andrew Selley is the chief executive of food wholesaler Bidfood, which has about 5,000 employees across the UK and 24 depots. He said the number of staff who were self-isolating changed on a day-to-day basis, but added the company had ""well over 100 people"" off at the moment. The firm, which has large contracts with schools, hospitals and prisons, recently had half a shift off at one depot due to staff being told to isolate. Mr Selley said it was a ""little ridiculous"" to expect individual companies to seek exemptions for staff who had been told to self-isolate. He added entire sectors, such as food supply, should be exempted and the government's scheme should work in the ""same way it did for key workers"" at the beginning of the pandemic. The government has saidit is ""crucial"" for people to quarantine after being ""pinged""by the NHS Covid-19 app. Its message comes after business minister Paul Scully said it was a decision for individuals and employers whether they should isolate after a ""ping"" from the app. The Times reported that another minister in the business department, Lord Grimstone of Boscobel, stressed in a letter to one large employer that the app was only an ""advisory tool"" and that people were not under any ""legal duty"". The prime minister's official spokesman said ""business-critical areas"" would be able to apply to be exempt from isolating. ""It's not a blanket exemption and my understanding is we're not going to be producing a list covering individual sectors,"" he said. ""It's important that anyone who feels they're in a critical industry or wants to raise potential issues because of isolation are able to contact departments and get advice and where necessary get exemptions."" Asked specifically about supermarket workers, the spokesman said: ""We're not seeking to draw lines specifically around who or who is not exempt. ""What's important is to make sure critical services are able to function and get that balance right between requiring people to isolate... but also making sure critical services can function.""

Officers told not to check green and amber arrivals,"Travellers to England from green and amber list countries may no longer face Covid checks on arrival - according to a union representing border staff. Officers will no longer routinely verify arrivals have tested negative before departure or completed a passenger locator form, the ISU said. The Guardianfirst reported,externalthe change and said it aimed to reduce queues. The government said carriers were checking all necessary requirements including forms and test bookings. A spokesperson added: ""This legal requirement on carriers is underpinned by a robust compliance regime, which is overseen by regulators. ""Compliance with these rules is essential in order to protect the population from new variants of Covid-19, and so there will be tough fines for those who do not follow the rules."" Airlines UK, which represents easyJet, Tui and British Airways among others, said: ""Carriers are committed to working with Border Force on these requirements, which is why compliance has remained consistently extremely high."" But Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the government of ""yet more staggering incompetence"" and added: ""They must - urgently - get a grip."" How have summer holiday rules changed? Your travel guide to seven Mediterranean countries From Monday, carriers were asked to begin checking vaccine status certification. They were already legally required to ensure passengers have completed necessary requirements before travelling. The Guardian said it had seen a leaked memo that told border staff they no longer had to search for a passenger locator form when the computer system failed to find one. The memo also reportedly confirmed that electronic border gates ""will no longer refer passengers to in-person checks by Border Force officers if a passenger locator form is not found"". The memo, which the Guardian said became operational on Monday as other restrictions eased in England, has not been seen by the BBC. Border Force officers were previously instructed to check 100% of passenger Covid documentation at the border - a direction blamed by some for contributing to queues of up to six hours. Previously about 10% of passenger Covid documentation had been checked. But Lucy Moreton, of the ISU trade union, confirmed the reported memo was accurate. ""Ultimately this is a political decision,"" Ms Moreton said. ""Certainly, it will reduce queue times significantly and hopefully also the level of verbal abuse to which Border Force staff are subject. ""That is welcome to us. The impact on the UK's Covid security is ultimately a scientific determination."" Transport Secretary Grant Shappshas warned of continuing disruption to travel, saying passengers should expect much of that to be focused at check-in and before travel, rather than at the border. All arrivals regardless of where they are coming from abroad are required to test negative before departure and have valid proof of their test status. They are also required to conduct another test two days after their arrival, and prove this is organised pre-departure. All travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form with basic details including an address. Those arriving from amber list countries, who are not fully vaccinated, must also complete a further test on day eight and quarantine at an address listed on the form. People who have been fully vaccinated are no longer required to carry out home quarantine when arriving from an amber list country. Arrivals from red list countries must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days, at a cost of at least Â£1,750 per adult. Additional reporting by George Bowden.

Thousands evacuated as deadly floods hit ChinaRecord rainfall has left more than 12 dead and flooded stations and roads in Zhengzhou city.China,"This video can not be played Commuters and children rescued from China floodwaters Twelve people have died after record-breaking rainfall flooded underground railway tunnels in China, leaving passengers trapped in rising waters. Video shared on social media shows evening commuters just managing to keep their heads above water. Water is seen rushing onto platforms. More than 500 people were eventually rescued from the tunnels in Henan province, officials said. Days of rain have caused widespread damage and led to 200,000 evacuations. Above ground, roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris swept along in fast moving currents. A number ofpedestrians have had to be rescued. In total, 25 people have died in Henan province and more than a dozen cities are affected. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that there had been ""significant loss of life and damage to property"". Several dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels, and soldiers have been mobilised to divert rivers which have burst their banks. Flights and trains in many parts of Henan have also been suspended. In the provincial capital  Zhengzhou, the equivalent of a year's average rainfall has fallen in just three days. On Tuesday, some of the city's flood defences were overwhelmed and water began flowing down into the railway tunnels. Survivors have described how water leaked through the doors, rising slowly from ""our ankles to our knees to our necks"". ""All of us who could, stood on the subway seats,"" one woman wrote on Chinese social network site Weibo. Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes Children were lifted out of the water by their parents, while others threw off anything which might hold them down. After about half an hour, one passenger said it became ""hard to breathe"". An order to shut down the line came at 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) so the evacuation could begin, Zhengzhou government officials said in a statement. Five people are being treated for injuries, with 12 having died. Elsewhere in the central Chinese city, children had to be rescued from a flooded nursery school. State media aired footage of them being floated out in plastic tubs by rescuers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou Hospital also briefly lost power on Tuesday night, though this has now been restored, said a statement on Weibo by the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee. It added that 600 critically ill patients had been transferred to another location. Another resident, identified as Mr Liu, 27, told BBC Chinese he had had ""no water, no electricity, and no internet"". ""Never in my life had I seen so much rain,"" Mr Liu added. ""There was one hour where the rain was just pouring down on us from the heavens, and everything went completely white."" But the rising waters were not just confined to Zhengzhou. A 20-metre (65ft) breach has emerged in the dam in Luoyang city after it was damaged by storms, officials said. Soldiers have been deployed to the area and a statement from the army warned it could ""collapse at any time"". Another user said that residents in Sishui town were stuck on rooftops. ""We don't know how to swimâ¦ the whole village is about to be washed away,"" the person wrote. Henan has experienced ""rare and severe rainfall"" since Saturday, China's meteorological authority said on Wednesday. Zhengzhou saw 624mm of rainfall on Tuesday, with a third of that amount falling between 16:00 and 17:00 alone, which ""smashed historical records"". It forecasted that parts of the region would continue to see ""severe or extremely severe storms"" and that the heavy rain was likely to end only on Thursday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Part of the Yellow River basin in China, Henan has several major river systems running through the province which are prone to flooding. Zhengzhou, which has a population of 12 million, sits on the banks of the Yellow River itself. Scientists have warned that widespread dam construction has exacerbated climate change problems in China's flood zone, says the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell. Connections between rivers and lakes have been cut and disrupted flood plains which once absorbed much of the region's annual summer downpours.

"UK-France deal to tackle rise in Channel crossingsFrance will double the number of police patrolling beaches, as record numbers cross the Channel.UK","This video can not be played The BBC's Jon Donnison spoke to some of the migrants trying to make the dangerous journey France will double the number of police patrolling its beaches as part of a deal with the UK to stem the number of migrants crossing the English Channel. It comes as the number of people crossing the Channel this year has now overtaken 2020's total. The UK will pay more than Â£54m as part of the deal, which will also improve intelligence sharing. But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont suggested it would not have an impact as the French coastline is too big. He told the Today programme: ""The fact is, we've seen it before. Having more money, having more police officers, having more controls, will not prevent people to succeed in these crossing attempts. ""We have too many kilometres of shore to monitor."" The funding will also be used for better technology to target those who organise the crossings, the Home Office said. Record 430 migrants cross Channel in single day What happens to migrants who reach the UK? June sees record number of Channel migrants arrive A group of migrants was seen arriving at Dover on Wednesday morning, bringing the total number this year to more than the 8,461 who made the crossing in 2020. On Monday at least 430 migrants crossed the Channel - a record for one day. The previous daily high of 416was set in September last year. The Home Office said on Tuesday 287 people had landed in the UK. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel and French interior minister Gerald Darmanin have agreed to ""strengthen co-operation"" over the crossings. The Home Office said UK support last year helped France double the number of officers deployed daily on the beaches of its northern coast. It said this resulted in France preventing twice as many crossings so far this year compared with the same period in 2020. However, it said the people who facilitated the crossings had now changed their tactics and had moved further up the French coast, ""forcing migrants to take even longer, riskier journeys"". Mr Dumont added that the French are not supposed to intervene at sea - yet former Border Force chief Tony Smith has called for joint patrols. Mr Smith said: ""That seems to be a step too far for the French at the moment. The French position is they are not prepared to intervene on the high seas, only on land."" A group of people thought to be migrants are escorted by Border Patrol in Dungeness on Tuesday The new support announced by the UK would enable France ""to respond by posting more security forces further up the coast, installing and utilising the latest surveillance equipment throughout northern France"", the Home Office said. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins insisted thata Â£28m deal,externalbetween the UK and France last November, to double police patrols on French beaches, had made a difference, saying it had prevented some 7,500 people crossing the Channel. Ms Atkins told Today it was an ""incredibly complicated"" situation and that the UK was trying to work with other countries to make sure ""when people arrive in a safe country, they remain there and do not try to make that hazardous journey"". She said the government wanted ""safe routes for legal migrants"" and to crack down on the gangs bringing people over. Analysis by Simon Jones, BBC reporter, in Dover From the famous White Cliffs of Dover, we watched this morning as another group of migrants was brought to shore by the Border Force, having been picked up in the Channel. Conditions at sea are once again incredibly calm and the sun is shining, so these are unlikely to be the only arrivals today. Almost 1,000 people have reached the UK by boat in the past three days, putting pressure on the home secretary to act. Priti Patel is now pledging more money to the French authorities to try to prevent the crossings. But the deal struck last night is very similar to one agreed between Britain and France last November - which has failed to stem the numbers arriving, though the Home Office points out the number of crossings being prevented by the French authorities has doubled. The government here accepts there is no quick and easy fix to problems with the asylum system, but there's no doubt the home secretary will want to see swift results in return for the increased investment in northern France. Ms Patel has previously pledged to make Channel crossings ""unviable"", with new legislation that will make it a crime to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission. The Nationality and Borders Bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, will mean migrants entering without permission could face up to four years in prison. The government hopes the overhaul of asylum rules will deter migrants from making the crossing. But the plans have been criticised by charities including Refugee Action, which has called them ""extreme and nasty"". A dinghy's arrival being watched over by the crew of an RNLI lifeboat Dan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander for the Home Office, said: ""There is an unacceptable rise in dangerous small boat crossings across the Channel because of a surge in illegal migration across Europe. ""People should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach and not risk their lives making these dangerous crossings. We are continuing to pursue the criminals behind these illegal crossings."" He added that the Nationality and Borders Bill would ""protect lives and break this cycle of illegal crossings"" and the government was continuing to return those with no legal right to remain in the UK. But Amnesty International's Steve Valdez-Symonds told the BBC the new legislation was an ""extremely reckless and dangerous response"" to the issue and would not tackle the problem of people smugglers. Instead, he said it was likely to drive desperate people to avoid the authorities, leaving them vulnerable to further exploitation and slavery. Labour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Home Office announcement was ""yet more empty words from the Conservatives about agreeing a deal with France to address trafficking gangs"". He said ministers promised a plan with France in August 2020, ""yet almost a year later they are still making empty promises, letting down victims, and allowing criminals to continue their evil trade"".

Vaccine proof plans considered for some sports events,"The crowd capacity at Wembley for the Euro 2020 final in July was raised to more than 60,000 Fans attending sports venues with capacities of about 20,000 or more may be required to show proof of full vaccination from the end of September, under plans being considered by the government. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson announced on Mondaythere was a plan to mandate certification at nightclubs and ""other venues where large crowds gather"". The BBC understands the definition of what constitutes a large crowd and what type of venues would fall under this label is yet to be determined. Downing Street said on Tuesday that its focus is on ""closed indoor settings"". The prime minister's official spokesperson said: ""We're not seeking to draw lines around particular settings. ""I think Professor [Jonathan] van Tam and the PM talked about the sort of areas where we'd be looking at enclosed spaces where large groups of people are brought together. ""We're going to be looking at the latest data which currently is very focused on nightclubs. But we'll be looking at the data both here and globally to consider what's the best approach."" A government spokesperson said: ""As the Prime Minister said, we reserve the right to do what is necessary to protect the public and reduce transmission, including mandating Covid certification in certain settings. ""We are working closely with organisations that operate large, crowded settings, where people are likely to be in close proximity to others outside their household, to encourage the use of the NHS Covid pass, where appropriate."" Indoor venues are expected to be treated differently to outdoor ones, and sports organisations are known to be seeking clarity on the matter. The Racecourse Association (RCA), for example, said it would be speaking to the government and industry stakeholders ""to understand the detail behind this plan"", and said it would be a ""significant logistical operation"". The RCA added: ""It is vital that horse racing and the wider sports/leisure economies have contingency plans to avoid commercially damaging restrictions being re-imposed but equally allow us to host safe events"". The UK government allowed the crowd capacity at Wembley to be raised to more than 60,000 for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020. Permitted under the government's Events Research Programme, fans attending Wembley were required to follow a number of strict entry requirements, including having a negative Covid-19 test or proof of full vaccination. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said on Monday that nightclubs and other such venues could be ""potential super-spreading events"" because of crowds in close contact. A capacity crowd of 140,000attended the British Grand Prixat Silverstone on Sunday - the largest crowd for a sporting event in the UK since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. There, all adults had to provide proof of full vaccination or be in possession of a negative test. In Scotland,Rangers have been given permissionto have 17,000 fans present at their Scottish Premiership opener against Livingston on 31 July. In May, Premier League executive director Bill Bush told the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus that a ""single magic wand like a vaccine passport"" would be ""too narrow and too prescriptive"". He said he wanted to work with the Government on a ""broader-based"" solution to certification at events. It is understood consultation with Premier League clubs on what approach will be taken to checking fans on entry to stadia next season is ongoing.

UK row with EU over Gibraltar's post-Brexit statusForeign Secretary Dominic Raab says a draft EU mandate undermines UK sovereignty over the territory.UK Politics,"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab met Chief Minister Fabian Picardo in Gibraltar in March. The foreign secretary has accused the EU of seeking ""to undermine the UK's sovereignty over Gibraltar"". Dominic Raab said he was ""disappointed"" by EU proposals for a post-Brexit deal over the British overseas territory. Mr Raab said a draft mandate from the European Commission ""directly conflicts"" with a framework deal agreed by the UK, Gibraltar and Spain last December. EU leaders must sign off on the EU's mandate before negotiations can begin. Gibraltar's sovereignty is disputed by Spain and Britain. The territory was not included in the trade agreement settled between the EU and the UK last year and a separate deal has to be agreed. It is thought that British objections to the EU plans centre on the nature of proposed new border arrangements in Gibraltar. End to Gibraltar land border prompts joy and trepidation UK Brexit minister says EU negotiations 'a little tense' Last December's political deal between the UK, Gibraltar and Spain gave a prominent role to the EU's border agency Frontex but the Commission's mandate appears to give greater responsibility to Spanish officials. In a statement, the foreign secretary said: ""We have consistently showed pragmatism and flexibility in the search for arrangements that work for all sides, and we are disappointed that this has not been reciprocated. We urge the EU to think again."" The European Commission said the proposed negotiating directives ""put forward solutions to remove physical checks and controls on persons and goods"" at the border between Spain and Gibraltar. ""It is without prejudice to the issues of sovereignty and jurisdiction, and focuses on cooperation in the region,"" the bloc added. The mandate includes rules for establishing responsibility for asylum, visas, residence permits and police cooperation and information exchange. The EU's post-Brexit negotiator, Maros Sefcovic, said its proposals seek to make a ""positive impact"" on those living either side of the border with Spain while protecting the single market. ""By putting forward this draft mandate, we are honouring the political commitment we made to Spain to start the negotiations of a separate agreement between the EU and the UK on Gibraltar. ""This is a detailed mandate, which aims to have a positive impact for those living and working on either side of the border between Spain and Gibraltar, while protecting the integrity of the Schengen Area and the single market."" In March the Foreign Secretary, and Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo agreed a joint approach to the negotiations on a new Gibraltar treaty between the EU and the UK.

Horse-racing bosses condemn abattoir footage,"This video can not be played Inside the abattoir slaughtering racehorses Irish and British horse-racing authorities have condemned footage that revealed evidence of a UK abattoir breaking welfare rules when slaughtering former racehorses. Horse Racing Ireland said the footage - which featured in a BBC Panorama investigation - was abhorrent. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) met welfare experts earlier to discuss the issue ""as a matter of urgency"". The abattoir told the BBC it did not accept any form of animal abuse. The covert footage, recorded by the anti-horse racing campaign group Animal Aid, showed horses being killed in front of each other and being shot from a distance at Drury and Sons - one of the UK's biggest abattoirs and one of the few licensed to slaughter horses. Veterinary experts said these actions broke guidelines, causing extra pain and trauma for the horses involved. BHA welfare director James Given said: ""We're all clear that the transporting of horses from Ireland to be euthanised in Britain must stop. ""So too should those practices in the abattoir featured in the programme, which appeared to cause distress to horses."" The BHA said a new welfare strategy, published in 2020, specifically sought to address the care of horses after their racing days were over. Horse Racing Ireland chief executive Brian Kavanagh said: ""The images we saw last night were abhorrent to all within Irish racing and in no way reflect the care and attention given to the overwhelming majority of horses in Ireland."" Freedom of Information requests have revealed that 4,000 former racehorses have been slaughtered in Britain and Ireland since the beginning of 2019. The vast majority were trained in Ireland, and some were once owned and trained by some of the biggest names in racing. Thousands of racehorses killed in slaughterhouses The Panorama film also included claims that attempts were being made to get contaminated horse meat into the human food chain by falsifying paperwork and tampering with horse microchips. Horse meat is not popular in the UK, but there is a sizeable export market for it in Europe. Horse passports and matching microchips are important as they show which animals have been treated with medicines that could be harmful to humans, such as the painkiller Bute. Horse Racing Ireland said it had contacted the Irish police about one attempt to tamper with a horse's microchip, as revealed in the Panorama investigation.  At the time, an on-site Foods Standards Agency vet spotted the problem and the horse was not sold for meat. In response to the Panorama investigation, the UK government's Food Standards Agency (FSA), which regulates abattoirs, said: ""Upholding animal welfare and the safety and authenticity of the food we eat is a top priority for the government."" It said it worked closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ""to ensure that animal welfare is maintained at all stages of food production and that all our food is correctly labelled and safe to eat"". The BHA and Horse Racing Ireland said they would support an investigation by UK authorities. The abattoir, Drury and Sons, told Panorama they ""take great care to maintain high welfare conditions and do not accept any form of animal abuse"". They said all horses are ""humanely destroyed',' and that on occasions where issues do occur, they take ''swift action to review and rectify them"".

US castigates China over climate change efforts,"John Kerry has travelled the world in recent months including going to Moscow last week US climate envoy John Kerry has called on China to increase the speed and depth of its efforts to cut carbon. Without sufficient emissions reductions by China, Mr Kerry said, the global goal of keeping temperatures under 1.5C  was ""essentially impossible"". Mr Kerry said he was convinced that China could do more and the US was willing to work closely to secure a reasonable climate future. Every major economy must now commit to meaningful reductions by 2030, he said. Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity US climate envoy criticised for clean tech optimism Shipping industry calls for new global carbon tax Mr Kerry was speaking at Kew Gardens in London, ahead of a G20 environment ministers meeting in Italy later this week. Referring to the key COP26 gathering in Glasgow in November, the former Secretary of State said that ""in little more than 100 days we can save the next 100 years"". Doing so would not be easy he said. Mr Kerry said that the promises made during and since the Paris climate agreement in 2015 would still see the world's temperature increase by 2.5-3C. ""We're already seeing dramatic consequences with 1.2C of warming,"" he said, referring to recent heatwaves in the US and Canada, and flooding in Europe. ""To contemplate doubling that is to invite catastrophe."" He castigated the efforts of some countries which are still building new coal-fired power stations. He was scornful of nations that are illegally cutting down the rainforest ""They're removing the lungs of the world, destroying irreplaceable biodiversity and destabilising the climate all at the same time."" Observers say that the envoy was likely referring to Brazil and Indonesia. Recent flooding in Germany has put climate change on the top of the political agenda Mr Kerry paid special attention to the efforts of China, saying the country was now ""the largest driver of climate change"". China has promised to peak emissions by 2030 - but the US diplomat said that was not good enough. ""If China sticks with its current plant and does not peak its emissions until 2030, then the entire rest of the world must go to zero by 2040 or even 2035,"" he warned. ""There is simply no alternative because without sufficient reduction by China, the goal of 1.5C is essentially impossible. China's partnership and leadership on this issue of extraordinary international consequence is essential."" Mr Kerry said he was convinced that China could outperform the targets it had set itself and that despite their diplomatic differences, the US was keen to co-operate. Heatwaves are hitting many parts of the world as the climate warms He also said all other major economies would have to step up, with more ambitious targets and plans for the next decade. Mr Kerry's comments come as new research shows that G20 countries are continuing to support fossil fuels in ways that are incompatible with the goals of the Paris agreement. This video can not be played What is behind the extreme heat? According to Bloomberg'sClimate Policy Factbook,external, G20 nations collectively cut fossil fuel funding by 10% from 2015 to 2019. However, eight countries, including the US, Canada and Australia increased their financial support for oil, coal and gas in this period. Last week, Mr Kerry travelled to Moscow where both sides agreed that the climate issue is one of common interest. President Putin said that Moscow ""attaches great importance"" to achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement. In May, Mr Kerry wascriticised by some scientistsfor rejecting the idea that Americans would have to change their consumption habits, for example, eating less meat.

Key Nike trainer factory hit by Covid outbreak,"Production at some of Nike's largest plants in Vietnam has been disrupted as Covid has spread through factories. The company refused to comment on whether store supplies would see shortages as a result of the outbreak. About half of Nike's shoes were manufactured in Vietnam in the last financial year, so this will mean challenges for its supply chain. Vietnam has seen a record rise in cases since last April with many infection clusters in its industrial provinces. Apple, Samsung and Puma could also be affected by the surge in cases recorded at suppliers' factories in the country. ""The health and safety of our teammates, as well as that of our suppliers, remains our top priority,"" a statement from Nike said. What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines? France probes retailers over forced labour claims Nike said the company would continue to work with its suppliers to support them in response to the rise in Covid cases. ""We are confident in Nike's ability to navigate these near-term dynamics, and we remain prudent in our planning,"" the statement added. One of Nike's worst affected suppliers in the region, Pou Chen Corp, also makes footwear for Adidas and is the world's largest manufacturer of branded trainers. It suspended operations at its plant in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday due to the outbreak in infections. In a statement, the country's health ministry said Pou Chen's Pouyuen Vietnam factory would be suspended for 10 days. The factory is Ho Chi Minh City's largest employer, with a total of 56,000 workers. But it was unable to stay open and arrange for its workers to sleep at the factory, as was required by authorities to limit the spread of infections, according to the health ministry. Nike employs over 450,000 workers in the country, 80 % of whom are women. Similar challenges could also be faced for Puma, whose footwear is also manufactured in the country. Apple and Samsung also have large suppliers in the worst affected factories in the northern region of Vietnam. Apple did not give a comment on whether the outbreak will mean item shortages in shops, while Adidas, Puma and Samsung did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Samsung makes around half of its phones in Vietnam and has had to stop work at three factories in Ho Chin Minh City. According to the health ministry's website, Samsung Electronics is planning for workers to sleep at the plants and has currently cut its staffing to 3,000 from 7,000. Many firms had begun to move their production from China to countries such as Vietnam as a result of challenges from tariffs over the course of the pandemic. Dr Patsy Perry, senior lecturer in fashion business at Manchester Metropolitan University, told the BBC these problems are compounded by the Covid-related surge in demand for athletic wear as people have been spending more time at home. ""This shows the risk of overreliance on a particular sourcing region,"" she explained. Bu, Dr Perry said that Nike's manufacturing map means it could potentially move production the other countries, depending how agile its supply chain relationships are. ""Costs might increase in the short term if it needs to move production into more expensive areas, but it's more important to service demand than risking a stock-out situation,"" Dr Perry added. Dr Steve New, professor of operations management at the University of Oxford's SaÃ¯d Business School, told the BBC that previously, because Vietnam has been effective at containing Covid, it has been able to respond rapidly with short local shutdowns. But he said that as the situation worsens, ""it will be much harder to pursue this approach without much more significant disruption to the supply chain."" Vietnam has vaccinated around 4% of its 100 million population. Its capital Hanoi has stopped all non-essential services due to new clusters of Covid infections and on Sunday urged its citizens to stay at home. The government added factory workers to its vaccine priority list after the rise in cases in late April forced manufacturing areas in the north of the country to close.

Compensation closer for women's pensions campaign,"Government officials were too slow to tell many women they would be affected by the rising state pension age, the Parliamentary Ombudsman has ruled. The finding brings the prospect of compensation closer for thousands of women born in the 1950s who have long been furious about the issue. It marks a significant victory for the Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaign. However, the ombudsman has no power to refund ""lost"" pensions. It is also unable to recommend that anyone receive their state pension any earlier than the current law allows. The fight over women's state pensions Angela Madden, who chairs the Waspi campaign, said: ""The findings reinforce what we, unfortunately, knew all along; that the DWP failed to adequately inform 3.8 million 1950s-born women that their state pension age would be increasing. ""These women have been waiting for many years for compensation. We cannot wait any longer. We are calling on the government to agree fair and adequate compensation rather than allow what has become a vicious cycle of government inaction to continue."" The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, andcurrently stands at 66for men and women. The increases have been controversial. Campaigners claim women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected. Many thousands said they had no idea they would have to wait longer to receive their state pension, and had suffered financial and emotional distress as a result. The ombudsman's initial finding of maladministration by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) centres on a delay in providing direct information to this group of women. While some women were aware of the general policy change, they did not know it would affect them personally. The ombudsman said that letters should have been sent directly to these women more than two years earlier than they were. For some, the delay was much longer. ""We have found that DWP failed to act quickly enough once it knew a significant proportion of women were not aware of changes to their state pension age,"" said Amanda Amroliwala, chief executive of the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. ""It should have written to the women affected at least 28 months earlier than it did. We will now consider the impact of these failings, and what action should be taken to address them."" Ms Madden, from Waspi, said the DWP's own research showed that women were not sufficiently aware of the changes ""yet they failed to act"". ""This inaction had devastating and life-altering impacts on women across the country,"" she said. The ombudsman considered six sample cases, but said the DWP should apply any subsequent recommendations to all of those affected. Whereas Waspi has called for bridging payments, the separate Backto60 group has campaigned for the state pension age for women affected to be returned to 60, and for these women to be refunded the pensions they had ""lost"" owing to the changes. The ombudsman has no power to do so, but it can recommend compensation is paid to those affected by the DWP's maladministration. There is no timeline for the remainder of its investigations, but it is planning to move as quickly as possible. It is unable to recommend any change in policy, which could have brought much larger sums in compensation. A series of court decisions found in favour of the government in terms of the changing pension age itself. A DWP spokesman said: ""Both the High Court and Court of Appeal have supported the actions of the DWP, under successive governments dating back to 1995, and the Supreme Court refused the claimants permission to appeal. ""In a move towards gender equality, it was decided more than 25 years ago to make the state pension age the same for men and women."" What is the row about women's pensions?

Horse-racing bosses hold talks on abattoir images,"This video can not be played Inside the abattoir slaughtering racehorses Irish and British horse-racing authorities have condemned footage that revealed evidence of a UK abattoir breaking welfare rules when slaughtering former racehorses. Horse Racing Ireland said the footage - which featured in a BBC Panorama investigation - was abhorrent. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) met welfare experts earlier to discuss the issue ""as a matter of urgency"". The abattoir told the BBC it did not accept any form of animal abuse. The covert footage, recorded by the anti-horse racing campaign group Animal Aid, showed horses being killed in front of each other and being shot from a distance at Drury and Sons - one of the UK's biggest abattoirs and one of the few licensed to slaughter horses. Veterinary experts said these actions broke guidelines, causing extra pain and trauma for the horses involved. BHA welfare director James Given said: ""We're all clear that the transporting of horses from Ireland to be euthanised in Britain must stop. ""So too should those practices in the abattoir featured in the programme, which appeared to cause distress to horses."" The BHA said a new welfare strategy, published in 2020, specifically sought to address the care of horses after their racing days were over. Horse Racing Ireland chief executive Brian Kavanagh said: ""The images we saw last night were abhorrent to all within Irish racing and in no way reflect the care and attention given to the overwhelming majority of horses in Ireland."" Freedom of Information requests have revealed that 4,000 former racehorses have been slaughtered in Britain and Ireland since the beginning of 2019. The vast majority were trained in Ireland, and some were once owned and trained by some of the biggest names in racing. Thousands of racehorses killed in slaughterhouses The Panorama film also included claims that attempts were being made to get contaminated horse meat into the human food chain by falsifying paperwork and tampering with horse microchips. Horse meat is not popular in the UK, but there is a sizeable export market for it in Europe. Horse passports and matching microchips are important as they show which animals have been treated with medicines that could be harmful to humans, such as the painkiller Bute. Horse Racing Ireland said it had contacted the Irish police about one attempt to tamper with a horse's microchip, as revealed in the Panorama investigation.  At the time, an on-site Foods Standards Agency vet spotted the problem and the horse was not sold for meat. In response to the Panorama investigation, the UK government's Food Standards Agency (FSA), which regulates abattoirs, said: ""Upholding animal welfare and the safety and authenticity of the food we eat is a top priority for the government."" It said it worked closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ""to ensure that animal welfare is maintained at all stages of food production and that all our food is correctly labelled and safe to eat"". The BHA and Horse Racing Ireland said they would support an investigation by UK authorities. The abattoir, Drury and Sons, told Panorama they ""take great care to maintain high welfare conditions and do not accept any form of animal abuse"". They said all horses are ""humanely destroyed',' and that on occasions where issues do occur, they take ''swift action to review and rectify them"".

Almost a quarter of England's pupils out of school,"Elaine says repeated periods of self-isolation are a worry for her children's mental health Almost a quarter (23.3%) of pupils in England were out of school last week, the latest official attendance figures show. This means there were 1.7 million pupils absent, up from 1.5 million the week before. The latest figures include over a million off for Covid-related reasons, but only 47,000 actually had Covid. In secondary schools, the absence rate was nearer a third (32.7%) of pupils, while in primaries it was 17%. Some 661,500 pupils out of the total were absent from school for unspecified non-Covid related reasons. These figures show a snapshot of the situation in state schools last Thursday - before changes introduced from 19 July, which are intended to reduce the numbers having to be sent home. There has been speculation that many families may have chosen to take their children out of school early so isolation rules do not interfere with holiday plans. While others, including some teaching unions, have highlighted the impact of the pandemic on pupil engagement and mental health. Elaine Blowers and her family in Hampshire are among many hundreds of thousands of families affected by having to self isolate. She says each time it happens, the mental health of her daughter Gracie and son Harley is affected. How will school be different next term? 1.5m pupils out of school in England last week Mrs Blowers, a mum of two young, primary-aged children in Andover told how her son and daughter had to isolate due to one person in their class testing positive. Both children took a PCR test and were Covid-negative. Her son, Harley, has special needs and has missed out on the additional help he gets in school and has not really got on well with home-learning. And she explained how her daughter, Gracie, experiences anxiety every time she has to isolate - developing nightmares and stomach pains. ""What is frustrating is that it is not the first time this has happened,"" she says. ""Every time we have always been negative and felt very frustrated that my children have had to be locked up and I've had to lose an income unnecessarily."" Elaine runs her own business as a childminder working from home, so every time her children need to isolate, it impacts her business. She said the current situation was tricky for parents. ""I know some parents have approached schools to keep children off so not to affect holidays. But other parents are still choosing to keep children in school. ""We've stuck to the rules but begrudgingly."" Elaine says both her children have really suffered by not being in school, but she does not blame the school which she says has been ""fantastic"" in offering support. ""The prime minister needs to get a grip and allow for people that are contacted to get a PCR test and if negative return to work or  school. This needs to change now - 16 August is too late,"" she says, referring to the date when Covid self-isolation rules are expected to change. ""It is having such a negative impact on businesses and people's, including children's, mental health."" A Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said: ""Our priority is for schools and colleges to deliver face-to-face, high quality education to all pupils as we know that being out of education causes significant harm to educational attainment, life chances, mental and physical health. ""Where children have needed to isolate, they must be offered immediate access to high-quality remote education."" He added that the DfE had now removed its system of grouping pupils in ""bubbles"" to restrict transmission, and that self-isolation would not be required next term for pupils coming into contact with positive cases. The National Association of Head Teachers' general secretary Paul Whiteman said the government's decision to end ""bubbles"" and school isolation requirements was intended to stop so many missing school. But he warned that rising case numbers would mean more disruption, unless there was action to prevent transmission in schools. ""The government's own modelling predicts that the number of cases among children and young people is only going to get worse by the start of next term,"" he added. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the latest figures ""bring a year of unprecedented educational disruption to a grim end"". He said schools and colleges needed substantial financial and practical support for on-site testing for students and ventilation systems ""This work cannot be done on the cheap and the government needs to stop counting the pennies and address the situation with a proper injection of support and funding,"" he added. Natalie Perera, chief executive of the Education Policy Institute said the stark figures on pupil absence underline the importance of education recovery programmes. ""Supporting pupils through this crisis has to be a number one priority for the government,"" she said. ""We need to see far more ambitious and better-targeted education recovery policies which address the scale of this challenge."" 1.5m pupils out of school in England last week Covid-related school absence hits new high LA officials giving update on wildfires as firefighters struggle to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Jeff Bezos launches to space aboard rocket shipThe world's richest man and three other passengers return safely just 11 minutes after take-off.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played The moment Jeff Bezos and crew launch into space on the first human flight of New Shepard Billionaire Jeff Bezos has made a short journey to space, in the first crewed flight of his rocket ship, New Shepard. He was accompanied by Mark Bezos, his brother, Wally Funk, an 82-year-old pioneer of the space race, and an 18-year-old student. They travelled in a capsule with the biggest windows flown in space, offering stunning views of the Earth. When the capsule touched back down after the 10-minute, 10-second flight, Jeff Bezos exclaimed: ""Best day ever!"" New Shepard, built by Bezos' company Blue Origin, is designed to serve the burgeoning market for space tourism. Amazon founder Mr Bezos - and other participants in the ""billionaire space race"" - have been criticised for offering what some see as joy rides for the super-wealthy. Critics say the money could be spent on pay rises for employees or fighting climate change. However, Mr Bezos insists he has an environmental vision: ""We need to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry and move it into space, and keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is,"" he told MSNBC. ""It's going to take decades and decades to achieve, but you have to start, and big things start with small steps... that's what this sub-orbital tourism mission allows us to do, it allows us to practice over and over."" Jeff Bezos sets date for space sightseeing flight Jeff Bezos and brother to fly to space in July Wally Funk, 82, joins Bezos space flight From left: Mark Bezos, Jeff Bezos, Oliver Daemen, Wally Funk On this flight was the oldest person who has been to space - Ms Funk - and the youngest, student Oliver Daemen. The spacecraft lifted off at 14:12 BST (09:12 EDT) from a private launch site near Van Horn, Texas. At a post-launch news briefing, Jeff Bezos said: ""My expectations were high and they were dramatically exceeded."" Two minutes into the flight, the capsule separated from its rocket and continued upwards towards the Karman Line - the most widely recognised boundary of space, that lies 100km up. The newly minted-astronauts shouted ""wow!"" and cheered. The moment the capsule touched down in the West Texas desert The post-flight briefing was shown video of the occupants performing somersaults and tumbles during four minutes of weightlessness. Stunning views of the Earth could be seen outside. Jeff Bezos said he was surprised by the sensation of microgravity: ""It felt so normal,"" he explained. Ms Funk added: ""It was great, I loved it, I can hardly wait to go again."" In the 1960s, Ms Funk was one member of a group of women called the Mercury 13. They underwent the same screening tests as male astronauts, but never got to fly under the US national space programme. Mr Bezos told CBS News on Monday: ""Wally can outrun all of us. During the Mercury 13, she was better than all the men and I can guarantee that's still true today."" Bezos' brother Mark, 53, is a senior vice president at Robin Hood, a New York-based charity. This video can not be played The Silicon Valley space race Oliver Daemen is the son of a Dutch financier. He had originally secured a seat on the second flight, but was drafted in to replaced the anonymous winner of a public auction who had to pull out from the trip with Bezos. The capsule reached a maximum altitude of around 107km (351,210ft) before starting its descent, parachuting down to a soft landing in the West Texas desert. Mr Bezos was delighted as he stepped out of the capsule after landing The passengers' families were at the landing site to greet them On the way down, Jeff Bezos told mission control: ""You have a very happy crew up here."" Mark revealed that iconic items from aviation history were brought along on the flight. These included a piece of canvas used on the Wright brothers' first plane, a medallion made from the vehicle that performed the first hot air balloon flight in 1783 and a pair of goggles used by pilot Amelia Earhart.

Backlash as 'pinged' staff rules called unworkable,"Industry bodies have reacted with dismay at the government's plan for firms to apply for staff to be exempt from coronavirus self-isolation rules. The government has said there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be ""considered on a case-by-case basis"". Karen Dee, chief executive of the airport operators association, said the scheme was ""simply unworkable"". The food supply industry called for clarity on how the scheme would work. The new policy comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that fully-vaccinated people in critical roles in England would be able to continue workingeven if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid.The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms. Individual businesses will have to contact their relevant government department to apply for any exemption. Those deemed eligible, which includes NHS and care staff, will be able to take daily tests instead. Downing Street said that the first exemptions around self-isolation have been given in some critical sectors. The number of exceptions outside of the NHS is expected to be relatively small, and not reach the high tens of thousands. There are ongoing discussions with companies in critical industries. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""A number of those exemptions are in process of being granted or have been granted."" 'Pingdemic' Firms have warned of increasing staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app.Iceland and Greene King saidon Monday they had had to shut shops and pubs as a result. Business lobby group the CBI has warned that the problem could hamper the economic recovery. Rod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said the plan felt like it had been ""thought up on the hoof without proper organisation or thought"". ""Truckers were classed as essential workers at the start of the pandemic; now they may be or may not be,"" he said. ""It's too confusing. The criteria isn't clear and it risks being both unfair and devastating to an already creaking supply chain."" Ms Dee, of the airport operators association, said the government ""must reconsider and exempt categories of workers"", such as airport security staff  and air traffic controllers from the requirement to self-isolate. ""As 24-hour operations, we need clear rules that are workable and easy to implement or there is a risk of unnecessary temporary closures,"" she said. ""Applying for each individual for an exemption from self-quarantine if they are 'pinged' is simply unworkable."" 'Pingdemic' shuts Iceland and Greene King sites Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said: ""What is the application process for businesses to use this? Who will qualify? Do you have to prove you are severely affected? How long will it take? ""If it's not simple and quick, it will not help and most businesses will have to ignore it. He said the number of people absent in the food sector due to isolation requests was ""growing exponentially across the food supply chain"". Andrew Selley is the chief executive of food wholesaler Bidfood, which has about 5,000 employees across the UK and 24 depots. He said the number of staff who were self-isolating changed on a day-to-day basis, but added the company had ""well over 100 people"" off at the moment. The firm, which has large contracts with schools, hospitals and prisons, recently had half a shift off at one depot due to staff being told to isolate. Mr Selley said it was a ""little ridiculous"" to expect individual companies to seek exemptions for staff who had been told to self-isolate. He added entire sectors, such as food supply, should be exempted and the government's scheme should work in the ""same way it did for key workers"" at the beginning of the pandemic. The government has saidit is ""crucial"" for people to quarantine after being ""pinged""by the NHS Covid-19 app. Its message comes after business minister Paul Scully said it was a decision for individuals and employers whether they should isolate after a ""ping"" from the app. The Times reported that another minister in the business department, Lord Grimstone of Boscobel, stressed in a letter to one large employer that the app was only an ""advisory tool"" and that people were not under any ""legal duty"". The prime minister's official spokesman said ""business-critical areas"" would be able to apply to be exempt from isolating. ""It's not a blanket exemption and my understanding is we're not going to be producing a list covering individual sectors,"" he said. ""It's important that anyone who feels they're in a critical industry or wants to raise potential issues because of isolation are able to contact departments and get advice and where necessary get exemptions."" Asked specifically about supermarket workers, the spokesman said: ""We're not seeking to draw lines specifically around who or who is not exempt. ""What's important is to make sure critical services are able to function and get that balance right between requiring people to isolate... but also making sure critical services can function.""

At a post-launch news briefing, Jeff Bezos said: ""My expectations were high and they were dramatically exceeded."" Two minutes into the flight, the capsule separated from its rocket and continued upwards towards the Karman Line - the most widely recognised boundary of space, that lies 100km up. The newly minted-astronauts shouted ""wow!"" and cheered. The moment the capsule touched down in the West Texas desert The post-flight briefing was shown video of the occupants performing somersaults and tumbles during four minutes of weightlessness. Stunning views of the Earth could be seen outside. Jeff Bezos said he was surprised by the sensation of microgravity: ""It felt so normal,"" he explained. Ms Funk added: ""It was great, I loved it, I can hardly wait to go again."" In the 1960s, Ms Funk was one member of a group of women called the Mercury 13. They underwent the same screening tests as male astronauts, but never got to fly under the US national space programme. Mr Bezos told CBS News on Monday: ""Wally can outrun all of us. During the Mercury 13, she was better than all the men and I can guarantee that's still true today."" Bezos' brother Mark, 53, is a senior vice president at Robin Hood, a New York-based charity. This video can not be played The Silicon Valley space race Oliver Daemen is the son of a Dutch financier. He had originally secured a seat on the second flight, but was drafted in to replaced the anonymous winner of a public auction who had to pull out from the trip with Bezos. The capsule reached a maximum altitude of around 107km (351,210ft) before starting its descent, parachuting down to a soft landing in the West Texas desert. Mr Bezos was delighted as he stepped out of the capsule after landing The passengers' families were at the landing site to greet them On the way down, Jeff Bezos told mission control: ""You have a very happy crew up here."" Mark revealed that iconic items from aviation history were brought along on the flight. These included a piece of canvas used on the Wright brothers' first plane, a medallion made from the vehicle that performed the first hot air balloon flight in 1783 and a pair of goggles used by pilot Amelia Earhart. Jeff Bezos recently resigned as chief executive of Amazon, the e-commerce giant he founded, in order to concentrate on his other ventures, including Blue Origin.

Man suffers life-threatening injuries in attack,"Millennium Bridge in Bute Park was cordoned off by police A man has been left with life-threatening injuries after being assaulted in a city park, police have said. Large parts of Bute Park, in Cardiff, were cordoned off after police were called to reports of an assault at about 01:10 BST on Tuesday. A man sustained serious head injures and is being treated at the University Hospital of Wales. South Wales Police said it was a ""violent and sustained attack"". Det Ch Insp Mark O'Shea said: ""To subject another person to violence in this way is intolerable, and we are carrying out a number of lines of inquiries to locate those involved. ""We know a number of people were around the area, and in Bute Park, at the time so if you witnessed the incident, or may have heard what took place, please come forward."" Initially, only an area around Servini's cafe was closed off A major incident room has been set up at Cardiff Central Police Station as officers investigate the crime. The force urged anyone who was in the Castle Street area between midnight and 02:00 on Tuesday, and has any dash cam or mobile phone footage, to share it with them. Members of the public were urged to stay away from the park, which would normally be very busy on a sunny day, while some entrances to the park, including the Millennium Bridge over the River Taff, had been shut. Initially, a smaller area around Servini's cafe was cordoned off, but the police later expanded the area. Some entrances to Bute Park were closed, including this one by Pettigrew's tearooms Cardiff council said: ""Prior to the pandemic, key city centre entrances to Bute Park were locked every night at sunset. ""The park is a large public open space and while it is not possible to prevent access after dark entirely, following the two recent serious incidents in the park, a decision has been taken to return to this locking regime with immediate effect.""

HMV backs High Street with plans for 10 new storesThe music chain's owner says people love shopping and want to touch goods before buying.BusinessComments,"Music and entertainment retailer HMV has said it is looking to open 10 new stores this year as it continues to put its faith in High Street stores. The plans include a search for a new London flagship site. Its former London landmark store on Oxford Street closed along with many others after HMV fell into administration more than two years ago. It was bought by Canadian music retail executive Doug Putman, who says he still thinks stores have a future. ""People obviously love going out shopping, they like touching and feeling and that's something that online is not going to replace,"" he told the BBC. ""I do believe... you're going to get more people trying to open up different stores and have different ideas. ""I'm still very optimistic on the [HMV] business and business as a whole on the High Street. I still think the High Street is just something so special."" The new store plans were announced as HMV commemorates opening its first store on London's Oxford Street 100 years ago. He said he could not give any details as to where the replacement flagship store in London would be as they were still taking a ""very hard look"" trying to find the best site. However, Mr Putman added that the long-term viability of the new stores was dependent on what the government did about business rates, which are currently being levied at a reduced rate until April next year. HMV would not be signing ""any long-term deals"" for the new stores, he said, given the level of uncertainty in the retail sector. Canadian Doug Putman bought HMV from administrators more than two years ago An HMV spokesman added: ""We're continuing to expand with new sites, looking at a combination of factors before making a decision. The upcoming business rates review will no doubt have an impact, not only on HMV, but on the wider British High Street. In some locations, even with good deals from landlords, rates make stores unviable."" Mr Putman said HMV's online business had done well throughout the pandemic, helping to offset the loss of sales in stores. ""Our online business - very similar to most retailers - doubled, tripled throughout the pandemic... [but] it still doesn't obviously make up for the loss of 100-plus stores."" Ed Sheeran to give free concert to 700 fans Sainsbury's stops selling CDs and DVDs Music stores have been particularly affected by the shift to digital over the years. The challenges from music downloading and streaming have added to the general shift to online sales affecting most retailers. Earlier this month, supermarket giant Sainsbury's said it had stopped selling CDs and DVDs as its customers increasingly went for music and films online. CD sales have shrunk in the past decade but were still worth Â£115m last year and vinyl sales continue to enjoy a revival of fortunes. There aren't many companies that have continued to trade on our High Streets for a century. That HMV survives may surprise many who wonder how a bricks-and-mortar retailer of physical media survives in a world of downloads and streaming. The venerable brand has focused on staying relevant to pop culture fans. The company's Canadian owner appears to have continued faith in the UK High Street at a time when it's undergoing a change just as challenging as any in HMV's history.  New stores are planned just as some people have questioned the purpose of the High Street post-pandemic. UK retailers have been through a deeply painful period of forced temporary closure, plunging sales and an accelerated shift to online shopping. Despite financial support from the government, some businesses have not survived the pandemic and the pain may not be over. There are dire predictions of thousands of more High Street closures to come, as firms are weighed down by lockdown loans. The profound changes taking place in retail cannot be stopped, but businesses say they need the government to act. A radical change to the business rates regime is top of most retailers' list of requests. Ministers are already conducting a fundamental review of the rates system and the outcome should be published in the autumn. Confidence is also key at a time when many shoppers are anxious about the ending of the legal requirement to wear a face covering in England.

Key Nike trainer factory hit by Covid outbreakNike could run out of its Vietnamese-made trainers because of a rise in Covid infections in the region.Business,"Production at some of Nike's largest plants in Vietnam has been disrupted as Covid has spread through factories. The company refused to comment on whether store supplies would see shortages as a result of the outbreak. About half of Nike's shoes were manufactured in Vietnam in the last financial year, so this will mean challenges for its supply chain. Vietnam has seen a record rise in cases since last April with many infection clusters in its industrial provinces. Apple, Samsung and Puma could also be affected by the surge in cases recorded at suppliers' factories in the country. ""The health and safety of our teammates, as well as that of our suppliers, remains our top priority,"" a statement from Nike said. What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines? France probes retailers over forced labour claims Nike said the company would continue to work with its suppliers to support them in response to the rise in Covid cases. ""We are confident in Nike's ability to navigate these near-term dynamics, and we remain prudent in our planning,"" the statement added. One of Nike's worst affected suppliers in the region, Pou Chen Corp, also makes footwear for Adidas and is the world's largest manufacturer of branded trainers. It suspended operations at its plant in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday due to the outbreak in infections. In a statement, the country's health ministry said Pou Chen's Pouyuen Vietnam factory would be suspended for 10 days. The factory is Ho Chi Minh City's largest employer, with a total of 56,000 workers. But it was unable to stay open and arrange for its workers to sleep at the factory, as was required by authorities to limit the spread of infections, according to the health ministry. Nike employs over 450,000 workers in the country, 80 % of whom are women. Similar challenges could also be faced for Puma, whose footwear is also manufactured in the country. Apple and Samsung also have large suppliers in the worst affected factories in the northern region of Vietnam. Apple did not give a comment on whether the outbreak will mean item shortages in shops, while Adidas, Puma and Samsung did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Samsung makes around half of its phones in Vietnam and has had to stop work at three factories in Ho Chin Minh City. According to the health ministry's website, Samsung Electronics is planning for workers to sleep at the plants and has currently cut its staffing to 3,000 from 7,000. Many firms had begun to move their production from China to countries such as Vietnam as a result of challenges from tariffs over the course of the pandemic. Dr Patsy Perry, senior lecturer in fashion business at Manchester Metropolitan University, told the BBC these problems are compounded by the Covid-related surge in demand for athletic wear as people have been spending more time at home. ""This shows the risk of overreliance on a particular sourcing region,"" she explained. Bu, Dr Perry said that Nike's manufacturing map means it could potentially move production the other countries, depending how agile its supply chain relationships are. ""Costs might increase in the short term if it needs to move production into more expensive areas, but it's more important to service demand than risking a stock-out situation,"" Dr Perry added. Dr Steve New, professor of operations management at the University of Oxford's SaÃ¯d Business School, told the BBC that previously, because Vietnam has been effective at containing Covid, it has been able to respond rapidly with short local shutdowns. But he said that as the situation worsens, ""it will be much harder to pursue this approach without much more significant disruption to the supply chain."" Vietnam has vaccinated around 4% of its 100 million population. Its capital Hanoi has stopped all non-essential services due to new clusters of Covid infections and on Sunday urged its citizens to stay at home. The government added factory workers to its vaccine priority list after the rise in cases in late April forced manufacturing areas in the north of the country to close.

"Almost a quarter of England's pupils out of schoolThe ""pingdemic"" continues to affect schools and families with nearly 25% absent as the term ends.","Elaine says repeated periods of self-isolation are a worry for her children's mental health Almost a quarter (23.3%) of pupils in England were out of school last week, the latest official attendance figures show. This means there were 1.7 million pupils absent, up from 1.5 million the week before. The latest figures include over a million off for Covid-related reasons, but only 47,000 actually had Covid. In secondary schools, the absence rate was nearer a third (32.7%) of pupils, while in primaries it was 17%. Some 661,500 pupils out of the total were absent from school for unspecified non-Covid related reasons. These figures show a snapshot of the situation in state schools last Thursday - before changes introduced from 19 July, which are intended to reduce the numbers having to be sent home. There has been speculation that many families may have chosen to take their children out of school early so isolation rules do not interfere with holiday plans. While others, including some teaching unions, have highlighted the impact of the pandemic on pupil engagement and mental health. Elaine Blowers and her family in Hampshire are among many hundreds of thousands of families affected by having to self isolate. She says each time it happens, the mental health of her daughter Gracie and son Harley is affected. How will school be different next term? 1.5m pupils out of school in England last week Mrs Blowers, a mum of two young, primary-aged children in Andover told how her son and daughter had to isolate due to one person in their class testing positive. Both children took a PCR test and were Covid-negative. Her son, Harley, has special needs and has missed out on the additional help he gets in school and has not really got on well with home-learning. And she explained how her daughter, Gracie, experiences anxiety every time she has to isolate - developing nightmares and stomach pains. ""What is frustrating is that it is not the first time this has happened,"" she says. ""Every time we have always been negative and felt very frustrated that my children have had to be locked up and I've had to lose an income unnecessarily."" Elaine runs her own business as a childminder working from home, so every time her children need to isolate, it impacts her business. She said the current situation was tricky for parents. ""I know some parents have approached schools to keep children off so not to affect holidays. But other parents are still choosing to keep children in school. ""We've stuck to the rules but begrudgingly."" Elaine says both her children have really suffered by not being in school, but she does not blame the school which she says has been ""fantastic"" in offering support. ""The prime minister needs to get a grip and allow for people that are contacted to get a PCR test and if negative return to work or  school. This needs to change now - 16 August is too late,"" she says, referring to the date when Covid self-isolation rules are expected to change. ""It is having such a negative impact on businesses and people's, including children's, mental health."" A Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said: ""Our priority is for schools and colleges to deliver face-to-face, high quality education to all pupils as we know that being out of education causes significant harm to educational attainment, life chances, mental and physical health. ""Where children have needed to isolate, they must be offered immediate access to high-quality remote education."" He added that the DfE had now removed its system of grouping pupils in ""bubbles"" to restrict transmission, and that self-isolation would not be required next term for pupils coming into contact with positive cases. The National Association of Head Teachers' general secretary Paul Whiteman said the government's decision to end ""bubbles"" and school isolation requirements was intended to stop so many missing school. But he warned that rising case numbers would mean more disruption, unless there was action to prevent transmission in schools. ""The government's own modelling predicts that the number of cases among children and young people is only going to get worse by the start of next term,"" he added. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the latest figures ""bring a year of unprecedented educational disruption to a grim end"". He said schools and colleges needed substantial financial and practical support for on-site testing for students and ventilation systems ""This work cannot be done on the cheap and the government needs to stop counting the pennies and address the situation with a proper injection of support and funding,"" he added. Natalie Perera, chief executive of the Education Policy Institute said the stark figures on pupil absence underline the importance of education recovery programmes. ""Supporting pupils through this crisis has to be a number one priority for the government,"" she said. ""We need to see far more ambitious and better-targeted education recovery policies which address the scale of this challenge."" 1.5m pupils out of school in England last week Covid-related school absence hits new high LA officials giving update on wildfires as firefighters struggle to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Covid in Scotland: 13 new deaths as cases decline,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says 13 new covid-linked deaths have been registered in the last 24 hours A further 1,604 positive cases have been logged (9.2% of all tests carried out). There are 529 positive patients in hospital (down seven) and of those 47 are in ICU (down two) Ms Sturgeon says while the rolling average of cases has dropped over the past two weeks, she continues to urge caution The whole of Scotland moved into the lowest tier of restrictions - level zero - on Monday More people can now meet indoors and up to 200 people can attend weddings and funerals Pubs and restaurants can open until midnight. Unlike England, mask coverings will remain mandatory in Scotland ""for some time to come"" Scotland's vaccine roll-out will be extended to children aged over 12 who are at high risk of falling ill with Covid BBC Scotland News  Allow Twitter content?

A plan for Scotlandâs health service to recover from the
impact of dealing with Covid is set to be launched. Dr Nicola Steedman, Scotland's deputy chief medical officer, says the strategy will set out how the NHS
can catch up on the appointments and operations cancelled as a result of Covid. Dr Steedman says the NHS is âvery keen on learning from
Covidâ and how services can be offered in a better way. The Scottish government official also says the strategy
will have âsupporting NHS staffâ at its heart, given the toll Covid has had on
many of them. Question from Stephen in Kilmacolm In level zero, more than two ""designated visitors"" are allowed access to care homes. The sector is also being encouraged to stop using the title as daily and group visits become the norm. Visitors are now allowed to take lateral flow tests at home before visiting, rather than at the care home. Inside the care home, physical distancing is now reduced to 1m while it is removed altogether outside in groups of 15 or less. Face masks are also no longer required outdoors. Question from Helen in Glasgow While the levels system remains in place, no singing or dancing is allowed among the reception guests. The only exception is the newlywed couple's first dance and a dance between the couple's parents, as long as they are in the same household. Live entertainment, such as bands and DJs, is permitted but guests must remain seated at their tables. One major development since the move to level zero is that the number of people who can attend a wedding has doubled from 100 to 200. A sense of what the ânew normalâ is going to be for Scotland
is needed from the Scottish government, Daniel Johnson MSP says. The Scottish Labour MSP says the SNP administration has to
let people and businesses know what life is going to be like for the rest of
the year and beyond. ""We still seem to be stuck on very short-term thinking
and we actually need to look at a long-term plan to get ourselves out of the
pandemic,â he tells the BBC Scotland programme. Mr Johnson also says ""serious questions"" have to be asked about the pace of vaccinations among younger people. Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross says he is encouraged by the current virus statistics. But he tells BBC Scotland'sCoronavirus Updateprogramme he is ""sceptical"" about calls for vaccine passports. Mr Ross adds: ""I think it means people will be treated differently because, for some people, there will be a very good reason why they can't get the vaccine."" On the issue of lower jab take-up rates among young people, he questions the decision toclose the NHS Louisa Jordan vaccination hubat the SSE Hydro in Glasgow. Mr Ross says: ""I think we have got to look at opportunities for getting people vaccinated in every part of Scotland and that means keeping the Hydro and other vaccination centres open."" Question from Tom in Aberdeen The Scottish government continues to warn people not to travel
tored list countries,externalor areas on holiday, or for any leisure purposes. Those planning travel to amber list countries are advised
not to assume that it will remain on the list, as the status of countries can
change at short notice. The amber travel rules have been relaxed for those who are fully vaccinated, which means an individual has received their second dose 14 days before leaving the country. Before travel you must make sure you have aprinted record of your vaccination,externalfrom NHS inform and state that you have been fully
vaccinated on yourpassenger
locator form,external. On return you musttake a Covid-19 test,externalbefore travelling andbook and pay Â£88 for a Covid-19 test,external. This must be taken within two days of
arriving in Scotland. There is no longer a requirement to self isolate. But those who have not had their second jab must take two Covid
tests on their return and self isolate for ten days. Train operators have been told they are expected to follow Scottish
Covid laws and guidance when operating north of the Border. LNER wascriticised for not enforcing social distancing rules when trains cross the border from England. But Ms Sturgeon says she welcomes a review by the cross-border, UK
government-owned operator. âI would expect companies operating in Scotland to
follow the law and guidance in Scotland - that is in my view what the public
would expect.â Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent The JCVI has concluded that until there is
more safety data on vaccines in children, then it is best only to offer it to
those for whom there is a direct benefit. They say the vast majority of
children will experience mild illness if they contract Covid so at this moment
in time, the chance of rare vaccine side-effects is a greater risk. But there is not universal consensus on this
view. Some experts say that more attention should be paid to the possible
complications of long Covid in children and the use of vaccines to stem the
spread of coronavirus. The Scottish government has always accepted
the advice of the JCVI and will continue to do so here, but the country will
face challenges first. Schools go back earlier here and Scotland
generally has higher numbers of under-18s starting college or university than
other parts of the UK. That could lead to a very disrupted start to term
and some students feeling like they are unprotected as they move into halls of
residence. Given some other countries are already
routinely vaccinating 12 to18-year-olds, this is one reason why the chief medical officer is writing to the JCVI asking for the decision to be regularly and
closely reviewed. James Matthews of Sky asks the first minister whether claims about Boris Johnson in aBBC interview with Dominic Cummingsamount to a resignation matter for the prime minister. Ms Sturgeon says she could not comment in detail about the allegations made by Mr Johnson's former chief adviser that the PM resisted autumn lockdown as only the over-80s were dying. But she adds: ""Nobody in a position like mine or Boris Johnson's should be glib or complacent about human life, whether that is the human life of a child, a young adult or an older adult. ""Human life is human life and as decision-makers I think it has been a heavy responsibility on all of our shoulders to try to take decisions that we recognise cannot save every person from this virus but that minimises the impact of it. ""Any leader who doesn't take that seriously should be asking themselves questions about whether they are fit for office."" No decision has been taken on the requirement for mandatory
vaccine passports in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon says. Answering a question from STV News, the first minister says the issue is under consideration after it was announcedpeople going to nightclubs in England will have to be fully vaccinated by the end of September. Ms Sturgeon says: âWhile
there are arguments for requiring vaccination to allow entry to certain places, it raises sensitive, ethical and equity considerations - not least because there
are some people who canât get vaccinated because of health conditions.â The first minister urges people to stick to the limits on household gatherings and wear face coverings. She highlights the importance of regular testing, encourages people to follow basic hygiene rules and meet outdoors. Ms Sturgeon adds: ""All of these measures are as important now as they have been throughout."" The first minister urges people to continue to treat the virus ""seriously"" and follow all of the rules and advice. She adds that the country took a further step back to normality on Monday but warns case numbers will remain high. Because of vaccination, we are undoubtedly in a better position than we were last year or even at the start of this year. But we can't abandon caution altogether - we will be foolish if we do that. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the decision not to vaccinate the
majority of children will be kept under âclose and ongoing reviewâ. The Scottish government has accepted the UK's Joint Committee
on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommendation thatonly children over 12 who are at higher risk of falling ill from Covid will be offered the vaccine. However, Ms Sturgeon sys she is âacutely awareâ other
countries are vaccinating all children and it is âextremely important that
this is not ruled out hereâ . The JCVI has ruled the risk to childrenâs health from Covid is
currently âvery lowâ. The first minister confirms all adults have been offered first dose appointments and adds the milestone has happened earlier than anticipated. She describes the uptake so far as ""quite remarkable"" by the standard of any previous vaccination programme. Ms Sturgeon adds she wants to get as close to 100% uptake as soon as possible She says: ""To put it bluntly, each and every person who gets jagged helps us take a step back to normality."" To date, 90% of all adults have had the first jab. But for 30 to 39-year-olds, the figure is 81% and for 18 to 29-year-olds it is 70%. As of 08:30 this morning, 3,984,433 people in Scotland had
received their first dose of the vaccine, an increase of 2,483 since Monday. That is 90% of the adult population. In
addition, 16,340 more people have received their second dose, taking the total number of fully
vaccinated Scots to 2,995,086. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says although case numbers remain high they are ""very much right now on a downward path"". To illustrate the point she adds that in the seven days up to 2 July, there were an average of 3,305 new cases being reported each day. But in the seven days to 16 July, that had fallen to an average of 2,112 new cases a day. Ms Sturgeon says: ""That amounts to a  decline in the past two weeks of more than one third and that is very encouraging"". Nicola Sturgeon begins with an update on the latest coronavirus
figures. The
first minister confirms that a further  1,604 people have tested positive
for Covid â which is 9.2% of the tests carried out yesterday. This
takes the total number of positive cases in Scotland to 332,455. There are 529 people in hospital with recently confirmed
Covid-19, a decrease of seven, and 47 in intensive care, up two from yesterday. There
have also been 13 more deaths recorded in the past 24 hours of people who
tested positive in the previous 28 days. That
brings the total number of deaths by that measurement to 7,813 Nicola Sturgeon will begin the Scottish government's coronavirus
briefing shortly, with deputy chief medical officer Dr Nicola Steedman
joining her. You can follow the latest developments right here and watch or

Scotland has lost several music festivals this summer as organisers say it is impossible to deal with Covid rules. Party at the Palace in Linlithgow and Doonhame in Dumfries are the latest to be scrapped at a few weeks' notice. Scotland has movedto level zero of restrictions, but there are still limits on the size of outdoor events, with 2,000 seated or 1,000 standing. Higher capacities must be agreed by the local council and Scottish government. But this is not enough to make many festivals in Scotland viable for organisers. Level zero restrictions are set to remain in place until 9 August. Read more here Â© 2025 BBC.

'Authorities knew stolen car danger before riot',"This video can not be played Social Media footage of Swansea 'yobs' setting cars on fire Stolen cars being sent freewheeling down a residential hill during a riot were already a ""known danger"" to authorities, it has been claimed. Father-of-two Adam Romain had to flee his house after it was targeted in the riots in Swansea in May when he tried to stop youths setting fire to his car. He claimed he warned police and Swansea council in February after a car was sent down his road in Mayhill. The council said it was ""isolated"" and there was a ""bigger discussion"". It comes aftera joint reviewwas announced to understand why rioting broke out in the Waun Wen Road area of Mayhill where ""yobs"" torched cars and threw bricks at houses on 20 May. Seven police officers were injured in the violence - involving about ""100 lads"" according to witnesses - which was condemned by First Minister Mark Drakeford as ""completely unacceptable"" and Home Secretary Priti Patel as ""disgraceful"". What do we know about Mayhill - the scene of the riot? Bereaved dad condemns Swansea disorder 'scumbags' Man donates car to Mayhill riot victim Police have since made about 30 arrests, and now an independent panel of experts, including South Wales Police, its Police and Crime Commissioner and Swansea council, will investigate why the disturbance happened. Mr Romain was targeted after he tried to stop rioters attacking his car - but the delivery driver had to flee his home after they started throwing missiles at his house. This video can not be played Adam Romain pleads for police help as his children scream during riot But he has claimed he warned the authorities about possible unrest on the Mayhill estate. ""Back in February we had an incident which was about 02:00,"" he recalled. ""A vehicle was taken from the top of the hill and basically freewheeled down."" He said it came ""flying down"" and smashed ""through this barrier"" put half-way down the steep Waun Wen Road near the house he has lived in for four years. Adam Romain said this car was stolen and pushed down the hill in February A crashed stolen car after it was rolled down Swansea's steep Waun Wen Road in February ""It hit both and landed in that diagonal way across the road,"" said Mr Romain. ""The police and the council would have known now because of this event that there is a danger and the bollards were not going to protect very much. ""It was a known danger already, we did request some concrete bollards, it would be interesting to know how we can improve the response towards the communities issues."" Mr Romain's mother Christina added: ""This is an extreme inaction, failing and people should be made accountable."" The leader of the council insisted there were plans in place to prevent anti-social behaviour on the road - but they had not yet been introduced. This video can not be played Mayhill rioters throw bricks at police van ""That issue, as far as I'm aware, was isolated,"" said councillor Rob Stewart, who had previously called the violence ""disgusting behaviour by yobs"". ""There was a much bigger discussion going on around motorcycles, about people being able to cycle fast up and down the hill. ""That meant we were looking at a much different solution to just putting a bollard in. ""We are looking at a park and play area, a re-greening of the whole area - a complete break in the area between this road and that road. ""The solution being worked up was one that was a much better solution for the community. ""I don't hold to the premise even putting these in would have prevented somebody trying to roll a car down if they were criminal and intent on criminal activity on that evening."" Families spoke of being trapped in houses, with police being ""pelted with rocks"" as they tried to break up the riot. South Wales Police's response has been criticised by some residents aftera vigil for 19-year-old Ethan Powell, who had recently died, turned into violence. This video can not be played Adam Romain says his family are leaving Mayhill because they no longer feel safe ""I can fully appreciate that for the people living on Waun Wen Road, and the surrounding areas, this would have been a terrifying experience for them,"" said Chief Supt Jo Maal. ""In terms of the response, we will look at all of these aspects. What calls were made to us and over what period of time we responded. But that will become apparent in due course."" Mr Romain, for example, said he dialled 999 on three occasions after coming back to his home after a frantic call from his partner. ""It felt like I was driving into a war zone,"" Mr Romain toldBBC Wales Investigates. ""They gave some explanations but nothing was satisfactory. Nothing that they said to me was 'ok, I understand completely'. ""There were some individual officers [who] apologised. They accept that there was a failing on that side."" There are plans to regenerate that area of Swansea, collectively known as ""the hill"", which overlooks the city and Swansea Bay. ""There will be and there has been significant investment in Mayhill, Townhill and Gors,"" said Mr Stewart. ""About Â£50m has gone into housing on the hill. That investment has gone in but we're on a journey to try and shore up the community, to support it as we come out of the Covid pandemic."" BBC Wales Investigates: Mayhill Riot.

"Vaccine proof plans considered for some sports eventsFans may be required to show proof of full vaccination to attend sports venues with capacities of about 20,000 or more by the end of September.BBC Sport","The crowd capacity at Wembley for the Euro 2020 final in July was raised to more than 60,000 Fans attending sports venues with capacities of about 20,000 or more may be required to show proof of full vaccination from the end of September, under plans being considered by the government. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson announced on Mondaythere was a plan to mandate certification at nightclubs and ""other venues where large crowds gather"". The BBC understands the definition of what constitutes a large crowd and what type of venues would fall under this label is yet to be determined. Downing Street said on Tuesday that its focus is on ""closed indoor settings"". The prime minister's official spokesperson said: ""We're not seeking to draw lines around particular settings. ""I think Professor [Jonathan] van Tam and the PM talked about the sort of areas where we'd be looking at enclosed spaces where large groups of people are brought together. ""We're going to be looking at the latest data which currently is very focused on nightclubs. But we'll be looking at the data both here and globally to consider what's the best approach."" A government spokesperson said: ""As the Prime Minister said, we reserve the right to do what is necessary to protect the public and reduce transmission, including mandating Covid certification in certain settings. ""We are working closely with organisations that operate large, crowded settings, where people are likely to be in close proximity to others outside their household, to encourage the use of the NHS Covid pass, where appropriate."" Indoor venues are expected to be treated differently to outdoor ones, and sports organisations are known to be seeking clarity on the matter. The Racecourse Association (RCA), for example, said it would be speaking to the government and industry stakeholders ""to understand the detail behind this plan"", and said it would be a ""significant logistical operation"". The RCA added: ""It is vital that horse racing and the wider sports/leisure economies have contingency plans to avoid commercially damaging restrictions being re-imposed but equally allow us to host safe events"". The UK government allowed the crowd capacity at Wembley to be raised to more than 60,000 for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020. Permitted under the government's Events Research Programme, fans attending Wembley were required to follow a number of strict entry requirements, including having a negative Covid-19 test or proof of full vaccination. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said on Monday that nightclubs and other such venues could be ""potential super-spreading events"" because of crowds in close contact. A capacity crowd of 140,000attended the British Grand Prixat Silverstone on Sunday - the largest crowd for a sporting event in the UK since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. There, all adults had to provide proof of full vaccination or be in possession of a negative test. In Scotland,Rangers have been given permissionto have 17,000 fans present at their Scottish Premiership opener against Livingston on 31 July. In May, Premier League executive director Bill Bush told the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus that a ""single magic wand like a vaccine passport"" would be ""too narrow and too prescriptive"". He said he wanted to work with the Government on a ""broader-based"" solution to certification at events. It is understood consultation with Premier League clubs on what approach will be taken to checking fans on entry to stadia next season is ongoing.

HMV backs High Street with plans for 10 new stores,"Music and entertainment retailer HMV has said it is looking to open 10 new stores this year as it continues to put its faith in High Street stores. The plans include a search for a new London flagship site. Its former London landmark store on Oxford Street closed along with many others after HMV fell into administration more than two years ago. It was bought by Canadian music retail executive Doug Putman, who says he still thinks stores have a future. ""People obviously love going out shopping, they like touching and feeling and that's something that online is not going to replace,"" he told the BBC. ""I do believe... you're going to get more people trying to open up different stores and have different ideas. ""I'm still very optimistic on the [HMV] business and business as a whole on the High Street. I still think the High Street is just something so special."" The new store plans were announced as HMV commemorates opening its first store on London's Oxford Street 100 years ago. He said he could not give any details as to where the replacement flagship store in London would be as they were still taking a ""very hard look"" trying to find the best site. However, Mr Putman added that the long-term viability of the new stores was dependent on what the government did about business rates, which are currently being levied at a reduced rate until April next year. HMV would not be signing ""any long-term deals"" for the new stores, he said, given the level of uncertainty in the retail sector. Canadian Doug Putman bought HMV from administrators more than two years ago An HMV spokesman added: ""We're continuing to expand with new sites, looking at a combination of factors before making a decision. The upcoming business rates review will no doubt have an impact, not only on HMV, but on the wider British High Street. In some locations, even with good deals from landlords, rates make stores unviable."" Mr Putman said HMV's online business had done well throughout the pandemic, helping to offset the loss of sales in stores. ""Our online business - very similar to most retailers - doubled, tripled throughout the pandemic... [but] it still doesn't obviously make up for the loss of 100-plus stores."" Ed Sheeran to give free concert to 700 fans Sainsbury's stops selling CDs and DVDs Music stores have been particularly affected by the shift to digital over the years. The challenges from music downloading and streaming have added to the general shift to online sales affecting most retailers. Earlier this month, supermarket giant Sainsbury's said it had stopped selling CDs and DVDs as its customers increasingly went for music and films online. CD sales have shrunk in the past decade but were still worth Â£115m last year and vinyl sales continue to enjoy a revival of fortunes. There aren't many companies that have continued to trade on our High Streets for a century. That HMV survives may surprise many who wonder how a bricks-and-mortar retailer of physical media survives in a world of downloads and streaming. The venerable brand has focused on staying relevant to pop culture fans. The company's Canadian owner appears to have continued faith in the UK High Street at a time when it's undergoing a change just as challenging as any in HMV's history.  New stores are planned just as some people have questioned the purpose of the High Street post-pandemic. UK retailers have been through a deeply painful period of forced temporary closure, plunging sales and an accelerated shift to online shopping. Despite financial support from the government, some businesses have not survived the pandemic and the pain may not be over. There are dire predictions of thousands of more High Street closures to come, as firms are weighed down by lockdown loans. The profound changes taking place in retail cannot be stopped, but businesses say they need the government to act. A radical change to the business rates regime is top of most retailers' list of requests. Ministers are already conducting a fundamental review of the rates system and the outcome should be published in the autumn. Confidence is also key at a time when many shoppers are anxious about the ending of the legal requirement to wear a face covering in England.

Jeff Bezos launches to space aboard rocket shipBillionaire Jeff Bezos has launched into space in the first crewed flight of his rocket ship.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played The moment Jeff Bezos and crew launch into space on the first human flight of New Shepard Billionaire Jeff Bezos has made a short journey to space, in the first crewed flight of his rocket ship, New Shepard. He was accompanied by Mark Bezos, his brother, Wally Funk, an 82-year-old pioneer of the space race, and an 18-year-old student. They travelled in a capsule with the biggest windows flown in space, offering stunning views of the Earth. When the capsule touched back down after the 10-minute, 10-second flight, Jeff Bezos exclaimed: ""Best day ever!"" New Shepard, built by Bezos' company Blue Origin, is designed to serve the burgeoning market for space tourism. Amazon founder Mr Bezos - and other participants in the ""billionaire space race"" - have been criticised for offering what some see as joy rides for the super-wealthy. Critics say the money could be spent on pay rises for employees or fighting climate change. However, Mr Bezos insists he has an environmental vision: ""We need to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry and move it into space, and keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is,"" he told MSNBC. ""It's going to take decades and decades to achieve, but you have to start, and big things start with small steps... that's what this sub-orbital tourism mission allows us to do, it allows us to practice over and over.""

Ms Funk added: ""It was great, I loved it, I can hardly wait to go again."" In the 1960s, Ms Funk was one member of a group of women called the Mercury 13. They underwent the same screening tests as male astronauts, but never got to fly under the US national space programme. Mr Bezos told CBS News on Monday: ""Wally can outrun all of us.

He claimed he warned police and Swansea council in February after a car was sent down his road in Mayhill. The council said it was ""isolated"" and there was a ""bigger discussion"". It comes aftera joint reviewwas announced to understand why rioting broke out in the Waun Wen Road area of Mayhill where ""yobs"" torched cars and threw bricks at houses on 20 May.

Key Nike factory hit by Vietnam Covid outbreak,"Production at some of Nike's largest plants in Vietnam has been disrupted as Covid has spread through factories. The company refused to comment on whether store supplies would see shortages as a result of the outbreak. About half of Nike's shoes were manufactured in Vietnam in the last financial year, so this will mean challenges for its supply chain. Vietnam has seen a record rise in cases since last April with many infection clusters in its industrial provinces. Apple, Samsung and Puma could also be affected by the surge in cases recorded at suppliers' factories in the country. ""The health and safety of our teammates, as well as that of our suppliers, remains our top priority,"" a statement from Nike said. What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines? France probes retailers over forced labour claims Nike said the company would continue to work with its suppliers to support them in response to the rise in Covid cases. ""We are confident in Nike's ability to navigate these near-term dynamics, and we remain prudent in our planning,"" the statement added. One of Nike's worst affected suppliers in the region, Pou Chen Corp, also makes footwear for Adidas and is the world's largest manufacturer of branded trainers. It suspended operations at its plant in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday due to the outbreak in infections. In a statement, the country's health ministry said Pou Chen's Pouyuen Vietnam factory would be suspended for 10 days. The factory is Ho Chi Minh City's largest employer, with a total of 56,000 workers. But it was unable to stay open and arrange for its workers to sleep at the factory, as was required by authorities to limit the spread of infections, according to the health ministry. Nike employs over 450,000 workers in the country, 80 % of whom are women. Similar challenges could also be faced for Puma, whose footwear is also manufactured in the country. Apple and Samsung also have large suppliers in the worst affected factories in the northern region of Vietnam. Apple did not give a comment on whether the outbreak will mean item shortages in shops, while Adidas, Puma and Samsung did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Samsung makes around half of its phones in Vietnam and has had to stop work at three factories in Ho Chin Minh City. According to the health ministry's website, Samsung Electronics is planning for workers to sleep at the plants and has currently cut its staffing to 3,000 from 7,000. Many firms had begun to move their production from China to countries such as Vietnam as a result of challenges from tariffs over the course of the pandemic. Dr Patsy Perry, senior lecturer in fashion business at Manchester Metropolitan University, told the BBC these problems are compounded by the Covid-related surge in demand for athletic wear as people have been spending more time at home. ""This shows the risk of overreliance on a particular sourcing region,"" she explained. Bu, Dr Perry said that Nike's manufacturing map means it could potentially move production the other countries, depending how agile its supply chain relationships are. ""Costs might increase in the short term if it needs to move production into more expensive areas, but it's more important to service demand than risking a stock-out situation,"" Dr Perry added. Dr Steve New, professor of operations management at the University of Oxford's SaÃ¯d Business School, told the BBC that previously, because Vietnam has been effective at containing Covid, it has been able to respond rapidly with short local shutdowns. But he said that as the situation worsens, ""it will be much harder to pursue this approach without much more significant disruption to the supply chain."" Vietnam has vaccinated around 4% of its 100 million population. Its capital Hanoi has stopped all non-essential services due to new clusters of Covid infections and on Sunday urged its citizens to stay at home. The government added factory workers to its vaccine priority list after the rise in cases in late April forced manufacturing areas in the north of the country to close.

Food industry calls for isolation rules exemption,"Industry bodies have reacted with dismay at the government's plan for firms to apply for staff to be exempt from coronavirus self-isolation rules. The government has said there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be ""considered on a case-by-case basis"". Karen Dee, chief executive of the airport operators association, said the scheme was ""simply unworkable"". The food supply industry called for clarity on how the scheme would work. The new policy comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that fully-vaccinated people in critical roles in England would be able to continue workingeven if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid.The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms. Individual businesses will have to contact their relevant government department to apply for any exemption. Those deemed eligible, which includes NHS and care staff, will be able to take daily tests instead. Downing Street said that the first exemptions around self-isolation have been given in some critical sectors. The number of exceptions outside of the NHS is expected to be relatively small, and not reach the high tens of thousands. There are ongoing discussions with companies in critical industries. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""A number of those exemptions are in process of being granted or have been granted."" 'Pingdemic' Firms have warned of increasing staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app.Iceland and Greene King saidon Monday they had had to shut shops and pubs as a result. Business lobby group the CBI has warned that the problem could hamper the economic recovery. Rod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said the plan felt like it had been ""thought up on the hoof without proper organisation or thought"". ""Truckers were classed as essential workers at the start of the pandemic; now they may be or may not be,"" he said. ""It's too confusing. The criteria isn't clear and it risks being both unfair and devastating to an already creaking supply chain."" Ms Dee, of the airport operators association, said the government ""must reconsider and exempt categories of workers"", such as airport security staff  and air traffic controllers from the requirement to self-isolate. ""As 24-hour operations, we need clear rules that are workable and easy to implement or there is a risk of unnecessary temporary closures,"" she said. ""Applying for each individual for an exemption from self-quarantine if they are 'pinged' is simply unworkable."" 'Pingdemic' shuts Iceland and Greene King sites Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said: ""What is the application process for businesses to use this? Who will qualify? Do you have to prove you are severely affected? How long will it take? ""If it's not simple and quick, it will not help and most businesses will have to ignore it. He said the number of people absent in the food sector due to isolation requests was ""growing exponentially across the food supply chain"". Andrew Selley is the chief executive of food wholesaler Bidfood, which has about 5,000 employees across the UK and 24 depots. He said the number of staff who were self-isolating changed on a day-to-day basis, but added the company had ""well over 100 people"" off at the moment. The firm, which has large contracts with schools, hospitals and prisons, recently had half a shift off at one depot due to staff being told to isolate. Mr Selley said it was a ""little ridiculous"" to expect individual companies to seek exemptions for staff who had been told to self-isolate. He added entire sectors, such as food supply, should be exempted and the government's scheme should work in the ""same way it did for key workers"" at the beginning of the pandemic. The government has saidit is ""crucial"" for people to quarantine after being ""pinged""by the NHS Covid-19 app. Its message comes after business minister Paul Scully said it was a decision for individuals and employers whether they should isolate after a ""ping"" from the app. The Times reported that another minister in the business department, Lord Grimstone of Boscobel, stressed in a letter to one large employer that the app was only an ""advisory tool"" and that people were not under any ""legal duty"". The prime minister's official spokesman said ""business-critical areas"" would be able to apply to be exempt from isolating. ""It's not a blanket exemption and my understanding is we're not going to be producing a list covering individual sectors,"" he said. ""It's important that anyone who feels they're in a critical industry or wants to raise potential issues because of isolation are able to contact departments and get advice and where necessary get exemptions."" Asked specifically about supermarket workers, the spokesman said: ""We're not seeking to draw lines specifically around who or who is not exempt. ""What's important is to make sure critical services are able to function and get that balance right between requiring people to isolate... but also making sure critical services can function.""

"Crucial for pinged people to self-isolate - No 10Downing Street tries to clear up confusion after a minister says people can make an ""informed decision"".UK","Downing Street has insisted it is ""crucial"" to self-isolate when sent an alert by the Covid app - and businesses should help employees to do so. It comes after business minister Paul Scully said he would encourage people who are ""pinged"" to self-isolate but they can make an ""informed decision"". The app has always been voluntary to download and any alerts are advisory. Labour accused the government of ""making it up as they go along"" and creating confusion. In recent days, there has been widespread criticism that the app has been sending out so many alerts that hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating and missing work, causing widespread disruption. Pub chains, supermarkets, transport networks and other businesses have warned of the crippling effect blanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations. People who are ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app and told they have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. However, anyone contacted directly byNHS Test and Trace,external- either by phone, text or email - must self-isolate. On Tuesday, the UK reported a further 46,558 new daily Covid cases alongside another 96 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Who could leave self-isolation to go to work? Meanwhile, a ""very small"" number of critical workers - including NHS and care staff - could carry on working even if told to self-isolate under a new government scheme. Industry bodiesreacted to the plan with dismay, describing it as ""simply unworkable"", amid confusion over how it would operate. Downing Street confirmed the first exemptions had been issued under the scheme by government departments. No 10 was unable to say how many people the government will approve for the loosened rules. Plans for the fully vaccinated to be made exempt from self-isolation were delayed until 16 August in England,with ministers warning at the time of a huge knock-onfor the economy and workplaces, including the NHS. In a BBC interview, Mr Scully was asked whether people should self-isolate if they are ""pinged"". ""I would absolutely encourage people to do that. But they can make an informed decision,"" he replied. ""I don't want to have to mandate people and tell people what to do as government any longer than I really have to. ""But they do have a responsibility to themselves, to their families and to their communities. It's by doing the right thing that we can keep Covid at bay."" Who could leave self-isolation to go to work? Should I be working at home or going in? Earlier, he told Times Radio that self-isolating after being told to by the app was a decision for individuals and employers. ""It's important to understand the rules,"" he said. ""You have to legally isolate if you are... contacted by Test and Trace, or if you're trying to claim isolation payments. The app is there to allow you to make informed decisions."" The Times is also reporting thatministers have written to major manufacturers,externalemphasising that staff are not legally obliged to isolate if ""pinged"". Investment minister Lord Grimstone told one large employer the app was only an ""advisory tool"" and that people were not under any ""legal duty"", the paper said. Following the ministers' comments, Downing Street attempted to clarify the government's position, insisting isolation remained the ""most important action"" people can take to stop the spread of the virus. ""Given the risk of having and spreading the virus when people have been in contact with someone with Covid, it is crucial people isolate when they are told to do so, either by NHS Test and Trace or by the NHS Covid app,"" a No 10 spokeswoman said. ""Businesses should be supporting employees to isolate, they should not be encouraging them to break isolation."" Now that legal restrictions have been lifted in England, cases of coronavirus will undoubtedly rise further. But a significant number of adults are not yet fully vaccinated. In the meantime, the test and trace system remains the only way the government can contain the virus to a level it deems acceptable. So the message on how closely people should follow the advice to isolate if ""pinged"" by the app is crucial. Although it's not a legal requirement to do so (only if contacted directly by test and trace) any suggestion that it's up to you, optional, or a judgement call risks undermining the government's entire approach. That's why we saw a junior minister's choice of words was quickly corrected by Downing Street this morning. The rules change next month, allowing double jabbed adults to avoid isolation. Until then the government will have to hope it can keep the public's confidence in the app and its instructions to isolate. John Edmunds, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said contact tracing and self-isolation should be maintained ""as stringently as we can"". ""We have one of the highest rates of cases in the world right now. The NHS has been under strain for a long time and they are busy trying to catch up on operations and are very, very busy. So to put them under more pressure now is going to be awkward,"" he told Times Radio. Justin Madders, Labour's shadow health minister, accused the government of ""making it up as they go along"". ""Yet again there is more confusion and incompetence from the heart of government at the expense of public health. They need to get a grip,"" he said. While the Covid app can only advise people to self-isolate, anyone in England who is called, texted or emailed by NHS Test and Trace must isolate for 10 days. Failure to self-isolate for the full time period can result in a fine, starting from Â£1,000. In other developments: In the week ending 9 July, there were 213 deaths involving Covid reported in England, Scotland and Wales - 82 more than were registered the previous week, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (there were no figures available for Northern Ireland because of a bank holiday) More than one million children in England were out of schoollast week due to Covid-related reasons, government figures show LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

The Met Office launched its new extreme heat warning,externalat the start of June 2021 to highlight potential widespread disruption and adverse health effects. Amber is the second-highest level in the system. It comes after a record-breaking number of heatwave deaths were recorded in England last summer. Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world take steep cuts to emissions. If they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious. The NHS advice is to: Move them to a cool place. Get them to lie down and raise their feet slightly Get them to drink plenty of water - sports or rehydration drinks are also OK Cool their skin - spray or sponge them with cool water and fan them. Cold packs around the armpits or neck are good too However, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heat stroke. It is a medical emergency and you should call 999. People with heat stroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot, their temperature could have passed 40C and they may have seizures or lose consciousness.

"NHS pay rise petition gathers almost 800,000 names","The petition set up by Matthew Tovey (centre) is due to be delivered to Number 10 on Tuesday An NHS Wales nurse who started a petition seeking a 15% pay rise for health and social care staff has gathered almost 800,000 names. Matthew Tovey, from Merthyr Tydfil, said NHS staff had been hailed as heroes during the Covid-19 pandemic and deserved to be rewarded. The Welsh government said it was considering findings before making any decision on pay rises. The UK government is due to publish its long-awaited NHS pay report soon. ""We've been all been hailed as heroes and angels who were working in unimaginable conditions,"" hospital nurse Mr Tovey toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""We had limited resources, scarce PPE. It was a terrifying experience."" Home births suspended amid staff shortage Coroner concerned over emergency staffing levels Mr Tovey said staff morale was ""on the floor"", and that colleagues were ""leaving the profession in droves"". ""We're already heading into a third wave, and it's sort of impossible to recruit new nurses,"" he added. ""A 15% pay raise would draw staff into the vacant posts and shows our true worth."" A bonus of Â£735 each was given to 222,000 Welsh NHS staff earlier this year The petition is due to be delivered to Number 10 Downing Street on Tuesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended plans to give someNHS staff in England a 1% pay rise, promptingthreats of industrial action. Pay review bodies covering most NHS workers have made recommendations which have not yet been published. Welsh NHS under substantial pressure, says chief Bonus payment for NHS and care staff in Wales The Welsh government will make a decision based on the review's recommendations as health is a devolved issue in Wales. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We haven't set an arbitrary cap on pay in our evidence to the pay review bodies and we are considering findings before we make an informed decision."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""Throughout the pandemic the UK government has always ensured Wales is getting the right support - with Â£8.6bn of additional spending."" Last month, nine trade unions signed an open letter to the Welsh government saying an""urgent and significant pay rise""was vital for NHS workers to reward staff and stop them leaving jobs. The Royal College of Nurses (RCN) said the Welsh government should commit to a12.5% increasefor all staff. Abonusof Â£735 each was given to 222,000 Welsh NHS staff earlier this year - amounting to about Â£500 after tax is deducted.

LiveLiveCovid in Scotland: 13 new deaths as cases decline2 minutes ago,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says 13 new covid-linked deaths have been registered in the last 24 hours A further 1,604 positive cases have been logged (9.2% of all tests carried out). There are 529 positive patients in hospital (down seven) and of those 47 are in ICU (down two) Ms Sturgeon says while the rolling average of cases has dropped over the past two weeks, she continues to urge caution The whole of Scotland moved into the lowest tier of restrictions - level zero - on Monday More people can now meet indoors and up to 200 people can attend weddings and funerals Pubs and restaurants can open until midnight. Unlike England, mask coverings will remain mandatory in Scotland ""for some time to come"" Scotland's vaccine roll-out will be extended to children aged over 12 who are at high risk of falling ill with Covid BBC Scotland News  Allow Twitter content?

A plan for Scotlandâs health service to recover from the
impact of dealing with Covid is set to be launched. Dr Nicola Steedman, Scotland's deputy chief medical officer, says the strategy will set out how the NHS
can catch up on the appointments and operations cancelled as a result of Covid. Dr Steedman says the NHS is âvery keen on learning from
Covidâ and how services can be offered in a better way. The Scottish government official also says the strategy
will have âsupporting NHS staffâ at its heart, given the toll Covid has had on
many of them. Question from Stephen in Kilmacolm In level zero, more than two ""designated visitors"" are allowed access to care homes. The sector is also being encouraged to stop using the title as daily and group visits become the norm. Visitors are now allowed to take lateral flow tests at home before visiting, rather than at the care home. Inside the care home, physical distancing is now reduced to 1m while it is removed altogether outside in groups of 15 or less. Face masks are also no longer required outdoors. Question from Helen in Glasgow While the levels system remains in place, no singing or dancing is allowed among the reception guests. The only exception is the newlywed couple's first dance and a dance between the couple's parents, as long as they are in the same household. Live entertainment, such as bands and DJs, is permitted but guests must remain seated at their tables. One major development since the move to level zero is that the number of people who can attend a wedding has doubled from 100 to 200. A sense of what the ânew normalâ is going to be for Scotland
is needed from the Scottish government, Daniel Johnson MSP says. The Scottish Labour MSP says the SNP administration has to
let people and businesses know what life is going to be like for the rest of
the year and beyond. ""We still seem to be stuck on very short-term thinking
and we actually need to look at a long-term plan to get ourselves out of the
pandemic,â he tells the BBC Scotland programme. Mr Johnson also says ""serious questions"" have to be asked about the pace of vaccinations among younger people. Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross says he is encouraged by the current virus statistics. But he tells BBC Scotland'sCoronavirus Updateprogramme he is ""sceptical"" about calls for vaccine passports. Mr Ross adds: ""I think it means people will be treated differently because, for some people, there will be a very good reason why they can't get the vaccine."" On the issue of lower jab take-up rates among young people, he questions the decision toclose the NHS Louisa Jordan vaccination hubat the SSE Hydro in Glasgow. Mr Ross says: ""I think we have got to look at opportunities for getting people vaccinated in every part of Scotland and that means keeping the Hydro and other vaccination centres open."" Question from Tom in Aberdeen The Scottish government continues to warn people not to travel
tored list countries,externalor areas on holiday, or for any leisure purposes. Those planning travel to amber list countries are advised
not to assume that it will remain on the list, as the status of countries can
change at short notice. The amber travel rules have been relaxed for those who are fully vaccinated, which means an individual has received their second dose 14 days before leaving the country. Before travel you must make sure you have aprinted record of your vaccination,externalfrom NHS inform and state that you have been fully
vaccinated on yourpassenger
locator form,external. On return you musttake a Covid-19 test,externalbefore travelling andbook and pay Â£88 for a Covid-19 test,external. This must be taken within two days of
arriving in Scotland. There is no longer a requirement to self isolate. But those who have not had their second jab must take two Covid
tests on their return and self isolate for ten days. Train operators have been told they are expected to follow Scottish
Covid laws and guidance when operating north of the Border. LNER wascriticised for not enforcing social distancing rules when trains cross the border from England. But Ms Sturgeon says she welcomes a review by the cross-border, UK
government-owned operator. âI would expect companies operating in Scotland to
follow the law and guidance in Scotland - that is in my view what the public
would expect.â Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent The JCVI has concluded that until there is
more safety data on vaccines in children, then it is best only to offer it to
those for whom there is a direct benefit. They say the vast majority of
children will experience mild illness if they contract Covid so at this moment
in time, the chance of rare vaccine side-effects is a greater risk. But there is not universal consensus on this
view. Some experts say that more attention should be paid to the possible
complications of long Covid in children and the use of vaccines to stem the
spread of coronavirus. The Scottish government has always accepted
the advice of the JCVI and will continue to do so here, but the country will
face challenges first. Schools go back earlier here and Scotland
generally has higher numbers of under-18s starting college or university than
other parts of the UK. That could lead to a very disrupted start to term
and some students feeling like they are unprotected as they move into halls of
residence. Given some other countries are already
routinely vaccinating 12 to18-year-olds, this is one reason why the chief medical officer is writing to the JCVI asking for the decision to be regularly and
closely reviewed. James Matthews of Sky asks the first minister whether claims about Boris Johnson in aBBC interview with Dominic Cummingsamount to a resignation matter for the prime minister. Ms Sturgeon says she could not comment in detail about the allegations made by Mr Johnson's former chief adviser that the PM resisted autumn lockdown as only the over-80s were dying. But she adds: ""Nobody in a position like mine or Boris Johnson's should be glib or complacent about human life, whether that is the human life of a child, a young adult or an older adult. ""Human life is human life and as decision-makers I think it has been a heavy responsibility on all of our shoulders to try to take decisions that we recognise cannot save every person from this virus but that minimises the impact of it. ""Any leader who doesn't take that seriously should be asking themselves questions about whether they are fit for office."" No decision has been taken on the requirement for mandatory
vaccine passports in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon says. Answering a question from STV News, the first minister says the issue is under consideration after it was announcedpeople going to nightclubs in England will have to be fully vaccinated by the end of September. Ms Sturgeon says: âWhile
there are arguments for requiring vaccination to allow entry to certain places, it raises sensitive, ethical and equity considerations - not least because there
are some people who canât get vaccinated because of health conditions.â The first minister urges people to stick to the limits on household gatherings and wear face coverings. She highlights the importance of regular testing, encourages people to follow basic hygiene rules and meet outdoors. Ms Sturgeon adds: ""All of these measures are as important now as they have been throughout."" The first minister urges people to continue to treat the virus ""seriously"" and follow all of the rules and advice. She adds that the country took a further step back to normality on Monday but warns case numbers will remain high. Because of vaccination, we are undoubtedly in a better position than we were last year or even at the start of this year. But we can't abandon caution altogether - we will be foolish if we do that. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the decision not to vaccinate the
majority of children will be kept under âclose and ongoing reviewâ. The Scottish government has accepted the UK's Joint Committee
on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommendation thatonly children over 12 who are at higher risk of falling ill from Covid will be offered the vaccine. However, Ms Sturgeon sys she is âacutely awareâ other
countries are vaccinating all children and it is âextremely important that
this is not ruled out hereâ . The JCVI has ruled the risk to childrenâs health from Covid is
currently âvery lowâ. The first minister confirms all adults have been offered first dose appointments and adds the milestone has happened earlier than anticipated. She describes the uptake so far as ""quite remarkable"" by the standard of any previous vaccination programme. Ms Sturgeon adds she wants to get as close to 100% uptake as soon as possible She says: ""To put it bluntly, each and every person who gets jagged helps us take a step back to normality."" To date, 90% of all adults have had the first jab. But for 30 to 39-year-olds, the figure is 81% and for 18 to 29-year-olds it is 70%. As of 08:30 this morning, 3,984,433 people in Scotland had
received their first dose of the vaccine, an increase of 2,483 since Monday. That is 90% of the adult population. In
addition, 16,340 more people have received their second dose, taking the total number of fully
vaccinated Scots to 2,995,086. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says although case numbers remain high they are ""very much right now on a downward path"". To illustrate the point she adds that in the seven days up to 2 July, there were an average of 3,305 new cases being reported each day. But in the seven days to 16 July, that had fallen to an average of 2,112 new cases a day. Ms Sturgeon says: ""That amounts to a  decline in the past two weeks of more than one third and that is very encouraging"". Nicola Sturgeon begins with an update on the latest coronavirus
figures. The
first minister confirms that a further  1,604 people have tested positive
for Covid â which is 9.2% of the tests carried out yesterday. This
takes the total number of positive cases in Scotland to 332,455. There are 529 people in hospital with recently confirmed
Covid-19, a decrease of seven, and 47 in intensive care, up two from yesterday. There
have also been 13 more deaths recorded in the past 24 hours of people who
tested positive in the previous 28 days. That
brings the total number of deaths by that measurement to 7,813 Nicola Sturgeon will begin the Scottish government's coronavirus
briefing shortly, with deputy chief medical officer Dr Nicola Steedman
joining her. You can follow the latest developments right here and watch or

Scotland has lost several music festivals this summer as organisers say it is impossible to deal with Covid rules. Party at the Palace in Linlithgow and Doonhame in Dumfries are the latest to be scrapped at a few weeks' notice. Scotland has movedto level zero of restrictions, but there are still limits on the size of outdoor events, with 2,000 seated or 1,000 standing. Higher capacities must be agreed by the local council and Scottish government. But this is not enough to make many festivals in Scotland viable for organisers. Level zero restrictions are set to remain in place until 9 August. Read more here Â© 2025 BBC.

China denies being behind major Microsoft hack,"The Microsoft hack affected at least 30,000 organisations globally China has denied allegations that it carried out a major cyber-attack against tech giant Microsoft. The US and other Western countries on Monday accused China of hacking Microsoft Exchange - a popular email platform used by companies worldwide. They said it was part of a broader pattern of ""reckless"" behaviour that threatened global security. China says it opposes all forms of cyber-crime, and has called the claims ""fabricated"". China's foreign ministry spokesman said the US had got its allies to make ""unreasonable criticisms"" against China. The UK, EU, New Zealand, Australia and others joined the US to accuse Chinese state-sponsored hackers. Microsoft's Exchange system powers the email of huge corporations small businesses and public bodies. The hack affected at least 30,000 organisations around the world. Microsoft blamed a Chinese cyber-espionage group for targeting a weakness in Microsoft Exchange, which allowed hackers to get into email inboxes. It said the group, known as Hafnium, was state-sponsored and based in China. Western security sources believe Hafnium knew Microsoft had planned to deal with the weakness, and so shared it with other China-based hackers. BACKGROUND: China accused of cyber-attack on Microsoft ANALYSIS: Microsoft email server hacks put Biden in a bind WATCH: The FBI launches new mission to 'disrupt' cybercrime The sources say the hack seems to signal a shift from a targeted espionage campaign to a smash-and-grab raid, leading to concerns that Chinese cyber-behaviour is escalating. The UK Foreign Office said the Chinese government had ""ignored repeated calls to end its reckless campaign, instead allowing state-backed actors to increase the scale of their attacks"". US President Joe Biden said the Chinese government may not have been carrying out the attacks itself, but was ""protecting those who are doing it. And maybe even accommodating them being able to do it"". The US Department of Justice on Monday announced criminal charges against four hackers linked to China's Ministry of State Security. It said they were connected to a long-term campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors in a least a dozen countries.

Plans to modernise power of attorney system,"Ministers are looking to overhaul the legal process for people to nominate someone to take financial and health decisions on their behalf if they lose the ability to act for themselves. There are more than five million registered Lasting Powers of Attorney - or LPAs - in England and Wales. But there are concerns the system is too slow and difficult to use. Under the current paper-based application process, it can taken months for powers to be handed over. The proposals would see the service become predominantly digital, with alternatives remaining for those unable to use the internet. Power of attorney 'let my husband die with dignity' 'Power of attorney meant Dad lost everything' An LPA is a legal document which allows people to appoint someone else to make decisions about their welfare, money or property. They are often used by older people to choose someone to make decisions for them when they lose the mental capacity to do so in the future - but they can be made by anyone over the age of 18. A three-month consultation will examine how technology can be used to reform the process of witnessing, improve access and speed up the service. The government is also considering creating a fast-track for families who need to quickly set up an LPA for a relative who has suffered a sudden change in their health. And it will look at making the process of objecting to an LPA simpler, as well as introducing new safeguards to protect against fraud and abuse. Justice Minister Alex Chalk said: ""A lasting power of attorney provides comfort and security to millions of people as they plan for old age. These changes will make the service quicker to use, easy to access and even more secure from fraud."" Nick Goodwin, Public Guardian for England and Wales,  said the proposals would make the service ""fit for the modern world"". ""More people are taking the vital step to plan for the future by applying for lasting powers of attorney, and we want to make sure that it is as safe and simple as possible to do so,"" he added.

Compensation closer for women's pensions campaignThe government was too slow to tell women they would be directly affected by the rising state pension age.Business,"Government officials were too slow to tell many women they would be affected by the rising state pension age, the Parliamentary Ombudsman has ruled. The finding brings the prospect of compensation closer for thousands of women born in the 1950s who have long been furious about the issue. It marks a significant victory for the Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaign. However, the ombudsman has no power to refund ""lost"" pensions. It is also unable to recommend that anyone receive their state pension any earlier than the current law allows. The fight over women's state pensions Angela Madden, who chairs the Waspi campaign, said: ""The findings reinforce what we, unfortunately, knew all along; that the DWP failed to adequately inform 3.8 million 1950s-born women that their state pension age would be increasing. ""These women have been waiting for many years for compensation. We cannot wait any longer. We are calling on the government to agree fair and adequate compensation rather than allow what has become a vicious cycle of government inaction to continue."" The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, andcurrently stands at 66for men and women. The increases have been controversial. Campaigners claim women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected. Many thousands said they had no idea they would have to wait longer to receive their state pension, and had suffered financial and emotional distress as a result. The ombudsman's initial finding of maladministration by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) centres on a delay in providing direct information to this group of women. While some women were aware of the general policy change, they did not know it would affect them personally. The ombudsman said that letters should have been sent directly to these women more than two years earlier than they were. For some, the delay was much longer. ""We have found that DWP failed to act quickly enough once it knew a significant proportion of women were not aware of changes to their state pension age,"" said Amanda Amroliwala, chief executive of the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. ""It should have written to the women affected at least 28 months earlier than it did. We will now consider the impact of these failings, and what action should be taken to address them."" Ms Madden, from Waspi, said the DWP's own research showed that women were not sufficiently aware of the changes ""yet they failed to act"". ""This inaction had devastating and life-altering impacts on women across the country,"" she said. The ombudsman considered six sample cases, but said the DWP should apply any subsequent recommendations to all of those affected. Whereas Waspi has called for bridging payments, the separate Backto60 group has campaigned for the state pension age for women affected to be returned to 60, and for these women to be refunded the pensions they had ""lost"" owing to the changes. The ombudsman has no power to do so, but it can recommend compensation is paid to those affected by the DWP's maladministration. There is no timeline for the remainder of its investigations, but it is planning to move as quickly as possible. It is unable to recommend any change in policy, which could have brought much larger sums in compensation. A series of court decisions found in favour of the government in terms of the changing pension age itself. A DWP spokesman said: ""Both the High Court and Court of Appeal have supported the actions of the DWP, under successive governments dating back to 1995, and the Supreme Court refused the claimants permission to appeal. ""In a move towards gender equality, it was decided more than 25 years ago to make the state pension age the same for men and women."" What is the row about women's pensions?

Ben & Jerry's to stop sales in occupied West Bank,"Ben & Jerry's has said it will stop selling its ice cream in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The US company said sales ""in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT)"" were ""inconsistent with our values"". Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the move was ""morally wrong"" and would prove to be ""financially wrong"". The West Bank and East Jerusalem have been under Israeli control since the 1967 Middle East war. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements there. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Patel takes on Ben and Jerry's over migrant boats The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained US moves to rebuild relations with Palestinians In a statement shared to its Twitter and Instagram pages on Monday, Ben & Jerry's said its decision reflected the concerns of ""fans and trusted partners"". The changes would be made by allowing current licensing arrangements to expire at the end of next year, it added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We have been working to change this, and so we have informed our licensee that we will not renew the license agreement when it expires at the end of next year.""

""We call on the Israeli government and consumers not to permit a boycott of Israel... Ice cream is not part of politics."" Israeli politicians reacted furiously to the announcement. ""The boycott of Israel - a democracy surrounded by islands of terror - reflects a complete loss of bearings. The boycott does not work and will not work, and we will fight it with all our might,"" Mr Bennett said. Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield set up the company in 1978 Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called Ben & Jerry's move a ""disgraceful capitulation"" to anti-Semitism and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a complete boycott of Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians. ""Over 30 states in the United States have passed anti-BDS legislation in recent years. I plan on asking each of them to enforce these laws against Ben & Jerry's,"" he said. A spokesman for BDS, Mahmoud Nawajaa, it welcomed Ben & Jerry's decision and called on the company ""to end all its procedures with the apartheid Israel"".

Asia follows global shares slide amid Covid fears,"Asian stock markets fell on Tuesday, tracking sharp declines seen in Europe and the US on Monday that were triggered by fears that rising Covid cases will hamper economic recovery. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 1% to hit its lowest level in six months, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng also lost 1%. On Monday, both the UK's FTSE 100 index and the US Dow Jones Industrial Average had tumbled by more than 2%. But shares in London and the rest of Europe started stronger on Tuesday. The FTSE 100 index rebounded 1%, while other major European indexes saw similar rises. Monday's sharp falls came as investors became increasingly jittery about the rise in the number of Covid cases in some countries,fuelled by the Delta variant. Japanese shares have now fallen for five sessions in a row over concerns about the spread of the variant and that the Tokyo Olympics could worsen the health crisis. ""Investors are concerned that the rapid spread of the Delta variant will derail the trajectory of the global recovery, notably in Asia which still has relatively low vaccination rates and where some widely used vaccines do not appear overly effective against it,"" Jeff Halley, senior market analyst, from Oanda told the BBC. ""I believe we are in for a messy week ahead, with markets being driven around by sentiment and not data, as the international economic calendar is very quiet."" Meanwhile, businesses in the UK have described how they are cutting opening hours, closing shops or may have to reduce production as employees are forced to self-isolate after being alerted by the NHS Covid-19 app. Price rises speed up again as economy unlocks Fears of workers on the face masks frontline ""Optimism which had been on the horizon just a few weeks ago has again been obscured by dark clouds, especially with the snap decision toenforce a 10-day quarantine for arrivals from France,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, on Monday. ""With some scientists warning that infections could reach 200,000 a day by September, there is now a feeling that the UK could be staring at a fresh autumn lockdown,"" she added. At a media briefing, US President Joe Biden urged Americans to get vaccinated in order to ensure the economy can remain open. Covid infections linked to the Delta variant have been increasing, but concerns among US investors spiked after Los Angeles imposed an indoor mask mandate again over the weekend. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1% in its worst session of 2021. Commenting on how markets performed on Monday, President Biden said: ""That's not how I judge economic growth."" His comments came after data published last week showed prices in the US spiked again in June, driven higher by the cost of used cars and food increasing. Mr Biden said that the increase in inflation was expected to be temporary, but he understood that unchecked inflation over the long term would pose a ""real challenge"" to the economy.

Part of city park closed after report of assault,"Millennium Bridge in Bute Park was cordoned off by police A man has been left with life-threatening injuries after being assaulted in a city park, police have said. Large parts of Bute Park, in Cardiff, were cordoned off after police were called to reports of an assault at about 01:10 BST on Tuesday. A man sustained serious head injures and is being treated at the University Hospital of Wales. South Wales Police said it was a ""violent and sustained attack"". Det Ch Insp Mark O'Shea said: ""To subject another person to violence in this way is intolerable, and we are carrying out a number of lines of inquiries to locate those involved. ""We know a number of people were around the area, and in Bute Park, at the time so if you witnessed the incident, or may have heard what took place, please come forward."" Initially, only an area around Servini's cafe was closed off A major incident room has been set up at Cardiff Central Police Station as officers investigate the crime. The force urged anyone who was in the Castle Street area between midnight and 02:00 on Tuesday, and has any dash cam or mobile phone footage, to share it with them. Members of the public were urged to stay away from the park, which would normally be very busy on a sunny day, while some entrances to the park, including the Millennium Bridge over the River Taff, had been shut. Initially, a smaller area around Servini's cafe was cordoned off, but the police later expanded the area. Some entrances to Bute Park were closed, including this one by Pettigrew's tearooms Cardiff council said: ""Prior to the pandemic, key city centre entrances to Bute Park were locked every night at sunset. ""The park is a large public open space and while it is not possible to prevent access after dark entirely, following the two recent serious incidents in the park, a decision has been taken to return to this locking regime with immediate effect.""

China denies 'malicious' claim of Microsoft hack,"The Microsoft hack affected at least 30,000 organisations globally China has denied allegations that it carried out a major cyber-attack against tech giant Microsoft. The US and other Western countries on Monday accused China of hacking Microsoft Exchange - a popular email platform used by companies worldwide. They said it was part of a broader pattern of ""reckless"" behaviour that threatened global security. China says it opposes all forms of cyber-crime, and has called the claims ""fabricated"". China's foreign ministry spokesman said the US had got its allies to make ""unreasonable criticisms"" against China. The UK, EU, New Zealand, Australia and others joined the US to accuse Chinese state-sponsored hackers. Microsoft's Exchange system powers the email of huge corporations small businesses and public bodies. The hack affected at least 30,000 organisations around the world. Microsoft blamed a Chinese cyber-espionage group for targeting a weakness in Microsoft Exchange, which allowed hackers to get into email inboxes. It said the group, known as Hafnium, was state-sponsored and based in China. Western security sources believe Hafnium knew Microsoft had planned to deal with the weakness, and so shared it with other China-based hackers. BACKGROUND: China accused of cyber-attack on Microsoft ANALYSIS: Microsoft email server hacks put Biden in a bind WATCH: The FBI launches new mission to 'disrupt' cybercrime The sources say the hack seems to signal a shift from a targeted espionage campaign to a smash-and-grab raid, leading to concerns that Chinese cyber-behaviour is escalating. The UK Foreign Office said the Chinese government had ""ignored repeated calls to end its reckless campaign, instead allowing state-backed actors to increase the scale of their attacks"". US President Joe Biden said the Chinese government may not have been carrying out the attacks itself, but was ""protecting those who are doing it. And maybe even accommodating them being able to do it"". The US Department of Justice on Monday announced criminal charges against four hackers linked to China's Ministry of State Security. It said they were connected to a long-term campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors in a least a dozen countries.

Who could leave self-isolation to go to work?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection.

Writing fake online reviews could be made illegal,"A plan to crack down on online rip-offs including making it illegal for people to write or host fake reviews has been outlined by the government. The proposals would see bigger fines for firms that trick consumers into spending more than they want to online. Businesses offering subscriptions would also be required to make clear exactly what consumers are signing up for and allow them to cancel easily. Consumer champion Which? said the plans should be ""swiftly implemented"". Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said the pandemic had highlighted weaknesses in consumer protections that allowed ""unscrupulous businesses to exploit customers"". Businesses will be prevented from manipulating customers to spend more than they want Under the government's proposals, regulators would receive help to stamp out tactics used to manipulate people browsing for goods and services online. This includes punishing businesses that trick consumers into spending more than they want to, and ""negative nudges"" - when businesses pay to have their product feature highly on a trader's website while hiding the fact they paid for it. The government said it would also get tough on prepayment schemes such as Christmas savings clubs - where customers choose Christmas hampers and vouchers months in advance, and then make regular payments towards the goods over the course of the year. Under the plans such schemes would have to safeguard customers' money in future. The aim is to prevent scandals such as Farepak, which saw tens of thousands of people lose all they had saved for Christmas when the company went bust in 2006. For the used car and home improvement sectors where consumers often make big one-off purchases, the government will make it mandatory for businesses to take part in arbitration or mediation where disputes arise over a transaction, so that consumer gripes are not dragged through the courts. For many of us it's become almost second nature to check a review site before buying or booking everything from restaurants, to holiday accommodation or trades people. Reviews matter, and that's why a whole industry has been spawned paying people to churn out fake positive reviews. The regulator has been making noises about trying to clamp down for a while, but now the government wants to tighten up the rules and make it illegal to pay someone to write or host a fake review. Hitting the host sites as well as the company being reviewed is the easier and potentially more effective way of trying to tackle the problem, rather than playing whack-a-mole with individual reviews that emerge. The difficulty, as ever, is going to be enforcement because regulators are always playing catch-up. New teeth for the Competition and Markets Authority will help but can never provide full protection for consumers. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was ""giving businesses confidence that they're competing on fair terms, and the public confidence they're getting a good deal"". Consumer and small business minister Paul Scully added: ""When consumers part with their hard-earned cash, they've got every right to expect they'll get their money's worth. Cowboy builders aren't welcome in 21st century Britain."" The government's proposals are part of a new consultation on reforming competition and consumer policy to give the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) enhanced powers to tackle consumer rip-offs and bad business practices. The government said there would be tougher penalties for those who break the law, with new powers for the CMA to issue fines of up to 10% of a firm's global turnover. The new legislation will make it illegal for people to leave fake reviews Other punishments which the CMA could enforce include disqualifying company directors who make false declarations to the regulator and being able to block so-called ""killer acquisitions"", where big businesses snap up prospective rivals before they can launch new services or products. The CMA will be able to enforce consumer law directly, rather than having to go through a court process, the government said. The watchdog will also be required produce regular ""state of competition"" reports under the plans to look at the vibrancy of competition in the UK's markets.

"Cameron lacked judgement over Greensill, MPs say","David Cameron showed a ""significant lack of judgement"" in the way he lobbied the government on behalf of Greensill Capital, a report has found. The Treasury committee also questioned the former prime minister's judgement on the financial health of the now-collapsed lending firm. The report comes after Mr Cameron was found to have lobbied for Greensill bysending texts to the chancellor. Mr Cameron said he acted in good faith but there were ""lessons to be learnt"". The Treasury committee said that while Mr Cameron did not break the rules over lobbying by former ministers, there was a ""good case for strengthening them"", with the current ones offering ""insufficient strength"". What's the David Cameron lobbying row about? Clock ticking on Gupta's fight to save his empire The committee concluded Mr Cameron's ""less formal means"" to lobby the government to help Greensill, where he was an advisor, were ""aided by his previous position of prime minister"". They added had he ""taken a broader and more enquiring assessment of the business"", there were ""signals available"" which might have led him to take a ""more restrained approach"" when asking the government to help the firm. Mel Stride, chair of the Treasury committee, said the Treasury ""should have encouraged"" Mr Cameron into ""more formal lines of communication as soon as it had identified his personal financial incentives"". He added: ""However, the Treasury took the right decision to reject the objectives of his lobbying, and the committee found that Treasury ministers and officials behaved with complete and absolute integrity."" At the start of the coronavirus pandemic the government said it would back loans to large companies struggling in lockdown. Greensill Capital,which has since collapsed, made seven loans totalling Â£350m to companies owned by Sanjeev Gupta's business empire, GFG Alliance, which included Liberty Steel, the UK's third-largest steel manufacturer which employs 3,000 people. It was revealed in March, that when advising Greensill, the former prime minister texted Conservative ministers within the Treasury to appeal for access to emergency loans for the finance firm, but the requests were rejected. Mr Cameron has been cleared of breaking any rules over his lobbying, however critics have continued to question his access to ministers. The Treasury committee said the ""central argument"" for Greensill's attempt to gain access to government support was ""more of a sales pitch than a reality"". The committee acknowledged Treasury officials and ministers behaved properly in their handling of Mr Cameron's lobbying, and ""took the right decision"" in preventing Greensill from accessing the Covid Corporate Financing Facility. However, they added members were ""very surprised"" by the Treasury's claim that Mr Cameron's former position had no meaningful effect on how Greensill's application for access to the CCFF was dealt with. ""Mr Cameron was an ex-prime minister, who had worked with those he was lobbying and had access to their mobile phone numbers,"" the committee said. ""The committee believes that the Treasury's unwillingness to accept that it could have made any better choices in how it engaged in this case is a missed opportunity for reflection."" In response to the report, Mr Cameron said: ""While I am pleased that the report confirms I broke no rules, I very much take on board its wider points. ""I always acted in good faith, and had no idea until the end of last year that Greensill Capital was in danger of failure. ""However, I have been clear all along that there are lessons to be learnt. As I said to the committee, I accept that communications of this nature should be done in future through only the most formal of channels. ""I agree that the guidance on how former ministers engage with government could be updated and was pleased to provide some suggestions on this to the committee."" A Treasury spokesman said: ""This report is clear that the Treasury was right to consider Greensill's proposals, right to ultimately reject their proposals, and concludes that the Treasury behaved with absolute integrity throughout the process."" Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said Mr Cameron being cleared of breaking any rules ""proves that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose"". Government showed 'unusual' interest in Greensill What's the David Cameron lobbying row about?

"Covid passport plan for nightclubs 'concerning'Manchester's night-time economy advisor brands the government's certification plan ""discriminatory"".Manchester","This video can not be played 'This is what life's about' - clubbers in England enjoy a return to the dancefloor Plans to make Covid vaccine passports mandatory at nightclubs are ""deeply concerning,"" Greater Manchester's night-time economy advisor has said. Full vaccination will be acondition of entry to clubsand other venues with large crowds from September. Sacha Lord, who runs the Warehouse Project club nights, said the government ""appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation"". The government said it had launched a hospitality strategy to help. The announcement came on the day nightclubs were allowed to reopen after almost 18 months of closure. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a press conference earlier: ""I don't want to have to close nightclubs again as they have elsewhere. But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing. ""As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission."" Mr Lord said the industry had been taken by surprise by the latest announcement. ""I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I am deeply concerned by the discriminatory nature for those who either can't have the vaccine for medical reasons or age, or who do not want to,"" he said. ""With this one move, the Government appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation."" What Covid rules have changed? PM urges caution as restrictions eased Cheers and celebrations as clubbers return He added: ""How will nightclubs now compete against pubs and bars down the road where these restrictions aren't needed, or attract punters who can just as easily have a house party without these enforcements in place. ""I have been in the nightlife and events industry for over 25 years, but I cannot see any reason why anyone would now want to enter this sector with such financially damaging restrictions in place."" Sacha Lord runs the Warehouse Project club nights and Parklife festival Earlier, he told BBC Breakfast hospitality businesses remain ""on a cliff edge"" He said over the last 18 months businesses had seen how the government ""has really not understood"" their needs and how they operate. He added: ""The ten o'clock curfew is a perfect example, pushing hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets at exactly the same time. That did far worse than good. ""We saw ridiculous substantial meal rules - the Scotch egg rule. ""I took them to the High Court to compel them to drop that, which saved many businesses and jobs across the whole of the UK. ""So time and time again, we have seen so many mistakes."" A government spokesperson said: ""We appreciate the significant impact the pandemic has had on the hospitality industry - including the night-time economy.

"Isolation rules loosened for critical workersPeople performing ""critical"" tasks including air traffic controllers will still be able to work under new rules.","Some fully vaccinated people in critical roles in England will be able to continue working even if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid. Instead those eligible - including NHS and care staff - will be able to take daily tests, the government said. A list of critical workers is due to be published, but the PM said it included food, utility and border staff. It follows mounting criticism of the impact of self-isolation on industry. Those eligible will be specifically named on a letter from a government department. ""This is not a blanket exemption for any sector or role,"" a government spokesman said. The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms and was announced as most remaining curbs in England ended on Monday, including face mask laws. Meanwhile, a further 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Zoom bets billions on home working continuing How many people can I meet now? Check your area's vaccine stats Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference that test, trace and isolate was still an ""essential"" part of the government's Covid response. He said close contacts of positive cases were five times more likely to contract Covid and that a ""continuing sacrifice"" would be required. Speaking while isolating at his country residence, Mr Johnson said workers involved in the supply of food, water and electricity, as well as staff on the border and on the railways, would be among those exempt from self-isolation. But he said this would be for work purposes only and involve a ""very, very small number of named critical workers"" with employers contacted by letter. He added that the government did not want to ""extend it too widely because this is one of the few shots we've got left in our locker to stop the chain reaction of the spread of Covid"". Although it was unclear exactly which jobs would be eligible, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi earlier confirmed the change would apply to health and social care workers in England. In Scotland, NHS staff will shortly receive similar guidance on self-isolation, deputy chief medical officer Dr Dave Caesar said. It came as Mr Zahawiconfirmed a limited group of children, many with underlying conditions, would be eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as soon as possible in England. He also confirmed that proof of full vaccinationwould be required in ""large crowded settings""such as nightclubs from the end of September in England - after all over-18s have had the chance to receive both vaccine doses. What's happening with the self-isolation rules? Which children are being vaccinated and why? Should I be working at home or going in? Under current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine. An upcoming change from 16 August will mean people who are fully vaccinated will be able to skip isolation by taking a daily Covid test. Under-18s will also no longer be required to self-isolate from 16 August if they are contact traced. Similar rules are due to come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August. Mr Johnson, along with Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is self-isolating after being in close contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid,who tested positive over the weekendafter feeling unwell on Friday evening. The PM appeared at Monday's news conference via video call from Buckinghamshire, alongside England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam and the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance in Downing Street. Amid a surge in infections linked to the Delta virus variant, a BBC analysis previously showed more than 4.5 million peoplecould be asked to self-isolatebetween 7 July and 16 August. Figures last week showed more than 530,000 contact tracing alerts were sent from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales between 1 July and 7 July. People can also be told to self-isolate through a separate process run by NHS Test and Trace backed by laws. Pub chains, supermarkets and other businesses havewarned of the crippling effectblanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations. Theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd-Webber said on Monday that self-isolation ruleshad forced the cancellation of performancesof his new West End show Cinderella. Each UK nation is in charge of its own coronavirus regulations. Englandended most of its remaining restrictionson Monday, while Scotland also eased some curbsas it moved to level zero. Some restrictions were lifted in Wales on Saturday,bringing an end to social-distancing outside. In Northern Ireland, a new Covid-19 certificate appis being prepared for launchnext week amid a ""final push"" to get younger people vaccinated. The number of daily Covid cases is often lower at the beginning of the week due to reporting delays and a ""weekend effect"". The number of patients admitted to hospital with Covid in the last seven days was 39.5% higher than the previous week, government data showed, with 4,317 admissions over the latest period. The number of deaths in the last seven days was 48% higher than the previous week, with 296 recorded.

Covid passport plan for nightclubs 'concerning',"This video can not be played 'This is what life's about' - clubbers in England enjoy a return to the dancefloor Plans to make Covid vaccine passports mandatory at nightclubs are ""deeply concerning,"" Greater Manchester's night-time economy advisor has said. Full vaccination will be acondition of entry to clubsand other venues with large crowds from September. Sacha Lord, who runs the Warehouse Project club nights, said the government ""appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation"". The government said it had launched a hospitality strategy to help. The announcement came on the day nightclubs were allowed to reopen after almost 18 months of closure. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a press conference earlier: ""I don't want to have to close nightclubs again as they have elsewhere. But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing. ""As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission."" Mr Lord said the industry had been taken by surprise by the latest announcement. ""I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I am deeply concerned by the discriminatory nature for those who either can't have the vaccine for medical reasons or age, or who do not want to,"" he said. ""With this one move, the Government appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation."" What Covid rules have changed? PM urges caution as restrictions eased Cheers and celebrations as clubbers return He added: ""How will nightclubs now compete against pubs and bars down the road where these restrictions aren't needed, or attract punters who can just as easily have a house party without these enforcements in place. ""I have been in the nightlife and events industry for over 25 years, but I cannot see any reason why anyone would now want to enter this sector with such financially damaging restrictions in place."" Sacha Lord runs the Warehouse Project club nights and Parklife festival Earlier, he told BBC Breakfast hospitality businesses remain ""on a cliff edge"" He said over the last 18 months businesses had seen how the government ""has really not understood"" their needs and how they operate. He added: ""The ten o'clock curfew is a perfect example, pushing hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets at exactly the same time. That did far worse than good. ""We saw ridiculous substantial meal rules - the Scotch egg rule. ""I took them to the High Court to compel them to drop that, which saved many businesses and jobs across the whole of the UK. ""So time and time again, we have seen so many mistakes."" A government spokesperson said: ""We appreciate the significant impact the pandemic has had on the hospitality industry - including the night-time economy.

Gay rugby player allowed to stay in UK,"Kenneth Macharia said he would have faced persecution in Kenya for being gay A gay African rugby player threatened with deportation has won the right to remain in the UK. Ken Macharia, 41, who moved to the UK more than a decade ago has been granted refugee status. Without it he feared he could have been sent back to Kenya, where homosexual activity is illegal and punishable with heavy jail sentences. A campaign was started by the gay- and bisexual-inclusive Bristol Bisons RFC, where Mr Macharia is a club member. A judge found he would be at ""real risk of serious harm as a gay man"" and that his ""human rights would be breached"" were he to be removed from the UK. A first-tier tribunal of the immigration and asylum chamber upheld Mr Macharia's appeal against deportation. Speaking afterwards, Mr Macharia said: ""When I tell people close to me the news, they are jumping with joy and excitement, I put on a smile and pretend to share the same level of enthusiasm. ""It's been a very long struggle, since 2016. ""I have had my hopes crushed too many times. I can't help wondering what will go wrong. ""The sadness has not gone away. I used to be optimistic. It will be a while before I am again. ""I am very grateful for all the support I have received. Very many people came to my aid at my time of need. ""The list is very long, some I know, some I don't. Thanks to each and everyone of you. ""It will take me a bit of time to truly believe this nightmare is over and be at the same level of enthusiasm as you."" Mr Macharia received support from friends and teammates in the UK Bristol Bisons RFC said: ""We are delighted to announce that, after five years of battling with the UK Home Office - a fight which was increased in intensity in 2019 when Ken was threatened with immediate removal from the country - our very own Ken has won his asylum appeal and been granted refugee status. ""We'd like to thank everyone for their continued support throughout the past couple of years."" Mr Macharia, who lives in Glastonbury, Somerset, feared mob violence or blackmail in the east African nation where the Foreign Office warned gay British travellers that holding hands or kissing in public could lead to imprisonment.
