England end Ireland's Grand Slam hopes,"Six Nations: England v Ireland England:(17) 24 Tries:Ford, Daly, Cowan-DickiePens:FarrellCons:Farrell 3 Ireland:(0) 12 Tries:Henshaw, PorterCons:Cooney England ended Ireland's Grand Slam hopes in brutal fashion as they rediscovered some of their World Cup form to reignite their own hopes of landing the Six Nations title. First-half tries from George Ford and Elliot Daly after Irish defensive errors plus two conversions and a penalty from Owen Farrell gave England a commanding 17-0 lead. Ireland struck back with a try from Robbie Henshaw but with Johnny Sexton uncharacteristically wayward off the tee, they never seriously threatened a comeback. Luke Cowan-Dickie drove over for England's third midway through the second half, with replacement Andrew Porter's late try no sort of consolation for Ireland. With Wales at home in a fortnight before a trip to Italy, Eddie Jones' men will believe they can finish the championship in style, although they may need Ireland to do them a favour and beat France in Paris next month. For the men in green and their head coach Andy Farrell it was a chastening afternoon, all the optimism created by the wins over Scotland and Wales leaching away in a display that was ponderous until the game was gone. Calculating Jones loves every scrap as England coach We could have declared at half-time - Jones I need to look at myself - Ireland coach Farrell England blitz Ireland - the match as it happened Bonus podcast: England silence the 'sausages' Rugby Union Weekly: round three match highlights England began at a real lick, Manu Tuilagi punching holes through the middle and going close down the left before Andrew Conway hauled him down. And the reward came when Ben Youngs stuck a grubber kick through, Sexton dithered and juggled in his own in-goal area and Ford seized on the loose ball to touch down. Sexton then mis-kicked horribly with a straightforward penalty from 30 metres out and England set up camp again in the Ireland half. CJ Stander lost his shirt in a first-half tussle with Maro Itoje Jonathan Joseph danced through in midfield after a mis-hit clearing kick from Conor Murray as Maro Itoje and CJ Stander scrapped in the 22, and England's forwards hammered away at the Ireland line. With a penalty coming, the men in white shaped to go wide, only for Ford to pop through another kick - and this time it was Jacob Stockdale who dallied, Daly diving onto the ball as Irish hands went to heads. The scoreboard reflected the gulf between the two sides, England dynamic with ball in hand and ferocious in defence, Ireland laboured and error-ridden. And Sexton's miserable half was compounded when he was penalised for slowing the ball up, Farrell stroking over his kick to give England their biggest half-time lead over Ireland in 18 years. This video can not be played Were England more up for it than us? - Farrell ponders what went wrong for Ireland Ireland simply had to improve - and belatedly they did. An England knock-on from the restart gave away possession and the visitors finally chiselled out some territory too. England managed to stop an Ireland driving maul from a line-out close in but the pressure kept coming. Ireland won a penalty in front of the posts, opted for the scrum and eventually found space in the right-hand corner for Henshaw to burrow through two defenders and over the line. But Sexton shanked the conversion just as he had the first-half penalty and the pressure ebbed away as Jones threw on Cowan-Dickie, Ellis Genge and Charlie Ewels. England's scrum, strong throughout, began to dominate and the penalties started to mount. Farrell kicked to the corner, the forwards set up the maul from the line-out and Cowan-Dickie peeled off with Sam Underhill and Jonny May driving him on to roll over for England's third try. May was nearly clear on his own after seizing a loose ball from a messy Ireland ruck and appeared to be taken out by Henshaw after kicking the ball ahead, only for referee Jaco Peyper to wave play on. And as the game stumbled towards the line, Porter rumbled over from a metre out for a try that made little difference to Ireland's afternoon. A bravura performance in the back row from a man more normally seen in the second row. He made 14 tackles and eight carries in the hour he was on the pitch, setting the tone for a dominant England performance. And all on his 31st birthday, while sporting a spectacular shiner of a black eye and winning his 84th England cap - the same as former captain Martin Johnson. England head coach Eddie Jones:""We had a good preparation, we were always looking at this game and the next as the ones we had to be at our best. ""We were disappointed with the second half, but when you are playing against a side like Ireland you expect them to get some possession. We had to defend pretty well. Ireland head coach Andy Farrell:""I think the scoreline flattered us a little bit. We didn't start to play how we wanted to until the game was over. England were excellent, every side will look at themselves physically and they certainly won that battle. We didn't fire a shot in that first half. ""England were fighting to stay in the championship and that's what we need to be in the next two games - I need to look at myself regarding the performance of the first half."" Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson:""It's a fantastic win for England, they were dominant throughout the whole game. The tactics in the first half were spot on, but it was a bit strange they didn't continue that after half-time and put the game away. ""They were happy to let Ireland have the ball and defend. They were really comfortable."" Former England hooker Brian Moore:""Ireland's half-backs Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray have been world class for a long time but I don't think I've ever seen them play as badly, and certainly kick as badly. That created a platform for England who were sharp and really could have scored more tries. ""England's line speed was good throughout, they won the majority of the collisions and got on top in the set-piece."" Former Ireland number eight Jamie Heaslip:""If you keep showing the same picture against a side like England, they'll punish you. Make basic mistakes in the back-field, you will get punished. If you want to win a championship, you can't make those mistakes.""

""The past week has been extremely difficult, coming to terms with the loss of our friend and colleague, Caroline,""presenter Laura Whitmore told viewers,externalof the ITV2 programme. ""Caroline loved Love Island. She loved love, and that's why tonight's final is dedicated to her."" She added: ""We're thinking of her family and everyone who knew her at this time."" The programme then showed a montage of some of Flack's memorable moments from the series in recent years. The islanders were told about Flack's death off-camera on Saturday,an ITV spokesman confirmed.,external Finley Tapp and Paige Turley were crowned the winners of the series as the finale drew to a close. Two episodes of this series were pulled from the schedules last weekend after Flack was found dead. The showreturned the following Monday with a tribute to Flackfrom the show's narrator Iain Stirling. This has been the first series of the show to take place in winter and be filmed in South Africa. Previous seasons have been filmed on the Spanish island of Mallorca over the summer. Overall, the winter series has been a ratings hit for ITV2, albeit not as successful as previous summer series. This series has been attracting around four million viewers per episode, including via catch-up services, compared with the six million the last summer series generally attracted. Laura Whitmore is the show's current presenter. She joined the show after Flack was charged with assaulting her boyfriend. Laura Whitmore pictured at the Brit Awards last week Tapp and Turley were crowned the winners of this series on Sunday night, winning the Â£50,000 prize, which they chose to share between them. In a twist that occurs in every series, Turley was given the chance to ""steal"" the full prize money before she decided to split it evenly. ""It's been such an amazing experience,"" Turley said earlier in the episode. ""It's been filled with challenges, but it's been amazing."" Asked what first attracted him to Turley, Tapp said: ""I loved how outgoing she was. I wasn't wrong in picking her because I thought she'd make me laugh and smile all day long. She's made me very happy."" Earlier this series, they became the first pair to become an official couple in the villa. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Mind the gap? Scale of UK's housing shortfall revealed,"Zoe McKendree: ""You can't really present yourself best for an interview if you're sleeping on a friend's sofa"" Hoping to buy a home? You'll have to get across the UK's huge housing gap. Researchers have used the averages of recent studies to estimate the possible scale of the current shortage, which will grow as the UK population increases in size. This gap - the difference between the current housing stock and the number needed for everyone to have a decent home to live in - is more than one million homes, according to theBBC Housing Briefing,external. A lot of the pressure from the gap falls on people renting privately. Zoe McKendree, 33, spends more than a third of her pay on rent for her shared flat in Brixton, south London. She dreams of the keys to a home of her own but that is a distant prospect. Instead, she has had to contend with what she said were ""callous"" landlords and escalating costs. She has also experienced multiple no-fault evictions, where private landlords evict tenants at short notice without a good reason. Zoe says: ""I can't do things like buy a car, which I would really like to. I can't move out. I have to still be in a flatshare. ""I also keep getting evicted through no fault of my own, and each time that costs me over a thousand pounds. So every time I save money, which I could put towards a deposit, it's gone."" The government has said itintends to ban no-fault evictions in England. The council house may be seeing a revival 'Why I don't want to live in a house' Where can I afford to live? No-fault evictions to be banned In a poll of more than 2,000 people for the Affordable Housing Commission, 13% of adults said their mental health was affected by their housing situation. Looking just at those in unaffordable housing - costing more than a third of income - produced a greater level of concern. Twenty-five percent of the sample said their mental health had suffered. That's potentially millions of people. Despite having a good job with a charity, Zoe feels her quality of life has hardly improved since her early 20s. The BBC's Housing Briefing estimates that we have built 1.2 million fewer homes than we should have She adds: ""It makes me feel really anxious - it made me very depressed. It made it really difficult to look for work because I had so much of my mental time worrying about where I was going to live. ""You can't really present yourself best for an interview if you're sleeping on a friend's sofa and you're really worried you're going to be homeless."" Behind the stress is a shortage of places to live. The BBC's Housing Briefing estimates that we have built 1.2 million fewer homes than we should have, and the need for more homes is increasing. The calculations suggest it will take at least 15 years at current building rates to close the gap, and that not enough of what is being built is affordable. Hannah Clark from Oxfordshire, now aged 32, has been saving since she was 14 in the hope of being able to put down a deposit on something affordable. After her father had a stroke, she realised, as a teenager, there would be no help from the bank of mum and dad. ""I very rarely even now spend anything on myself,"" she says. ""There's a sense of guilt, because I have to save for a roof over my head. I have to have security for my future."" In contrast to Zoe, Hannah has been living rent free with family members, currently her sister, while she puts money aside. It sounds an easier route, but Hannah says her mental health has been affected. ""If you're living under someone else's roof you're constantly under their rules and therefore you can't have a relationship really with anyone. You can't invite them back,"" she explains. ""It's quite lonely, there's lots of pressure."" Hannah Clark first began saving for a home when she was 14 The Affordable Housing Commission found that more than half of 18 to 24-year-olds live with family, and 18% are still doing so as 25 to 34-year-olds. At the same time, government statistics show that the number of young adults living with parents is on the rise. Hannah has managed to build up a nest egg and aims to use it for the deposit on a small studio flat. She has been working for a publishing company and running a small business on the side selling illustrations. But she says the challenge of getting her own home has been a constant stress. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Since 2010 this government has delivered over 464,000 new affordable homes, including 114,000 social homes. In addition to this, the social housing waiting list has decreased by 40% since 2012. ""Last year we delivered more homes than any year in the last 30 years and have committed to delivering a million more in this parliament. ""We have also abolished the council borrowing cap so local authorities are able to continue to build more social homes, giving families the chance to find somewhere that is safe and secure.""

Macron 'not sure' of UK-EU trade deal by deadline,"French President Emmanuel Macron says negotiating a UK-EU trade deal will be ""tense"" French President Emmanuel Macron has said he is ""not sure"" a UK-EU trade deal will be struck by 31 December, the end of the Brexit transition period. Mr Macron said negotiations starting in March will be ""tense"", with fishing rights a key point of contention. It comes as the UK government signalled it would publish its mandate for the trade deal later this week. In the document, ministers are expected to reiterate their desire for a Canada-style deal with few tariffs on goods. While a trade deal is hammered out with the EU, the UK is following the majority of the bloc's rules. The UK is in this transition period until 31 December following its departure from the EU on 31 January. ""I am not sure that an agreement will be reached between now and the end of the year,"" Mr Macron said at a meeting with fishermen in Paris on Saturday. ""Anyway, it is going to become more tense because [the British] are very hard."" What is the transition period? Barnier: UK can't have Canada-style deal What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? Mr Macron also said fishing rights could be a sticking point in negotiations. The UK has said it will consider a deal on fisheries but it must be based on the notion that ""British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats"". The EU has different ideas about an agreement on fisheries. Mr Macron's comments come as the UK government signalled it would publish detailed demands for a trade deal. The mandate is due to be signed off on Tuesday and will be published online and in Parliament on Thursday, the BBC's Jonathan Blake said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, called for a ""Canada-Free Trade Agreement-type relationship"" with the EU in a speech in Brussels earlier this month - and the mandate will repeat these demands. But EU chief negotiatorMichel Barnier has said such a deal cannot happen. Michel Barnier says the UK cannot have the same EU trade deal as Canada has Mr Barnier said the EU was ready to offer an ""ambitious partnership"" with the UK post-Brexit, but its ""particular proximity"" meant it would be different. Under Canada's agreement with the EU, which took seven years to negotiate, import tariffs on most goods have been eliminated between the two countries, though there are still customs and VAT checks. Is fishing the next big argument in Brexit talks? How do you negotiate a trade agreement? The EU has repeatedly warned that the UK cannot expect to enjoy continued ""high-quality"" market access if it insists on diverging from EU social and environmental standards. UK-EU trade negotiations, led by Mr Barnier and Mr Frost, are due to begin in Brussels on 2 March. How do you negotiate a trade agreement? 'Frugal' and other nations in EU budget stand-off Barnier: UK can't have Canada trade deal with EU Brexit negotiator: UK must be able to set own laws What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal?

Wuhan Britons end quarantine,"More than 100 Britons rescued from China have left isolation, as dozens of people from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship begin a two-week quarantine. UK citizens previously evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan - the centre of the virus outbreak - have ended their isolation in Milton Keynes. It comes a day after those rescued from the Diamond Princess ship in Japan were taken to Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. On Saturday, the government confirmed that no new UK cases had been detected. People with backpacks and suitcases were pictured getting into waiting taxis outside Kents Hill Park conference centre in the east side of Milton Keynes, where 118 UK nationals and their family members were isolated. Paul Wilkinshaw, 39, who left the centre with his wife Lihong, 33, said it ""feels weird"" to not require protective equipment. ""It feels fantastic to leave, although it feels weird not having to wear a mask and gloves in public,"" Mr Wilkinshaw said. Bill To said ""everything was excellent"" during his two-week quarantine in Milton Keynes ""It was really good, everything was excellent. I'm happy I can go home now,"" another evacuee, Bill To, said. ""I'm going to get some Chinese food. Everything is good."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock commended the group ""for their patience and perseverance"". Vinnie O'Dowd, BBC News The last of those in quarantine at Kents Hill Park training centre left just before 12:00 GMT. The 118 people isolated here for two weeks were treated to pizza, katsu curry and steaks. They were also offered microwave meals and goods such as smartphones, with SIM cards, and brand-new suitcases. We spoke to Bill To, who said his first day from quarantine would be partly spent seeking out his first Chinese meal in two weeks. Others said they were just glad to be leaving and had sumptuous praise for the NHS staff that tended to them during their stay. The Department of Health provided care and also splashed out on entertainment such as basketball nets and football posts, fitness dumbbells, and Netflix accounts. However, there was a function to the frills. It kept those in quarantine happy and relaxed, as each of them were tested for coronavirus three times over the two weeks of their stay. It came as the Foreign Office amended its travel advice for South Korea as cases of the new coronavirus, and the disease it causes, increased. Itadvised against,externalall but essential travel to the cities of Daegu and Cheongdo in the country, which have been declared ""special care zones"" by South Korean authorities. 'Narrowing window' to contain virus outbreak How a virus reveals the many ways China is feared Coronavirus: What you need to know The latest group of Britons to be evacuated - passengers from the cruise liner Diamond Princess - arrived at Arrowe Park on Saturday. The 30 Britons and two Irish citizens will spend the next 14 days isolated from the world in nurses' accommodation. They have already spent two weeks in quarantine on board the ship, but since then 600 passengers and crew have tested positive for the new virus. Those evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship landed at Boscombe Down, a MoD base in Wiltshire Four Britons from the ship who recently tested positive for the new coronavirus were not on the latest evacuation flight. They include David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, who have since been diagnosed with pneumonia, according to their family. They are being treated in a Japanese hospital. Arrowe Park was previously used to isolate 83 British nationals who were flown back to the UK from Wuhan. The chief executive of Wirral Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, Janelle Holmes, said the hospital was using its previous experience as a ""blueprint"" for treating the new group. In other developments: Italyhas introduced ""extraordinary measures"" to tackle the spread of the new virusthere after the number of cases in the country rose to 79 - including two Italian citizens who have died Restrictions by the Italian governmentled to the postponement of the Scotland Women's Six Nations rugby matchon Sunday, with plans put in place to bring staff and players back to the UK In South Korea, a fourth person has died and the number of confirmed cases has jumped to more than 550, an increase of more than 100 on the previous day. Most cases are linked to a hospital and a religious group near the south-eastern city of Daegu Israel refused to allow some 200 non-Israelis to disembark from a plane which had arrived from South Korea, sending them back to Seoul; the 12 Israelis on board were quarantined Iran reported its fifth death from the disease, and ordered the closure of schools, universities and cultural centres in 14 provinces The BBC's medical correspondent Fergus Walsh said it seems increasingly likely that the spread of the new coronavirus will become a pandemic - or global outbreak. ""The combined situation in South Korea, Iran and Italy point to the early stages of pandemic,"" he said. ""In each of these countries we are seeing spread of the virus with no connection to China."" Chinese health authorities reported a decrease in the rate of deaths and new cases of the coronavirus on Saturday. Some 76,392 cases including 2,348 deaths have been confirmed in China. The head of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the greatest concern now was countries with weaker health systems, particularly in Africa.

Sensational Fury stops Wilder to win world title,"This video can not be played 'Not bad for an old fat guy who can't punch' - best of Fury's post-fight news conference Tyson Fury produced the most destructive performance of his boxing life to end Deontay Wilder's five-year reign as WBC heavyweight world champion in seven thrilling rounds of their Las Vegas rematch. The Briton, 31, pummelled his rival in a way few could have imagined following their 2018 draw, flooring him in the third and fifth rounds while constantly backing up the most-feared puncher in the division in a way no-one has done before. A jab and right hand - the combination with which Wilder has wiped men out repeatedly - sent the American down in the third, stunning the MGM Grand Arena. Wilder, making his 11th defence, fell again before the round was out - this time a slip - and looked ragged under the pressure, before a left hand to the body sent the 34-year-old down in the fifth. Fury delivered everything he had promised, transitioning from his hit-and-move style to overpower, outwork and bully his previously undefeated rival until the towel came in during the seventh round. This was more than a world title win, it was a statement - and as Fury was held aloft by his corner after victory was sealed, the days of depression, weight gain and despair that cost him the belts he claimed in 2015 seemed a lifetime away. Relive Fury v Wilder II - from the ring walks to the winning moment 'There's a fella across the pond who might want a tickle' - Fury says Joshua bout will 'complete' career 'Living legend' Fury shines bright in Vegas - but did he lick Wilder's blood? Podcast: Costello & Bunce on Tyson Fury's night for the ages Tyson Fury was carried to the ring on a throne Thousands of British fans who had descended on Vegas saw their hero take an age to arrive at the ring on a throne, sporting a golden crown. It was the only time Fury moved slowly all night. He hit pads in the ring as Wilder made his ring walk - just as he did 15 months earlier in Los Angeles - and his start was rapid, a flurry of hooks prompting chants of ""there's only one Tyson Fury"" from the crowd. Actors Michael J Fox and Jason Statham, as well as Super Bowl winner Patrick Mahomes, watched as Fury raised his hand at the end of the opening three-minute round and things began to feel markedly different to their first meeting. He simply did not take a backward step, forcing Wilder to the ropes and ensuring the champion had no say in the pace of proceedings. And in the third round, those who had paid the kind of ticket prices that made this the highest gate ever for a heavyweight bout in Nevada, rose to their feet at the sight of Wilder floored for only the second time in his career. A right hand behind Wilder's ear - the same shot with which the American had floored Fury nine rounds into their first fight - did the damage. Wilder then fell again as Fury bulldozed him. At the bell, the pair glared at one another and Wilder knew he was in a place no fighter wants to be. The Britons sitting ringside did not want to be anywhere else. Wilder was taken to hospital after the fight and didn't appear at the news conference Was the weight Fury had gained making the difference? Was it the new training set-up? Whatever it was worked to perfection. He was putting on a boxing clinic and a body shot dropped the stunned Wilder once more in the fifth. Fury was docked a point for punching on the break but he did not seem to care or blink at the punishment, instead continuing to feint and twitch to set shots up before unloading on a man who had started a slight favourite. He led 59-52 59-52 and 58-53 on the cards when the towel came in. Fight week had seen repeated debate over where this meeting ranked in the pecking order of the greatest nights of heavyweight action, but little consensus. What we can say with certainty is that this was a masterclass. This video can not be played 'This was written in the stars' - Fury on beating Wilder Fury owned the centre of the ring and dictated the fight from the opening bell Wilder, under-appreciated through half a decade as a champion, knew this was the night he could fully silence doubters. Some 43 fights into an undefeated career his ability was still questioned by many, and scorned by some. Wilder's fabled right hand never showed up. It was telegraphed time and again and the Alabama fighter - who was cut close to his left ear - quickly left the arena to go to hospital for stitches on the damage. Coming in at the highest weight of his career may be offered up as an explanation for his shortcomings, but the gulf between the fighters was huge. In the years since Wilder first won the title, Fury has claimed three world belts, lost them without fighting amid problems with drugs, alcohol and depression, and gained the kind of weight that meant many assumed his boxing career was over. Now he is back at the top, with a back-story that has helped shape cult-hero status in the UK and now a burgeoning profile in the US. Tyson Fury sang to his wife after the fight He may flippantly say this title means little to him. He may continue to threaten to walk away from boxing. We can be certain he will lead us all a merry dance until the day it is all over. But when it is, this win will be remembered. There will be talk of a third Wilder fight and talk of a historic all-British meeting with Anthony Joshua. But the next moves can wait for now as here, on a Vegas Strip where dreams are so often dashed, Fury completed his journey from personal despair to sporting glory. What a ride it has been. Hopefully he is now better placed than the first time around to live with one of sport's sweetest of introductions - heavyweight champion of the world. Tyson Fury speaking to BT Sport Box Office:""I told everybody with a pair of ears that the Gypsy King would return to the throne. My last fight everybody wrote me off. I was underweight and over-trained. I'm a destroyer. Not bad for someone with pillow fists. ""I'm a man of my word. I told Wilder, his team, the world. We trained for a knockout; we wasn't tapping around in that gym. ""I talk like this because I can back it up. People write me off, they look at my fat belly and bald head and think I can't fight. He fought the best Tyson Fury, we're both in our primes. ""I expect him to ask for the third fight. I know he's a warrior and I'll be waiting."" Tyson Fury wore a trademark patterned suit to the post-fight news conference Promoter Frank Warren, speaking to the 5 Live Boxing podcast:""I have been doing this a long time and that was the best performance I have seen from a British boxer in the ring. ""I always believed Tyson would stop him and it is the best moment for me, selfishly, but it is also for him and his family. ""It is the best comeback in sport, not boxing. He was in the depths of despair and to pull himself back from that is the most amazing thing. It is special."" Deontay Wilder:""The best man won on the night. My coach threw in the towel but I'm ready to go out on my shield. ""I had a lot of things going on coming into this fight but it is what it is. ""I just wish my corner would have let me go out on my shield, I'm a warrior. But [Fury] did what he did and there's no excuses."" Former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis:""Congratulations to Tyson Fury on a huge win and bossing his way to the WBC and Ring heavyweight straps. Once again you showed up big. ""The best fighters solve puzzles. Tonight Fury solved the puzzle that was Wilder by making him fight going backwards where he's not as explosive. Big-manned him.""

'Maverick Fury one fight from immortality',"This video can not be played 'This was written in the stars' - Fury on beating Wilder Tyson Fury outclassed Deontay Wilder, became a world champion again, broke into a rendition of American Pie and had 16,000 people in the MGM Arena in the palm of his hand. It is feeling increasingly familiar. The world seems to dance to his tune these days. Since his return to boxing from a litany of personal issues, each venture, decision and fight he touches turns to gold. He risked a great deal whenfirst challenging Wilder in 2018, and ended up on the canvas. It looked a significant setback until he rose - just - and drew. An eye-watering financial deal with US broadcaster ESPN followed. He was badly cut invictory over Otto Wallinin September and needed time out to heal. ThenWWE rangand gave him the chance to earn big money, win new fans and avoid real punches in the process. His autobiography came out to much fanfare, he did a UK speaking tour, sang a pop song with Robbie Williams and signed for a two-part television documentary on his life. Saying yes to recovery has served him well. Now he must say yes to facing Anthony Joshua and demonstrate, beyond doubt, that he is the best heavyweight of his era. Of course, he says he already is and clearly he would take that bout. Fury has now dethronedWladimir KlitschkoandWilder,who had reigned for a combined 14 years until they faced the 'Gypsy King'. With such landmark victories, you sense he simply does not care who he shares a ring with. Money should not be an issue either, given the same Saudi Arabian power brokers who took Joshua's rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr to the Middle East were ringside for Fury's destruction of Wilder. They would throw record figures at the British heavyweights in order to stage the division's first fight for all four major belts. ""It has become the biggest fight in the history of the sport,"" said Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn. A fight in Saudi Arabia might not please UK fans, but money talks. It might just be the only commodity that can paper over the politics that would play out between the teams and television networks behind the fighters. Key figures close to Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis thought the pair would fight in 1996. It took six more years, proving how much things can drag on in boxing, however appetising the prospect. Fury must know this purple patch is his time to strike. He knows how things can change. The troubles that became public in 2015, controversial statements, ugly headlines and struggles with depression and drinking, are only one chapter of Fury's story. As early as 2012 he had talked of being in a dark place and of having an eating disorder. And in the build-up to the Wilder fight, one of Fury's team said the Briton still has severe down days. He has the capacity to charm Americans on glitzy talk shows one day and slip into confusion the next. Keeping him stimulated, his team have said, is critical in maintaining his mental wellbeing. It is hard to imagine Fury's immediate future proving more exciting than the 20 months since his break from the sport ended. And yet, as the great and good of boxing fell at the feet of the new champion in Vegas, maybe we learned there are greater levels he can reach. This video can not be played 'Not bad for an old fat guy who can't punch' - best of Fury's post-fight news conference Dave Coldwell described it as ""one of the most amazing nights I've watched in my time in boxing"" while fellow British trainer Joe Gallagher said Fury was ""the number one heavyweight in the world"". Those tributes came less than two months after Fury joined forces with Detroit-based trainer SugarHill Steward. Steward's uncle Emanuel, who trained fighters of the calibre of Thomas Hearns, Lewis and Klitschko, predicted more than 10 years ago that Wilder would become a world champion, and that Fury would be dominant once Klitschko retired. Fury effectively brought the curtain down on Klitschko and has now dominated Wilder. Steward called it. But what could Fury achieve under his nephew? A lot, if he can build on his latest win. The decision to take punching space away from Wilder by relentlessly smothering him was genius. A talented fighter backed by a calculated team can create something special. That is not to take anything away from Fury's former trainer Ben Davison, who rebuilt the champion at a time of crisis. And Fury's father John deserves credit for publicly demanding his son find a new team and bulk up after his win over Wallin. Fury listened and acted. The result was devastating. Whether it's jumping into WWE or singing with pop stars, he takes a chance, attacks the task with gusto and almost invariably comes up trumps. There is a bravery to his positive choices. He is a maverick, and he deserves immense credit. A unique achievement is his for the taking if he secures the fight that boxing has longed to see. If anyone can make it happen, it is probably him. The world, after all, seems to be dancing to his tune.

Fury stops Wilder - how social media reacted,"If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app,please go here,externalto see this story in full. Astonishing. One of the greatest performances by a British fighter. It was either going to be a Tyson Fury points win or a Deontay Wilder knockout, right? Wrong. Fury powered up the Las Vegas lights with a brutal display of boxing; dominating andstopping Wilder in the seventh roundto win the WBC heavyweight championship. Didn't wake up (or stay up) for the fight? Well, don't worry, let's take a look at how the night unfolded at the MGM Grand Arena... It's an understatement to describe Fury as a 'showman'. His now-infamous ring walks are a sight to behold; from coming in dressed as an 'all-American' before his win over Germany'sTom Schwarzin June to the traditional Arabian clothing inhis stint with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)in December. And he didn't disappoint this time - the 'Gypsy King' was carried in on a throne, wearing a robe and crown, to the tune of Crazy by Patsy Cline - maybe not the obvious choice to get you pumped up for a bout... Wilder's entrance was also far from low-key... Sparking a reaction from those on Twitter... Arguably the biggest heavyweight fight in recent memory, there was a real buzz in Vegas for Wilder versus ...'Furry?!'... Actor Michael J.Fox, YouTuber Logan Paul, wrestler Triple H and chef Gordon Ramsay; just some of the names from the world of entertainment who graced the arena with their presence... And you also had some heavyweight boxing royalty as former foes Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield reunited... Former heavyweight champions Mike Tyson (left) and Lennox Lewis They joined more than 15,000 fans who packed into the arena. It was quite the earner for promoters... After a long wait, the fighters' introductions were over and it was time for a scrap. Since their 2018 fight ended in acontroversial draw, Fury stopped the unknown Schwarz and laboured to a win over Sweden's Otto Wallin, whereas Wilder knocked out contenders Dominic Breazeale and Luis Ortiz. Many predicted this could be an early night's work for the champion, but Fury took the centre of the ring and continuously tagged the American in the early rounds. Before the fight, Wilder said Fury had ""pillow fists""... well, Wilder was soon resting his head on the canvas as Fury floored him in the third and the fifth. And fans were impressed... Soon enough, the inevitable happened. A barrage of unanswered punches and Wilder's corner threw in the towel. The boxing world stood up and applauded... Even Matchroom Boxing's Eddie Hearn, who promotes WBA, IBF and WBO champion Anthony Joshua, was full of praise for Fury... Fury faced some criticism for ditching trainer Ben Davison and linking up with American SugarHill Steward before this fight. Davison was credited for helping Fury on his journey back into boxing, after the heavyweight ballooned up to 27st and suffered well-documented issues with drugs, alcohol and his mental health. But this was a classy tweet from Davison... Fury was expecting to be in a war and, although it was a very one-sided win, he did taste some blood. Television replays appeared to show the Brit licking it off Wilder's neck during the fight. In the last year, Fury has ventured into professional wrestling and dueted on a single with Robbie Williams. Maybe next on his list is a cameo in the Twilight films... You've just shared the ring with the most feared puncher in the heavyweight division. What do you do next? Have a little song-song, of course. After having his hand raised, Fury took the mic and led the thousands in the building, and millions watching around the world, to a rendition of Don McLean's American Pie. He even got 88-year-old legendary promoter Bob Arum to join in, much to the amusement of fans... So what next for Fury? Wilder has 30 days to activate a rematch clause, and Fury says he expects the trilogy to happen, but there's not a huge demand for it... With Fury and Joshua holding all of the main belts, it's an incredible time for heavyweight boxing in Great Britain. So, will we see the two get it on? It would undoubtedly be one of the most high-profile sporting events to ever take place in the United Kingdom. And promoter Hearn is up for it... That, though, is talk for another day.

England end Ireland's Grand Slam hopesEngland rediscover some of their World Cup form to reignite their own Six Nations hopes.,"Six Nations: England v Ireland England:(17) 24 Tries:Ford, Daly, Cowan-DickiePens:FarrellCons:Farrell 3 Ireland:(0) 12 Tries:Henshaw, PorterCons:Cooney England ended Ireland's Grand Slam hopes in brutal fashion as they rediscovered some of their World Cup form to reignite their own hopes of landing the Six Nations title. First-half tries from George Ford and Elliot Daly after Irish defensive errors plus two conversions and a penalty from Owen Farrell gave England a commanding 17-0 lead. Ireland struck back with a try from Robbie Henshaw but with Johnny Sexton uncharacteristically wayward off the tee, they never seriously threatened a comeback. Luke Cowan-Dickie drove over for England's third midway through the second half, with replacement Andrew Porter's late try no sort of consolation for Ireland. With Wales at home in a fortnight before a trip to Italy, Eddie Jones' men will believe they can finish the championship in style, although they may need Ireland to do them a favour and beat France in Paris next month. For the men in green and their head coach Andy Farrell it was a chastening afternoon, all the optimism created by the wins over Scotland and Wales leaching away in a display that was ponderous until the game was gone. Calculating Jones loves every scrap as England coach We could have declared at half-time - Jones I need to look at myself - Ireland coach Farrell England blitz Ireland - the match as it happened Bonus podcast: England silence the 'sausages' Rugby Union Weekly: round three match highlights England began at a real lick, Manu Tuilagi punching holes through the middle and going close down the left before Andrew Conway hauled him down. And the reward came when Ben Youngs stuck a grubber kick through, Sexton dithered and juggled in his own in-goal area and Ford seized on the loose ball to touch down. Sexton then mis-kicked horribly with a straightforward penalty from 30 metres out and England set up camp again in the Ireland half. CJ Stander lost his shirt in a first-half tussle with Maro Itoje Jonathan Joseph danced through in midfield after a mis-hit clearing kick from Conor Murray as Maro Itoje and CJ Stander scrapped in the 22, and England's forwards hammered away at the Ireland line. With a penalty coming, the men in white shaped to go wide, only for Ford to pop through another kick - and this time it was Jacob Stockdale who dallied, Daly diving onto the ball as Irish hands went to heads. The scoreboard reflected the gulf between the two sides, England dynamic with ball in hand and ferocious in defence, Ireland laboured and error-ridden. And Sexton's miserable half was compounded when he was penalised for slowing the ball up, Farrell stroking over his kick to give England their biggest half-time lead over Ireland in 18 years. This video can not be played Were England more up for it than us? - Farrell ponders what went wrong for Ireland Ireland simply had to improve - and belatedly they did. An England knock-on from the restart gave away possession and the visitors finally chiselled out some territory too. England managed to stop an Ireland driving maul from a line-out close in but the pressure kept coming. Ireland won a penalty in front of the posts, opted for the scrum and eventually found space in the right-hand corner for Henshaw to burrow through two defenders and over the line. But Sexton shanked the conversion just as he had the first-half penalty and the pressure ebbed away as Jones threw on Cowan-Dickie, Ellis Genge and Charlie Ewels. England's scrum, strong throughout, began to dominate and the penalties started to mount. Farrell kicked to the corner, the forwards set up the maul from the line-out and Cowan-Dickie peeled off with Sam Underhill and Jonny May driving him on to roll over for England's third try. May was nearly clear on his own after seizing a loose ball from a messy Ireland ruck and appeared to be taken out by Henshaw after kicking the ball ahead, only for referee Jaco Peyper to wave play on. And as the game stumbled towards the line, Porter rumbled over from a metre out for a try that made little difference to Ireland's afternoon. A bravura performance in the back row from a man more normally seen in the second row. He made 14 tackles and eight carries in the hour he was on the pitch, setting the tone for a dominant England performance. And all on his 31st birthday, while sporting a spectacular shiner of a black eye and winning his 84th England cap - the same as former captain Martin Johnson. England head coach Eddie Jones:""We had a good preparation, we were always looking at this game and the next as the ones we had to be at our best. ""We were disappointed with the second half, but when you are playing against a side like Ireland you expect them to get some possession. We had to defend pretty well. Ireland head coach Andy Farrell:""I think the scoreline flattered us a little bit. We didn't start to play how we wanted to until the game was over. England were excellent, every side will look at themselves physically and they certainly won that battle. We didn't fire a shot in that first half. ""England were fighting to stay in the championship and that's what we need to be in the next two games - I need to look at myself regarding the performance of the first half."" Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson:""It's a fantastic win for England, they were dominant throughout the whole game. The tactics in the first half were spot on, but it was a bit strange they didn't continue that after half-time and put the game away. ""They were happy to let Ireland have the ball and defend. They were really comfortable."" Former England hooker Brian Moore:""Ireland's half-backs Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray have been world class for a long time but I don't think I've ever seen them play as badly, and certainly kick as badly. That created a platform for England who were sharp and really could have scored more tries. ""England's line speed was good throughout, they won the majority of the collisions and got on top in the set-piece."" Former Ireland number eight Jamie Heaslip:""If you keep showing the same picture against a side like England, they'll punish you. Make basic mistakes in the back-field, you will get punished. If you want to win a championship, you can't make those mistakes.""

Venice Carnival closes amid coronavirus outbreak,"This video can not be played Around 50,000 cannot enter or leave several towns without special permission Italian officials have cut short the Venice Carnival as they try to control what is now the worst outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe. Authorities in the Veneto region said the event would end later on Sunday, two days earlier than scheduled. Italy has by far the highest number of coronavirus cases in Europe, with 152. Three people have died. Italy has imposed strict quarantine restrictions in two northern ""hotspot"" regions close to Milan and Venice. About 50,000 people cannot enter or leave several towns in Veneto and Lombardy for the next two weeks without special permission. Even outside the zone, many businesses and schools have suspended activities, and sporting events have been cancelledincluding several top-flight football matches. The BBC's Mark Lowen described the situation just outside the zone. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In neighbouring Austria, a train from Venice was stopped at the Austrian border after it emerged that two passengers had fever symptoms. Austria's Interior Minister Karl Nehammer later confirmed to the BBC that the pair tested negative for coronavirus. ""All authorities have acted quickly and with great caution in this case,"" said Mr Nehammer in a statement. ""The reporting chain worked without delay."" What you need to know about the virus A visual guide to the outbreak Pregnant nurse 'propaganda' sparks backlash Elsewhere, authorities in South Korea and Iran are battling to control rising numbers of infections. South Korea has raised its coronavirus alert to the ""highest level"". In the UK,four passengers recently returned from quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for the virus. The new strain of coronavirus, which originated last year in Hubei province in China, causes a respiratory disease called Covid-19. China has seen more than 76,000 infections and 2,442 deaths. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on Saturday that ""extraordinary measures"" would come into force to try to stem the rising number of coronavirus cases. He said the quarantine restrictions could last for weeks. Police, and if necessary the armed forces, will have the authority to ensure the regulations are enforced. Angelo Borrelli, the head of Italy's Civil Protection Department, told reporters that 110 of the confirmed cases were in Lombardy, with 21 in Veneto with others in Emilia-Romagna and Lazio. Officials reported a third death on Sunday, an elderly woman from the town of Crema suffering from cancer. Are African countries ready? Four new UK coronavirus cases among ship evacuees Italian officials say they are still trying to trace the source of the outbreak. The Venice Carnival had been due to close on Tuesday but regional president Luca Zaia told Sky TG24 television on Sunday that it would be suspended, along with other events, in a bid to combat the virus. ""From this evening, we plan to stop carnival and all sporting activities until 1 March,"" he said. The colourful Venice Carnival draws thousands of visitors to the city every year Universities in Milan have been closed and the city's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said schools would also close their doors while the outbreak continued. ""As a precaution I think that the schools have to be closed in Milan. I will propose to the president of the region to enlarge the precaution to the entire metropolitan city area. It is just a precaution, we don't want to create panic,"" he said. Colette Walsh, an English teacher living in the town of Lissone, told the BBC that supermarket shelves were empty as people were panic-buying. Some guests were spotted in masks at the Dolce & Gabbana show ""It's surreal, I have never seen anything like it,"" she said. Meanwhile Giorgio Armani's fashion show, scheduled to be held in Milan on Sunday, went ahead but without any media or buyers present. The show was livestreamed on its website, Instagram and Facebook pages. Dolce & Gabbana's fashion week show went ahead as normal, though, with some guests wearing surgical masks. On Sunday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the country faced ""a grave turning point"", and the next few days would be crucial in the battle to contain the outbreak. South Korea has reported six deaths and more than 600 confirmed infections - the highest number outside China, although an outbreak of coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan, has also seen more than 600 cases. This video can not be played People in Daegu have voiced concern over the spread of the virus ""The government will raise the alert level to the highest level according to experts' recommendations,"" Mr Moon said. Health officials revealed a further leap in the number of coronavirus cases with a cluster of infections linked to a hospital and to a religious group near the south-eastern city of Daegu. South Korean sect identified as coronavirus hotbed My phone kept screeching at me as we approached Daegu. Several emergency alert messages flashed up on it. It's an annoying and alarming sound, but it can be useful. The messages tell you where a nearby confirmed coronavirus patient has been and at what time. They're incredibly detailed. It has times, dates, exact locations. For instance, one patient was in a Korean pool hall until 1.30am! We were shown one of the newly designated coronavirus hospitals. Dozens of ambulances were lined up outside, being sprayed with disinfectant. In each one was a patient with coronavirus waiting to be admitted. They are kept inside a plastic tunnel and transferred by staff who are head-to-toe in white protective clothing. Medics and staff rush in and out of the crisis centre, prioritising patients who need the most care. The majority of patients in hospital have mild symptoms. Chi-Heum Cho, the director of the Keimyung University Dongsan Hospital, told me he hoped they could get this outbreak under control in the next week. But he knows a lot will depend on how far it has spread. As you head outside, the streets of South Korea's fourth largest city feel almost abandoned. One or two people, with their heads down and mask on, walk purposefully past the shuttered shops. Most appear to be staying indoors. One of the region's leading jewellery stores still had 50 hopeful staff sitting at their counters. A couple of them told me how worried they were about this virus spreading, mostly for their elderly parents or young children. They don't have the hospital director's confidence that this will be under control soon. Of the 169 new cases announced in South Korea on Sunday, 95 of them are linked to a Christian sect in Daegu called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. The total number of cases connected to the church stands at 329. Iran said on Sunday it had 43 confirmed cases of the virus, most of them in the holy city of Qom. Eight of those infected have died, the highest number of deaths outside China. Iraq, Pakistan, Armenia and Turkey have closed their borders with Iran, and Afghanistan has suspended air and road travel to and from Iran. On Sunday, China's President Xi Jinping described the outbreak as the ""largest public health emergency"" in the country's recent history. He acknowledged ""shortcomings"" in China's response and said lessons must be learned. On Saturday, Chinese authorities reported a decrease in the rate of deaths and new cases of the coronavirus. But outside China, cases with no clear link to that country or other confirmed cases continue to rise, prompting concern from the World Health Organization (WHO). Are you in Italy?

Wuhan Britons end Milton Keynes quarantine,"More than 100 Britons rescued from China have left isolation, as dozens of people from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship begin a two-week quarantine. UK citizens previously evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan - the centre of the virus outbreak - have ended their isolation in Milton Keynes. It comes a day after those rescued from the Diamond Princess ship in Japan were taken to Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. On Saturday, the government confirmed that no new UK cases had been detected. People with backpacks and suitcases were pictured getting into waiting taxis outside Kents Hill Park conference centre in the east side of Milton Keynes, where 118 UK nationals and their family members were isolated. Paul Wilkinshaw, 39, who left the centre with his wife Lihong, 33, said it ""feels weird"" to not require protective equipment.

Bill To said ""everything was excellent"" during his two-week quarantine in Milton Keynes ""It was really good, everything was excellent. I'm happy I can go home now,"" another evacuee, Bill To, said. ""I'm going to get some Chinese food. Everything is good."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock commended the group ""for their patience and perseverance"". Vinnie O'Dowd, BBC News The last of those in quarantine at Kents Hill Park training centre left just before 12:00 GMT. The 118 people isolated here for two weeks were treated to pizza, katsu curry and steaks.

Others said they were just glad to be leaving and had sumptuous praise for the NHS staff that tended to them during their stay.

However, there was a function to the frills. It kept those in quarantine happy and relaxed, as each of them were tested for coronavirus three times over the two weeks of their stay.

'Narrowing window' to contain virus outbreak How a virus reveals the many ways China is feared Coronavirus: What you need to know The latest group of Britons to be evacuated - passengers from the cruise liner Diamond Princess - arrived at Arrowe Park on Saturday. The 30 Britons and two Irish citizens will spend the next 14 days isolated from the world in nurses' accommodation. They have already spent two weeks in quarantine on board the ship, but since then 600 passengers and crew have tested positive for the new virus. Those evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship landed at Boscombe Down, a MoD base in Wiltshire Four Britons from the ship who recently tested positive for the new coronavirus were not on the latest evacuation flight. They include David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, who have since been diagnosed with pneumonia, according to their family. They are being treated in a Japanese hospital.

S Korea declares highest alert over coronavirus,"The South Korean city of Daegu has seen the biggest increase in infections South Korea has raised its coronavirus alert to the ""highest level"" as confirmed case numbers keep rising.

Six people have died from the virus in South Korea and more than 600 have been infected. Meanwhile, Italy and Iran have announced steps to try to contain worrying outbreaks of the virus. In Italy, strict quarantine restrictions are in forcein two northern ""hotspot"" regions close to Milan and Venice. Around 50,000 people cannot enter or leave several towns in Veneto and Lombardy for the next two weeks without special permission. Even outside the zone, many businesses and schools have suspended activities, andsporting events have been cancelled including several top-flight football matches. South Korean sect identified as coronavirus hotbed What you need to know about the virus A visual guide to the outbreak Pregnant nurse 'propaganda' sparks backlash Amid the growing restrictions, the last two days of the Venice Carnival, on Monday and Tuesday, were cancelled. Italy has seen two deaths and the number of confirmed cases has risen to more than 100 - 89 of them in Lombardy. ""The contagiousness of this virus is very strong and pretty virulent,"" said Lombardy's health chief, Giulio Gallera. Iran's outbreak of coronavirus has significantly worsened, with the death toll rising to eight on Sunday. The government has acknowledged 43 confirmed cases although officials have warned the virus may have spread to ""all cities"". Schools, universities and cultural centres across 14 Iranian provinces have been closed from Sunday. The new strain of coronavirus, which originated last year in Hubei province in China, causes a respiratory disease called Covid-19. China has seen more than 76,000 infections and 2,442 deaths. On Sunday, China's President Xi Jinping described the outbreak as the ""largest public health emergency"" in the country's recent history. He acknowledged ""shortcomings"" in China's response and said lessons must be learned. Analysis by Fergus Walsh,medicalcorrespondent The combined situation in South Korea, Iran and Italy points to the early stages of pandemic. This means a global outbreak, with the coronavirus spreading in the community in multiple parts of the world. In each of these countries we are seeing spread of the virus with no connection to China. The lockdown efforts in Italy mirror those that have happened in China. The situation in Iran is especially worrying because the health authorities have reportedly said the virus has spread to multiple cities, and it appears the first case in Lebanon is linked to a traveller from Iran. If we have a pandemic, it will still be important to limit the speed of spread of the virus.  If countries could hold it somewhat at bay until the end of winter, there is a hope that warmer temperatures will reduce the time the virus can survive in the air, as we see with seasonal flu. But this may not be certain. On Sunday, health officials revealed a further leap in the number of coronavirus cases with a cluster of infections linked to a hospital and to a religious group near the south-eastern city of Daegu. The sixth death was confirmed at the Daenam Hospital, in Cheongdo, which treats the elderly and people with mental health issues. The hospital has seen more than 110 people infected including nine medical staff. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Korea has seen the largest number of confirmed cases after China. An outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has also seen more than 600 cases. ""The Covid-19 incident faces a grave turning point,"" President Moon said following a meeting with ministers and experts. ""The next few days will be crucial. The government will raise the alert level to the highest level of 'grave' according to experts' recommendations and drastically strengthen our response system."" This video can not be played People in Daegu have voiced concern over the spread of the virus Of the 169 new cases announced in South Korea on Sunday, 95 of them are linked to a Christian sect in Daegu called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. The total number of cases connected to the church stands at 329. In a video statement, a church spokesman expressed ""deep regret"" that many of its followers and citizens of South Korea had been infected. The spokesman added that the church had advised about 250,000 members to minimise their outside contact and take precautions. Shincheonji founder Lee Man-hee says he is ""the promised pastor"" Religious organisation founded in 1984 by South Korean national Lee Man-hee Lee, now in his 80s, describes himself as ""the promised pastor"" mentioned in the Bible Followers are taught to believe that Lee is the second coming of Jesus Christ Shincheonji is the abbreviation from Korean of ""New Heaven and New Earth"" Reportedly has more than 120,000 members around the world Accused of being a cult, and has been involved in controversies in several countries In other developments: Israel refused to allow non-Israelis to disembark from a Korean Air plane at Ben-Gurion Airport on Saturday. It had announced a ban on South Koreans and Japanese visitors, sparking an official protest from Seoul Dozens of evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise shiphave begun their two-week quarantine in the UK The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has expressed concern at the number of new cases with no clear link to China or other confirmed cases. In a briefing to the African Union on Saturday, he said the greatest concern now was countries with weaker health systems, particularly in Africa. Dr Tedros said the WHO was working with African governments to train thousands of health workers and to provide equipment to identify and treat infected people. ""Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems,"" he said. ""We are working hard to prepare countries in Africa for the potential arrival of the virus."" Dr Tedros said some countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, were using experience gained from testing for the Ebola virus to test for the new coronavirus. ""This is a great example of how investing in health systems can pay dividends for health security,"" he added. Concern in Daegu as coronavirus cases rise.

Italy imposes lockdown in coronavirus hotspots,"This video can not be played Around 50,000 cannot enter or leave several towns without special permission Italian officials have cut short the Venice Carnival as they try to control what is now the worst outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe. Authorities in the Veneto region said the event would end later on Sunday, two days earlier than scheduled. Italy has by far the highest number of coronavirus cases in Europe, with 152. Three people have died. Italy has imposed strict quarantine restrictions in two northern ""hotspot"" regions close to Milan and Venice. About 50,000 people cannot enter or leave several towns in Veneto and Lombardy for the next two weeks without special permission. Even outside the zone, many businesses and schools have suspended activities, and sporting events have been cancelledincluding several top-flight football matches.

In neighbouring Austria, a train from Venice was stopped at the Austrian border after it emerged that two passengers had fever symptoms. Austria's Interior Minister Karl Nehammer later confirmed to the BBC that the pair tested negative for coronavirus. ""All authorities have acted quickly and with great caution in this case,"" said Mr Nehammer in a statement. ""The reporting chain worked without delay."" What you need to know about the virus A visual guide to the outbreak Pregnant nurse 'propaganda' sparks backlash Elsewhere, authorities in South Korea and Iran are battling to control rising numbers of infections. South Korea has raised its coronavirus alert to the ""highest level"". In the UK,four passengers recently returned from quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for the virus. The new strain of coronavirus, which originated last year in Hubei province in China, causes a respiratory disease called Covid-19. China has seen more than 76,000 infections and 2,442 deaths. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on Saturday that ""extraordinary measures"" would come into force to try to stem the rising number of coronavirus cases. He said the quarantine restrictions could last for weeks. Police, and if necessary the armed forces, will have the authority to ensure the regulations are enforced. Angelo Borrelli, the head of Italy's Civil Protection Department, told reporters that 110 of the confirmed cases were in Lombardy, with 21 in Veneto with others in Emilia-Romagna and Lazio. Officials reported a third death on Sunday, an elderly woman from the town of Crema suffering from cancer. Are African countries ready? Four new UK coronavirus cases among ship evacuees Italian officials say they are still trying to trace the source of the outbreak. The Venice Carnival had been due to close on Tuesday but regional president Luca Zaia told Sky TG24 television on Sunday that it would be suspended, along with other events, in a bid to combat the virus. ""From this evening, we plan to stop carnival and all sporting activities until 1 March,"" he said. The colourful Venice Carnival draws thousands of visitors to the city every year Universities in Milan have been closed and the city's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said schools would also close their doors while the outbreak continued. ""As a precaution I think that the schools have to be closed in Milan. I will propose to the president of the region to enlarge the precaution to the entire metropolitan city area. It is just a precaution, we don't want to create panic,"" he said. Colette Walsh, an English teacher living in the town of Lissone, told the BBC that supermarket shelves were empty as people were panic-buying. Some guests were spotted in masks at the Dolce & Gabbana show ""It's surreal, I have never seen anything like it,"" she said. Meanwhile Giorgio Armani's fashion show, scheduled to be held in Milan on Sunday, went ahead but without any media or buyers present. The show was livestreamed on its website, Instagram and Facebook pages. Dolce & Gabbana's fashion week show went ahead as normal, though, with some guests wearing surgical masks. On Sunday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the country faced ""a grave turning point"", and the next few days would be crucial in the battle to contain the outbreak. South Korea has reported six deaths and more than 600 confirmed infections - the highest number outside China, although an outbreak of coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan, has also seen more than 600 cases. This video can not be played People in Daegu have voiced concern over the spread of the virus ""The government will raise the alert level to the highest level according to experts' recommendations,"" Mr Moon said. Health officials revealed a further leap in the number of coronavirus cases with a cluster of infections linked to a hospital and to a religious group near the south-eastern city of Daegu. South Korean sect identified as coronavirus hotbed My phone kept screeching at me as we approached Daegu. Several emergency alert messages flashed up on it. It's an annoying and alarming sound, but it can be useful. The messages tell you where a nearby confirmed coronavirus patient has been and at what time. They're incredibly detailed. It has times, dates, exact locations. For instance, one patient was in a Korean pool hall until 1.30am! We were shown one of the newly designated coronavirus hospitals. Dozens of ambulances were lined up outside, being sprayed with disinfectant. In each one was a patient with coronavirus waiting to be admitted. They are kept inside a plastic tunnel and transferred by staff who are head-to-toe in white protective clothing. Medics and staff rush in and out of the crisis centre, prioritising patients who need the most care. The majority of patients in hospital have mild symptoms. Chi-Heum Cho, the director of the Keimyung University Dongsan Hospital, told me he hoped they could get this outbreak under control in the next week. But he knows a lot will depend on how far it has spread. As you head outside, the streets of South Korea's fourth largest city feel almost abandoned. One or two people, with their heads down and mask on, walk purposefully past the shuttered shops. Most appear to be staying indoors. One of the region's leading jewellery stores still had 50 hopeful staff sitting at their counters. A couple of them told me how worried they were about this virus spreading, mostly for their elderly parents or young children. They don't have the hospital director's confidence that this will be under control soon. Of the 169 new cases announced in South Korea on Sunday, 95 of them are linked to a Christian sect in Daegu called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. The total number of cases connected to the church stands at 329. Iran said on Sunday it had 43 confirmed cases of the virus, most of them in the holy city of Qom. Eight of those infected have died, the highest number of deaths outside China. Iraq, Pakistan, Armenia and Turkey have closed their borders with Iran, and Afghanistan has suspended air and road travel to and from Iran. On Sunday, China's President Xi Jinping described the outbreak as the ""largest public health emergency"" in the country's recent history. He acknowledged ""shortcomings"" in China's response and said lessons must be learned. On Saturday, Chinese authorities reported a decrease in the rate of deaths and new cases of the coronavirus. But outside China, cases with no clear link to that country or other confirmed cases continue to rise, prompting concern from the World Health Organization (WHO). Are you in Italy?

All of a sudden, England's game against West Indies next Sunday looks very, very big. Lose that, and they will be as good as out. Nicky ShawEx-England all-rounder on BBC Test Match Special The improvement in South Africa's players in the last few years has been because they've come to Australia and England, played in the WBBL and KSL, and been exposed to a higher standard of cricket.

More to leave quarantine as cruise Britons isolateMore than 100 UK nationals end their two-week period in Milton Keynes as 30 others begin their isolation.,"More than 100 Britons rescued from China have left isolation, as dozens of people from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship begin a two-week quarantine. UK citizens previously evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan - the centre of the virus outbreak - have ended their isolation in Milton Keynes. It comes a day after those rescued from the Diamond Princess ship in Japan were taken to Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. On Saturday, the government confirmed that no new UK cases had been detected. People with backpacks and suitcases were pictured getting into waiting taxis outside Kents Hill Park conference centre in the east side of Milton Keynes, where 118 UK nationals and their family members were isolated.

Bill To said ""everything was excellent"" during his two-week quarantine in Milton Keynes ""It was really good, everything was excellent.

A simple guide to caucuses,"Iowa, where it's never too cold to caucus Four years after the world watched Donald Trump's momentum build and build until he became the Republican nominee, America is again deciding who will run for the White House. The nominees are being chosen through a series of primaries and caucuses in every US state and territory, that began in Iowa on 3 February and ends in Puerto Rico in early June. The Republican nominee will be Donald Trump. Even though technically he has a challenger, he is so popular among Republicans, he has a clear run ahead of him. With that in mind, the Democratic primaries are the only ones worth watching. It's an unusual process, not all of which makes sense, although we've tried. A whole year before the primaries, the first candidates emerged from hibernation. Over the year, others woke up and eventually 28 people announced they were running to become the Democratic nominee for president. But dwindling funds, luke-warm or (ice-cold) public reaction and campaign infighting have, to varying degrees, led to most of them pulling out of the race. Which Democrat will take on Trump? The strange symbol on one candidate's hand At the start of primary season, 11 people remained in the running, a number that has now reduced to three. In theory, any one of them could become the nominee. In reality, only two now have a chance. The first event of the primary season isn't a primary at all - it's a series of caucuses, in Iowa. These took place on Monday 3 February, in somewhat chaotic fashion. What are caucuses? This video can not be played How Iowa is like the luge: An unconventional guide to the caucuses A caucus involves people attending a meeting - maybe for a few hours - before they vote on their preferred candidate, perhaps via a head count or a show of hands. Those meetings might be in just a few select locations - you can't just turn up at a polling station. As a result, caucuses tend to really suit candidates who are good at rousing their supporters to get out of bed. People like Bernie Sanders, for example, who performed well in Iowa this time, as did Pete Buttigieg. Nine odd things about the Iowa caucuses Democrats' key issues explained Caucuses used to be far more popular back in the day, but this year, Democrats are holding only four in US states - in Nevada, North Dakota, Wyoming and Iowa. If any candidate gets under 15% of the vote in any caucus, their supporters then get to pick a second choice from among the candidates whodidget more than 15%, or they can just choose to sit out the second vote. Why does Iowa matter? A win there for any candidate can help give them momentum and propel them to victory in the primaries. Why is Iowa first in the primary calendar? You can blame Jimmy Carter, sort of. Iowa became first in 1972, for various technical electoral reasons too boring to go into here. But when Carter ran for president in 1976, his team realised they could grab the momentum by campaigning early in Iowa. He won there, then surprisingly won the presidency, and Iowa's fate was sealed. Why does Iowa not matter? Iowa doesn't represent the entire US - it's largely white, so the way people vote there is very, very different than in other states. Its record on picking the eventual nominees is a bit rubbish too, at least when it comes to Republicans - when there's an open Republican race, Iowa hasn't opted for the eventual nominee since 2000. Such names as Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz have won there in recent years. This year, Iowa suffered a bloody nose when the Democratic result was delayed by days due to technical glitches. Its curtain-raiser status may now be in doubt. New Hampshire: Intensely bucolic Eight days after Iowa on Tuesday, 11 February, was the first primary, in New Hampshire. The tiny north-eastern state of only 1.3m people once again became an unlikely hotbed of political activity. What is a primary? Unlike a caucus, where voters are expected to turn up at a few limited locations at certain times and stick around for a while, primary voters can just turn up at a polling booth and vote in secret. Then leave. How does a primary work? The more votes a candidate gets in a caucus or primary, the more ""delegates"" they are awarded, and all candidates will be hoping to win an unbeatable majority of delegates. The number of delegates differs in each state, and is decided by a convoluted series of criteria. In California's primary, for example, there are 415 Democratic delegates up for grabs this year. In New Hampshire, it was only 24. This year is a bit different. Any candidate would need to get at least 15% of the vote in any primary or caucus to be awarded delegates. There are still eight candidates in the running - an unusually large number - so there's a risk the vote share will be spread out and some of the candidates may struggle to reach 15%. After New Hampshire, we started to get a clear picture of who was struggling (Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren), but even though Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg had claimed the most delegates at this stage, neither is guaranteed to become the nominee. The picture became much clearer on... A few other states voted in between New Hampshire and the end of February, but things really started to warm up by Super Tuesday, on 3 March. What is Super Tuesday? THE big date in the primary calendar, when 16 states, territories or groups voted for their preferred candidate in primaries or caucuses. A third of all the delegates available in the entire primary season were up for grabs on Super Tuesday. By the end of the dayit became much clearer that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were the front-runnersfor the Democratic nomination. The two states with the most delegates voted on Super Tuesday - California (with 415 Democratic delegates) and Texas (228). California voted three months earlier than in 2016, making Super Tuesday even more super than normal. After hectic Super Tuesday, everyone gets to cool down for a week, before another busy day on Tuesday, 10 March, when six states vote, with 352 delegates available. After that, the primary season still has three months left to run and at the end, the role of those delegates will become clear... Hillary Clinton celebrates becoming the Democratic nominee at the 2016 convention. This is as good as things got for her campaign. Donald Trump will almost certainly be sworn in as the Republican nominee at the party convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, between 24 and 27 August. The Democrats will confirm their candidate at their own convention between 13 and 16 July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. What happens in a convention? Here's where those delegates come in. Let's say that during primary season, candidate A wins 10 delegates. During the convention, those 10 delegates would vote for candidate A to become the Democratic nominee. (Any party member can apply to be a delegate - they tend to be party activists or local political leaders.) All through the Democratic primaries, there are3,979 delegatesavailable. If any one candidate wins more than 50% of those delegates during primary season (that's1,990 delegates), then they become the nominee in a vote at the convention. But if we get to the Democratic convention and no-one has more than 50% of the delegates, it becomes what's known as a ""contested"" or ""brokered"" convention. This could well happen this year. There are so many candidates that no one frontrunner emerges in the primaries, and they split the delegates between them. In that circumstance, asecondvote would follow. In that second vote, all the 3,979 delegates would vote again, except this time they would be joined by an estimated771 ""superdelegates"". These are senior party officials past and present (former president Bill Clinton is one, as is current Vermont senator and presidential contender Bernie Sanders), and they're free to vote for whomever they wish. If a candidate wins 50% or more in that vote - 2,376 delegates - then they become the nominee. This is all thanks to a rule change in 2020: last time around, the superdelegates voted at the start of the convention, with the delegates. But many had pledged their support to Hillary Clinton even before the convention, leading her rival Mr Sanders to suggest the deck was stacked against him. He's the one who campaigned for the change - and it may benefit him in 2020. After inching past Iowa, negotiated New Hampshire, survived Super Tuesday and come through the convention, there is only one step left for the nominee: the presidential election, on 3 November.

Nevadans left behind by Trump's boom,"""We basically ended up living in our car"" Corin Kealoha and Shaun Karagory both work full time - but cannot afford food without the help of a food bank. ""We can't even live off our wages,"" says Corin, 46, who works as a hotel receptionist. ""That's why we come here."" The couple are at St Vincent's Food Pantry, in Reno, Nevada, where they have picked up cardboard boxes containing cereals, bread, milk, peanut butter, and some meat. And their story offers a glimpse into the complicated reality behind the economic recovery lauded by President Donald Trump. In his January State of the Union, President Trump hailed the ""great American comeback"", stating: ""Jobs are booming. Incomes are soaring. Poverty is plummetingâ¦ the years of economic decay are over."" US economy under Trump: The greatest ever? Trump's State of the Union speech fact-checked The Democratic 2020 race - in five charts It's a narrative he hopes will help him win November's presidential race - including in Nevada, a swing state that supported Hillary Clinton by a margin of just 2% in 2016. The western state, home to Las Vegas, was one of the worst hit by the 2008 financial crisis. House prices dropped up to 60%, unemployment soared to 14%, and the state had the highest number of home foreclosures nationwide. More than a decade on, Nevada's home values have recovered,the state came first for job growth,externalin the US in 2018, and unemployment now hovers at a 20-year low of 3.8%. But to get a sense of some of the limits of the recovery, you only have to take a walk in downtown Reno. Down North Virginia Street, there are glittery high-rise hotels and casinos, river walkways, and tourists taking selfies at the iconic Reno Arch, which proudly welcomes visitors to ""the biggest little city in the world"". Yet if you take a different turn, and walk down East Fourth Street, the city looks very different. Instead of high-rises, there are smaller, weekly motels, and instead of tourists, you can see queues outside shelters and soup kitchens, and homeless people sitting, chatting, or doing push-ups near the railway tracks. ""Unemployment is low, but unfortunately unemployment is not a great indicator of how many people are hungry,"" says Jocelyn Lantrip, from the Food Bank of Northern Nevada, which supplies charities including St Vincent's Food Pantry. And often, those going hungry - or temporarily homeless - are people who already have jobs. ""We have anything from 350 to 450 new families per month,"" says Carlos Carrillo, programme director at the St Vincent's Food Pantry, in between packing boxes with food. ""We used to have a lot of clients who were unemployed or on social security, but nowadays most of our clients are working families."" The food bank has even started offering dog and cat food to 1,500 families a month - a practical step after they realised that clients would often go hungry in order to feed their pets. A majority of clients say they are forced to use the food bank because rents have soared. ""They take money out of their food budget to pay for rent, so that's where we come in, to provide a bit of the food that they're not buying anymore,"" Mr Carrillo says. Carlos says St Vincent's Food Pantry serves about 300 families in Reno each day Elliott Parker, chair of economics at the University of Nevada, Reno, argues that ""recovery is in the eye of the beholder"". The latest data from the Census Bureau suggests that median household income is still just below 2008 levels, he adds. ""We are finally at the end of a very long recovery - but wages have risen nowhere near as fast as housing and rental prices."" Nevada has the nation's worst shortage of affordable housing for low-income families,according to an advocacy group,external, with only 19 homes for every 100 low-income renter households. There are various reasons for the housing crisis - including stalled construction from the 2008 financial crisis that has been slow to pick up. And Reno residents complain about the ""Tesla effect"" - as tech workers and retirees from the more expensive neighbouring state of California cross the border into Nevada, they push up rental prices for locals. ""Fifty percent of people in Nevada rent, and half of them are rent burdened - meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing,"" says state Senator Julia Ratti, whose district covers the Reno-Sparks area. ""This means they become very vulnerable to anything happening in their life - if you get a flat tyre, or your child needs medical care, you'll be late on your rent."" ""Rent has jumped so dramatically you can't even stay on your two feet,"" says Corin It's something Corin and Shaun, 39, experienced last year, after Shaun, who works as a security guard, developed fibromyalgia and had to take some time off work. ""We became homeless because I couldn't afford to pay the rent,"" says Corin. ""We basically ended up living in our car."" They have since moved into a studio apartment - although the rent, which is $900 a month, takes a significant bite out of their wages - they both earn $10 per hour. ""We're not stable yet - we're not even sure what's going to happen,"" Corin says with a laugh. ""We just live day by day for now."" John Restrepo, an analyst at RCG Economics in Las Vegas, says it is both true that the economy overall has grown - and that many working families are still suffering. Those with equities in the stock market and small businesses have come out as winners from the economic recovery, he says, but wage earners have lost out. Las Vegas is experiencing record unemployment ""About 60% of our households are not invested in the stock market - they depend on wages - and a large percentage of those folks, particularly lower-income workers, haven't benefited from the recovery at all,"" says Mr Restrepo. ""The challenge is that wages have been pretty stagnant after you adjust for inflation."" He believes that many companies, ""as a result of the great recession, decided to do business differently"" - hiring more contractors and gig workers. Nevada was also coming out of a particularly deep recession, which means ""we've been growing for 10 years now, but it's also one of the slowest recoveries in terms of the rate of recovery."" The other issue that comes up again and again when you speak to Nevadans is the cost of healthcare. Jim Eaglesmith spent four years caring for his mother, who had been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and eventually lost his job in a physical therapy clinic after he had to reduce his hours to look after her. ""The expenses of rent, home, healthcare, hospice and prescription needs meant I depleted my savingsâ¦ in the last three years I used up her savings and my 401K. I spent everything I had thinking she was going to have some money left over, but I ended up having to spend almost all of it,"" he says. Jim lives at the Village on Sage Street, in a dormitory in a modular unit After that, he says he was effectively homeless for two months, couch surfing with different friends until he was able to move into Village on Sage Street - a dormitory developed by the Community Foundation of Western Nevada - which is designed to help working poor individuals and offers single rooms for as little as $400 a month. ""I can't afford a lot of things, but I'm not here to make money,"" says Jim, who now works part time as a performance artist. ""My value isn't based on my economic worth."" US healthcare costs are amongst the highest in the world,external- which means even middle-income families can feel vulnerable. Adrielle Hammon, 35, works in a pre-school, making $9 an hour. Last year, she and her husband qualified for Medicaid, a public healthcare scheme for poor Americans - which meant when her son had a medical emergency, the $40,000 hospital bill was covered. This year, her family's income has grown - Adrielle believes they are now ""roughly middle class"" - but it means they no longer qualify for Medicaid, and neither of them receives health insurance through work. ""We can afford food, gas and bills now,"" she says. ""But you throw in things like hospital bills, and that's something worrisome... I don't go to the doctor for anything unless someone's literally dying."" ""I don't see it ever being the case that we can afford to buy a house"" - Adrielle Hammon And the American dream of owning their own home seems like a remote possibility, which she admits bothers her because ""we always figured that by the time we were this age, we'd be able to afford to buy a house."" For many lower-income families, housing and healthcare costs can combine, to make them more vulnerable to unexpected emergencies. Angel Mcceig-Escalanti, 44, says most of her family's income is spent on rent, and dealing with problems with their car. ""We've not been able to save any money at all - we have really been struggling,"" she says. She lives with her husband, her mother, and one of her three children in a two-bedroom apartment costing $1,270 a month - ""and one person doesn't have a bedroom - my mother sleeps on the couch."" ""I only use the system when I need it"" - Angel Mcceig-Escalanti She visits St Vincent's Food Pantry for fresh and canned fruit and vegetables, and visits several other food banks for help as well - particularly because, as a diabetic, she has to have a low-carbohydrate diet. ""We could buy food, just not the sort of food I should be eating. I'm supposed to be low carb, but that's the stuff that is the cheapest."" She also chooses the food carefully, hoping that this will help ensure her teenage son doesn't develop diabetes when he's older. In politics, and in the media, it can be tempting to generalise - whether it is about the economic recovery, or the plight of lower-income families. But the reality is often more nuanced - especially as the working class don't necessarily see themselves as poor. I met Kayshoun Grajeda, 33, at the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas - a training centre that has built-in kitchens, a restaurant, and bedrooms for hospitality staff in training. She's beaming with pride as she explains it's her last day on the guestroom attendant course, and as she demonstrates how to make a bed in five minutes while keeping the sheets perfectly smooth. ""If you really want something, and put your best foot forward, you can accomplish it,"" she adds. ""There's help - you've just gotta want it. You can't put the blame on somebody else."" Kayshoun says her three children are extremely proud that she is about to graduate from the Culinary Academy The single mother of three has just been offered a job with a hotel, and believes it will be a significant step up from her previous job as a hair dresser. ""I want things for my kids, so this is definitely a good start, you know? I'm starting at $15.35, but it's a start! It's above minimum wage,"" she says with a grin. It's a sense of positivity that is partly shared by Deidre Hammon, who lives with her daughter Brianna in a mobile home in a trailer park on the outskirts of Reno. Deidre (who is also Adrielle's mother) works three jobs - as a contractor at a law firm, as an advocate at a centre for children with disabilities, and as a carer for Brianna, 36, who lives with cerebral palsy. ""We're all very optimistic about our lives, we don't want to see ourselves as poor people who can't afford anything,"" she says. But she adds that the difficulties that working families face are very real. Her car just broke down, so she's been forced to spend $250 per week on a rental car, since she needs to drive for work and to transport Brianna around. Brianna and Deidre Hammon While she would rather work in a full-time role with benefits, ""it's easier to have low-wage jobs I can quit easily, and then find another low-wage job"" - because she sometimes needs time off at short notice to care for her daughter. She also can't afford a wheelchair van - which means she has to manually help Brianna in and out of the car. ""I have to swing the wheelchair into the back of the car, break it down, put it together, and transfer Brianna into the car, two to three times a day. I have amazing upper body strength right now, but who knows how long that's going to last? I'm almost 60!"" She says she has to look after Brianna herself, because there aren't enough service providers in northern Nevada. She meets other mothers caring for adult children with disabilities, and they all find the prospect of their children living without them ""terrifying"", she adds. ""We all feel like we can't die, ever - because who's going to take your place?"" Chris says he plans to vote Republican: ""I prefer to go by my standards - I'm pro-life"" Meanwhile, Christopher Ripke lives with epilepsy, and works full time as a dishwasher at the University of Nevada, Reno - sometimes working seven days a week, as he often offers to work overtime. He also leads People First, a non-profit that helps people with disabilities. He makes $9.30 an hour - sometimes making $13.50 per hour for overtime - and also receives some rental assistance and food stamp assistance, but says he still falls below the poverty level. Despite that, he feels pleased to have medical coverage in his job - and says he ""absolutely"" feels optimistic about his future. ""I'm setting money aside for future plans - I plan to move to Texas because the healthcare's better."" Nevada is third in the Democratic primary race - and the state bills itself as more ethnically diverse, and more working class, than either Iowa or New Hampshire. At Wednesday's Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar all made specific appeals to working families, or talked about the need to raise wages. At Wednesday's Democratic debate, several candidates made overt appeals to the working class But voting patterns can be personal - and unpredictable - and politicians take the working-class vote for granted at their peril. Deidre, Brianna and Adrielle all support Bernie Sanders because of his Medicare for All proposals - and do not want to see President Trump win. Brianna says bluntly: ""If Trump gets re-elected I'm probably dead. He plans to cut all the programmes that make my life possible."" Meanwhile, Christopher and Angel both support President Trump - Christopher because he disagrees with the Democratic candidates' stance on abortion, and Angel because ""when he says something, he does it"". Christopher uses food stamps, and is not convinced by reports that Mr Trump's proposed budget would cut food stamps and the safety net. ""That's one thing I don't believe - if I see it, I see it, but I've heard nothing about that."" Meanwhile, Angel believes Mr Trump's proposal to reduce the safety net is a good idea. ""I've been working since I was 13, andâ¦ I only used the system when I needed it. People don't do that anymore, now they use it because there's free stuff."" And while Kayshoun's ""best foot forward"" attitude chimes in with how the Republicans say they help working families, she's actually unimpressed with both Mr Trump, and the Democratic candidates. ""We need a new president, and not the one we've got,"" she says, adding that she plans to vote independent this year ""because I'm not really feeling nobody"".

Sensational Fury stops Wilder to win world titleBritain's Tyson Fury becomes world heavyweight champion for the second time.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played 'Not bad for an old fat guy who can't punch' - best of Fury's post-fight news conference Tyson Fury produced the most destructive performance of his boxing life to end Deontay Wilder's five-year reign as WBC heavyweight world champion in seven thrilling rounds of their Las Vegas rematch. The Briton, 31, pummelled his rival in a way few could have imagined following their 2018 draw, flooring him in the third and fifth rounds while constantly backing up the most-feared puncher in the division in a way no-one has done before. A jab and right hand - the combination with which Wilder has wiped men out repeatedly - sent the American down in the third, stunning the MGM Grand Arena. Wilder, making his 11th defence, fell again before the round was out - this time a slip - and looked ragged under the pressure, before a left hand to the body sent the 34-year-old down in the fifth. Fury delivered everything he had promised, transitioning from his hit-and-move style to overpower, outwork and bully his previously undefeated rival until the towel came in during the seventh round. This was more than a world title win, it was a statement - and as Fury was held aloft by his corner after victory was sealed, the days of depression, weight gain and despair that cost him the belts he claimed in 2015 seemed a lifetime away. Relive Fury v Wilder II - from the ring walks to the winning moment 'There's a fella across the pond who might want a tickle' - Fury says Joshua bout will 'complete' career 'Living legend' Fury shines bright in Vegas - but did he lick Wilder's blood? Podcast: Costello & Bunce on Tyson Fury's night for the ages Tyson Fury was carried to the ring on a throne Thousands of British fans who had descended on Vegas saw their hero take an age to arrive at the ring on a throne, sporting a golden crown. It was the only time Fury moved slowly all night. He hit pads in the ring as Wilder made his ring walk - just as he did 15 months earlier in Los Angeles - and his start was rapid, a flurry of hooks prompting chants of ""there's only one Tyson Fury"" from the crowd. Actors Michael J Fox and Jason Statham, as well as Super Bowl winner Patrick Mahomes, watched as Fury raised his hand at the end of the opening three-minute round and things began to feel markedly different to their first meeting. He simply did not take a backward step, forcing Wilder to the ropes and ensuring the champion had no say in the pace of proceedings. And in the third round, those who had paid the kind of ticket prices that made this the highest gate ever for a heavyweight bout in Nevada, rose to their feet at the sight of Wilder floored for only the second time in his career. A right hand behind Wilder's ear - the same shot with which the American had floored Fury nine rounds into their first fight - did the damage. Wilder then fell again as Fury bulldozed him. At the bell, the pair glared at one another and Wilder knew he was in a place no fighter wants to be. The Britons sitting ringside did not want to be anywhere else. Wilder was taken to hospital after the fight and didn't appear at the news conference Was the weight Fury had gained making the difference? Was it the new training set-up? Whatever it was worked to perfection. He was putting on a boxing clinic and a body shot dropped the stunned Wilder once more in the fifth. Fury was docked a point for punching on the break but he did not seem to care or blink at the punishment, instead continuing to feint and twitch to set shots up before unloading on a man who had started a slight favourite. He led 59-52 59-52 and 58-53 on the cards when the towel came in. Fight week had seen repeated debate over where this meeting ranked in the pecking order of the greatest nights of heavyweight action, but little consensus. What we can say with certainty is that this was a masterclass. This video can not be played 'This was written in the stars' - Fury on beating Wilder Fury owned the centre of the ring and dictated the fight from the opening bell Wilder, under-appreciated through half a decade as a champion, knew this was the night he could fully silence doubters. Some 43 fights into an undefeated career his ability was still questioned by many, and scorned by some. Wilder's fabled right hand never showed up. It was telegraphed time and again and the Alabama fighter - who was cut close to his left ear - quickly left the arena to go to hospital for stitches on the damage. Coming in at the highest weight of his career may be offered up as an explanation for his shortcomings, but the gulf between the fighters was huge. In the years since Wilder first won the title, Fury has claimed three world belts, lost them without fighting amid problems with drugs, alcohol and depression, and gained the kind of weight that meant many assumed his boxing career was over. Now he is back at the top, with a back-story that has helped shape cult-hero status in the UK and now a burgeoning profile in the US. Tyson Fury sang to his wife after the fight He may flippantly say this title means little to him. He may continue to threaten to walk away from boxing. We can be certain he will lead us all a merry dance until the day it is all over. But when it is, this win will be remembered. There will be talk of a third Wilder fight and talk of a historic all-British meeting with Anthony Joshua. But the next moves can wait for now as here, on a Vegas Strip where dreams are so often dashed, Fury completed his journey from personal despair to sporting glory. What a ride it has been. Hopefully he is now better placed than the first time around to live with one of sport's sweetest of introductions - heavyweight champion of the world. Tyson Fury speaking to BT Sport Box Office:""I told everybody with a pair of ears that the Gypsy King would return to the throne. My last fight everybody wrote me off. I was underweight and over-trained. I'm a destroyer. Not bad for someone with pillow fists. ""I'm a man of my word. I told Wilder, his team, the world. We trained for a knockout; we wasn't tapping around in that gym. ""I talk like this because I can back it up. People write me off, they look at my fat belly and bald head and think I can't fight. He fought the best Tyson Fury, we're both in our primes. ""I expect him to ask for the third fight. I know he's a warrior and I'll be waiting."" Tyson Fury wore a trademark patterned suit to the post-fight news conference Promoter Frank Warren, speaking to the 5 Live Boxing podcast:""I have been doing this a long time and that was the best performance I have seen from a British boxer in the ring. ""I always believed Tyson would stop him and it is the best moment for me, selfishly, but it is also for him and his family. ""It is the best comeback in sport, not boxing. He was in the depths of despair and to pull himself back from that is the most amazing thing. It is special."" Deontay Wilder:""The best man won on the night. My coach threw in the towel but I'm ready to go out on my shield. ""I had a lot of things going on coming into this fight but it is what it is. ""I just wish my corner would have let me go out on my shield, I'm a warrior. But [Fury] did what he did and there's no excuses."" Former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis:""Congratulations to Tyson Fury on a huge win and bossing his way to the WBC and Ring heavyweight straps. Once again you showed up big. ""The best fighters solve puzzles. Tonight Fury solved the puzzle that was Wilder by making him fight going backwards where he's not as explosive. Big-manned him.""
