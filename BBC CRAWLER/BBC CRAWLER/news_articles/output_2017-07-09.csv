Holiday sickness fakers face crackdown,"Ministers are seeking to make it harder for UK holidaymakers to make bogus food poisoning claims. Travel industry bosses and Spanish hotels have complained of a huge rise in false insurance claims. They warned that heavy payouts could lead to British tourists paying higher package holiday prices and being barred from some resorts. The government said it would reduce the cash incentives of bringing such cases against holiday firms. Justice Secretary David Lidington said it wanted tolimit the legal costs,externalthat travel firms had to pay out for the claims. ""Our message to those who make false holiday sickness claims is clear - your actions are damaging and will not be tolerated,"" Mr Lidington said. The problem recently led Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to observe British digestive systems ""had become the most delicate in the world"". Travel trade body Abta said it ""strongly welcomed"" the government move. The escalating problem of claims, according to one UK travel company boss, risked making British tourists the laughing stock of Europe. That's because thousands of French, German, Danish etc holidaymakers staying in the same hotels and dining in the same restaurants as British tourists, didn't get as sick and as often as UK visitors. The dilemma for hotels and restaurants is the cost of challenging these claims in the courts is so high yet the sums involved are relatively modest. So most hotels and their insurance firms simply pay out. That ends up with higher premiums for everyone else. This move to clamp down on bogus claims by the government could - in theory - save us all some money. UK holidaymakers who are found guilty of making a fraudulent claimface up to three years in jail, the Ministry of Justice said. It added that the travel industry estimated holiday sickness claims had increased by 500% since 2013 - a rise not seen in other countries. The government is closing a loophole that means legal costs are not currently capped on claims for foreign holidays. Those with genuine claims will still be able to sue for damages, it said. Mark Tanzer, chief executive of Abta, said: ""These claims are tarnishing British holidaymakers' reputation abroad, particularly in Spain where they are costing hoteliers millions of pounds."" He welcomed efforts to stop firms from ""unduly profiting from false claims"", but called on the government to also increase transparency between claims firms and solicitors. Last month, Tui's UK managing director Nick Longman and Thomas Cook UK's managing director Chris Mottershead both warned that if the problem continued, it could spell the end of the all-inclusive holiday for UK travellers. Mr Mottershead said: ""It has the potential of putting hoteliers out of business. They will stop British customers coming into their hotels."" A British citizen was arrested in Majorca in June for encouraging holidaymakers to submit bogus claims for food poisoning against the hotel where they were staying. It followed an undercover operation by the hotel chain which had been subjected to a spike in claims from UK tourists.

Brexit may never happen - Cable,"This video can not be played Vince Cable: ""I'm beginning to think Brexit may never happen"" Sir Vince Cable - the likely next Lib Dem leader - says he is ""beginning to think Brexit may never happen"". He said ""enormous"" divisions in the Labour and the Tory parties and a ""deteriorating"" economy would make people think again. ""People will realise that we didn't vote to be poorer, and I think the whole question of continued membership will once again arise,"" he said. He was speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show. Key Brexit bill faces opposition Cable open to cross-party Brexit working His comments were dismissed by leading Eurosceptic Conservative MP Owen Paterson, who said Sir Vince was just ""chucking buckets of water around"" and ignoring the ""huge vote"" in favour of leaving in the referendum and at the general election, where the two main parties backed Brexit. ""Vince Cable's party went down in votes, as did the other little parties who want to stay in the European Union,"" he told the BBC's Sunday Politics. He added: ""I am afraid Vince is behind history. We are going to leave. We are on target."" Sir Vince conceded that the Lib Dem policy on a second referendum on the terms of a Brexit deal ""didn't really cut through in the general election"". But he said it could offer voters ""a way out when it becomes clear the Brexit is potentially disastrous"". The former business secretary looks set to be crowned Lib Dem leader. He is the only candidate following the resignation of Tim Farron. This video can not be played Cable 'behind history' on Brexit - Tory MP Sir Vince told the BBC he wants to work with Labour and Tory MPs to block what he regards as Theresa May's ""hard Brexit"" policy. ""A lot of people are keeping their heads down,"" he said, and ""we'll see what happens"" when MPs returned from their summer break. But he added: ""I'm beginning to think that Brexit may never happen. ""The problems are so enormous, the divisions within the two major parties are so enormous. I can see a scenario in which this doesn't happen."" MPs are set to vote on the Repeal Bill, a key piece of Brexit legislation, in the autumn. Sir Vince has said he wants to form a cross-party coalition including like-minded Tory and Labour MPs to oppose Britain's exit from the single market - the official policy of both the Conservative and Labour parties. He said Labour MPs who disagreed with their leader's position were welcome in his party, and predicted Labour's divisions on the issue would get worse. ""Jeremy Corbyn had a good election, for sure, but there is an element of a 'bubble' about it,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""He managed to attract large numbers of people on the basis that he was leading opposition to Brexit. ""Actually he is very pro-Brexit, and hard Brexit, and I think when that becomes apparent, the divisions in the Labour Party will become more real and the opportunity for us to move into that space will be substantial."" Sir Vince has come under fire for saying Theresa May's comment, in her 2016 Conservative Party conference speech, that ""if you believe you're a citizen of the world, you're a citizen of nowhere,"" was like something out of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. Quizzed by Andrew Marr on this, Sir Vince said he had got the wrong dictator: ""I got my literary reference wrong - I think it was Stalin who talked about 'rootless cosmopolitans'."" Sir Vince, who won back his Twickenham seat at the general election, is not expected to face a challenger for the Lib Dem leadership but he said would still produce a manifesto. He suggested he would back income tax rises to pay for improvements to health and social care.

Labour 'aim' to wipe Â£100bn student debt,"Labour's ""ambition"" is to write off all student debt, which would cost Â£100bn, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has said. The Labour MP said it was a ""huge amount"" and the party would not commit to doing it ""unless we can afford to"". The Conservatives said it was a ""shambolic"" proposal, which Labour had no idea how to fund and would lead to higher taxes. Labour has pledged to scrap university tuition fees if it wins power. But leader Jeremy Corbyn went further in aninterview with the NME,externalduring the election campaign, suggesting existing debts could be wiped. Reality Check: What would wiping student debt cost? 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees He told the music magazine: ""There is a block of those that currently have a massive debt, and I'm looking at ways that we could reduce that, ameliorate that, lengthen the period of paying it off, or some other means of reducing that debt burden. ""I don't see why those that had the historical misfortune to be at university during the Â£9,000 period should be burdened excessively compared to those that went before or those that come after. I will deal with it."" The Greens were the only party at the general election to include a commitment to wipe all student debt in their manifesto. Quizzed by the BBC's Andrew Marr on how much it would cost, Ms Rayner said: ""It is a huge amount, it is Â£100bn, which they estimate at the moment, which will increase. ""It's a huge amount of money but we also know a third of that is never repaid."" Lord Adonis has called for tuition fees to be scrapped Ms Rayner said Mr Corbyn had said it was an ""ambition"", but she added ""we will not announce that we're doing it unless we can afford to do that"". She added: ""I like a challenge, Andrew, but we've got to start dealing with this debt crisis that we're foisting on our young people. It's not acceptable. ""They are leaving university with Â£57,000 worth of debt, it's completely unsustainable and we've got to start tackling that."" Last month, the Student Loan Company said that outstanding debt on student loans had increased by 16.6% to Â£100.5bn at the end of March. Only about a third of the students who have taken out Â£9,000-a-year loans are expected to pay them back fully, meaning the government will have to pick up part of the bill. Lord Adonis, who came up with the student fees policy as Tony Blair's policy director, has called for them to be scrapped or vastly reduced, sayingin an article for the Guardian,externalthat he had never meant to create a ""Frankenstein's monster of Â£50,000-plus debts for graduates on modest salaries"". He blamed ""greedy"" university vice-chancellors, who successfully lobbied the coalition government to increase the Â£3,000 cap on fees to Â£9,000. Conservative First Secretary of State Damian Green, who is effectively Theresa May's second-in-command, has called for a ""national conversation"" on tuition fees, to consider whether they should be paid out of taxes. Angela Rayner has previously called on the government to reverse the abolition of student maintenance grants to help the most disadvantaged students. She also wants to reduce the interest rate that students have to pay on their loans, which has gone up to 6.1%. Asked by Andrew Marr if fewer working class youngsters were getting into university education as a result of tuition fees, she said: ""I don't believe that that's the case actually, but I do believe that many working class and part-time and older mature students are actually leaving university."" Conservative MP Luke Hall said Ms Rayner's comments contradicted Mr Corbyn's claim that fewer people from disadvantaged backgrounds were going to university. He said: ""The truth is that the number of people going to university from disadvantaged backgrounds has never been higher. ""Now Labour are making shambolic promises to spend Â£100bn extra, without any idea of how to fund it, that could only be paid for through higher taxes on families. ""This government is committed to making sure that everybody has the chance to go to university no matter their background, so that we can build a country that works for everyone."" 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees Reality Check: What would wiping student debt cost?

Men shot in play park disturbance,"Six men were found with injuries near a children's play area in Ballantay Terrace A 23-year-old man is in a critical condition in hospital after being shot in a large scale disturbance in the Castlemilk area of Glasgow. Six men were taken to hospital following the incident near a children's play area in Ballantay Terrace at about 20:00 on Saturday. Police said up to 15 individuals were involved in the incident, which they described as attempted murder. A 25-year-old man is also in a stable condition in hospital. Officers said that on arrival at the scene they found six men with various injuries. Det Ch Insp Martin Fergus said children and other members of the public were in the area at the time of the attack. He told BBC Scotland: ""The call that we received was that there was a large scale disturbance, upwards of 12 to 15 individuals of various age groups engaged in a large scale disturbance using weapons. ""It's [too] early to say exactly what the motive behind this was, we are working on the hypothesis that this may be a localised feud between families, we don't know at this stage. DCI Martin Fergus said children and other members of the public were in the area when the disturbance broke out ""What I can confirm is that two individuals received injuries consistent with gunshot wounds, one of which is critical and fighting for his life as I speak. ""The other male also received critical injuries, however, they are not thought to be life threatening at this time. ""Other males that were also involved in the disturbance have received an array of injuries all believed to be serious."" Since the six men were admitted to hospital in the city, four have been discharged. Supt John McBride said officers would be patrolling the area to reassure the local community. He said: ""It happened in a sunny Saturday evening when children were undoubtedly out playing in the area and if you're a parent there and you've got a young kid, you probably want that feeling of safety."" He added: ""It is important for people to know that this was not a random attack, it was a targeted attack involving two separate factions."" ""It was such a large incident. We have got six people seriously injured, one of whom is still in a critical condition in hospital, one in a stable condition, and four with serious injuries."" The area where the attack took place is largely overlooked by housing and officers believe many people will have witnessed the incident as a result. They have urged anyone with information to come forward.

'May's cry for help to Corbyn',"Theresa May's speech on Tuesday reaching out to opposition parties makes the lead for several of the papers - with headlines such as ""May's cry for help to Corbyn"" in the Daily Telegraph, ""Weakened May pleads for support from rivals"" in the Times and ""May appeals to Labour for policy ideas"" in the Guardian. The i says the prime minister's message would have been unthinkable,externalbefore her election gamble backfired. The Times says it is an admission,externalof her political weakness. For the Guardian,external, the speech will be seen as an attempt to relaunch her faltering premiership. The Telegraph says Mrs May's appeal comes at a time,externalwhen her leadership is at its weakest, with calls by Tory MPs for her to stand down after her failure to secure a majority. TheFinancial Times,externaldescribes it as an attempt to shore up her premiership against mutinous MPs as she prepares to publish the most significant piece of Brexit legislation - the Repeal Bill - on Thursday. Manoeuvring among ambitious backbenchers and pro-EU MPs is intensifying ahead of the bill, it adds. Leo McKinstry in the Daily Express,externalsays there's no obvious, clear alternative to Mrs May, so the idea of a smooth coronation for her successor is just a fantasy. The Sun agrees, saying a coronation to replace her won't happen,externaland the leadership battle will be a bloodbath. It will put the Brexit talks on hold and make us a laughing stock in Brussels, the paper adds. Forthe Daily Mirror,externalhowever, talk of plots means the prime minister's mind is on personal survival rather than Britain's future prosperity. It thinks she should resign and call another election. The Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror and the Sun lead on Monday's fresh High Court hearing on the case of the terminally-ill baby, Charlie Gard. The Mail says his heartrending fight for life has gripped the world,external, and even prompted dramatic interventions from the White House and the Vatican. Today, it adds, his parents will beg the court to be able to seek treatment for his rare genetic condition, which has left him on life support. It has the headline: ""Charlie's day of destiny"". The Sun's headline says their plea to the judge will be,external: ""Give our Charlie a miracle."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Reports and pictures of Iraqi forces and civilians celebrating on the streets of Mosul following the Iraqi government's announcement that the city had been liberated from the Islamic State group are on several front pages. The Guardian says victory in Mosul is both a strategic and symbolic milestone,externalfor Iraqi fighters backed by US-led coalition forces. But its residents have paid a steep price, with thousands killed or wounded in the battle. TheFinancial Times,externalwarns that the advances on IS-held territory in Iraq and Syria will deal a heavy blow, but not eliminate the group. It says its militants can melt into the desert and will probably keep up insurgent attacks and suicide bombings. And theTelegraph says the UK and other European countries must be ready,externalfor the threat arising from the return of more jihadis. Other extremists, it adds, will head for Libya or Sinai, presenting a menace to the world for years to come. The Sun,externalwelcomes the proposal to keep zero hours contracts - one of the expected recommendations of the government's review of employment practices. It accepts that some workers are exploited, but says most like the flexibility they offer. Banning them - it argues - would harm small businesses who can't afford full-time staff. The review strikes a decent balance by enhancing workers' rights without damaging business, it adds. The Times,externalreports that ministers have rejected calls to lower interest rates on student loans. It quotes a government source as saying that interest charged on loans is below equivalent market rates and those of payday lenders, and they offer protection to borrowers that critics overlook. The paper says First Secretary of State Damian Green appeared to support a review of tuition fees last month. But the source tells the paper he was trying to highlight that Labour's policy of abolishing fees would mean the reintroduction of student number controls, reversing progress in social mobility and a dramatic underfunding of universities. The Daily Mail,externalhas the results of a study of what it calls ""motherhood in 2017"", showing how the pressures of parenting and holding down a career have meant that many traditional tasks have fallen by the wayside. According to the research, 23% of women said they did not have time to cook an evening meal from scratch and one in five was unable to find time to make a child's birthday cake. Among the 1,000 mothers polled, 17% were unable to take a role in their child's Parent Teacher Association and a third said chores such as ironing bed linen were too much for them. But - the paper adds - the vast majority made sure they never missed important events in their children's lives such as attending a school play, parents' evening or sports day. Finally, depending which paper you read, play at Wimbledon will be ""magic Monday"" for the Mail; ""mega Monday"" for the i and ""middle Monday"" for the Telegraph.

The i says,externalthat if Andy Murray and Johanna Konta win their matches they will be through to the quarter-finals - and that would be the first time a British man and woman have made the last-eight together since 1973.

Tesla boss Musk unveils latest model,"Tesla co-founder Elon Musk tweeted the first image of the Model 3 after it rolled off the production line Tesla co-founder and chief executive Elon Musk has shared the first images of the electric car company's Model 3 after it came off the assembly line. Mr Musk tweeted a picture captioned ""First Production Model 3,external"" on Saturday. The entrepreneur followed it up with another Model 3 photo, this time in colour, outside the Tesla factory site in California. The Model 3 is Tesla's first mass-market car and the first 30 owners will get in the driver's seat on 28 July. The four-door Model 3 will then be available to the public, with a base price of $35,000 (Â£27,100), almost half that of the Tesla's next-cheapest model. Tesla's share price more than doubled between December and late June as investors backed Mr Musk's strategy to transform the low-volume luxury electric car maker into a producer for the crowded mass-market, but has since fallen back. Tesla boosted ahead of new car launch Elon Musk reveals underground road vision Can Tesla live up to its value? Registrations for new Teslas in California, the car maker's largest market, were down 24% in April compared with April 2016, according to IHS Markit data. The company responded by calling the figure ""cherry-picked"" data. Tesla reported that first-half 2017 global deliveries for all its models rose to 47,100. That was at the lower end of its predicted sales range of 47,000 to 50,000. In its last full financial year results the company made a loss of $889m (Â£689m).

Lake District awarded Unesco status,"About 18 million people visit the Lake District each year The Lake District has joined the likes of the Grand Canyon, the Taj Mahal and Machu Picchu by being awarded Unesco World Heritage status. The national park was one of 33 sites around the world to bediscussed by the Unesco committee,externalin Krakow, Poland. The committee praised the area's beauty, farming and the inspiration it had provided to artists and writers. It is the 31st place in the UK and overseas territories to be put onthe Unesco World Heritage List,external. The committee suggested the impact of tourism be monitored and requested improvements in conservation efforts. The delegates heard the 885 sq-mile (2,292 sq km) Lake District had been trying to obtain the Unesco status since 1986. Lord Clark of Windermere, chairman of the Lake District National Park Partnership which put together the bid, described the decision as ""momentous"". In pictures: Where are the UK's world heritage sites? Men-only island gets World Heritage nod Windermere is England's largest natural lake ""A great many people have come together to make this happen and we believe the decision will have long and lasting benefits for the spectacular Lake District landscape, the visitors we welcome every year and for the people who call the National Park their home,"" he added. Steve Ratcliffe, director of sustainable development at the Lake District National Park, said the application had been a ""long time in the making"" and he was ""incredibly proud"" of the landscape which has been shaped by nature, farming and industry. He told the committee: ""The Lake District now becomes an international and global property and we look forward to working with you and our communities to make sure this site inspires future generations around the world."" Steve Ratcliffe said it ""has taken millennia to become the evolving masterpiece it is today"" About 18 million people visit the Lake District each year, spending a total of Â£1.2bn and providing about 18,000 jobs. It is home to England's largest natural lake - Windermere - and highest mountain - Scafell Pike. The Lake District has inspired artists and writers Nigel Wilkinson, managing director of Windermere Lake Cruises, said he was hopeful the Unesco status would put the Lakes on an international level. ""What we really hope is it will act as an economic driver and will grow the value, not the volume, of tourism by giving people more... reasons to make day visits and sustained visits."" Harriet Fraser, a writer and patron of Friends of the Lake District, said: ""It's the most beautiful district but it has a very deep culture which is largely hill farming but also conservation.""

Iraqi PM in Mosul to celebrate IS defeat,"This video can not be played Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi met Iraqi forces on his arrival in Mosul Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi has visited Mosul to congratulate Iraqi forces for their ""victory"" over Islamic State militants in the city. The city was ""liberated"", with ""just one or two pockets"" still controlled by IS, his office said in a statement. Iraqi forces, backed by US-led air strikes, have been battling to retake Mosul since 17 October last year. Islamic State militants seized it in June 2014 before proclaiming a ""caliphate"" straddling Iraq and Syria. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen have also been involved in the gruelling battle. The Iraqi prime minister arrived to ""congratulate the armed forces and the Iraqi people"" on the final defeat of IS in Mosul on Sunday, the statement said. Iraq's federal police celebrated in the Old City of Mosul on Sunday ""Victory is certain, and what remains of [IS] is surrounded, and it is just a matter of time for us to announce the great victory to our people,"" Mr Abadi said. There were celebrations in the streets during Mr Abadi's visit but he has not yet given a speech formally declaring triumph. His office says victory will be formally declared after Iraqi forces clear out the remaining pockets of jihadists desperately holding out in a tiny area near the Old City. Battle for Mosul: The story so far Where is 'Islamic State' leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? After Mosul: The Iraqi towns still under IS control Airstrikes and exchanges of gunfire could still be heard on Sunday, and plumes of smoke seen rising into the sky. The fall of Mosul does not mean the end of IS in the country. It still hasterritoryelsewhere - such as Tal Afar and three towns in the western province of Anbar - and is able to carry out bombings in government-held areas. Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent This video can not be played The BBC reports from Mosul where rescue teams are searching for survivors Troops helped a steady stream of fleeing civilians - mostly women and children - to safety. Their faces were haunted and some had to be helped. The children didn't even flinch when there was more sound of gunfire. An older woman was so weak she could barely walk. A few babies being carried looked almost lifeless. If this is victory it's come at a huge cost. Not just in human life. Nearly everyone rescued had had to leave dead relatives behind. Almost every building in the old city has been scarred or completely destroyed. Search and rescue teams are still pulling bodies from the rubble. The heat has contributed to the stench of decaying corpses. Read more The government announced the ""liberation"" of eastern Mosul in January, but the west of the city, with its narrow, winding streets, has presented a more difficult challenge. Some 900,000 people have been displaced from the city since 2014 - about half the pre-war population - aid organisations say. Sally Becker, an aid worker with Road to Peace, an NGO helping children get access to medical treatment in war zones, said it was the ""worst devastation that I've ever seen"". ""I've been working in conflict areas now for 25 years, so I've seen most of them: Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, and I have never seen anything as bad as this,"" she said. Save the Children warned of the psychological impact on the children ""haunted by memories of extreme violence, or of loved ones killed in front of them"". ""For children and their families to process these horrors and rebuild their lives, psychological support will be absolutely crucial"", said Ana Locsin, Save the Children's Iraq country director. ""But right now the world is providing next to no funding for mental health."" French President Emmanuel Macron and British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon are among those to congratulate Mr Abadi, and thank soldiers - including French and British troops - for liberating the city. Ina joint statement,external, EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini and its aid commissioner Christos Stylianides said: ""The recovery of Mosul from the hands of (IS) marks a decisive step in the campaign to eliminate terrorist control in parts of Iraq and to free its people."" They called for a ""process of return and the re-establishment of trust between communities"".

Shoppers 'in the dark' about Brexit effect,"UK shoppers are ""completely in the dark"" about the effect Brexit will have on their weekly shop, a former Sainsbury's boss has told BBC Panorama. Justin King, who ran the supermarket for a decade, said the ""last thing"" any current supermarket boss would reveal was their intention to put up prices. But he added it was ""very clear"" shoppers would face ""higher prices, less choice and poorer quality"". The main supermarkets declined to speak to BBC Panorama. Mr King, who ran Sainsbury's until 2014, said: ""Brexit, almost in whatever version it is, will introduce barriers. ""That makes it less efficient which means all three of those benefits - prices, quality and choice - go backwards."" Food and farming combined are the UK's biggest manufacturing sector and the EU is involved all along the chain - from what grows in British fields to the labels in shops. This video can not be played Ex-Sainsbury's boss warns Brexit will impact our weekly shop The EU also guarantees free trade across the continent and Mr King - who supported Remain - said this frictionless movement kept food prices down. Mr King, who has said the weaker pound will push up prices, added that EU membership helped retailers find the best suppliers and markets throughout Europe. He also said the EU had driven up standards and enabled the UK to get out-of-season vegetables all year round. But manufacturing boss and Leave campaigner John Mills believes the EU keeps prices artificially high for the shopper. He said: ""Food prices inside the EU vary from food product to food product, but the average is something like 20% higher than they are in the rest of the world - so there is very substantial scope for food prices coming down if we switch sources of supply outside the EU."" Mr Mills, chairman of consumer goods firm JML, said cheaper prices may not mean lower standards. What does Brexit mean for UK farmers? Business leaders urge single market until Brexit deal Food chiefs warn on post-Brexit tariffs He said: ""The reason why food prices are higher inside the EU is because they have got tariffs which keep the prices up. ""It's not anything to do with quality - it's due to the institutional arrangements which means the food prices are kept much higher to increase farmers' incomes."" Some British farmers fear that a bad Brexit deal - which does not protect them - could drive them out of business. John Davies, a livestock farmer from Powys in Wales, told Panorama: ""I'm really scared of imports - produced to completely different standards [with] hormones, you know, feedlot beef, you know - we're based on green and pleasant land, high environmental standards. We really are proud of that."" Brexit: Good or bad for Welsh farmers? Feedlots - places where cattle are fattened for slaughter - are common in the US, which is the world's largest beef producer. It supplies one fifth of the beef eaten around the world. But in the UK, less than 1% of the fresh and frozen beef bought last year came from the US, according to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB). Possibly the most controversial difference in livestock farming either side of the Atlantic is the American use of growth hormones, which is banned in the EU. The UK is largely self-sufficient when it comes to beef - with home-grown British beef accounting for 76% of purchases last year. Brexit could change that. Mr Davies said: ""Brexit could have a massive effect on our food-producing ability in this nation, that's a key strategic decision to be made."" David Trowbridge from the Iowa Cattlemen's Association says US beef is ""very competitive"" The prime minister has already been driving for new deals in America and the UK's special relationship with the US could provide a source of cheap food. David Trowbridge, president-elect of the Iowa Cattlemen's Association in the US, told BBC Panorama: ""We don't want to destroy an industry within another country, but you know... we are very competitive... It's up to your consumers on what they want to pay for the product."" In the UK, we spend roughly 8% of our income on food, according to the World Economic Forum. Americans spend 6% - less than any other country in the world - and that is partly down to large-scale, cheap and efficient farming. Other farmers that Panorama spoke to welcomed Brexit. Jacob Anthony, a 24-year-old fifth generation beef and sheep farmer who runs a 700-acre farm in Bridgend, Wales, voted to leave the EU. ""I'm a young farmer and I'm looking to the future,"" he said. ""I think a lot of us in the industry were not happy with the way the sector was going and I thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for realistic change."" Farmer Jacob Anthony hopes that leaving the EU will open up export opportunities Mr Anthony said leaving the EU would give British farmers a chance to strike new trade deals and push into new emerging markets. Last year, 13% of UK-produced beef was exported, according to the AHDB, whose spokesman said it was largely the bits British shoppers did not want. Conservative MP James Cleverly insists that the UK doesn't ""have to just roll over"" in Brexit negotiations. He said: ""We are a highly desirable market. That actually gives us some strength in the negotiations."" For Mr Mills, it is the establishment who ""doesn't really like Brexit"". ""And they are throwing up difficulties all over the place, which I don't think are going to materialise to anything like the extent to which they claim,"" he said. Ex-Sainsbury's boss Mr King is concerned, however, that ""there has been, in my estimation, almost no conversation about the potential impact of Brexit on the food supply chain by definition"". He said with less than two years to go until Brexit, ""food needs to get on the agenda pretty soon"". The government has said little about plans for food and farming after Brexit, and the new Environment Secretary Michael Gove declined to speak to BBC Panorama. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""As the secretary of state has made absolutely clear, there will be no diminution or watering down of food standards. ""Leaving the EU provides us with a golden opportunity to develop a new farming and food policy. ""We will remain global leaders in environmental and animal welfare standards, maintain our high quality produce abroad and reduce pressure on the weekly household budget.""

May to fight back with 'fairness' vow,"This video can not be played Theresa May met her Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull in Downing Street Theresa May is to call on rival parties to ""contribute and not just criticise"" as she signals a post-election change in her style of government. In a speech on Tuesday the PM will say she still wants to change the country, but will say that losing her majority means a new approach is needed. Labour says it shows the Conservatives have run out of ideas. But First Secretary of State Damian Green said it was a ""grown-up way of doing politics"". Ministers loyal to Mrs May have dismissed reports of plots to remove her as drink-fuelled ""gossip"", but Labour remains on an election footing, with leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he hopes for a fresh poll in September. Theresa May 'quit' stories blamed on 'warm Prosecco' September election would be nice - Jeremy Corbyn MPs call for 'all options' on Brexit Mrs May will return to the message from her first day in Downing Street last July, when she succeeded David Cameron, and vow to lead what she called a ""one nation"" government that works for all and not just the ""privileged few"". The speech is being seen by some as a ""re-launch"" or ""fightback"" after Mrs May lost her majority - and much of her authority - in the snap election last month. Theresa May's speech is a pitch for cross-party consensus. ""Come forward with your own views and ideas about how we can tackle"" the challenges the country faces, Mrs May will say, adding: ""We may not agree on everything, but ideas can be clarified and improved and a better way forward found."" Bluntly, it is an explicit acknowledgement of her fragility; her authority and majority shrivelled. Government sources say it is a mature approach that maintains a commitment to taking on big, difficult and complex challenges; not just Brexit but reform of social care, too, for instance. Labour says Mrs May's speech proves the Conservatives have ""completely run out of ideas"" and were reduced to ""begging"" for policy proposals from them. In her speech, the PM will say that although the result of June's election was not what she wanted, ""those defining beliefs remain, my commitment to change in Britain is undimmed"". Her ""belief in the potential of the British people and what we can achieve together as a nation remains steadfast, and the determination I have to get to grips with the challenges posed by a changing world never more sure"", she will say. She will unveil a review - of casual and low-paid work - by Matthew Taylor, a former top adviser to Tony Blair, which she commissioned when she became prime minister. Matthew Taylor will publish his employment review on Tuesday It is thought Mr Taylor, who has been examining the use of zero-hours contracts and the rise in app-based firms such as Uber and Deliveroo, will stop short of calling for a compulsory minimum wage for those employed in the so-called gig economy, who do not have guaranteed hours or pay rates. But he is expected to propose a series of extra rights for those in insecure jobs and could also recommend shaking up the tax system to reduce the gap between employees and the self-employed. He is also likely to call for measures to improve job satisfaction for people working in minimum wage jobs,according to The Guardian.,external In her speech, Mrs May will say: ""When I commissioned this report I led a majority government in the House of Commons. The reality I now face as prime minister is rather different. ""In this new context, it will be even more important to make the case for our policies and our values, and to win the battle of ideas both in Parliament as well as in the country. ""So I say to the other parties in the House of Commons... come forward with your own views and ideas about how we can tackle these challenges as a country. ""We may not agree on everything, but through debate and discussion - the hallmarks of our parliamentary democracy - ideas can be clarified and improved and a better way forward found."" This video can not be played The PM has a programme for Britain that will spread prosperity, the first secretary of state tells Today She will acknowledge the fragile nature of her position in the Commons but insist it will not stop her taking ""the bold action necessary to secure a better future"". Speaking at a press conference with Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull on Monday, Mrs May said she had sought input from other parties in the past on issues like counter-terrorism and modern slavery. She also said she was happy to work with Labour's Yvette Cooper and others in a cross-party approach to tackling intimidation and online abuse of MPs and others involved in the political process. Asked if her desire for co-operation extended to Brexit, including on the government's Repeal Bill when it is published later this week, the prime minister said she was seeking the ""broadest possible consensus"" surrounding the terms of the UK's exit. But former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said people would take the calls for cross-party working with ""a lorry load of salt"" - and he questioned why Mrs May had not raised the issue a year ago when she entered Number 10. ""The reason she wasn't asking for it then was she didn't need to,"" he said. Damian Green: This is a grown up way of doing politics Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""A call for Labour to contribute is superfluous. On the single biggest issue of our generation, Brexit, Corbyn isn't contributing, he is cheerleading."" Scottish Government Brexit minister Michael Russell said: ""If the prime minister is genuinely interested in creating a consensus then Scotland should have a seat at the negotiations to leave the EU."" But Mr Green, who has known Mrs May since university and is effectively her deputy prime minister, said the public would welcome a move away from politics in which parties ""just sit in the trenches and shell each other"". ""Politicians of all parties are invited to contribute their ideas - that's a grown up way of doing politics,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said Mrs May was motivated by ""her duty"" to carry on, adding: ""She still has the same ambitions for this country as she had a year ago and she's determined to put them into practice for the good of this country - that's what drives her."" Asked if the PM could be tempted to step down after her summer holiday, he said: ""No. She thinks not just that it's her duty, but she has a programme for Britain that encompasses not just a good Brexit deal, but also a domestic agenda that will spread prosperity around this country, make this a fairer society, tackle some of the injustices that we still have in our society - and that fire burns within her as strongly as ever."" The BBC's assistant political editor, Norman Smith, said that the Conservatives and Labour were ""poles apart"" on many significant policy areas. He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""More brutally, Jeremy Corbyn is not minded to help Theresa May. He smells blood in the water. ""He wants to do everything he can to stampede Mrs May into another election, so the idea he might somehow seek to cooperate with her, I think, is bordering on the fanciful.""

May 'quit' stories down to 'warm prosecco',"This video can not be played David Lidington MP: ""Too much sun and warm Prosecco leads to gossipy stories in the media"" Justice Secretary David Lidington has dismissed speculation about Theresa May's future as the product of ""too much sun and too much warm Prosecco"". He said summer drinks parties produced ""gossipy stories"" and the public wanted the PM to get on with her job. Stories have suggested the PM is under pressure,externalto name a departure date after losing her Commons majority. There are also reports Tory MPs are unhappy with the deal Mrs May did with the DUP to prop up her government. Mr Lidington, who was promoted to the job of justice secretary by Mrs May in her post-election reshuffle, described stories about Mrs May's leadership as ""gossip"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I have been in Parliament 25 years and almost every July a combination of too much sun and too much warm Prosecco leads to gossipy stories in the media. ""But the key thing is this - the public's had an election and I think they want politicians to go away and deal with the real problems this country is facing"". Former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell has, meanwhile, sought to play down comments about Mrs May,reported in the Mail on Sunday,external. He reportedly told a private dinner for Tory MPs that Mrs May was dead in the water and should go. A Conservative MP present at the gathering told the paper: ""He said she was weak, had lost her authority, couldn't go on and we needed a new leader. ""Some of us were very surprised and disagreed with him."" Mr Mitchell, who was described as a key ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis, one of those being tipped as a future Tory leader, said the Mail story was ""an overheated report of a private dinner conversation"". Mr Mitchell is alleged to have made the comments at a dinner on 26 June, the day Mrs May struck a deal with the DUP to prop up her minority government. He did not mention Mr Davis in his comments at the One Nation Commons dining club of Tory MPs, of which he is the secretary, the newspaper added.

Funeral held for death-fall acrobat,"Pedro AuniÃ³n Monroy was a trained dancer, specialising in aerial stunts The funeral for a Brighton acrobat who died during a performance has been held in Spain, a family friend has said. Specialist aerial dancer Pedro AuniÃ³n Monroy was suspended in a cage during the Mad Cool festival in Madrid on Fridaywhen he plunged 100ft to his death. A Buddhist ceremony was held on Saturday and a Catholic cremation carried out earlier. His friend Gary Taylor said Mr Monroy was a ""huge bundle of energy"". He told the BBC a Prince song was played during the funeral for the Portslade-based dancer, and his ashes will be buried with his grandmother's in Spain on Monday. Gary Taylor has paid tribute to his 'kind and energetic' friend ""Pedro and his partner Mike are both Buddhists and [Mike] said afterwards it was a very powerful experience,"" Mr Taylor said. ""Pedro was a huge ball of energy, a very big character and a very kind man. ""I've got a lot of funny memories, but far too few memories now. He was a big showman and died as you might expect, with an audience. ""His family are lovely... they are all devastated and shocked."" Mr Monroy's last Facebook post before his death Mr Monroy died between performances by Alt-J and Green Day, and paramedics spent 30 minutes trying to revive him. It is unclear at this stage what caused the fall. Mr Taylor said he expects there will be an investigation into the circumstances, as the Mayor of Madrid, Manuela Carmena, had told the family she wanted to know exactly what happened. Mr Monroy had his own performance company, In Fact Aerial Dance, based in Brixton, London, and previously worked as a self-employed massage therapist at The Grand Hotel, Brighton. In statement on the 45,000-ticket sell out festival's website, directors Javier Arnaiz and Farruco CastromÃ¡n said they did not initially inform the audience or the bands the fall was fatal because of ""security reasons"".

Climber dies after Ben Nevis fall,"The climber died after falling on Tower Ridge on Ben Nevis A climber has died after falling on Tower Ridge on Ben Nevis. Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team said the man had suffered fatal injuries in the fall on Saturday morning. The Coastguard rescue helicopter from Inverness was diverted from training and arrived on the scene at about 11:10 BST. The climber was airlifted from the mountain and transferred to an ambulance at the Torlundy helicopter landing site near Fort William. The rescue team praised the helicopter crew for recovering the man from a ""very difficult location"" on the mountain. Tower Ridge is one of several big ridges on the north-east face of the 1,345m (4,413ft) Ben Nevis and is considered by many climbers to have an Alpine feel because of its length and exposure. A spokeswoman for the Coastguard said the operation had taken about two hours. A Coastguard rescue helicopter airlifted the man from the mountain In a post on the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team's Facebook page,a spokesperson for the team wrote,external: ""We are sad to report that a call out yesterday was to a climber who suffered fatal injuries sustained in fall while climbing Tower Ridge. ""Our thoughts and condolences go out to his family and friends."" ""A big thank you to R951 who did a fantastic job to make the recovery from a very difficult location and all the climbers who assisted and brought down the climber's friend."" Twenty people died in the Scottish mountains last year,according to Mountaineering Scotland,external. Three of the fatalities were on Ben Nevis,including the deaths of Rachel Slater and Tim Newton, who were killed by an avalanche on the mountain in February 2016.

Tory-DUP deal facing legal challenge,"Ciaran McClean stood unsuccessfully for the Green Party in West Tyrone in June's election A mental health worker is to legally challenge the UK government's deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Ciaran McClean, who is a member of the Green Party, says the pact breaches the Good Friday Agreement and the Bribery Act. The DUP has agreed to support the minority Conservative governmentin important votes, in return for money for Northern Ireland. A former government lawyer said the bribery claim was ""spurious"". The government has said it believes theconfidence and supply agreement,externalis within the law. May's deal with the DUP: What you need to know Who are the DUP? Where will the money go? Â£1bn deal no 'silver bullet' Mr McClean has launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund the judicial review. David Greene, Mr McClean's solicitor, said an application for a judicial review would be submitted either on Monday or Tuesday. On his crowdfunding webpage, Mr McClean, who stood unsuccessfully for the Green Party in West Tyrone in June's election, says the government is ""threatening hard-won peace"" with its DUP deal. The Tory-DUP deal came two weeks after June's election resulted in a hung Parliament ""The Tories are being propped up by the DUP in order to cling to power after the recent election. This horrifies me. It's straight bribery - money for votes. ""The deal flies in the face of the Good Friday Agreement, under which the government is obligated to exercise its power with 'rigorous impartiality' on behalf of all the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions."" He is pursuing the legal challenge as an individual, not on behalf of the Green Party. Mr McClean's solicitor is a senior partner at London-based Edwin Coe solicitors, who represented hairdresser Deir Tozetti Dos Santos,one of the claimants in the successful Brexit challenge in the Supreme Court. Mr Greene told the BBC there had been a ""public outcry"" over the Tory-DUP deal. ""It's not a question of foisting views and the important point is this is about the rule of law,"" he said. ""This is about a citizen's entitlement to go in front of a court and say that doesn't look right and to be able to challenge it in some meaningful way."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Tory Chief Whip Gavin Williamson sign off on the deal Alberto Costa, former government lawyer and now MP for South Leicestershire, told the BBC the investment given to Northern Ireland as part of the deal was not a ""personal inducement"" and Prime Minister Theresa May had a constitutional duty to form a government. He said the deal was ""transparent and lawful"" and the bribery claim was ""vexatious"" and ""totally without merit"". Under the confidence and supply arrangement, the DUP guarantees that its 10 MPs will vote with the government on the Queen's Speech, the Budget, and legislation relating to Brexit and national security -  while Northern Ireland will receive an extra Â£1bn over the next two years. While rival parties in Northern Ireland have largely welcomed the additional funding, concerns have been raised that the deal could undermine the peace process and devolution negotiations, with the UK government dependent on the support of the DUP. The deal was also widely criticised by opposition parties in the UK. Labour branded it ""shabby and reckless"", while the Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones called it a ""straight bung"" and said it ""kills the idea of fair funding"".

"Time to work with Russia, Trump says","Mr Putin (L) and Mr Trump met on Friday in Germany and, among other things, spoke about Russia's alleged interference in the US election US President Donald Trump says it is time to work ""constructively"" with Russia after his meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. He tweeted,externalthat Mr Putin ""vehemently denied"" interfering in the US election at their first face-to-face encounter at the G20 on Friday. But Mr Trump's position contrasts with some of his own senior officials. And he is facing criticism from within his party after revealing a proposal to partner with Russia on online security. He tweeted that he and Mr Putin had discussed forming ""an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking and many other negative things will be guarded and safe"", prompting derision on social media and from the Republican Party. Senator Marco Rubio suggested that such an initiative would be like partnering with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on chemical weapons.

She told CNN that talking to Russia should never mean that the US ""take our eyes off the ball"". And US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said interference in the 2016 election remained an impediment to better relations with Russia. A special prosecutor is investigating whether Trump associates colluded with alleged Russian efforts to influence last November's US election. At the meeting at the G20in Hamburg, both sides confirmed that the presidents had discussed Russia's alleged meddling, but at the time seemed unable to agree on the exact outcome. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Mr Trump accepted Mr Putin's assertions that the allegations were not true. Mr Tillerson, meanwhile, said the two men held a ""robust"" discussion on the issue, and that Mr Trump had pressed the Russian leader on several occasions - but that an ""intractable disagreement"" might remain.

Charlie Gard's parents make hospital plea,"This video can not be played Charlie's parents want to take him to the US The parents of Charlie Gard have joined supporters to deliver a petition to Great Ormond Street Hospital calling on doctors to allow the sick baby to travel to the USA for treatment. The petition has been signed by more than 350,000 people. The 11-month old boy's case is due to return to the High Court on Monday after the hospital said it had seen claims of new evidence relating to the potential therapy. His family said the fight was not over. Speaking outside the hospital, Charlie's parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard thanked their supporters and the media for sharing the story of their 11-month-old son worldwide. The couple both in their 30s and from Bedfont, west London, want to take the baby to a hospital in the US for experimental treatment, but lost a lengthy legal battle after judges ruled in favour of doctors at GOSH. GOSH doctors argued the therapy would not improve Charlie's quality of life. Charlie Gard has been in intensive care since October Mr Gard said they needed a specialist in Charlie's condition and therefore need to send him to America to ""give him the chance he deserves."" Ms Yates added: ""We have seven doctors supporting us from all around the world. ""There is up to 10% chance that this treatment may work and that's a chance worth taking. ""He's our son, he's our flesh and blood. We feel that it should be our right as parents to decide to give him a chance at life."" She added: ""There is nothing to lose, he deserves a chance."" It comes after GOSH said on Friday it had applied to the High Court for a fresh hearing ""in light of claims of new evidence relating to potential treatment for his condition"". Clinicians from the Bambino Gesu paediatric hospital's neurosciences department said tests in mice and patients with a similar, but not the same, genetic condition as Charlie had shown ""dramatic clinical improvements"". Charlie inherited the faulty RRM2B gene from his parents, affecting the cells responsible for energy production and respiration and leaving him unable to move or breathe without a ventilator. Charlie's case will be heard by Mr Justice Francis on Monday at 14:00 BST, according to a High Court listing.

Iraqi PM in Mosul to celebrate victory,"This video can not be played Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi met Iraqi forces on his arrival in Mosul Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi has visited Mosul to congratulate Iraqi forces for their ""victory"" over Islamic State militants in the city. The city was ""liberated"", with ""just one or two pockets"" still controlled by IS, his office said in a statement. Iraqi forces, backed by US-led air strikes, have been battling to retake Mosul since 17 October last year. Islamic State militants seized it in June 2014 before proclaiming a ""caliphate"" straddling Iraq and Syria. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen have also been involved in the gruelling battle. The Iraqi prime minister arrived to ""congratulate the armed forces and the Iraqi people"" on the final defeat of IS in Mosul on Sunday, the statement said. Iraq's federal police celebrated in the Old City of Mosul on Sunday ""Victory is certain, and what remains of [IS] is surrounded, and it is just a matter of time for us to announce the great victory to our people,"" Mr Abadi said. There were celebrations in the streets during Mr Abadi's visit but he has not yet given a speech formally declaring triumph. His office says victory will be formally declared after Iraqi forces clear out the remaining pockets of jihadists desperately holding out in a tiny area near the Old City. Battle for Mosul: The story so far Where is 'Islamic State' leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? After Mosul: The Iraqi towns still under IS control Airstrikes and exchanges of gunfire could still be heard on Sunday, and plumes of smoke seen rising into the sky. The fall of Mosul does not mean the end of IS in the country. It still hasterritoryelsewhere - such as Tal Afar and three towns in the western province of Anbar - and is able to carry out bombings in government-held areas. Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent This video can not be played The BBC reports from Mosul where rescue teams are searching for survivors Troops helped a steady stream of fleeing civilians - mostly women and children - to safety. Their faces were haunted and some had to be helped. The children didn't even flinch when there was more sound of gunfire. An older woman was so weak she could barely walk. A few babies being carried looked almost lifeless. If this is victory it's come at a huge cost. Not just in human life. Nearly everyone rescued had had to leave dead relatives behind. Almost every building in the old city has been scarred or completely destroyed. Search and rescue teams are still pulling bodies from the rubble. The heat has contributed to the stench of decaying corpses. Read more The government announced the ""liberation"" of eastern Mosul in January, but the west of the city, with its narrow, winding streets, has presented a more difficult challenge. Some 900,000 people have been displaced from the city since 2014 - about half the pre-war population - aid organisations say.

""I've been working in conflict areas now for 25 years, so I've seen most of them: Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, and I have never seen anything as bad as this,"" she said. Save the Children warned of the psychological impact on the children ""haunted by memories of extreme violence, or of loved ones killed in front of them"". ""For children and their families to process these horrors and rebuild their lives, psychological support will be absolutely crucial"", said Ana Locsin, Save the Children's Iraq country director.

Near-blind kitten finds a new home,"Bear needs daily eye drops and eye baths A kitten left almost blind by cat flu has found a new home on the other side of the country after a couple fell in love with him on the internet. Bear arrived at the Blue Cross's Ipswich centre ""in an appalling state"" when he was just three months old. A couple in Somerset spotted him on the charity's website and knew, despite his deformed eyelids and partial sight, that they had to adopt him. Several months later and after a 400-mile trip he is now settled with them. Bear could barely see due to ulcers on his eyes, and his inner eyelids had fused together when he arrived in December. He needed two operations to save his vision, the Blue Cross said. He can still only partially see and has deformed eyelids. Bear can go outdoors but needs to be accompanied because of his poor sight However, his non-conventional looks did not put off Tara Newton and Luke Thomas, from Yeovil. ""We wanted to give a home to a cat with a disability, as a lot of people overlook them,"" Ms Newton said. ""I saw Bear on the website and I just knew we had to have him. He looked like such a lovely little guy and he is."" They made the round trip of about 400 miles (645km) to Suffolk, and more than seven hours later, Bear was settling into his new home. He still needs daily eye drops and morning and night eye bath as his tear ducts are deformed. Bear also needs to be closely monitored as the cat flu that caused his problems - caused by the feline herpes virus - is incurable and will remain in his body for life, the animal charity said. ""He is so loving and affectionate,""  Ms Newton said. ""To go through so much at such a young age and still be so friendly is amazing.""

Trump hails G20 as 'wonderful success',"Mr Trump said the G20 summit in Germany was ""carried out beautifully"" by Mrs Merkel US President Donald Trump has declared the G20 summit in Germany a ""wonderful success"", despite his country's isolated position on climate change. In a joint statement, the leaders of 18 nations and the EU recognised the US decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. However, they also said other G20 members remained committed to the ""irreversible"" accord. Deadlock over the issue had held up the last day of talks in Hamburg. A final agreement was eventually reached and thejoint summit statement,externalwas officially released on Saturday. The statement also said the US would seek ""to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently"". Analysis: G19 plus America Memorable moments from the G20 In pictures: Violence at G20 protests The Paris accord sets targets for greenhouse gas emissions aimed at curbing global temperature increases. In her closing news conference, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted the summit in Hamburg, said she still deplored Mr Trump's position but that she was ""gratified"" the other 19 nations opposed its renegotiation. However Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later said that his country's ratification of the Paris accord was now in doubt, as the US withdrawal jeopardised compensation for developing countries. Mr Erdogan said the US stance on the Paris accord makes Turkey less inclined to ratify the deal Mr Erdogan said that when Turkey signed the accord, France had promised that Turkey would be eligible for compensation for some of the financial costs of compliance. ""So we said if this would happen, the agreement would pass through parliament. But otherwise it won't pass,"" Mr Erdogan told a news conference, adding that parliament had not yet approved it. Mr Trump also won a concession on trade, with leaders underlining the right of countries to protect their markets with what they referred to as legitimate trade defence instruments. He later tweeted: ""The #G20Summit was a wonderful success and carried out beautifully by Chancellor Angela Merkel. Thank you!"" Mr Trump held his final talks of the event with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the two leaders discussed efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions. The US president told his Chinese counterpart that ""something has to be done"" after Pyongyangtested an intercontinental ballistic missileon Tuesday with the potential to hit the US state of Alaska. President Xi said he supported denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and said the China US relationship had made ""progress... despite some sensitive issues"", state news agency Xinhua said. Mr Xi suggested visits between the two countries' defence ministers, Xinhua added.

Lake District bids for Unesco status,"About 18 million people visit the Lake District each year The Lake District has joined the likes of the Grand Canyon, the Taj Mahal and Machu Picchu by being awarded Unesco World Heritage status. The national park was one of 33 sites around the world to bediscussed by the Unesco committee,externalin Krakow, Poland. The committee praised the area's beauty, farming and the inspiration it had provided to artists and writers. It is the 31st place in the UK and overseas territories to be put onthe Unesco World Heritage List,external. The committee suggested the impact of tourism be monitored and requested improvements in conservation efforts. The delegates heard the 885 sq-mile (2,292 sq km) Lake District had been trying to obtain the Unesco status since 1986. Lord Clark of Windermere, chairman of the Lake District National Park Partnership which put together the bid, described the decision as ""momentous"". In pictures: Where are the UK's world heritage sites? Men-only island gets World Heritage nod Windermere is England's largest natural lake ""A great many people have come together to make this happen and we believe the decision will have long and lasting benefits for the spectacular Lake District landscape, the visitors we welcome every year and for the people who call the National Park their home,"" he added. Steve Ratcliffe, director of sustainable development at the Lake District National Park, said the application had been a ""long time in the making"" and he was ""incredibly proud"" of the landscape which has been shaped by nature, farming and industry. He told the committee: ""The Lake District now becomes an international and global property and we look forward to working with you and our communities to make sure this site inspires future generations around the world."" Steve Ratcliffe said it ""has taken millennia to become the evolving masterpiece it is today"" About 18 million people visit the Lake District each year, spending a total of Â£1.2bn and providing about 18,000 jobs. It is home to England's largest natural lake - Windermere - and highest mountain - Scafell Pike. The Lake District has inspired artists and writers Nigel Wilkinson, managing director of Windermere Lake Cruises, said he was hopeful the Unesco status would put the Lakes on an international level. ""What we really hope is it will act as an economic driver and will grow the value, not the volume, of tourism by giving people more... reasons to make day visits and sustained visits."" Harriet Fraser, a writer and patron of Friends of the Lake District, said: ""It's the most beautiful district but it has a very deep culture which is largely hill farming but also conservation.""

'I knew Mel would quit Bake Off with me',"Mel and Sue quit hosting The Great British Bake Off when it was announced the show would be moving to Channel 4 Former Great British Bake Off host Sue Perkins says she knew Mel Giedroyc was also going to leave the show - even though they had never discussed it - because they are ""like twins in a cot"". The pair both decided to quit the programme when the BBC lost the rights to Channel 4 in a bidding warlast year, saying they weren't ""going with the dough"". Perkins said the pair were so close after a 30-year friendship that they frequently did the same thing. ""I didn't need to ring her and say 'what are you going to do?', because I knew what she was going to do - it was merely a question of how we were going to do it,"" she told Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Perkins told Kirsty Young she missed hosting Bake Off and would have carried on fronting it if it had remained on the BBC. Bake Off: BBC loses rights to Channel 4 Why did Bake Off move to Channel 4? New Bake Off line-up: A winning recipe? In explaining her decision to leave, she joked: ""I think we were running out of puns - there's only so many in the tank."" ""Every bap pun, every Hungarian ring pun was mined and mined. ""But there was one point when I did think 'can I do this forever?' - four days before I came to the Bake Off tent I had been with the first family of the Mekong in Tibet, who had no electricity and no running water and they would [only eat] yak butter and barley. ""Four days later I was in a tent where somebody was crying because they couldn't find the packet of marron glace, and I did think how can I rationalise these two worlds?"" Next year marks the 30th anniversary of when Mel and Sue first met at Cambridge University and went on to forge a career as a comedy double-act. ""The first thing I noticed was she had some dusky pink DMs (Doctor Martin shoes) and I looked up and saw a shock of bleached blonde hair, this profusion of teeth like a broken piano and a hearty laugh,"" Perkins said. ""I felt compelled to just move into her orbit and I knew we'd know each other forever. ""We have seen each other through such highs and lows, and above and beyond our working relationship we're friends - we love each other and want the best for each other."" Now their time on Bake Off has come to an end, Perkins hinted they might reunite for another TV project soon.

'Cheaper' Heathrow runway plans proposed,"A wealthy businessman has submitted plans for a third runway at Heathrow which he says would be Â£5bn cheaper than the airport's current scheme. Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has put his proposal to the government's public consultation on Heathrow. Ministers have expressed a preference for the airport's plansfor a new runway and terminal costing Â£17.5bn. Heathrow said it was already considering some of the ideas, and wanted to lower the cost too. Arora Group's proposals include changing the design of terminal buildings and taxiways, and reducing the amount of land it is built on. Third runway cleared for takeoff Why expansion is taking so long Is new runway more important post-Brexit? The green price of Heathrow expansion Death sentence for Heathrow villages Mr Arora said: ""We want passengers to be at the heart of our plans and the current monopoly at Heathrow, which over-charges airlines and in turn raises fares for passengers, is not the right model for the future. ""Heathrow needs competition and innovation which puts passengers and airlines at the heart of the expansion project."" He added: ""One of the options we have proposed to government includes a possible shift of the runway so that it does not impact on the M25 and M4, as we know the M25 junction being affected threatens the deliverability of the whole project. ""We appreciate this is a politically sensitive issue but it is merely an option with additional savings of Â£1.5bn, whereas the rest of our proposals save up to Â£5.2bn without the need to amend the runway location."" Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways' owner IAG, welcomed the proposals. He said: ""The government should look closely at Arora's proposal as it would significantly reduce costs."" British Airways is Heathrow's biggest customer. An airport spokeswoman said: ""Heathrow's expansion proposals are supported by the government and have widespread cross-party political, business and union support. ""We continue to develop our plans to improve passenger experience, reduce the impact on local communities and lower the cost so we deliver expansion at close to current charges. ""Some of the options we are looking at sound similar to those suggested in this submission, and we will welcome views on these in the public consultation later this year."" Construction will not begin for at least three years, and it could be delayed by legal challenges over the runway's environmental impact. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""The government has made clear that it believes a new north-west runway at Heathrow is the best scheme to deliver the economic and connectivity benefits this country needs. ""New capacity will increase competition between airlines resulting in lower fares for passengers. ""A consultation on a draft airports national policy statement closed on 25 May and we are currently analysing the responses, and will set out our next steps in due course."" The Department for Transport has estimated a new runway at Heathrow would bring economic benefits to passengers and the wider economy worth up to Â£61bn, and create as many as 77,000 additional local jobs over the next 14 years.

Brexit blow or May's Trump card?,"Many of the Sunday papers deliver their verdict on Theresa May's whirlwind diplomacy in Hamburg. The Sunday Telegraph says theprime minister played her ""trump card"",externalwhen she called attention to world leaders' enthusiasm for deeper trade ties with the UK. It was a tactical move in the Telegraph's view - aimed at rebuking Cabinet colleagues who stress the risks of leaving the single market and customs union. The Sunday Times saysDonald Trump ""rode to her rescue"",external, giving the PM an opportunity to take a swipe at her mutinous ministers. Thefuture after Brexit is not so bright in the Observer,external. Two of Germany's biggest industry groups tell the paper they will prioritise protecting the single market over forging a new deal with Britain - and warn that negative effects for British business will be hard to avoid in the coming months. Aformer SAS soldier makes a number of startling claims,externalin an interview with the Mail on Sunday about allegations of illegal killings by special forces in Afghanistan. The unnamed trooper says he took part in raids now being investigated by the Royal Military Police and that civilians - some of them children - died when operations went wrong. He admits that unarmed Afghans were ""routinely killed"" - but only when they were confirmed to be high-ranking Taliban, who would have been released within days had they been captured. ""The tactics sound gruesome but these were bad men whose guilt had been established,"" the soldier reasons. ""For me"", he says, ""the ends justify the means.""
