Six held over Venezuela 'drone attack',"This video can not be played Footage showed dozens of soldiers running away before the transmission was cut off Six people have been arrested in Venezuela for involvement in an apparent assassination attempt on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, the interior minister says. NÃ©stor Reverol said they were part of a group that loaded two drones with explosives and set them off during a military parade in the capital Caracas. Mr Maduro has warned the perpetrators face ""maximum punishment"". He has blamed Colombia for the incident but provided no evidence. Colombia said the accusation was ""baseless"". The government has also pointed the finger at the opposition, prompting fears of a new crackdown. Venezuela's leader NicolÃ¡s Maduro divides opinion Venezuela crisis: How did we get here? Many opposition leaders have already left the country citing government harassment and there are reported to be more than 200 political prisoners in the country's jails. Mr Maduro was speaking at a military ceremony when the incident happened Meanwhile Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez declared his unconditional loyalty to the president on national TV. ""We are determined, determined to defend our homeland, our constitution, our democracy, our institutions,"" he said. Correspondents say Mr Maduro has relied heavily on the armed forces to keep power in the midst of an economic crisis and political turmoil. The incident happened when Mr Maduro was speaking at an event to mark the anniversary of the national guard. A bang is heard and footage of his speech shows the president suddenly looking upwards and dozens of soldiers running away. Two drones loaded with explosives went off near the president's stand, Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez said. Seven soldiers were injured, the Venezuelan authorities said. Charred windows were seen near the place where President Maduro was speaking Later Mr Maduro said the incident had strengthened his resolve. ""I am fine, I am alive, and after this attack I'm more determined than ever to follow the path of the revolution,"" he said. ""Justice! Maximum punishment! And there will be no forgiveness."" Interior Minister Reverol said six ""terrorists and hired killers"" had been arrested, several vehicles seized and hotels raided. Mr Maduro accused neighbouring Colombia and elements within the US of instigating ""a right-wing plot"" to kill him. The Colombian government has denied any involvement, saying there is ""no basis"" to Mr Maduro's allegations. US National Security Adviser John Bolton denied any US involvement in the incident, adding that it could be ""a pretext set up by the regime itself"". Mr Rodriguez accused Venezuela's right-wing opposition of carrying out the attack. ""After losing the vote, they failed again,"" Mr Rodriguez said. He was referring to May's presidential elections, where Mr Maduro was re-elected for another six-year term. Maduro wins second term amid claims of vote rigging However, Hasler Iglesias, a youth leader with the opposition Voluntad Popular Party, told the BBC: ""It's hard to believe that the opposition is going to make an attempt when they have never made an attempt in this way in 20 years."" Meanwhile, a little-known group called Soldiers in T-shirts said on social media that it was behind the alleged attack. The claim was not backed up by any evidence, and the group did not respond to media requests for comment. Soldiers sealed off the area after the alleged attack To add further to the confusion, firefighters at the scene disputed the government's version of events, the Associated Press reports. Speaking on condition of anonymity, three of them said the incident was actually a gas tank explosion inside an apartment, but did not provide further details, the news agency says. Mr Maduro has managed to split opinion almost as much as his predecessor in office, Hugo ChÃ¡vez. Since assuming office in 2013, Mr Maduro's administration has drawn widespread condemnation from a string of nations worldwide for undermining democracy and violating human rights in his country. NicolÃ¡s Maduro divides opinion How Venezuela's crisis developed and worsened His opponents paint him as a ruthless despot who detains his political rivals on overly harsh charges pressed by a judiciary under his party's control, while his followers say he is protecting the country from another coup. His re-election in May came amid a deep economic crisis which has been driving hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans from the oil-rich country. However, there is still a loyal core of people who support Mr Maduro and his United Socialist Party (PSUV), saying Venezuela's problems are caused not by the government but by forces such as the US.

Rural crime prompts 'medieval' defences,"Farmers are digging trenches and earth banks to prevent thieves driving 4x4s onto farms The cost of rural crime has risen to Â£44.5m as organised criminal gangs target farm machinery. Farmers are resorting to ""medieval"" fortifications such as earthworks to protect their property, according to NFU Mutual, which produced the figures. Police said that the global demand for agricultural equipment was attracting organised crime to the countryside. Thefts of quad bikes, agricultural vehicles and 4x4s have driven the 13.4% increase in crime over the last year. NFU Mutual, which provides insurance to farmers, said in its annual rural crime report that the cost to farmers is at its highest point since 2013. While rural crime has fallen in Scotland and the north west of England, there have been sharp rises of more than 30% in the Midlands, Wales and the south east of England. Tim Price, NFU Mutual's rural affairs specialist, said this year's spike in crime was driven by a ""new breed"" of determined thieves, using technology and brute force to steal from farms and prompting farmers to bolster their defences. He said: ""This year we're seeing people bring in things like earth banks - the medieval fortifications last used a thousand years ago."" Farmers are combining these ancient deterrents with modern technology, such as CCTV, floodlighting and motion sensors. James Gregory, a farmer in Gloucestershire, is installing more than a mile of earth banks Gloucestershire Police have begun helping local landowners to dig trenches and earth banks to stop thieves from driving 4x4s onto farmland. One farm has an earth wall 3ft tall followed by a 2ft-deep ditch, with barriers extending for more than a mile. Another farmer, James Gregory from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, said he was installing an earth bank in order to deter joyriders and opportunistic thieves. He said: ""It's early days but it's like putting a padlock on a shed: if you were really determined you could still probably break in, but if it just deters a casual person then you're saving a lot of hassle."" Others are creating a single point of entry, reinforced gates, barricaded strong rooms for high-value goods and tall fences to deter thieves. Stolen farm machinery is also being used to commit further crimes, NFU Mutual said, with farm loaders used to smash into village shops and steal from cash machines. And farmers are suffering long-term anxiety from the fear that they are being watched by criminals who are waiting for an opportunity, the report said. David Airey, a farmer in Sutton-in-Craven in North Yorkshire, said crime rates were the worst he had seen in 52 years of farming. He has lost almost Â£20,000 in three quad bikes, trailers, metal, a tonne of sugar beet, drills, chainsaws, milk kits and nearly 100 ewes in repeated thefts. ""It's relentless,"" he said. ""It's scary, you wake up every morning, expecting to go outside and find something disappeared."" Mr Price at NFU Mutual said there had been some successful police initiatives, such as the Scottish Partnership Against Rural Crime. But he called for more collaboration between police forces, to prevent crime being displaced across county borders. The lead officer for rural affairs at the National Police Chiefs' Council, Deputy Chief Constable Craig Naylor, said police have createdthe first UK-wide strategy to tackle rising rural crime,external, with a focus on organised gangs. He said: ""Crime in rural communities can have devastating consequences on residents and businesses alike."" The strategy paper says the rise in crime has been caused by the ""collapse"" of close-knit rural communities and the growth of modern transport links that allow thieves to export stolen machinery in a matter of hours. Det Con Chris Piggott, from the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service, said: ""Organised crime has realised that there's big revenue to be made exporting this stuff across the world."" Police were constantly developing new methods to counter rural crime, he said, but thieves often adapted their approach in response. He added: ""They'll learn how to evade our tactics. What we need to do is to keep developing.""

Snake filmed eating pigeon in street,"This video can not be played The stray snake was discovered on High Road, in Leytonstone, on Saturday morning A tropical snake has been filmed eating a pigeon on a busy east London street. Dave Fawbert spotted the boa constrictor, thought to be an abandoned pet, on High Road, Leytonstone, on Saturday morning. The RSPCA has since taken the reptile to a wildlife centre and is appealing for information about how it may have come to be in the street. A spokeswoman for the charity said it appeared ""someone had found a dead pigeon and then given it to the snake"". Mr Fawbert said the snake was ""100% eating the pigeon, it had its jaw open wrapped around it and the head was half-way in already"". He added that he had hoped to see a snake in the wild while on safari in Tanzania a few years ago. ""I never did, but I guess now I have,"" he said. His Twitter post of the reptile has been shared more than 4,000 times. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Starving US children rescued from compoundPolice searched the site after receiving a message that said: ""We are starving and need food and water.""US & Canada","Police described the location where the children were found as a ""makeshift compound"" near the community of Amalia in the north of New Mexico Police in the US state of New Mexico have rescued 11 malnourished children who were being kept in squalid conditions in a remote desert compound. They said the children, aged one to 15, had no shoes, were wearing rags and ""looked like Third World refugees"". Five adults were found at the scene, including two heavily armed men. Police searched the site after receiving a message from a third party that read: ""We are starving and need food and water."" On Sunday, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe ""swore an affidavit for arrest warrants charging 11 counts of child abuse for all five adults related to the neglect and abuse of the children involved"". Each count of child abuse is a felony. It is not clear how the group ended up at the compound in Amalia, near the state's border with Colorado. Police described the compound as a small underground caravan covered by plastic, with no running water or electricity. Sheriff Hogrefe told ABC News the children were hungry, thirsty and filthy. ""I've been a cop for 30 years. I've never seen anything like this. Unbelievable,"" he said. ""They were skinny, their ribs showed, they were in very poor hygiene and very scared."" From left to right: Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj, Subhannah Wahhaj No fresh water was found at the site, and the only food there was a few potatoes and a box of rice, police said. Two armed men, Siraj Wahhaj and Lucas Morton, were arrested at the scene,external, and charged with several counts of child abuse. Three women, believed to be the children's mothers, were ""arrested without incident"" and booked in the Taos Adult Detention Center,according to the Sheriff's Office,external. Police have not explained what connection the women - named as Jany Leveille, 35, Hujrah Wahhaj, 38, and Subhannah Wahhaj, 35, - have to each other. Police said the children were living in ""Third World"" conditions Mr Hogrefe told ABC it appeared the women and children ""were brainwashed and feel great intimidation from the men that were in control of this facility"". The 11 children have been taken into care by local social services. Mr Wahhaj is also wanted on suspicion of abducting his three-year-old son, but the boy was not among the group found at the compound, US media report. It was the search for the boy that led to the arrests on Friday. According to the sheriff's office, law enforcement officials are still searching for the boy, who turned four on Monday. Police said they had been aware of the compound for some time but had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before entering, as the occupants were ""most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief"". Mr Wahhaj was armed with an AR-15 rifle and four pistols when they encountered him, they said. There were bullet casings covering the ground on site, as well as a makeshift shooting range and 150ft tunnel,KOB 4 News,externalreported. Suspects Siraj Wahhaj (L) and Lucas Morton.

"Scores killed in Indonesia island quakeAt least 82 people are killed in Lombok, just a week after another quake on the same holiday island.","This video can not be played Moment the quake struck caught on camera At least 91 people are now known to have died after a powerful earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Lombok. Hundreds of people have been wounded by Sunday's quake, officials say, mostly in the north of the island. The 6.9 magnitude tremor was fairly shallow, occurring only 30km (18 miles) underground. It damaged thousands of buildings and triggered power cuts. About 1,000 foreign tourists are being evacuated from the nearby Gili islands and at least one person died on Bali. Video footage from Bali, to the west of Lombok, showed people running from their homes screaming. There have been more than 130 aftershocks since the quake hit on Sunday morning. A tsunami warning was issued but was lifted after a few hours. It comes a week afteranother quake hit Lombok, popular with tourists who visit its beaches and hiking trails. That quake killed at least 16 people. Lombok is a roughly 4,500 sq km (1,700 sq miles) island east of the slightly larger island of Bali. In pictures: Damaged homes and evacuations in Lombok The two islands are home to about three and four million people respectively, but each year are visited by millions of tourists from around the globe. A spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency told the AFP news agency that many buildings had been affected in Lombok's main city of Mataram. Most of them had been built with weak construction materials. Are earthquake warnings effective? History of deadly earthquakes Mataram residents described a powerful jolt that sent people fleeing into the streets. ""Everyone immediately ran out of their homes, everyone is panicking,"" one resident named as Iman said. This video can not be played 'Expect strong Lombok quake aftershocks' In several parts of Mataram, there were electricity blackouts. Patients at the city hospital, and also at Denpasar hospital in Bali, were evacuated and tended to by doctors in the streets. Hospital patients were looked after in the streets after the earthquake There was a feeling of panic as the earthquake hit Debris littered the streets of Lombok and Bali, which local people sought to clean up in the hours after the quake. The quake was felt for several seconds in Bali. One worker in Denpasar described the scene to the BBC. ""They were initially just little shocks but then they started to get bigger and bigger and people started to shout 'earthquake', then all the staff panicked and rushed out of the building,"" the unnamed man said. Model and presenter Chrissy Teigen, who is on holiday in Bali, described 15 seconds of a tremor, followed by ""so many aftershocks"". Allow Twitter content?

Airports on both Lombok and Bali are both operating normally despite some minor damage - at Bali's Denpasar airport some ceiling panels were shaken loose by the tremors. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.

"Australia now a land of drought, PM saysPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has announced new measures to help farmers affected by the drought.","The drought has affected 99% of New South Wales Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has warned that the country has become a ""land of drought"" as he announced further measures to help stricken farmers. The new package will provide an extra A$140m ($104m; Â£80m) in payments to farmers and for mental health support. It brings the total amount of government funding to $576m. Although it is still winter, parts of eastern Australia are experiencing the worst drought in living memory. Ninety-nine percent of New South Wales, which is the country's most populous state and provides around a quarter of the country's agricultural output, is currently in drought. Australia's drought seen from the air How Australia's extreme heat might be here to stay Five places that have just broken heat records Announcing the additional funding from a farm in the state, Mr Turnbull said: ""Now we are the land of droughts and flooding rains, we recognise that. ""It's a very volatile and often capricious climate and Australian farmers are resilient, they plan for drought, they are good managers but it can become really overwhelming."" ABC News showed Mr Turnbull comforting a local charity worker, who wept as she described the ""dire"" situation.

House of Fraser store closures to go ahead,"House of Fraser has been under pressure from online retailers House of Fraser has settled a legal row with a group of landlords removing one hurdle to a potential rescue deal. The deal means the department store chain can go ahead with its plan to close 31 of its 59 shops in January. The landlords had argued slashing rentson remaining stores was unfair to them, putting the rescue plan in jeopardy. However, the deal will not be enough to safeguard House of Fraser's future, with it now urgently seeking fresh investment in order to survive. House of Fraser said it was now ""focused on concluding discussions with interested investors"" and the out-of-court settlement with the landlords had removed ""any risk to those discussions"". House of Fraser rescue deal falls through House of Fraser loan offer from Mike Ashley Landlords challenge House of Fraser rescue Potential suitors for the chain include Philip Day, owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mills, and whose retail empire includes Peacocks, Jane Norman, Austin Reed and Jaeger. Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, who already owns an 11% stake in House of Fraser, alsoapproached the chain in July over a potential investment deal. Mr Ashley is understood to have not communicated with House of Fraser's financial advisers' Rothschilds since then, and The Sunday Times has suggested he is unlikely to proceed with a rescue deal due to concerns over the chain's pension funds. However, industry insiders say House of Fraser's two defined-benefit pension funds are fully funded. Other names in the frame as possible saviours include investment funds Alteri, an offshoot of US hedge fund Apollo, and Hilco, both of which specialise in buying up troubled firms and turning their performance around. The chain's future has been thrown into doubt after Hong Kong-listed C.banner, owner of Hamleys,pulled out of plans to take control and invest Â£70min the retailer. Richard Lim, boss of independent research consultancy Retail Economics, says it is still ""hard to know with any certainty just what will happen next at House of Fraser."" This video can not be played Why is House of Fraser failing? ""But it is in desperate need of a rescue package. Without any external funding it is inevitable it will fall into administration. ""Funding will have to be in place within a matter of weeks, rather than any longer period, if House of Fraser is to have a fighting chance to ensure its future."" The retailer employs 17,500 people - 6,000 direct and 11,500 concession staff. House of Fraser is using company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), a form of insolvency proceedings, to overhaul its business. CVAs are being increasingly used by struggling retailers as a way to close stores, but landlords argue that they are being abused as a quick way to cut rents. Mark Fry of Begbies Traynor and Charlotte Coates of JLL, who advised the group of House of Fraser landlords throughout the CVA process and subsequent legal challenge, said they were pleased with the settlement. ""The retail CVA process in the UK has become increasingly misused and prejudiced against landlords and needs correcting. ""CVAs were designed as a means to rescue a business, not simply a tool to shed undesirable leases for the benefit of equity shareholders,"" they added in a statement. House of Fraser is one of a number of retailers struggling amid falling consumer confidence, rising overheads, the weaker pound and the growth of online shopping. Electronics chain Maplin and toy chain Toys R Us both collapsed into administration earlier this year. Other High Street chains such as Mothercare and Carpetright have been forced to close stores in order to survive.

Top NHS GP quits over anonymous posts,"England's most senior GP has resigned after admitting he posted anonymous comments on an online medical forum. Dr Arvind Madan, director of primary care at NHS England, is thought to have posted with the name ""Devil'sAdvocate"". It comes after a group of more than 8,000 GPs called for Dr Madan's resignation, after comments he made about the closure of smaller practices. In a statement, he said he had wanted to ""provoke a more balanced discussion about contentious issues"". The magazine Pulse reported on Wednesday,externalthat Dr Madan stood by comments he made online suggesting GPs should be ""pleased"" with the closure of some small GP surgeries. In the comment he said: ""There are too many small practices struggling to do everything patients now want for their families in a modern era of general practice"". In the same magazine,the group GP Survival - which represents 8,000 GPs - had written an open letter,externalcalling for Dr Madan to resign as director of primary care. The east London GP said it was clear he had ""lost the confidence"" of some of his colleagues over the comments. Another post by Devil'sAdvocate said of GPs' pay: ""We can get 6 figure salaries for working 4 days a week 45 weeks a year without on call... run that past the general public and see how much sympathy you get."" Announcing his resignation from NHS England,external, Dr Madan, who has been a GP for 23 years, said: ""As part of my attempts to challenge the negative views - and even conspiracy theories - held by a small but vocal minority in the profession, I posted on an anonymous online forum used by GPs. ""It was never my intention to cause offence but rather to provoke a more balanced discussion about contentious issues acting as a devil's advocate. ""I wish to make it categorically clear that these comments are not a reflection of NHS England policy, and it is now clear to me that trying to move the debate on in this way is not compatible with my role as director of primary care."" He apologised to those who were upset - ""particularly in smaller practices"" - and added that ""supporting general practice is too important an issue to allow it to be mired in unnecessary controversy"". Dr Madan said that small practices were struggling, which meant integrating them with others would prevent closures. The British Medical Association (BMA) said Dr Madan had ""done the right thing"" in offering his resignation. Its GP committee deputy chairman Dr Mark Sanford-Wood said: ""We have today written to NHS England raising our concerns and demanding action after Dr Madan's damaging comments caused significant anger amongst the profession at a time when GPs require support from NHS England.""

"Australia now a land of drought, PM says","The drought has affected 99% of New South Wales Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has warned that the country has become a ""land of drought"" as he announced further measures to help stricken farmers. The new package will provide an extra A$140m ($104m; Â£80m) in payments to farmers and for mental health support. It brings the total amount of government funding to $576m. Although it is still winter, parts of eastern Australia are experiencing the worst drought in living memory. Ninety-nine percent of New South Wales, which is the country's most populous state and provides around a quarter of the country's agricultural output, is currently in drought. Australia's drought seen from the air How Australia's extreme heat might be here to stay Five places that have just broken heat records Announcing the additional funding from a farm in the state, Mr Turnbull said: ""Now we are the land of droughts and flooding rains, we recognise that. ""It's a very volatile and often capricious climate and Australian farmers are resilient, they plan for drought, they are good managers but it can become really overwhelming."" ABC News showed Mr Turnbull comforting a local charity worker, who wept as she described the ""dire"" situation. ""I worry every day I go to visit farming families that I'm going to get to someone and it's going to be hours too late, it's literally that bad,"" she said.

Maduro vengeful over 'drone attack'The Venezuelan president's reaction to an apparent assassination bid prompts fears of a new crackdown.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Footage showed dozens of soldiers running away before the transmission was cut off Six people have been arrested in Venezuela for involvement in an apparent assassination attempt on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, the interior minister says. NÃ©stor Reverol said they were part of a group that loaded two drones with explosives and set them off during a military parade in the capital Caracas. Mr Maduro has warned the perpetrators face ""maximum punishment"". He has blamed Colombia for the incident but provided no evidence. Colombia said the accusation was ""baseless"". The government has also pointed the finger at the opposition, prompting fears of a new crackdown. Venezuela's leader NicolÃ¡s Maduro divides opinion Venezuela crisis: How did we get here? Many opposition leaders have already left the country citing government harassment and there are reported to be more than 200 political prisoners in the country's jails. Mr Maduro was speaking at a military ceremony when the incident happened Meanwhile Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez declared his unconditional loyalty to the president on national TV. ""We are determined, determined to defend our homeland, our constitution, our democracy, our institutions,"" he said. Correspondents say Mr Maduro has relied heavily on the armed forces to keep power in the midst of an economic crisis and political turmoil. The incident happened when Mr Maduro was speaking at an event to mark the anniversary of the national guard. A bang is heard and footage of his speech shows the president suddenly looking upwards and dozens of soldiers running away. Two drones loaded with explosives went off near the president's stand, Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez said. Seven soldiers were injured, the Venezuelan authorities said. Charred windows were seen near the place where President Maduro was speaking Later Mr Maduro said the incident had strengthened his resolve. ""I am fine, I am alive, and after this attack I'm more determined than ever to follow the path of the revolution,"" he said. ""Justice! Maximum punishment! And there will be no forgiveness."" Interior Minister Reverol said six ""terrorists and hired killers"" had been arrested, several vehicles seized and hotels raided. Mr Maduro accused neighbouring Colombia and elements within the US of instigating ""a right-wing plot"" to kill him. The Colombian government has denied any involvement, saying there is ""no basis"" to Mr Maduro's allegations. US National Security Adviser John Bolton denied any US involvement in the incident, adding that it could be ""a pretext set up by the regime itself"". Mr Rodriguez accused Venezuela's right-wing opposition of carrying out the attack. ""After losing the vote, they failed again,"" Mr Rodriguez said. He was referring to May's presidential elections, where Mr Maduro was re-elected for another six-year term. Maduro wins second term amid claims of vote rigging However, Hasler Iglesias, a youth leader with the opposition Voluntad Popular Party, told the BBC: ""It's hard to believe that the opposition is going to make an attempt when they have never made an attempt in this way in 20 years."" Meanwhile, a little-known group called Soldiers in T-shirts said on social media that it was behind the alleged attack. The claim was not backed up by any evidence, and the group did not respond to media requests for comment. Soldiers sealed off the area after the alleged attack To add further to the confusion, firefighters at the scene disputed the government's version of events, the Associated Press reports. Speaking on condition of anonymity, three of them said the incident was actually a gas tank explosion inside an apartment, but did not provide further details, the news agency says. Mr Maduro has managed to split opinion almost as much as his predecessor in office, Hugo ChÃ¡vez. Since assuming office in 2013, Mr Maduro's administration has drawn widespread condemnation from a string of nations worldwide for undermining democracy and violating human rights in his country. NicolÃ¡s Maduro divides opinion How Venezuela's crisis developed and worsened His opponents paint him as a ruthless despot who detains his political rivals on overly harsh charges pressed by a judiciary under his party's control, while his followers say he is protecting the country from another coup. His re-election in May came amid a deep economic crisis which has been driving hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans from the oil-rich country. However, there is still a loyal core of people who support Mr Maduro and his United Socialist Party (PSUV), saying Venezuela's problems are caused not by the government but by forces such as the US.

Twenty people dead in WW2 plane crash,"The plane came down high above sea level in the Swiss Alps Twenty people have died after a World War Two vintage aircraft crashed into a mountainside in eastern Switzerland, police say. The plane - a Junkers JU-52 HB-HOT - was carrying 17 passengers and three crew on a sightseeing flight when it took off on Saturday afternoon. Operator JU-Air said it was saddened by the news and it had set upa helpline for relatives,external. It has suspended all flights until further notice. The cause of the crash is not known. The passengers were returning to Zurich from a two-day excursion in Locarno near Switzerland's southern border. Although there were eyewitnesses to the crash, the BBC's Imogen Foulkes says that the investigation into what happened will take time. The plane had no black box, and the remote alpine location of the crash means there was little radar monitoring. How likely are you to survive a plane crash? 2017 - the safest year for air travel Why you should listen to on-board safety ""Based on the situation at the crash site we can say that the aircraft smashed into ground almost vertically at relatively high speed,"" said Daniel Knecht of the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board. ""What we can rule out at this point is that there had been a collision before the crash, neither with another aircraft nor with some other obstacle such as a cable."" A witness who was on the mountainside at the time of the crash told the 20 Minutes newspaper that""the plane turned 180 degrees to the south and fell to the ground like a stone"",external. Of the 20 people on the flight, 11 were men and nine were women, police spokeswoman Anita Senti said at a news conference. Police say the passengers were aged between 42 and 84 years old and that the relatives of all but one of the victims had been contacted. The bodies of the victims, 17 from Switzerland and three from Austria - believed to be an Austrian couple and their son - are still being recovered. The aircraft crashed about 2,540m (8,333 ft) above sea level, on the western side of a 3,000m peak called Piz Segnas. The plane involved was made in Germany in the 1930s JU-Air runs sightseeing tours on its squadron of German-made vintage aircraft from DÃ¼bendorf military airfield near Zurich. The company's CEO Kurt Waldmeier told the AFP news agency the plane had undergone a maintenance inspection in July.

"Fox: No-deal most likely Brexit outcomeNo 10 insists it can get a good deal for the UK, after Liam Fox says chances of a no-deal are 60%.UK Politics","Liam Fox says the chance of a no-deal Brexit is growing, blaming the ""intransigence"" of the European Commission. The international trade secretary and Brexiteer put the chance of failing to come to an agreement at ""60-40"". He told the Sunday Times,externalthat Brussels' chief negotiator had dismissed the UK's Chequers proposals simply because ""we have never done it before"". No 10 insists the government remains confident it can get a good deal. Mr Fox told the paper that he had not thought the likelihood of no-deal was higher than 50-50, but the risk had increased. He said the EU had to decide whether to act in the economic best interests of its people, or to go on pursuing an approach determined by an obsession with the purity of its rules. ""I think the intransigence of the commission is pushing us towards no deal,"" he said. At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan from Chequers Reality Check: What would 'no deal' look like? The UK's four Brexit options The government has been touting its plans for Brexit agreed at Chequers - the prime minister's country residence in Buckinghamshire - to the EU and its leaders, including the French President Emmanuel Macron, whomTheresa May met on Friday. But Mr Fox claimed Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, had already dismissed the proposals, which ""makes the chance of no deal greater"". He said: ""We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it's a bureaucrats' Brexit - not a people's Brexit - then there is only going to be one outcome."" Mr Fox said if the EU did not like the proposal, they should ""show us one that they can suggest that would be acceptable to us"". He added: ""It's up to the EU27 to determine whether they want the EU Commission's ideological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies."" Theresa May met with Emmanuel Macron on Friday, but Downing Street would not reveal any outcomes On Friday, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney,warned that the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was ""uncomfortably high"". Mr Carney said that if a no-deal Brexit were to happen, it would mean disruption to trade and economic activity, as well as higher prices for a period of time. But he said that the UK financial system was robust and could withstand any post-Brexit shocks. The comments led to a decline in the pound on the currency markets and saw him labelled as ""the high priest of Project Fear"" by Leave-backing MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. Meanwhile, another prominent Brexiteer, former minister Priti Patel, has called on Mrs May to have the ""backbone and confidence"" to back Britain in the negotiations with the EU. Writing for the Telegraph's website,external, she said the UK was in a ""strong position"" when it came to a future trade deal because ""we are dynamic, competitive and growing"" - while the EU ""desperately needs our money"". Priti Patel says the UK is in a ""strong position"" for negotiations But unlike Mr Fox, Ms Patel does not back the Chequers deal, which has already led to a number ofresignations from the government- including David Davis as Brexit secretary and Boris Johnson as foreign secretary. She wrote: ""It will leave us half in and half out, still bound to EU regulations and constraints. ""[It will be] the worst of both worlds - effectively out of Europe but still run by Europe.""

Deadly quake strikes Indonesia island,"This video can not be played Moment the quake struck caught on camera At least 91 people are now known to have died after a powerful earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Lombok. Hundreds of people have been wounded by Sunday's quake, officials say, mostly in the north of the island. The 6.9 magnitude tremor was fairly shallow, occurring only 30km (18 miles) underground. It damaged thousands of buildings and triggered power cuts. About 1,000 foreign tourists are being evacuated from the nearby Gili islands and at least one person died on Bali. Video footage from Bali, to the west of Lombok, showed people running from their homes screaming. There have been more than 130 aftershocks since the quake hit on Sunday morning. A tsunami warning was issued but was lifted after a few hours. It comes a week afteranother quake hit Lombok, popular with tourists who visit its beaches and hiking trails. That quake killed at least 16 people. Lombok is a roughly 4,500 sq km (1,700 sq miles) island east of the slightly larger island of Bali. In pictures: Damaged homes and evacuations in Lombok The two islands are home to about three and four million people respectively, but each year are visited by millions of tourists from around the globe. A spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency told the AFP news agency that many buildings had been affected in Lombok's main city of Mataram. Most of them had been built with weak construction materials. Are earthquake warnings effective? History of deadly earthquakes Mataram residents described a powerful jolt that sent people fleeing into the streets. ""Everyone immediately ran out of their homes, everyone is panicking,"" one resident named as Iman said. This video can not be played 'Expect strong Lombok quake aftershocks' In several parts of Mataram, there were electricity blackouts. Patients at the city hospital, and also at Denpasar hospital in Bali, were evacuated and tended to by doctors in the streets.

Ms Eastwood, 28, has not been seen since leaving work at Royal Stoke University Hospital on 27 July. Detectives are continuing to question a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after the body was discovered on rural land near Caverswall, about 10 miles from Stoke-on-Trent. The family of the midwife have thanked the public for their support. In a statement released by Staffordshire Police, they said: ""We would like to say 'thank-you' to all the people who followed Samantha's story and tried their best to help."" Officers confirmed the body, discovered during a cordoned-off search, was believed to be that of Ms Eastwood, pending formal identification. The 32-year-old man who was arrested a week ago on suspicion of kidnap was rearrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday. Two other men, aged 28 and 60, are being held on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Farmer Nigel Potts, 53, said he had seen police activity close to a nearby disused quarry. ""It seems that that's where the main focus of the search is,"" he said.

Aguero wins Community Shield for Man City,"This video can not be played Community Shield: Chelsea 0-2 Manchester City highlights Sergio Aguero scored both Manchester City goals as the Premier League champions beat Chelsea to win the Community Shield on a sweltering day at Wembley. Aguero's first - his 200th goal for the club - came after 13 minutes, when he collected the ball on the edge of the area after Phil Foden surged forward, and fired into the bottom corner. His second came after the break, when he latched on to Bernardo Silva's pass and beat Willy Caballero with another precise low finish. Chelsea, less than a month into Maurizio Sarri's reign as manager, lacked a presence in attack and managed only one shot on target, a long-range strike by 17-year-old Callum Hudson-Odoi which Claudio Bravo fumbled to safety. Some of their lethargy going forward could be put down to the heat, which made it difficult for both sides to sustain any sort of tempo. Players were allowed water breaks during the game and some City players sitting on the bench had wet towels over their heads to try to protect them from the intensity of the sunshine. Sarri was without his best forward player, with Eden Hazard due back for post-World Cup pre-season training on Monday amid speculation Real Madrid want to sign him. City, who won last year's title by 19 points, were also without some of their stars - with Kevin de Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and David Silva all absent. But they produced a controlled and efficient performance to secure their third piece of silverware in the past six months. The worry for the rest of the Premier League is they have the appetite for more. This video can not be played Sergio Aguero scores his 200th Manchester City goal to put them 1-0 up against Chelsea Chelsea 0-2 Manchester City - how you rated the players Relive the action as it happened City boss Pep Guardiola was able to hand a start to new Â£60m forward Riyad Mahrez but, in the absence of De Bruyne and David Silva, it was Foden and Bernardo Silva who caught the eye. Operating on either side of Fernandinho, as steady as ever at the base of City's midfield, they looked to spring forward at every opportunity. Foden did exactly that to set up Aguero's opener, latching on to a pass from Aymeric Laporte and taking full advantage as the Chelsea defence backed off. It was a similar story when Silva provided the assist from which Aguero extended City's lead in another lightning break in which the ball travelled from the edge of City's box into the Chelsea net in a matter of seconds. Both players were utilised further forward last season, but showed they could have a part to play in a deeper role in the coming campaign. Aguero - given the nod over Gabriel Jesus, who started on the bench - was as deadly as ever up front and had City converted one of a flurry of late chances, the scoreline would have been even more resounding. This video can not be played Sergio Aguero scores his second goal to put Manchester City 2-0 up against Chelsea It is 78 days since Chelsea lifted the FA Cup here in Antonio Conte's last act as manager. Sarri has since arrived from Napoli as the Blues' eighth permanent boss in the past 10 years. Sarri's prime concern is probably keeping his stars - as well as doubts over Hazard's future, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is also wanted by Real, and Willian has been linked with Barcelona. ""The performance was not bad in the first half but in the second half there was a big difference from a physical point of view, so we have to work,"" said Sarri following the defeat. ""I am worried about the defensive phase - not the defenders. We have to improve, especially on the other half. I spoke with Willian, Courtois and Hazard only by phone. Tomorrow morning or afternoon I will speak to them again but, in this moment, I am confident."" But this display was evidence of where he needs to strengthen his team too, with a new striker surely top of his list. Alvaro Morata was again underwhelming in front of goal and failed to offer his side any sort of focal point going forward. The Spanish striker only managed one touch in the City box in the 70 minutes he was on the pitch, a moment which also provided him with his only shot at goal - a wild first-half effort which flew well wide. Hudson-Odoi provided Chelsea's best moments in attack, with his pace giving the City defence something to worry about. Ross Barkley also impressed early on with some neat touches, when he was seeing plenty of the ball in a deeper role, but his influence faded after the break. In the longer term, Chelsea will surely improve as they adjust to Sarri's trademark 4-3-3 formation, but on this occasion they went backwards the longer the game went on. It was a reminder of how much work Sarri has to do - but the good news is he will not have to play City every week. This video can not be played Community Shield: Maurizio Sarri says Chelsea players will 'have to work' He looked slightly sheepish when he appeared on the big screen before the end of the game, when it was announced he was man of the match, but he deserved it. As well as scoring both goals he was a livewire up front, with seven shots in total, four of them on target, and he set up his team-mates for chances too City have won the Community Shield for the first time since 2012, when they beat Chelsea 3-2 at Villa Park. Chelsea have now failed to win the Community Shield in any of their past five appearances (2010, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2018). It's the joint-longest run of appearances without winning or sharing the trophy in the competition's history, along with Newcastle (1932, 1951, 1952, 1955 and 1996). This is the first time the Premier League champions have won the Community Shield since Manchester United beat Wigan 2-0 in 2013. The last Community Shield winners to go on to win the title that season were Manchester United in 2010-11. Aguero's opener was his 200th goal for City in all competitions - the first player to reach that milestone for the club. He has now scored five goals at Wembley for City - more than any other player. Ten of Aguero's 201 goals in all competitions for City have come against Chelsea - only against Newcastle (14) has he scored more. Foden provided his second assist in all competitions for City - both have been for Aguero goals. Sarri's first competitive game in charge of Chelsea is at Huddersfield on Saturday (15:00 BST). Before then, they play a friendly against French side Lyon at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday (20:05 BST). City begin the defence of their Premier League crown with a trip to Arsenal next Sunday (16:00 BST).

Corbyn apology for anti-Semitism hurt,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has again apologised for hurt caused to Jewish people by anti-Semitism in his party. In a video message, he also admitted Labour had been too slow in dealing with disciplinary cases. It comes as his deputy Tom Watson warned the party could ""disappear into a vortex of eternal shame"" and be unfit to lead if it did not tackle the issue. He gave a stark warning inThe Observer,external, saying Labour had to take a ""long, hard look at ourselves"". Labour has been dealing with a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than two years. Anti-Semites don't speak for me - Corbyn A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? Recently, the focus has been on a new code of conduct the party has adopted on anti-Semitism, with critics concerned that it does not go as far as theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines,external. Mr Watson called for Mr Corbyn to adopt the full definition of anti-Semitism in his interview on Sunday, and also said internal inquiries intoJewish Labour MPs Margaret Hodge and Ian Austinshould be dropped. The Labour MPs, who both lost family members in the Holocaust, are facing disciplinary proceedings for confrontations over the party's response to anti-Semitism claims. His pleas were not addressed in Mr Corbyn's message, which was posted on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Watson said Labour needs to ""stand up for what is right and present the party as fit to lead the nation"". He has faced a backlash on social media over his comments, with thousands of Labour supporters calling on him to resign and some targeting personal abuse at him for allegedly stabbing Jeremy Corbyn in the back. Labour's deputy leaderresponded to the criticism,externalby saying he ""never, ever"" thought he would face demands to quit ""for standing up for people who are facing prejudice and hate"". This video can not be played The Labour Party ""has become so intolerant"", says Emily Benn He was backed by some Labour MPs and former Foreign Secretary David Miliband who said the anti-Semitism row had ""revealed myopia and sectarianism"" at the top of the party. Labour MP Wes Streeting, a prominent critic of Mr Corbyn, said the situation was a ""cesspit"", writing: ""Imagine demanding the resignation of our deputy leader because he's called for meaningful action against racism."" Former minister Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the home affairs committee,told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:""I support Tom on this. I think the point is we need to address it."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: ""Tom Watson in his article stated that we need to get this right - and I agree with him, and Jeremy agrees with him on that point. ""It's important for us all in the Labour Party to take full responsibility for this issue and make sure we deal with it as quickly as possible."" In his video, Mr Corbyn said anyone who denies that anti-Semitism is ""surfacing"" in the party is ""clearly actually wrong and contributing to the problem"". ""I'm sorry for the hurt that's been caused to many Jewish people,"" he said. ""We have been too slow in processing disciplinary cases of, mostly online, anti-Semitic abuse by party members. We're acting to speed this process up."" Tom Watson says Labour should adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn also stressed that people who hold anti-Semitic views ""have no place in the Labour Party"" and said people who use ""anti-Semitic poison"" are not his supporters, nor do they speak for him or the party. He has repeatedly condemned anti-Semitism and haspreviously saidhe is ""sincerely sorry"".

Aguero wins Community Shield for Man CitySergio Aguero scores both goals as Manchester City beat Chelsea 2-0 at Wembley to win the Community Shield.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Community Shield: Chelsea 0-2 Manchester City highlights Sergio Aguero scored both Manchester City goals as the Premier League champions beat Chelsea to win the Community Shield on a sweltering day at Wembley. Aguero's first - his 200th goal for the club - came after 13 minutes, when he collected the ball on the edge of the area after Phil Foden surged forward, and fired into the bottom corner. His second came after the break, when he latched on to Bernardo Silva's pass and beat Willy Caballero with another precise low finish. Chelsea, less than a month into Maurizio Sarri's reign as manager, lacked a presence in attack and managed only one shot on target, a long-range strike by 17-year-old Callum Hudson-Odoi which Claudio Bravo fumbled to safety. Some of their lethargy going forward could be put down to the heat, which made it difficult for both sides to sustain any sort of tempo. Players were allowed water breaks during the game and some City players sitting on the bench had wet towels over their heads to try to protect them from the intensity of the sunshine. Sarri was without his best forward player, with Eden Hazard due back for post-World Cup pre-season training on Monday amid speculation Real Madrid want to sign him. City, who won last year's title by 19 points, were also without some of their stars - with Kevin de Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and David Silva all absent. But they produced a controlled and efficient performance to secure their third piece of silverware in the past six months. The worry for the rest of the Premier League is they have the appetite for more. This video can not be played Sergio Aguero scores his 200th Manchester City goal to put them 1-0 up against Chelsea Chelsea 0-2 Manchester City - how you rated the players Relive the action as it happened City boss Pep Guardiola was able to hand a start to new Â£60m forward Riyad Mahrez but, in the absence of De Bruyne and David Silva, it was Foden and Bernardo Silva who caught the eye. Operating on either side of Fernandinho, as steady as ever at the base of City's midfield, they looked to spring forward at every opportunity. Foden did exactly that to set up Aguero's opener, latching on to a pass from Aymeric Laporte and taking full advantage as the Chelsea defence backed off. It was a similar story when Silva provided the assist from which Aguero extended City's lead in another lightning break in which the ball travelled from the edge of City's box into the Chelsea net in a matter of seconds. Both players were utilised further forward last season, but showed they could have a part to play in a deeper role in the coming campaign. Aguero - given the nod over Gabriel Jesus, who started on the bench - was as deadly as ever up front and had City converted one of a flurry of late chances, the scoreline would have been even more resounding. This video can not be played Sergio Aguero scores his second goal to put Manchester City 2-0 up against Chelsea It is 78 days since Chelsea lifted the FA Cup here in Antonio Conte's last act as manager. Sarri has since arrived from Napoli as the Blues' eighth permanent boss in the past 10 years. Sarri's prime concern is probably keeping his stars - as well as doubts over Hazard's future, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is also wanted by Real, and Willian has been linked with Barcelona. ""The performance was not bad in the first half but in the second half there was a big difference from a physical point of view, so we have to work,"" said Sarri following the defeat. ""I am worried about the defensive phase - not the defenders. We have to improve, especially on the other half. I spoke with Willian, Courtois and Hazard only by phone. Tomorrow morning or afternoon I will speak to them again but, in this moment, I am confident."" But this display was evidence of where he needs to strengthen his team too, with a new striker surely top of his list. Alvaro Morata was again underwhelming in front of goal and failed to offer his side any sort of focal point going forward. The Spanish striker only managed one touch in the City box in the 70 minutes he was on the pitch, a moment which also provided him with his only shot at goal - a wild first-half effort which flew well wide. Hudson-Odoi provided Chelsea's best moments in attack, with his pace giving the City defence something to worry about. Ross Barkley also impressed early on with some neat touches, when he was seeing plenty of the ball in a deeper role, but his influence faded after the break. In the longer term, Chelsea will surely improve as they adjust to Sarri's trademark 4-3-3 formation, but on this occasion they went backwards the longer the game went on. It was a reminder of how much work Sarri has to do - but the good news is he will not have to play City every week. This video can not be played Community Shield: Maurizio Sarri says Chelsea players will 'have to work' He looked slightly sheepish when he appeared on the big screen before the end of the game, when it was announced he was man of the match, but he deserved it. As well as scoring both goals he was a livewire up front, with seven shots in total, four of them on target, and he set up his team-mates for chances too City have won the Community Shield for the first time since 2012, when they beat Chelsea 3-2 at Villa Park. Chelsea have now failed to win the Community Shield in any of their past five appearances (2010, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2018). It's the joint-longest run of appearances without winning or sharing the trophy in the competition's history, along with Newcastle (1932, 1951, 1952, 1955 and 1996). This is the first time the Premier League champions have won the Community Shield since Manchester United beat Wigan 2-0 in 2013. The last Community Shield winners to go on to win the title that season were Manchester United in 2010-11. Aguero's opener was his 200th goal for City in all competitions - the first player to reach that milestone for the club. He has now scored five goals at Wembley for City - more than any other player. Ten of Aguero's 201 goals in all competitions for City have come against Chelsea - only against Newcastle (14) has he scored more. Foden provided his second assist in all competitions for City - both have been for Aguero goals. Sarri's first competitive game in charge of Chelsea is at Huddersfield on Saturday (15:00 BST). Before then, they play a friendly against French side Lyon at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday (20:05 BST). City begin the defence of their Premier League crown with a trip to Arsenal next Sunday (16:00 BST).

Fox: No-deal most likely Brexit outcome,"Liam Fox says the chance of a no-deal Brexit is growing, blaming the ""intransigence"" of the European Commission. The international trade secretary and Brexiteer put the chance of failing to come to an agreement at ""60-40"". He told the Sunday Times,externalthat Brussels' chief negotiator had dismissed the UK's Chequers proposals simply because ""we have never done it before"". No 10 insists the government remains confident it can get a good deal. Mr Fox told the paper that he had not thought the likelihood of no-deal was higher than 50-50, but the risk had increased. He said the EU had to decide whether to act in the economic best interests of its people, or to go on pursuing an approach determined by an obsession with the purity of its rules. ""I think the intransigence of the commission is pushing us towards no deal,"" he said. At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan from Chequers Reality Check: What would 'no deal' look like? The UK's four Brexit options The government has been touting its plans for Brexit agreed at Chequers - the prime minister's country residence in Buckinghamshire - to the EU and its leaders, including the French President Emmanuel Macron, whomTheresa May met on Friday. But Mr Fox claimed Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, had already dismissed the proposals, which ""makes the chance of no deal greater"". He said: ""We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it's a bureaucrats' Brexit - not a people's Brexit - then there is only going to be one outcome."" Mr Fox said if the EU did not like the proposal, they should ""show us one that they can suggest that would be acceptable to us"". He added: ""It's up to the EU27 to determine whether they want the EU Commission's ideological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies."" Theresa May met with Emmanuel Macron on Friday, but Downing Street would not reveal any outcomes On Friday, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney,warned that the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was ""uncomfortably high"". Mr Carney said that if a no-deal Brexit were to happen, it would mean disruption to trade and economic activity, as well as higher prices for a period of time. But he said that the UK financial system was robust and could withstand any post-Brexit shocks. The comments led to a decline in the pound on the currency markets and saw him labelled as ""the high priest of Project Fear"" by Leave-backing MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. Meanwhile, another prominent Brexiteer, former minister Priti Patel, has called on Mrs May to have the ""backbone and confidence"" to back Britain in the negotiations with the EU. Writing for the Telegraph's website,external, she said the UK was in a ""strong position"" when it came to a future trade deal because ""we are dynamic, competitive and growing"" - while the EU ""desperately needs our money"". Priti Patel says the UK is in a ""strong position"" for negotiations But unlike Mr Fox, Ms Patel does not back the Chequers deal, which has already led to a number ofresignations from the government- including David Davis as Brexit secretary and Boris Johnson as foreign secretary. She wrote: ""It will leave us half in and half out, still bound to EU regulations and constraints. ""[It will be] the worst of both worlds - effectively out of Europe but still run by Europe.""

Thousands without water after pipe burst,"Severn Trent said it was working to replace the broken section of the pipe Several thousand homes are without water in Nottinghamshire after a major pipe burst. Large parts of the eastern side of the county are affected by the problem, which occurred in the village of Epperstone. Severn Trent Water said it was one of its biggest mains, meaning people may have no supply or low pressure. It is working to deliver bottled water to vulnerable people in the affected areas, it added. Severn Trent Water said it received about 20 calls by 01:00 BST on Sunday, with workmen on the site by 01:30. Engineers have now removed the broken part of the pipe and are working to connect a new section. The 24in pipe is one of the biggest in the area In a statement, Severn Trent Water added: ""As water starts to come back on it's possible this could be at low pressure to begin with but this will build as we get more water into our pipes. ""This section of the network covers a wide area of Nottinghamshire so it will take a bit of time for water to get round the pipes and back to customer's homes."" The company said that many of the affected households had seen their normal supplies return, and a collection point has been set up at Bingham Leisure Centre to help those still without water. The collection point will be open until 22:00 on Sunday. Bottles of water were provided for residents Peter Edney, from Severn Trent Water, said engineers have been working ""since the early hours of the morning"" to move water around the network. ""We're doing everything we can to get all supplies restored as soon as we can and once again we'd like to say sorry for the inconvenience that's been caused,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

In his article, he said he recognised the ""strong concerns"" about Labour's code of conduct and that many Jewish organisations believed it should include all examples.

Huge earthquake hits Indonesian island,"This video can not be played Moment the quake struck caught on camera At least 91 people are now known to have died after a powerful earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Lombok. Hundreds of people have been wounded by Sunday's quake, officials say, mostly in the north of the island. The 6.9 magnitude tremor was fairly shallow, occurring only 30km (18 miles) underground. It damaged thousands of buildings and triggered power cuts. About 1,000 foreign tourists are being evacuated from the nearby Gili islands and at least one person died on Bali. Video footage from Bali, to the west of Lombok, showed people running from their homes screaming. There have been more than 130 aftershocks since the quake hit on Sunday morning. A tsunami warning was issued but was lifted after a few hours. It comes a week afteranother quake hit Lombok, popular with tourists who visit its beaches and hiking trails. That quake killed at least 16 people. Lombok is a roughly 4,500 sq km (1,700 sq miles) island east of the slightly larger island of Bali. In pictures: Damaged homes and evacuations in Lombok The two islands are home to about three and four million people respectively, but each year are visited by millions of tourists from around the globe. A spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency told the AFP news agency that many buildings had been affected in Lombok's main city of Mataram. Most of them had been built with weak construction materials. Are earthquake warnings effective? History of deadly earthquakes Mataram residents described a powerful jolt that sent people fleeing into the streets. ""Everyone immediately ran out of their homes, everyone is panicking,"" one resident named as Iman said. This video can not be played 'Expect strong Lombok quake aftershocks' In several parts of Mataram, there were electricity blackouts. Patients at the city hospital, and also at Denpasar hospital in Bali, were evacuated and tended to by doctors in the streets. Hospital patients were looked after in the streets after the earthquake There was a feeling of panic as the earthquake hit Debris littered the streets of Lombok and Bali, which local people sought to clean up in the hours after the quake. The quake was felt for several seconds in Bali. One worker in Denpasar described the scene to the BBC. ""They were initially just little shocks but then they started to get bigger and bigger and people started to shout 'earthquake', then all the staff panicked and rushed out of the building,"" the unnamed man said. Model and presenter Chrissy Teigen, who is on holiday in Bali, described 15 seconds of a tremor, followed by ""so many aftershocks"". Allow Twitter content?

He said there were a limited number of boats available so the evacuation was taking place gradually, but that more boats were on their way. Airports on both Lombok and Bali are both operating normally despite some minor damage - at Bali's Denpasar airport some ceiling panels were shaken loose by the tremors. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.

"Australia now a land of drought, PM saysPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has announced new measures to help farmers affected by the drought.Australia","The drought has affected 99% of New South Wales Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has warned that the country has become a ""land of drought"" as he announced further measures to help stricken farmers. The new package will provide an extra A$140m ($104m; Â£80m) in payments to farmers and for mental health support. It brings the total amount of government funding to $576m. Although it is still winter, parts of eastern Australia are experiencing the worst drought in living memory. Ninety-nine percent of New South Wales, which is the country's most populous state and provides around a quarter of the country's agricultural output, is currently in drought. Australia's drought seen from the air How Australia's extreme heat might be here to stay Five places that have just broken heat records Announcing the additional funding from a farm in the state, Mr Turnbull said: ""Now we are the land of droughts and flooding rains, we recognise that.

Opt-out organ donation 'in place by 2020',"A new opt-out system for organ donation will be in place by 2020 in England, if Parliament approves ""Max's Law"". Under the plans detailed by ministers, adults will be presumed to be organ donors unless they have specifically recorded their decision not to be. The government said it would save up to 700 lives each year. In the UK in 2017, 411 people died before the right donor was found, and more than 5,000 people are currently on the waiting list in England. A similar opt-out system has been in placein Wales since 2015. Scotland plans to introduce asimilar schemeand Northern Ireland has also expressed an interest. ""Max's Law"" is named after Max Johnson, from Cheshire, who was saved by a heart transplant. His search for a suitable heart was followed in a series of front-page stories in theDaily Mirror, as the newspaper campaigned for the change in the law.,external Last year,Theresa May wrote to the 10-year-old, saying she chose the name after she heard his ""inspirational story"". The legislation was subsequently introduced last year, and will return to the House of Commons in the autumn to be voted on. If passed, it is expected to come into effect in England in spring 2020 - because the timetable for its introduction will allow for a year of ""transition"" to the new law. The government said it would also encourage people to discuss, with their families, the issue of whether they would want to be a donor in the event of their death. Mark Smith had diabetes for 25 years, which caused his kidneys to fail. He was on the waiting list for seven months before he was able to have a kidney and pancreas transplant. Mr Smith told BBC Breakfast that he had got in touch with the family of his donor, a 24-year-old manslaughter victim, to express his gratitude. ""Having lost a younger brother myself, I wanted them to know that I could empathise,"" he said. ""Although I hadn't lost a child, I knew what it was like to lose someone young in very tragic circumstances."" Mark Smith received a double transplant in 2009 Since then, he said they have been in touch several times and had become ""really good friends"". ""I've always been a supporter of organ donation, it's such a noble thing to do for people to give that gift - it really is the gift of life,"" he added. The new system presumes that over-18s in England are in favour of donating their organs when they die, instead of the current system where people opt in by signing the NHS Organ Donor Register. Under the new law, those who do not wish to donate their organs will still be able to opt out via the register and by using an NHS app that launches at the end of the year. The register will also include an option for people to state their faith, if it is important to their decision. Currently, fewer than half of families give consent for their loved one's organs to be donated if they are unaware of their wishes, and ministers hope that the new system will encourage people to make their wishes known before their death. Research shows 82% of people support organ donation, yet only 37% have recorded their wishes on the NHS Organ Donor Register. Under the new plans, specialist nurses will be on hand to discuss donation with families after a loved one dies. Hayley Louise Jordan died from a brain haemorrhage when she was 32, and her organs were donated to six people, including two children. She had signed the organ donor register before her death, and her mum Carol says she was glad her daughter's wishes could be granted. Hayley Louise's mum Carol Jordan feels comfort after her daughter's organs were donated ""My Hayley had gone, she wasn't there any more,"" she said. ""Now I've got comfort knowing she's saved six recipients. ""I just want them to have a healthy and happy life - that's the comfort I get now. ""I just wanted some good to come from it. ""They were sitting waiting for a call and it's a miracle for those recipients."" Carol says she agrees with the new system of presumed consent. ""It's a good thing because you're taking the decision off the parents."" Jackie Doyle-Price, Secretary of State for Mental Health and Inequalities, said the changes could save up to 700 lives every year, but she said organ donation remained a gift. ""I want to encourage people who wish to give life in the event of their death to take the time to record their wishes and discuss it with their family,"" she said. ""However, we know this new system alone is not a magic bullet. ""We need to address myths and misconceptions around donation, and we will only do this by having informed debate and dialogue, which I hope will be fostered by these proposals."" Fiona Loud, policy director of Kidney Care UK, told BBC Breakfast the experience in Wales, wheredonations did not initially increase, showed the new system depended on widespread public support. ""We must have a full, consistent public education system with faith groups, schools, colleges, universities, and with the public as well,"" she said. She added the new system would involve a ""soft opt-out"", where families could override the presumption in favour of donation if they strongly believed their dead relative would not have wanted it. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said introducing an opt-out system in England would reflect the views of the general public better. He said: ""This will also ease the agonising pain felt by many families who risk losing a loved one while they wait for an organ. ""It's still really important for all of us to have conversations with our loved ones about organ donation so our wishes can be met if the worst should happen.""

It comes as thousands of students and school children continue a week-long protest calling for safer roads. Police used tear gas to disperse crowds on Sunday. At least 50protesters have also been injured in street attacks. Local media reported that political activists belonging to the governing party beat students marching towards their offices. Hundreds of young people returned to the streets on Sunday despite violence against them The students were demanding to know why protesters were attacked on Saturday, in clashes which left dozens injured. The US ambassador condemned the violence. ""Nothing can justify the brutal attacks and violence over the weekend against the thousands of young people who have been peacefully exercising their democratic rights,""a statement on the embassy's Facebook page said,external. Ambassador Bernicat was unharmed in the late night attack on her convoy ""The peaceful demonstrations of the past week in favour of better vehicle and road safety, led by students and school children across Bangladesh, have united and captured the imagination of the whole country."" Meanwhile, a prominent photojournalist and human rights activist, Shahidul Alam, was detained by police on Sunday over Facebook posts relating to the protests. Mr Alam had criticised the government's handling of the protests in interviews with international media. Obaidul Quader, general secretary of the Awami League, told journalists that party activists acted in self-defence as the students attacked first. ""Will we kiss them if they advance towards Awami League office?"" he said. Government officials have called for an end to the protests. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged protesters to stay at home. ""Whatever they have done is enough,"" she said, adding that police had begun a week-long campaign to bring discipline to the roads. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan warned that the patience of law enforcement officers with the protesters was wearing thin. ""Even we have a limit. We will take action if that limit is exceeded,"" he said. The protests began whenyoung people took to the streets peacefully after a boy and girl were killed by a speeding bus last Sunday. Thousands of students and school children have joined the demonstrations calling for safer roads. They have ignored repeated calls from the government for them to return home. Over the past two days, unidentified men in helmets carrying sticks and metal rods have attacked protesters and journalists. Local media have blamed groups linked to the Awami League. Witnesses have told the BBC that anyone found filming the clashes, including journalists, have been beaten and had their equipment destroyed. The government blocked 3G and 4G internet services for 24 hours on Saturday evening in response to the protests, with young people complaining that this is to stop them organising and sharing their actions.

Up to 20 feared dead in WW2 plane crash,"The plane came down high above sea level in the Swiss Alps Twenty people have died after a World War Two vintage aircraft crashed into a mountainside in eastern Switzerland, police say.

Three men die after car and lorry crash,"Robert Bambridge, 24, from Pontypool, is the first named victim of the collision A family has paid tribute to one of the victims of a crash in which three men died in Cardiff. The collision between a car and a lorry happened on Sunday at about 04:00 BST on the A4232 Southern Way in the Llanedeyrn area of the city. Robert Bambridge, 24, from Pontypool, has been described as a ""free spirit"" and a ""kind hearted"" son, brother and father by his family. Details about the other men are not yet known. ""Robert lived for his daughter and was at his happiest when they were together walking in the mountains and playing in the swimming pool,"" said a family statement. ""To say that Robert was much loved would not do him justice for the love that we feel for him. ""He was a son, brother but, most importantly, a father and it is tragic that he has been taken from us so soon."" South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had sent three crews to assist following the incident. South Wales Police closed the road until Sunday afternoon to carry out an investigation. Officers have appealed for anyone who witnessed the collision between a grey Ford Focus and heavy goods vehicle to come forward.

"Offer transgender fertility help, NHS told","A watchdog is threatening NHS England with legal action if it does not begin offering fertility treatments to transgender patients as standard. Transitioning can lead to fertility loss, but many patients are not offered a chance to have eggs or sperm stored. The Equality and Human Rights Commission said this is ""outdated"" discrimination as patients with other conditions routinely get that option. NHS England says it is a matter for government ministers to decide upon. According to the EHRC, the decision on who should be offered the extraction and storage of eggs and sperm - known as gamete extraction and storage - falls to individual Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). ""But many choose not to [offer this service]"" to transgender patients, the watchdog said. How do you legally change gender? Transgender people face two-year wait The story of two transgender children The EHRC sent a pre-action letter to NHS England on Friday, which it said was the first step towards a judicial review, and asked them to make gamete extraction and storage available to anyone having treatment for gender dysphoria. The NHS defines gender dysphoria as a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity. Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the EHRC, said: ""Our laws and our values protect those who seek treatment for gender dysphoria. ""This means that where appropriate, treatment should be made available in order to ensure that access to health services is free of discrimination. ""A choice between treatment for gender dysphoria and the chance to start a family is not a real choice."" She added: ""We have asked NHS England to reflect on the true breadth of their statutory mandate and the impact on the transgender community of these outdated policies."" The NHS said the EHRC had ""misplaced their fire"" by targeting it rather than the government. An NHS England spokesperson said: ""Decisions on which services are commissioned by NHS England are taken by ministers based on advice from an independently chaired panel of health experts and patient representatives, using a process set out in primary legislation."" The EHRC believes it is within NHS England's legal powers to make fertility services for transgender patients a ""core service"", which would mean all CCGs should offer it. But the NHS says a decision by ministers is needed to allow this to happen. NHS England have 14 days to respond to the EHRC's letter. A spokeswoman from the watchdog added: ""Their response will determine whether or not further action is necessary."" The Department of Health declined to comment.

Melania backs NBA star after Trump insults,"US First Lady Melania Trump has backed basketball player LeBron James, hours after her husband made insulting remarks about him on Twitter. James had said in an interview that Mr Trump was divisive and had emboldened racists. In response, Mr Trump questioned James' intelligence, saying it was not easy to make the NBA player ""look smart"". However, Mrs Trump's spokeswoman said James was ""working to do good things"" with a school in his Ohio hometown. She said Mrs Trump wanted ""to have an open dialogue about issues facing children"". Earlier this week, James told CNN during an interview with Don Lemon that sport had offered him the opportunity to meet people of different backgrounds and race. ""Sports has never been something that divides people. It's always been something that brings someone together,"" he said. ""He [Mr Trump] is dividing us and what I noticed over the last few months is that he's kinda used sport to divide us and that's something I can't relate to, because I know that sport was the first time I was ever around someone white."" He also argued that Mr Trump's actions had encouraged racists, saying: ""I think [racism's] always been there. But I think the president in charge now has given people - they don't care now, they throw it to your face."" On Saturday, the president responded on Twitter by saying: ""Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. ""He made Lebron look smart, which isn't easy to do.""

Mr Trump also suggested that he prefers NBA legend Michael Jordan over the LA Lakers star. The president's endorsement of basketball star Michael Jordan was perhaps a reference to the long-standing debate over whether Jordan or James is the better all-time player. However, Jordan also expressed support for James. He told media outlets through his spokesperson: ""I support L.J. [LeBron James]. He's doing an amazing job for his community.""

"Wales 'standing still' on foreign tourismLondon and Scotland are drawing in more overseas tourists but, despite a marketing campaign, Wales is not.","The Year of Legends marketing campaign aimed to share Wales' ""epic story"" and give visitors ""legendary experiences"" Despite a multimillion pound campaign to boost tourism, Wales is ""standing still"" in attracting foreign tourists, an expert has said. Simon Calder added it was ""really concerning"" visitor spending dropped by 17% at a time when the pound is weak. A record 39.2m visitors came to the UK in 2017 - but headed mainly to London and Scotland, new figures show. The Welsh Government said its tourism barometer survey was ""overwhelmingly positive"" overall. Numbers of foreign tourists rose by 0.5% but their spend dropped by 17% in the 12 months Â£5m was spent on theYear of Legendscampaign, which aimed to give visitors legendary experiences. Mr Calder said the lack of flights from major countries meant Wales was regarded as ""an add on"" to a trip to England rather than a destination in its own right. Wales' past brought to life as part of Year of Legends Ministers pay Â£1m to Qatar Airways to market Wales Wales tourism campaign 'working but more UK visitors needed' ""These figures are really concerning for the Wales tourism industry,"" he said. ""Scotland in particular has done very well while Wales is effectively standing still."" Thetourism analysis published by the Welsh Government,externaldescribes UK-wide increases being driven by visitors from north America and non-European countries. Overall, 20m headed for London (up 4% on 2016) and 3.2m for Scotland (up 17%). St Davids Cathedral in Pembrokeshire is a popular tourist destination In comparison, there were 1.1m visitors to Wales (up 0.5%). However, while these visitors' spending increased by 14% in London to Â£13,546m and by 23% in Scotland to Â£2,276m, the figure dropped in Wales by 17% to Â£369m. Mr Calder added: ""The spend is really troubling because the pound is pretty pathetic and you would expect it to go up. ""This could be down to the length of time people can be persuaded to stay if they are using Wales as an add on to a trip to England."" He said tourists' imaginations had been captured through theWild Atlantic Way,externalin Ireland andNorth Coast 500,externalin Scotland. However, even with ""fantastic movie set locations"", people needed to get to Wales. ""There has a been a huge increase in flights between Edinburgh and north America, that will explain a lot of the increase,"" Mr Calder said. ""Wales will be hoping the new Qatar link does the same."" While he said it was too early to know if it would be a success, it made Wales one stop from large cities such as Shanghai. The Wales Tourism Alliance described the figures as ""disappointing"". The Welsh Government has signed a Â£1m marketing deal for Qatar Airways to promote Wales around the world Domestic UK overnight visitors to Wales fell in 2017. There was a 3% decrease to 9m who spent Â£1,628m (a 3.6% drop) while UK-wide there was a 1% increase to 120.68m, who spent Â£23,683m (a 2.6% increase). A Welsh Government spokeswoman said its tourism survey showed 80% of businesses reported a greater or similar level of business compared to 2016. ""There is no doubt that tourism is a hugely competitive global sector and we will continue to work with the industry to further improve what we have to offer in Wales and maximise opportunities to introduce new audiences and grow both overseas and domestic visitors so we can  look to build on the 10 million overnight visitors we  welcomed in 2017,"" she added. The spokeswoman said themed years have been ""very well received"" and the Â£5m invested in the Year of Legends marketing campaign helped generate an additional Â£365m for the Welsh economy. In 2018 so far, more than 100 cruise ships have visited Wales, bringing 51,000 passengers from countries such as the USA, Canada and France. This represents a 15% increase on 2017, with the 54 stopping at Anglesey, 30% more than last year.

Actor Steven Seagal to be Russian envoy,"Steven Seagal (left) has praised President Putin's policies Russia has appointed the US actor Steven Seagal as a special envoy to improve ties with the United States. Seagal was granted Russian citizenship in 2016and has praised President Putin as a great world leader. Born in the US, the martial arts star gained international fame for roles in the 1980s and '90s like Under Siege. He is also one of the Hollywood stars accused by several women of sexual misconduct in the wake of the #MeToo campaign, which he has denied. Steven Seagal faces sex harassment claims Steven Seagal denies Bond girl assault Harassment in Hollywood: Who's been accused? The Russian foreign ministry made the announcement on its official Facebook page, saying the unpaid position was similar to that of a United Nations' goodwill ambassador and Seagal would promote US-Russia relations ""in the humanitarian sphere"". The Flight of Fury star, still popular with Russian audiences, has recently defended the Russian government over claims that it meddled in 2016 US elections. The 66-year-old has called President Putin ""one of the great living world leaders"", and when Seagal was granted Russian citizenship, said he hoped it would be a symbol of how relations between Moscow and Washington were starting to improve. Seagal was also granted Serbian citizenship in 2016, following several visits to the Balkan country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Three die in car and lorry crash,"Robert Bambridge, 24, from Pontypool, is the first named victim of the collision A family has paid tribute to one of the victims of a crash in which three men died in Cardiff. The collision between a car and a lorry happened on Sunday at about 04:00 BST on the A4232 Southern Way in the Llanedeyrn area of the city. Robert Bambridge, 24, from Pontypool, has been described as a ""free spirit"" and a ""kind hearted"" son, brother and father by his family. Details about the other men are not yet known. ""Robert lived for his daughter and was at his happiest when they were together walking in the mountains and playing in the swimming pool,"" said a family statement. ""To say that Robert was much loved would not do him justice for the love that we feel for him. ""He was a son, brother but, most importantly, a father and it is tragic that he has been taken from us so soon."" South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had sent three crews to assist following the incident. South Wales Police closed the road until Sunday afternoon to carry out an investigation. Officers have appealed for anyone who witnessed the collision between a grey Ford Focus and heavy goods vehicle to come forward.

Wales 'standing still' on foreign tourism,"The Year of Legends marketing campaign aimed to share Wales' ""epic story"" and give visitors ""legendary experiences"" Despite a multimillion pound campaign to boost tourism, Wales is ""standing still"" in attracting foreign tourists, an expert has said. Simon Calder added it was ""really concerning"" visitor spending dropped by 17% at a time when the pound is weak. A record 39.2m visitors came to the UK in 2017 - but headed mainly to London and Scotland, new figures show. The Welsh Government said its tourism barometer survey was ""overwhelmingly positive"" overall. Numbers of foreign tourists rose by 0.5% but their spend dropped by 17% in the 12 months Â£5m was spent on theYear of Legendscampaign, which aimed to give visitors legendary experiences. Mr Calder said the lack of flights from major countries meant Wales was regarded as ""an add on"" to a trip to England rather than a destination in its own right. Wales' past brought to life as part of Year of Legends Ministers pay Â£1m to Qatar Airways to market Wales Wales tourism campaign 'working but more UK visitors needed' ""These figures are really concerning for the Wales tourism industry,"" he said. ""Scotland in particular has done very well while Wales is effectively standing still."" Thetourism analysis published by the Welsh Government,externaldescribes UK-wide increases being driven by visitors from north America and non-European countries. Overall, 20m headed for London (up 4% on 2016) and 3.2m for Scotland (up 17%). St Davids Cathedral in Pembrokeshire is a popular tourist destination In comparison, there were 1.1m visitors to Wales (up 0.5%). However, while these visitors' spending increased by 14% in London to Â£13,546m and by 23% in Scotland to Â£2,276m, the figure dropped in Wales by 17% to Â£369m. Mr Calder added: ""The spend is really troubling because the pound is pretty pathetic and you would expect it to go up. ""This could be down to the length of time people can be persuaded to stay if they are using Wales as an add on to a trip to England."" He said tourists' imaginations had been captured through theWild Atlantic Way,externalin Ireland andNorth Coast 500,externalin Scotland. However, even with ""fantastic movie set locations"", people needed to get to Wales. ""There has a been a huge increase in flights between Edinburgh and north America, that will explain a lot of the increase,"" Mr Calder said. ""Wales will be hoping the new Qatar link does the same."" While he said it was too early to know if it would be a success, it made Wales one stop from large cities such as Shanghai. The Wales Tourism Alliance described the figures as ""disappointing"". The Welsh Government has signed a Â£1m marketing deal for Qatar Airways to promote Wales around the world Domestic UK overnight visitors to Wales fell in 2017. There was a 3% decrease to 9m who spent Â£1,628m (a 3.6% drop) while UK-wide there was a 1% increase to 120.68m, who spent Â£23,683m (a 2.6% increase). A Welsh Government spokeswoman said its tourism survey showed 80% of businesses reported a greater or similar level of business compared to 2016. ""There is no doubt that tourism is a hugely competitive global sector and we will continue to work with the industry to further improve what we have to offer in Wales and maximise opportunities to introduce new audiences and grow both overseas and domestic visitors so we can  look to build on the 10 million overnight visitors we  welcomed in 2017,"" she added. The spokeswoman said themed years have been ""very well received"" and the Â£5m invested in the Year of Legends marketing campaign helped generate an additional Â£365m for the Welsh economy. In 2018 so far, more than 100 cruise ships have visited Wales, bringing 51,000 passengers from countries such as the USA, Canada and France. This represents a 15% increase on 2017, with the 54 stopping at Anglesey, 30% more than last year.

A small group of protesters criticised sponsor British Airways for its co-operation over government-ordered deportations.

Ch Supt Neil Honnor said armed officers would be working in the city during the parade with ""public safety the main priority"".

"Opt-out organ donation 'in place by 2020'Adults in England will be presumed to consent to donating their organs under ""Max's Law"".Health","A new opt-out system for organ donation will be in place by 2020 in England, if Parliament approves ""Max's Law"". Under the plans detailed by ministers, adults will be presumed to be organ donors unless they have specifically recorded their decision not to be. The government said it would save up to 700 lives each year. In the UK in 2017, 411 people died before the right donor was found, and more than 5,000 people are currently on the waiting list in England. A similar opt-out system has been in placein Wales since 2015. Scotland plans to introduce asimilar schemeand Northern Ireland has also expressed an interest. ""Max's Law"" is named after Max Johnson, from Cheshire, who was saved by a heart transplant. His search for a suitable heart was followed in a series of front-page stories in theDaily Mirror, as the newspaper campaigned for the change in the law.,external Last year,Theresa May wrote to the 10-year-old, saying she chose the name after she heard his ""inspirational story"". The legislation was subsequently introduced last year, and will return to the House of Commons in the autumn to be voted on. If passed, it is expected to come into effect in England in spring 2020 - because the timetable for its introduction will allow for a year of ""transition"" to the new law. The government said it would also encourage people to discuss, with their families, the issue of whether they would want to be a donor in the event of their death. Mark Smith had diabetes for 25 years, which caused his kidneys to fail. He was on the waiting list for seven months before he was able to have a kidney and pancreas transplant. Mr Smith told BBC Breakfast that he had got in touch with the family of his donor, a 24-year-old manslaughter victim, to express his gratitude. ""Having lost a younger brother myself, I wanted them to know that I could empathise,"" he said. ""Although I hadn't lost a child, I knew what it was like to lose someone young in very tragic circumstances."" Mark Smith received a double transplant in 2009 Since then, he said they have been in touch several times and had become ""really good friends"". ""I've always been a supporter of organ donation, it's such a noble thing to do for people to give that gift - it really is the gift of life,"" he added. The new system presumes that over-18s in England are in favour of donating their organs when they die, instead of the current system where people opt in by signing the NHS Organ Donor Register. Under the new law, those who do not wish to donate their organs will still be able to opt out via the register and by using an NHS app that launches at the end of the year. The register will also include an option for people to state their faith, if it is important to their decision. Currently, fewer than half of families give consent for their loved one's organs to be donated if they are unaware of their wishes, and ministers hope that the new system will encourage people to make their wishes known before their death. Research shows 82% of people support organ donation, yet only 37% have recorded their wishes on the NHS Organ Donor Register. Under the new plans, specialist nurses will be on hand to discuss donation with families after a loved one dies. Hayley Louise Jordan died from a brain haemorrhage when she was 32, and her organs were donated to six people, including two children. She had signed the organ donor register before her death, and her mum Carol says she was glad her daughter's wishes could be granted. Hayley Louise's mum Carol Jordan feels comfort after her daughter's organs were donated ""My Hayley had gone, she wasn't there any more,"" she said. ""Now I've got comfort knowing she's saved six recipients. ""I just want them to have a healthy and happy life - that's the comfort I get now. ""I just wanted some good to come from it. ""They were sitting waiting for a call and it's a miracle for those recipients."" Carol says she agrees with the new system of presumed consent. ""It's a good thing because you're taking the decision off the parents."" Jackie Doyle-Price, Secretary of State for Mental Health and Inequalities, said the changes could save up to 700 lives every year, but she said organ donation remained a gift. ""I want to encourage people who wish to give life in the event of their death to take the time to record their wishes and discuss it with their family,"" she said. ""However, we know this new system alone is not a magic bullet. ""We need to address myths and misconceptions around donation, and we will only do this by having informed debate and dialogue, which I hope will be fostered by these proposals."" Fiona Loud, policy director of Kidney Care UK, told BBC Breakfast the experience in Wales, wheredonations did not initially increase, showed the new system depended on widespread public support. ""We must have a full, consistent public education system with faith groups, schools, colleges, universities, and with the public as well,"" she said. She added the new system would involve a ""soft opt-out"", where families could override the presumption in favour of donation if they strongly believed their dead relative would not have wanted it. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said introducing an opt-out system in England would reflect the views of the general public better. He said: ""This will also ease the agonising pain felt by many families who risk losing a loved one while they wait for an organ. ""It's still really important for all of us to have conversations with our loved ones about organ donation so our wishes can be met if the worst should happen.""

"Donald Campbell's Bluebird returns to waterThe record-breaking hydroplane, which crashed in 1967, is being tested on the Isle of Bute.Glasgow & West Scotland","The Bluebird was recovered from the bottom of Coniston Water in 2001 and has been rebuilt Donald Campbell's Bluebird has been launched in front of cheering crowds for the first time in over 50 years. The record-breaking hydroplane was floated as part of tests being carried out on Loch Fad on the Isle of Bute. It has been rebuilt after being recovered from the bottom of Coniston Water in 2001, following Campbell's fatal crash in 1967. The 45-year-old died trying to break his own water speed record when the Bluebird K7 flipped and crashed. A group of volunteers from Tyneside are testing the iconic craft to see if it is watertight and whether it can withstand a buffeting from the waves. Bluebird flipped as it travelled at more than 300mph Engineer Bill Smith has led the restoration project after salvaging the craft Donald Campbell had been travelling at speeds of more than 300mph to break his own 276mph record when the Bluebird K7 partially disintegrated. Lead engineer Bill Smith, said it had been a ""labour of love"" to put the hydroplane back on water. ""This project is 22 years old this year. ""We've been 15 years in the rebuild - five years to strip down, catalogue and clean, and ten years since we set the first rivet to bring her back to this condition. ""This is a fully working machine, completely original. This is the vehicle that Donald Campbell drove. The craft will stay on the island for the next few weeks An attempt to refloat the craft earlier in the afternoon stalled when it became snagged on the beach of the loch. Daughter marks Bluebird crash 50 years on Campbell's Bluebird roars back to life However, the team said they were determined to launch it in the near perfect conditions on the Isle of Bute. Mr Smith said the Bluebird had been made to operate on the ""flat calm"". Tim Walsh, who is the project's lead pilot, added: ""We are looking to assess how it copes with the water, are there any leaks and what challenge is there from different sizes of waves."" The craft is set to undergo a battery of tests on Loch Fad over the coming weeks before it returns to Coniston next year, where it is expected to run at speed. Campbell was born on 23 March 1921 in Surrey and was the son of speed record breaker Sir Malcolm Campbell He initially used his father's old boat Bluebird K4 in record-breaking attempts In 1960 he survived a horrific crash in the US while trying to break the land speed record The Bluebird K7 boat was already 12 years old at the time of the Coniston Water crash He set eight world speed records - seven on water and one on land Campbell's lucky mascot - a 9ins ""Mr Whoppit"" bear from 1956 - was recovered after the crash Campbell's Bluebird set for Scotland run Daughter marks Bluebird crash 50 years on Campbell's Bluebird roars back to life Museum move for Campbell's Bluebird Unseen Campbell speed film restored.

Can Italy trust this man?,"Salvini mastered the use of Facebook Live as a tool to convey his often inflammatory message With a couple of shrugs, Matteo Salvini's ministerial career came to a sudden end in late August 2019. Addressing parliament, Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte attacked his nominal deputy's entire way of working. Salvini, sitting alongside Conte, raised his shoulders as if to say he didn't care. He then went to join the rest of his party in newfound opposition. The coalition government of Salvini's far-right League party and the Five Star Movement fell apart. Fifteen months of populist experiment was at an end. It was a stunning turnaround. Salvini had provoked the fall of his own coalition. He wanted to cash in his opinion poll lead in order to win outright power in a snap election. But his gamble had a fatal flaw; he did not count on the possibility of his opponents teaming up to stop him. Five Star got together with the centre-left Democratic Party and Salvini may now have to wait in opposition until the next scheduled general election in 2023. This video can not be played Giuseppe Conte launched a bitter attack on Matteo Salvini (L) in August as Mr Salvini to his right and Mr Di Maio to his left No longer Italy's most powerful politician, he now spends his time holding rallies and criticising his former coalition partners - including Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio, who he has said ""did not turn out to be a serious person"". Salvini, though, promises a return to power. ""Let's make ourselves ready,"" he later told his supporters in Bergamo in northern Italy, adding: ""In the next election we will return and take this country in hand for the next 10 years."" But for the first time in more than a year he no longer dictates the country's agenda. In office, he enjoyed acting like an outsider. Now he really is one. I first saw Salvini in person in Rome in the run-up to the 2018 general election. Standing smoking in his green puffer jacket, he blended in with his bodyguards and aides. Politicians in Italy tend to prefer the tailored suit and shirt, the kind that makes them stand out from their supporting cast. Not so Salvini. On the occasions he does put on a tie, it is almost invariably loosened at the collar. Outside the event in Rome, journalists waited politely as Salvini smoked and checked his phone. ""Why are you against migrants?"" I asked him once he had finished his cigarette. ""I'm againstillegalmigrants,"" he corrected me. ""Too many of them are dangerous for Italy and Europe."" His words struck a chord with the electorate. Salvini's League party did better than expected at the polls. In June 2018, he was sworn in as deputy prime minister and interior minister in a coalition government with the populist Five Star Movement. The two parties installed an unknown former law professor, Giuseppe Conte, as a relatively powerless prime minister. Salvini ended up becoming the most powerful figure in the government. It was the culmination of a political career that began when he was a teenager. He entered politics as a left-wing secessionist, before transforming himself into the leading spokesman of Italy's nationalist hard right. Salvini joined the Northern League at a time when it wanted independence from the rest of Italy. The party believed that the south of Italy was holding back the more affluent north, and its members enjoyed joking in their chants that southerners were dirty and lazy. ""There's a bad smell / Even dogs are running away / Must be that the Neapolitans are arriving / They have cholera, are earthquake-hit / They never washed themselves with soap."" In Italy, all political parties operate their own mini-states. Salvini found work in the Northern League's in-house newspaper and its radio station, taking his place on the movement's left wing - a point he advertised by wearing a Che Guevara pin. Alessandro Morelli is a close friend of Salvini who grew up alongside him and is now a fellow League member of parliament. ""We would always be involved in grassroots politics,"" he says. ""We'd put up posters, set up gazebos, distribute propaganda - we were always close to the people. Even then you could see he had the makings of a leader."" In 1993, at the age of 20, Salvini was elected to Milan's city council. Six years later, with an early eye for a populist gesture, he refused to shake the hand of the visiting Italian president, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. ""No thanks,"" he said. ""You don't represent me."" Salvini's anti-southern views even overshadowed his own 2003 wedding to Fabrizia Ieluzzi. The couple divorced in 2010. ""It was crazy,""she tells the BBC. ""My origins are from Apulia, in southern Italy, and he's from the north. For a start, he had four relatives there, and I had 200. ""When we were going to cut the cake he took his shirt off and put on a green one, the colour of The League, and all his friends started chanting [anti-Southern] League songs. And all my relatives, on the other side of the ballroom, started booing. That was my wedding!"" Salvini went on to serve as a member of the European Parliament, but did not want to spend his entire career as a niche politician. A break-up of Italy - the Northern League's main focus - was not likely to happen. He wanted national power, which meant transforming the Northern League into an Italy-wide party. In 2013, when the party was on about 4% in the polls, he won its leadership. He gradually switched its focus: the principal enemy would no longer be the Italian state. Instead it would be the European Union. ""When the wrong Europe was built, we realised that the enemy wasn't just Rome any more, but it had moved to Brussels,"" says Alessandro Morelli, the League MP and long-time Salvini ally. ""Even further away, even less representative of Italians. For this reason, we realised that Brussels was the political enemy."" Are Salvini's immigration claims correct? All the latest news on Matteo Salvini Salvini dropped the 'Northern' from The League's name and turned his party into a national movement. But, crucially, he retained the party's style - its easy-to-understand populist message that there were enemies threatening the people. In addition to Europe, he identified a second threat: immigration. Since 2014, more than 640,000 migrants have landed on Italy's shores - many have since left for other European countries, but others remain. ""He's a chameleon, a politician who changes colour and shape according to his convenience and the political moment,"" says Matteo Pucciarelli, the author of Anatomy of a Populist: The True Story of Matteo Salvini. ""Today he plays the right-wing sheriff. But knowing him privately, I know that that's not his real nature. That's a character. Some of the stuff he says in public is disturbing and scary, but the human side of Salvini is different. But this doesn't make it OK."" Mr Salvini has condemned what he calls ""organised migration that aims at replacing the Italian people"". Here, migrants pose with him at a camp in Calabria in July Salvini demonstrated the two apparently contradictory skills that any successful populist politician needs: a core message, and the willingness to adapt or abandon this message whenever the need arises. He inherited an Italian political landscape shaped by the country's original populist, Silvio Berlusconi. The former prime minister had made himself his movement's biggest brand. So Salvini decided to do the same. This was a job he appeared to enjoy. He may well have figured that there was an opening. At the time, Italy was led by Matteo Renzi from the centre-left, a politician who modelled himself on Clinton, Blair and Obama. There was surely room in Italy for an anti-Renzi, someone who didn't spend his whole time leading seminars about globalisation. ""For better or for worse, Salvini is the guy next door,"" says his biographer Matteo Pucciarelli. ""He's the typical son of Italian parents, accessible, very simple, with whom you can speak about anything. ""He lives in a suburb of Milan in a small flat,"" Pucciarelli adds. ""He likes football, beautiful women, food and taking photographs of sunsets. He's the average Italian."" Surprisingly, no-one else had occupied this space in Italian politics. Matteo Renzi was too much of a pro-globalist. The eternally ambitious Berlusconi may have spoken in an easy to understand way, but a billionaire collector of football teams and romantic affairs was hardly someone you'd have a beer with. Beppe Grillo, the founder of the populist Five Star Movement, was too colourful to be normal. Renzi's eventual successor as prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, was a tinder-dry media-wary aristocrat, who might have been happier talking quietly about the history of frescoes. ""Would you trust Italy to this man?"" Oggi magazine asked in 2014 The more Salvini acted like a regular, albeit publicity-driven, Italian, the more he connected with the public. He also realised that politicians who spend most of their time talking about enemies also need to show a sense of fun. In December 2014, he posed half-naked on the cover of the gossip magazine 'Oggi', wearing only the green tie of the League party. The headline said: ""Would you trust Italy to this man?"" Not yet, was the answer. But his party was rising in the polls. He continued to present his own phone-in show on the League's in-house radio station, Radio Padania. Given his many years presenting the phone-in, it may be that Salvini has answered more questions from the public than any other serving Italian politician. Like other populists, Salvini took to filming and posting his own videos and publicity stunts online. In May 2017, he filmed himself spending a night at the Mineo migrant centre in Sicily, the largest of its kind in Europe. The video of him going to bed in a migrant camp attracted attention. It served to highlight the words he would write after his visit: ""I'm increasingly convinced that there is an ongoing attempt of ethnic replacement of one people with another people. This is not emergency migration, but organised migration that aims at replacing the Italian people with other people, Italian workers with other workers."" Salvini's assertion refers to a corner of conspiracy theory occupied by those who have long believed that European elites have a detailed plan to replace their own workers with migrants. ""Salvini uses words and ideas that were first developed in extreme right wing circles,"" says Valerio Renzi, the author of 'Bulldozer Politics: Salvini's League and the European Right', ""For example, the fight against the alleged attempt to ethnically replace the European peoples. This is a conspiracy theory. Salvini translates these ideas into television language - ideas that were born in incubators of the extreme right in Italy and Europe."" Salvini sells his message with a mixture of jokes and apocalyptic warnings. ""How many migrants are you hosting at home?"" he joked with a co-presenter on Radio Padania, in April 2014. ""Do you eat bananas? These days if you don't eat bananas you're a racist."" ""150 migrants are coming into Veneto this week, distributed among the region,"" he told listeners to his phone-in show in Feb 2015. ""This is ethnic replacement co-ordinated by Europe."" During the 2018 general election campaign, he called migrants ""an army of benefit thieves and criminals"". ""The risk is that he is legitimising the worst impulses of this country,"" says Salvini's biographer Matteo Pucciarelli. ""Up until a few years back, people were ashamed of saying certain things about migrants, of speaking openly about earning the right to shoot a burglar. With Salvini there's total freedom. From a cultural perspective, he has opened the gates to very negative impulses that maybe were always around but weren't visible."" Protesters from Italy's Radical Party protest against Salvini's stance on migrants in Rome In each country, words and phrases carry their own memories. Salvini's direct language reminds some Italians of the Mussolini era in the 1920s and 30s, when insults were followed by the formalised persecution of minority groups. In particular, Salvini's suggestion that the Roma communities of Italy be subjected to their own census was a reminder of the 1938 race laws passed under Mussolini. 'Treated like dogs': Italy's Roma minority This is not to accuse Salvini himself of fascism. It's simply to say that his words tap into a long historical memory. Discussion of these ideas does not happen in isolation. In February 2018, a former local candidate for The League injured six migrants in a drive-by shooting. Migrants, and those who speak out in favour of migration, now fear for their own safety. Laura Boldrini, the speaker of the lower house of parliament from 2013 to 2018, has become a particular target of Salvini's verbal attacks. Salvini depicts Boldrini, who was once the Rome spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as the symbol of everything he is trying to bring down. ""Every time a migrant committed a crime, or there was a crime, a rape, a robbery, he would refer to migrants as 'Boldrini's resources',"" the former speaker tells me. ""People were blaming me. It was awful. I received really violent rape and death threats. This campaign had implications on my life. I needed a security detail. You never know when [the threats] are real or not."" ""Stop bullying migrants,"" she urges him. ""Start working on the real problems. Try to be competent and reliable. Stop using social media in that aggressive way. Be serious. [Act like] a minister."" Many Italians on the centre-left share Boldrini's thoughts. But it's unlikely to make much of an impact on its target. Salvini's friends say that he's good at disregarding criticism. ""He laughs at all the jokes that circulate about him,"" says his former wife Fabrizia Ieluzzi. ""I never saw him get offended by a joke they make about him. I don't know how he does it, but he's good at letting these things go."" But that's not always the case. Salvini's skin may be thinner than his allies claim. In July 2018, he began legal proceedings against the writer Roberto Saviano after Saviano accused him of aiding the mafia. The League's leader shares a derision of liberal critics with his growing number of allies in fellow nationalist movements in the West. Salvini has routinely voiced his support for Marine Le Pen in France, as well as for President Trump. He's also been pictured in Red Square in Moscow happily wearing a Putin T-shirt. In 2014, he went to North Korea and declared afterwards: ""I'm happy I went. There's a splendid sense of community. There's a lot of children playing in the streets and not with their Playstations."" Shortly after taking office, Salvini announced ambitions to create a pan-European association of nationalist parties, capable of changing the direction of the European Union. This sets him up in direct opposition to France's President Emmanuel Macron, the de facto leader of the continent's liberal movements. The Salvini-Macron competition may come to define the future of the European Union. Early days are often full of broad promises. Matteo Salvini certainly seems to enjoy the crush of controversy and the attention. He is regularly seen taking selfies with those keen to pose with him. In previous years, many ordinary Italians would have been extremely reluctant to stand alongside the standard-bearer of a northern-led party which denigrated southerners, Europeans, and migrants. But Italy has changed. For now, this is Matteo Salvini's country. Italy has a habit, however, of rejecting those it once embraced as saviours. ""I don't think it can last in the long term,"" says Salvini's biographer Matteo Pucciarelli. ""This continuous cycle of launching attacks, diverting attention, creating illusions, changing the perception of reality... It may work to gain consensus to reach government, but it can't last when you're in government."" It turns out that it didn't.

Some of the funniest out-of-office replies,"It's that time of year again. You send an email hoping to get something done and ping - it comes straight back to you with an out-of-office response. It's annoying because it means you have to email someone else, but also because it's a reminder that you're stuck in the office working while others are off having fun. For many people setting an out-of-office (OOO) response is a last-minute chore, the final obstacle standing between them and their holiday. But for some it has become a labour of love, a way to show off their sense of humour or tell everyone just how much fun they are having. Here are some of the best examples showing the potential of the humble out-of-office reply to become, well, something so much more. Sacha Romanovitch says she wants to encourage people to switch off Grant Thornton's chief executive Sacha Romanovitch's recent OOO read: ""I'm off with my family right now, back on 23 July. I'll be reading, diving and playing with my boys while they still want to play with me! ""My great team will be dealing with my emails while I'm off ensuring you get support from the right people to keep things moving."" Frankly it seems a bit smug. I'd like to spend time with my children too, but I'm stuck at work. But Ms Romanovitch - who is indeed out of the office so unable to speak to me in person - says via email that the point of her unusually detailed OOO is to let everyone know that it is ok to switch off. ""There is still so much that creates a sense of needing to work 24/7. ""My out-of-office is just one of those little things I do to signpost what I think should be the norm,"" she says. Of course, not everyone agrees. See more stories and videos like this Tyler BrÃ»lÃ©, the editor-in-chief of the magazine Monocle, declined to speak to me for this article. But he has writtenan entire column for The Financial Times,externalon why everyone, particularly those at the top, should say a big fat no to the OOO. He argues they are ""out of step with the ways of the modern world"" and suggests people who use them simply aren't committed enough. And if you thought the classic ""limited access to email"" was a good OOO excuse, Mr BrÃ»lÃ© says that unless you work ""200ft below the streets of New York repairing the sewers"" everyone will know you're telling fibs. Would you use your out-of-office to channel your inner Rick Astley? Such concerns haven't hindered Steven Nelson, a veteran writer of elaborate out-of-office responses. One of his most memorable OOOs was written in tune to eighties pop star Rick Astley's hit Never Gonna Give You Up. It went - you can sing along if you want - like this: ""Never gonna give you up, Never gonna let you down, Never gonna run around and desert you, Never gonna make you cry, Never gonna say goodbye, Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you. ""I'm also never gonna reply to your message until 9th August as I'm off on holiday."" Mr Nelson, from the financial services consultancy The Lang Cat, admits he's now cringing with embarrassment about his message, but it hasn't stopped him writing them. In fact, he's now in fierce competition with a fellow out-of-office joker at the firm to try to outwit one another. ""It's got to the point where I feel an inordinate amount of pressure to come up with one,"" he admits. His jokey response was prompted by an urge to counteract all the serious ""self-important"" OOOs he received, telling people who to contact if their enquiry was ""urgent"". ""We work in financial services. What could possibly be classed as urgent?"" he says. But not everyone gets to find out how funny he is, as his most humorous responses are set to reply to internal emails only. ""It's a really fine line, you don't want to make your organisation look like a fun factory,"" he says. Edwyn McFarlane, a business innovation director at Awin - a firm that helps websites make money from referrals - also isn't brave enough to send his OOO response externally. But he says for junior staff members, who deal with clients they know, a funny out-of-office can ""be a good marketing tool"". Mr McFarlane's OOO reads: ""I am on annual leave until dd/mm/yyyy. I will allow each sender one email and if you send me multiple emails, I will randomly delete your emails until there is only one remaining. Choose wisely. Please note that you have already sent me one email."" Disappointingly, he says it is definitely a joke and he never actually deletes any unread emails. 'I wish I'd never gone on reality TV' Kidnapped Helen the shark 'recovering' Seven-year-old New Zealand girl fixes sexist road sign Puddle splash van driver loses job Some firms, however, actively encourage it. In 2014,German car firm Daimlerset up an optional service for workers going on holiday to have all new emails automatically deleted. France has gone even further by givingstaff the legal right to ""disconnect""and avoid work emails outside working hours. Such moves aren't purely altruistic. Compulsive out-of-hours email checking and the inability to switch off has been blamed for everything from burnout to sleeplessness as well as relationship problems. In Volkswagen's case it said research showed that staff who switched off properly performed better in the longer term. Interestingly, recipients of such emails say they don't find them offensive, perhaps wishing they had been told to do the same. BBC journalist Bill Thompson says he admires ""the honesty"" of such OOOs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Barbara Pachter, the author of The Essentials of Business Etiquette, says an out-of-office response is often the first impression someone in your professional life gets of you. Her advice is to keep it simple, warning that joking around or ""giving too much personal information"" is liable to annoy many recipients. The perfect out-of-office, she says must: be clear and concise provide actionable information such as an alternative person to contact not have any mistakes such as an incorrect number or detail be removed once you're back at work Not everyone will be amused by funny out-of-office replies One plus of being a bit more daring in your OOO reply is that it can soften the miserable feeling of having to get back to work after a week or two of fun. Rob Gilroy, a copywriter, who initially wrote funny out-of-office answers to amuse himself, says he now looks forward to his return just to read the replies. His recent OOO read: ""ERROR 405: Could not reach copywriter. Soz. Haha! What a brilliantly geeky joke, that. But in all seriousness, if you're wanting something done, no can do. ""I'm out of the office from now (Tues 27th June) to until then (Friday 30th June). ""And if you're that Nigerian Prince, asking for more money, then no. Not until you've paid that Â£12,000 back into my account. ""Other than that? I'll bring any and all answers on my return. Peace out."" Mr Gilroy admits not everyone will get it: ""I imagine there's a healthy dose of people who find them twee or annoying."" That of course is the risk. But in terms of getting it wrong it's unlikely anything will rivalthe out-of-office that ended up on a road sign,externalbecause officials assumed the auto-reply was the Welsh translation that they had requested. As a result, a sign meant to bar lorries from a road near a supermarket instead read in Welsh: ""I am not in the office at the moment. Send any work to be translated."" An embarrassing error, but quite fun. And after all, if no-one wrote amusing OOOs then us poor people left stuck in the office over the summer would have even less fun.

Grandfather grows giant cucumber,"The beast grown by Raghbir Singh Sanghera could be an Armenian cucumber, one expert suggested A grandfather in Derby says praying to his cucumber has helped it grow to a potential world-record size. Raghbir Singh Sanghera, who worked as a farmer in India before coming to the UK in 1991, grew the 51in (129.54cm) ribbed vegetable in his greenhouse. Mr Sanghera said the cucumber - whose species has not yet been determined - continues to grow in girth and length. The currentGuinness World Record for the longest cucumber,external, which was grown in Wales in 2011, is 107cm (42.13in). Secrets of giant vegetable grower Peter Glazebrook Trying to grow the world's biggest cabbage Llanharry giant vegetable grower's 'armchair-sized cabbage' God's giant miracle carrots Peter Glazebrook, an expert in growing giant vegetables, says it appears to be an Armenian cucumber (Cucumis meloflexuosus), making it a muskmelon as opposed to a standard cucumber (Cucumis sativus), which is part of the gourd family. ""We have seen these presented before at giant veg shows only to be rejected,"" Mr Glazebrook said. ""However, it is a fine specimen of its type, and he has done well."" Only members of theCucumis sativusspecies can qualify for the Guinness World Record of longest cucumber. A spokesman for Guinness World Records said they have no current record for the longest Armenian cucumber, ""but anyone can apply to create a new title via our website"". The colossal cucumber - which may in fact be a variety of muskmelon - has now reached more than 51in (129.54cm) Mr Sanghera said he will take the vegetable to the Singh Sabha Gurdwara in Nottingham, where he volunteers, for everyone to share once it is ready to eat. ""It's still growing and will get thicker, then when it's ready we'll keep some seeds for next year,"" the 75-year-old said. ""You have to look after it like a child."" Mr Sanghera has a seat in his greenhouse where he prays Mr Sanghera said the unusually long vegetable was one of four he planted four months ago, but while the other three were eaten, one was left alone to grow. ""I have made a seat to sit next to it and where I can see it and watch it,"" he said. ""I pray that it grows, that it keeps us all healthy and that everybody stays well and happy - it makes me happy seeing it.""

Aniston 'fantasises' about Friends reboot,"Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow, pictured in 2003 Jennifer Aniston says she, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow have talked about a possible Friends reboot. In awide-ranging interview with InStyle,external, she added she ""fantasises"" about the show being brought back. ""Courteney, Lisa and I talk about it. I fantasise about it. It really was the greatest job I ever had,"" Aniston said. ""I don't know what it would look like today, but you never know. So many shows are being successfully rebooted."" (Shows to have been brought back recently include Will & Grace, Gilmore Girls, The X Files, Roseanne and Queer Eye... withBuffy on the way.) Friends ran for 10 years from from 1994 She pondered whether ""Lisa, Courteney, and I could reboot The Golden Girls and spend our last years together on wicker furniture"". (She's probably joking about this but we kind of hope she isn't.) Here are eight other things we learned from the interview: 1. ""First, with all due respect, I'm not heartbroken."" Earlier this year, Aniston announced she and Justin Theroux wereseparatingafter two years of marriage. ""The misconceptions are 'Jen can't keep a man', and 'Jen refuses to have a baby because she's selfish and committed to her career',"" Aniston told the magazine. ""Or that I'm sad and heartbroken. First, with all due respect, I'm not heartbroken. And second, those are reckless assumptions. ""They don't know what I've been through medically or emotionally."" 2. Women who don't have children are considered ""damaged goods"", she says Aniston pictured at her Hollywood Walk of Fame induction ceremony last year Since leaving Friends, Aniston has gone on to have a successful movie career - arguably the only former star of the series to do so. Her big-screen hits include We're The Millers, Horrible Bosses, The Break-Up and Marley & Me. But the 49-year-old has been followed by headlines along the way, suggesting she has prioritised her career over starting a family. ""There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they're deemed damaged goods,"" Aniston said. ""Maybe my purpose on this planet isn't to procreate. Maybe I have other things I'm supposed to do?"" 3. Media headlines about her life have become ""more and more absurd"". It's not just media stories about motherhood and her love life Aniston has struggled to escape over the years. ""For the most part I can sit back and laugh at the ridiculous headlines because they have gotten more and more absurd,"" she said. Later in the interview, McNearney asks Jen what the biggest misconception is about her, so the actress hits Google. ""Oh, look, I'm having a $100,000 revenge makeover!"" 4. Jen would struggle in a beauty pageant. Not because she's not good looking enough or anything, but because of the talents you have to perform. ""My talents are not baton twirling or Hula-Hooping or tap dancing or ventriloquism or yodeling. ""I would be eliminated right away. Out. No talent."" 5. She has zero time for double standards in the media. ""When a couple breaks up in Hollywood, it's the woman who is scorned. The woman is left sad and alone. She's the failure. F that."" 6. Fear of flying is the main thing she wishes she could overcome. ""It started in my 20s. It was a weird, scary flight,"" Aniston explained. ""Afterward I started noticing the stories on the news about plane crashes... So, yeah, that's something I'd like to get rid of. It's so irrational."" 7. She may have (secretly) checked out your Instagram account. The actress confirmed she doesn't have social media accounts, but added she's can be a ""creeper"" on Instagram. ""There are times when I'll look through and think, 'Oh my god, what a time suck!'"" She also added her name to the growing number of celebrities who are social media-sceptic, adding that such platforms are ""fueling narcissism"". 8. Women should be hired on merit, not just for the sake of it. Aniston's latest movie Dumplin' is written, produced, and directed primarily by women, with female lead characters. Praising the ""extraordinary"" team, she argued that women should not be hired for the sake of industry box-ticking, but on merit. ""We shouldn't be shoving female directors and producers down each other's throats because we have to. Then we're making those decisions from a place of fear.""

Love Island: 10 best moments,"L to R: Hayley, Megan, Charlie, Georgia (with Jack Fowler) and Alex The bikinis have been packed away, the personalised water bottles have been slurped from for the last time, and Dr Alex's sunburn may soon finally show some signs of abating. Jack and Dani have been crownedthe Love Island 2018 series winners and are set to walk off happily ever after into the Balearic sunset (after it's been Instagrammed first, obvs), with their Â£50,000 spoils and dignity intact. Love Island in seven charts How will contestants cash in? As the sun goes down on this year's Love Island, we look back at the series' defining moments. Well, someone needs to think of the trees A major political summit took place earlier this summer, featuring heavily in the news. There has been plenty of reporting on who's in, who's out and what aspects of trade and travel will be affected. No, not Theresa May's Chequers meeting, but the Love Island girls chatting Brexit. An early series highlight came when Hayley Hughes admitted she ""didn't have a clue"" what Brexit was. Trying to explain, Georgia says: ""Welfare, and like things we trade with would be cut down."" Confused perhaps by the cutting down comment, Hayley responds: ""So does that mean we won't have any trees?"" ""Cheese?"" says Samira, adding to the general farce of the conversation. ""Why wouldn't we have trees?"" chimes in Dani. Things finally take a serious turn for Hayley when it's mooted that it may become more difficult for Brits to travel abroad. ""So it would be harder to go on holidays?"" says Hayley. ""Oh, I love my holidays!"" This Brexit thingy is serious stuff indeed. Rosie splitting up with Adam provided the show's first major drama One of the first truly explosive scenes came when Rosie Williams confronted Adam Collard over the way he had treated her following the arrival of newcomer Zara McDermott. After spending 10 days coupled up, Rosie told Adam he had ""hurt her"" and broken her heart, after ignoring her all day. Adam denied he'd done anything wrong and generally looked smug during the whole conversation. Cue Adam becoming public enemy number one - even prompting charityWomen's Aid to issue a warningabout his emotional abuse and gaslighting behaviour towards both Rosie and Kendall. Georgia Steel and Jack Fowler shared a brief kiss after a date If you didn't know after the (approximate) 2,643 times she mentioned it, Georgia is loyal. Babe. She even mentioned it four times back-to-back, so it must be true. Speaking - as she's cracking on with Idris - she says: ""Obviously I am very loyal. I'm a very loyal girl. Very loyal. And when I am with someone, I am completely loyal unless I am honest with them, tell them how I feel, then I crack on."" Got it? Even during one of the other biggest moments of the series, when she may or may not have planted THAT KISS on Jack Fowler, she was - of course - still loyal. And that cheeky little peck went on to cause more trouble than it could possibly have been worth. Laura broke up with Jack (for not being loyal); Georgia and Laura fell out (over Laura questioning G's loyalty); and Ellie and Georgia had a bitter kitchen exchange (with Ellie claiming Georgia was, in fact, NOT loyal. Gasp!) In the words of Dua Lipa: One kiss is all it takes. Ofcom received more than 2,600 complaints over the video shown to Dani Dyer One of the biggest - and most complained about - must-see moments on television this year was the moment Dani saw footage of boyfriend Jack in Casa Amor with his ex Ellie. Dyer burst into tears at the video and took to the Love Island beach hut to share her agony. ""I just knew it was too good to be true,"" she sobbed. But the scenessparked more than 2,600 complaintsto Ofcom, as many thought the video Dyer was shown was misleading. In reality, Jack had also taken his bedding outside into the garden because he refused to share a bed with another girl, and told Adam he was in love with Dyer - but these excerpts had not been shown to her. Safe to say, they were happily reunited and it all turned out right in the end. Megan played with fire when she entreated Wes to kiss her while he was still coupled up with Laura. In so doing, all manner of rules from the girl code could be heard smashing. To his credit, Wes didn't cheat on Laura, but told her he'd be ""getting to know Megan a whole lot more"" following the conversation. Understandably, Laura and Meg never really saw eye to eye afterwards. Love Island winners revealed Your Love Island questions answered Jack proved to be a master of impersonations In a scene that could have come straight from Emmerdale, the boys offered some light relief from all the drama when, out of nowhere, they allpretended to be from Yorkshire,externalfor a whole conversation. A sign of cabin fever perhaps, but it had us in hysterics. Likewise, Jack proved he was a dab hand at doing impressions of his fellow Islanders - with his and Dani's take-off of Eyal a real highlight. Allow Twitter content?

Hitherto unlucky-in-love Samira finally found her Prince Charming in Frankie, but was left bereft when he was voted off the show. She told her fellow Islanders: ""So, these past couple of days I haven't been myself and I've struggled to be happy in here and have fun and I had a taste of what I've wanted and it's gone."" So off she skipped out of the villa's front door in a tiny fuchsia bikini with her enormous suitcase. Wonder what airport security made of her outfit? Allow Twitter content?

There was a lot of asking to be each other's significant others in the series. But the hands down most inventive example goes to Charlie Brake, who pulled off a master plan in cahoots with Wes, Jack Fincham and Alex. Operation Chellie involved derring-do in the guise of covert use of a lipstick, strategic spillage of red wine and copious usage of the word ""muggy"". One ""I've never been so shocked in my life"" and a ""yes"" later from Ellie and they had all jumped in the pool. Romeo done.

When tasked with the baby challenge, Dr Alex showed he wasn't quite cut out for fatherhood yet. During the task, in which the Islanders were given a baby doll to care for, the A&E doctor catapulted himself and his baby onto the floor during an impromptu buggy race with Jack Fincham. It left the 27-year old sprawling and the baby with (presumably) multiple serious injuries. Meanwhile, Josh proved to be the worst dad ever after pulling his baby's arm off. Fatherhood should definitely be put off a few years for this lot. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Are heatwaves 'un-British'?,"How does Britain, known around the world for its famous grey skies and rain, react to a lengthy heatwave? ""Hallelujah,"" someone shouted, as a small boy ran into the street and started to dance. After weeks of hot, dry weather, it had begun to rain and in my London neighbourhood last week, the plump droplets splashing on to the pavement dust were a cause for celebration. People walked through the storm, getting soaked to the skin, with shiny faces upturned. The country, it seemed, had been holding its breath waiting for this moment, and now it could breathe again. We grumble about our rainy weather, but this summer has reminded us how much we value it. The strange scenes took me back to 1976, when after weeks of boiling weather and amid warnings of water rationing, the Prime Minister James Callaghan instructed one of his ministers, Denis Howell, to do a rain dance. When the heavens did indeed open the next day, the nation rejoiced. Denis Howell, appointed minister for drought in 1976, later served as minister for snow Euphoria, however, was short-lived. Less than a week later, the minister of state for drought had his title changed to minister of state for floods. Two years later, it changed again - Howell became minister of state for snow. I don't know whether No 10 had a word with Sam Gyimah, the minister with current responsibility for the Met Office, but in the days before the storm, many had taken to social media to suggest a bit of ministerial rain dancing was required. The heatwave is, well, it's just not British. Day after day after day of the same blue skies is foreign to us. Our climate is benign and our weather is changeable. The default is grey, a neutral backdrop against which the excitement of a sunny spell or squally shower is all the greater. We are famous for our greyness. In AD 94, the Roman historian Tacitus described Britain as a country where ""the sky is overcast with continual rain and cloud"". Two thousand years later and the American travel writer Bill Bryson made the same point: ""Sometimes it rained, but mostly it was just dull, a land without shadows. It was like living inside Tupperware."" Throughout history, Britain has been noted for its grey skies The cobwebs and dust of interminable sultriness, daily life which seems ever slower, it all feels alien to the British. It is often said thatour reserved national characteris shaped by our temperate climate. But is that true? Are we the product of our weather? How does the 2018 heatwave compare to that of 1976? Storms sweep in as temperatures cool Climate change driven by humans made heatwave 'twice as likely' In about 7 AD, the Greek historian and geographer Strabo hinted at an association between his assessments of the British climate (rain and fog) and the British temperament (simple and barbaric). The suggestion was that the damp, gloomy climate had incubated an uncivilised, backward race. In 1733, the doctor and writer John Arbuthnot came to the reverse conclusion. He suggested variations in atmospheric pressure found in cold northern climes resulted in ""greater activity and courage"" compared with people in hot countries who, ""free from the agitations and sensations of northern people"", were ""lazy and indolent"". The Mediterranean is renowned for its sun, scenery and food. But are its people happier than those in gloomier places? David Hume was unconvinced. The Scots philosopher responded to these ideas in a controversial essay entitled Of National Characters. In this, he argued that the only observable difference ""is the vulgar one, that people in the northern regions have a greater inclination to strong liquors, and those in the southern to love and women"". Even this association was ""doubtful"", Hume felt. During the last few decades a significant amount of research has been conducted into the relationship between mood and climate. Do high temperatures make people passionate? Does precipitation dampen enthusiasm? Are people happier in summer than in winter? Analysis in the '70s and '80s looking at the performance of students in America and Switzerland (by Howard & Hoffman [1984], Sanders & Brizzolara [1982] and Faust et al. [1974]) variously suggested that high pressure, high temperature and low humidity were associated with positive emotions: basically, nice weather seemed to put people in a good mood. More recent researchsuggests the link is close to non-existent,external. Even the wettest conditions fail to dampen the enjoyment of festival-goers like this couple Some in Britain instinctively believe that if they lived in a warm, sunny environment instead of enduring waves of Atlantic cloud and rain, everyone would be a lot happier. The idea that a warm, sunny climate makes us cheerier doesn't hold up. The happiest region in the UK, according to data from the ONS Wellbeing survey, is the most northerly:Shetland, Orkney and the Outer Hebrides,external. Some islands here see only around 1,000 hours of sunshine a year compared with a UK average of 1,340 hours. Andinternational lists of the happiest countriestend to find places like Norway, Sweden, Canada, Denmark and Finland at the top. There is no correlation between well-being and sunshine - if anything it looks like the opposite. Finland's people are among the happiest on earth And yet. And yet. And yet. Immediately following last week's thunderstorm, when a watery sun sparkled on puddles through clean, fresh air, colours brighter and senses somehow keener, those moments were profoundly exhilarating. Don't tell me that is not real. It is not the heat of this summer that is un-British. Already, I have heard familiar moans about the cooler cloudy weather and nostalgia for the summer sizzle. No, it is the invariability. When we pull back the curtains at the start of a new day, we need to be kept guessing at what we might see. That is the British way.

Phone etiquette: How not to lose friends,"They're the first thing many of us look at in the morning and the last thing at night. Our phones are never far from our side and we're checking them every 12 minutes,according to Ofcom. It's a love affair that looks set to last so we've come up with five rules of phone use worth observing - from no phones at dinnertime to turning it off at the checkout. An absolute no-no for most (81%) of us - yet half of us have been with others who've done it. And more than a quarter (26%) of young adults admit to it. ""They should always be off and out of sight during meals, meetings and parties,"" insists Diana Mather, of The English Manner consultancy. ""The person you're with is the person who's the most important. None of us is indispensable."" And, if you need proof of what it can do for relationships, Gareth Southgate's boys - hailed for their team ethos - put their phones to one side during team meals and unexpectedly made it to the World Cup semi-finals. A coincidence? Well, maybe. No phones at the table for England But even looking at the screen at the dinner table is not on - for some. More than four in five people aged 55 and over think it's unacceptable to check notifications, compared with around half (46%) of 18 to 34-year-olds. Read more about the UK's phone use That tinny drone from the top deck of the bus screeching out of a mobile speaker - it's known as sodcasting. And it applies to watching videos and playing video games loudly, as well as listening to music. Three-quarters (76%) of us object to it - but it doesn't stop us doing it. Allow Twitter content?

You're at the till but on the phone mid-conversation. Do you hang up, say a polite ""hello"" and graciously pack away your bread and clementines - or chat on regardless? It's a source of frustration for many a shop worker, receptionist and waiter. One Sainsbury's checkout worker was so incensed when a customer refused to end her call that she refused to serve her.The supermarket apologised. This video can not be played When should you hang up your phone? ""Texting and talking is so rude,"" says manners expert Diana Mather. ""We're still animals - the pheromones, the charisma, the aura - if we're not concentrating on each other, we're wasting a huge opportunity to get to know each other better."" John McDonnell's colleagues might have missed out on getting to know the shadow chancellor a little better during this Commons session. He had something to say on the 2016 Autumn Statement - but not all his colleagues were catching those pheromones. Is it wrong for MPs to use mobiles in the Commons? They've got their head down, eyes peeled to the screen - and they're right in your path. Internally you're screaming Look up! Look up! But no - it's the pavement slalom again - dodging in and out of pedestrians in the phone zone. And Twitter user @tiredhorizon has a public warning for them. Put away your phones in public buildings, hospitals and near reversing lorries. He describes having to push huge bins around them and has seen them get in the way of porters pushing patients in hospital beds. Not good. Allow Twitter content?

Disinvited - the bridesmaids no longer needed,"Allergies, a lost job and a 10 hour drive - reasons bridesmaids received for losing the role An American woman hasspoken of her dismay,externalafter being sacked from her role as bridesmaid. Courtney Duffy,external's now-deleted tweet has met with a mixed response online. Other jilted bridesmaids have been prompted to share their own experiences of being demoted - or even disinvited - from weddings. One maid of honour told the BBC it was a ""pretty awful way to lose a friend"". Whilst another described the experience as ""super awkward"". Tori Holder, in Georgia, US, told the BBC she was asked to step down from her role as bridesmaid, but was still asked to hold open barn doors for the bride during the ceremony. Ms Holder said she met up with the bride to exchange Christmas gifts, about a year before the wedding. Tori Holder described the dress she was asked to wear as ""similar to the 12-year-old flower girl's"" She said she was informed that, because the groom's party had been reduced by at least two groomsmen, she would no no longer be needed as a bridesmaid.

""She knew I wouldn't be able to join in a good number of bridal activities."" Ms Holder said the bride gave her a different dress to wear. Allow Twitter content?
