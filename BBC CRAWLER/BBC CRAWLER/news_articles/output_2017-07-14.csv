Vogue sorry over Zayn and Gigi shoot,"Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid in the US Vogue photoshoot US Vogue has apologised for ""missing the mark"" by saying Zayn Malik and his girlfriend Gigi Hadid were ""embracing gender fluidity"". In an interview, the former One Directioner and the US model talked about borrowing each other's clothes. They were photographed in colourful, fairly androgynous clothes. But readers mocked the magazine for its definition of the phrase, pointing out that what you wear does not make you ""gender fluid"". Many on social media pointed out that the term refers to people with a particular transgender identity, who do not conform to societal expectations of male or female or identify as either. For instance Jacob Tobia wrote in Cosmopolitan,external: ""If you're going to talk about a marginalised community, talk to that community. ""Unlike how this new Vogue cover shoot presents it, the lived experience of being gender-nonconforming is rarely that fun and glamorous."" Vogue describes a conversation between the pair, with Hadid telling Malik: ""I shop in your closet all the time, don't I?"". The 24-year-old singer then replies that he borrowed an Anna Sui T-shirt from her, adding: ""I like that shirt. And if it's tight on me, so what? It doesn't matter if it was made for a girl."" Hadid, 22, agrees, saying: ""Totally. It's not about gender. It's about, like, shapes. And what feels good on you that day. ""And anyway, it's fun to experiment."" Vogue writer Maya Singer comments in the piece, in US Vogue's August issue, that for many young people ""gender is a more or less arbitrary distraction"" and that there is ""a terrific opportunity for play"". She says ""this new blase attitude toward gender codes marks a radical break"", adding: ""For these millennials, at least, descriptives like boy or girl rank pretty low on the list of important qualities - and the way they dress reflects that."" But poet Tyler Ford, who's quoted in the accompanying article exploring gender norms,tweeted,external(with an eyeroll emoji): ""The only mention of the word 'trans' is by me via interview."" Journalist and author Hannah Orenstein said she would have preferred Tyler to have been profiled instead of Hadid and Malik,tweeting,external: ""Zayn and Gigi are profiled in this piece on gender fluidity because... they borrow each other's clothes sometimes?"" Another reader noted on Twitter: ""Y'all notice Zayn isn't out here wearing dresses."" And Colette Fahywrote,external: ""All Z & G say is that they borrow each other's clothes. Such a big jump for the mag to declare gender fluidity."" In a statement issued on Friday, a Vogue spokeswoman said: ""The story was intended to highlight the impact the gender-fluid, non-binary communities have had on fashion and culture. ""We are very sorry the story did not correctly reflect that spirit - we missed the mark. ""We do look forward to continuing the conversation with greater sensitivity.""

Teens held over moped acid attack spree,"This video can not be played ""My helmet saved me,"" says London acid attack victim Jabed Hussain Two teenagers have been arrested after acid was thrown in people's faces in five attacks over one night in London. Two moped riders attacked people in a 90-minute spree in Islington, Stoke Newington and Hackney on Thursday, stealing mopeds in two of the attacks. An eyewitness said he heard a victim, who he believed was a delivery driver, ""screaming in pain"". One victim suffered ""life-changing injuries"". Police are looking at whether moped theft was the motive for the attacks. Officers said they were linking the attacks and boys aged 15 and 16 have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and causing grievous bodily harm. Delivery services Deliveroo and UberEATS have confirmed two of the victims were couriers working for the firms. The attacks happened amid rising concern about the number of assaults involving corrosive substances in London. Why are acid attacks on the rise? How to treat a chemical burn Since 2010,there have been more than 1,800 reports of attacks involving corrosive fluids in the capital. Last year, it was used in 458 crimes, compared to 261 in 2015, according to Met Police figures. Hackney resident Jon Moody said he was watching TV when he heard screaming and ran to the window. This video can not be played Footage posted by Turon Miah shows an acid attack victim being doused with water ""I heard a high-pitched scream but thought it was the boys playing football... I heard more shouting and ran to my window,"" he said. ""I could see a man in serious distress, he was screaming in pain. ""There were only two police officers with the victim, they took out two large water canisters and poured it over him."" He said he believed the victim was a delivery driver and about 20 fellow delivery drivers turned up at the scene. Emergency services and delivery drivers came to the aid of an acid attack victim in Queensbridge Road, Hackney The Hackney Gazette last week reported,externalmany delivery drivers are refusing to work in some areas after 21:30 BST because of robbery fears. Takeaway delivery firm Deliveroo emailed drivers saying it was working with the Met Police and urged its staff to report any information about the attacks. The email said the firm was ""truly shocked"" about what had happened. The assaults happened amid increasing concern about the sharp rise in acid attacks in London. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said the growing trend of victims being doused with corrosive liquids was concerning. Ms Dick told LBC Thursday night's attacks were ""completely barbaric"". ""The acid can cause horrendous injuries,"" she said. ""The ones last night involved a series of robberies we believe are linked - I am glad to see we have arrested somebody."" A Met spokesman said one line of inquiry detectives would be pursuing was whether the attackers were targeting moped riders to steal their bikes. The 16-year-old boy was arrested in Kingsbury Road, north-west London, early on Friday, while the 15-year-old was arrested in Stoke Newington several hours later. The attacks began at 22:25 BST on Thursday in Hackney Road. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour MP for East Ham Stephen Timmshas tabled an adjournment debate for Monday in the House of Commons,externalon the rise in the number of acid attacks. About a third of last year's acid attacks in the capital took place in the London borough of Newham, which is in his constituency. Mr Timms told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""most concerned about sulphuric acid"" and that carrying a bottle without justification should be treated as an offence, like carrying a knife. ""We could certainly come up with arrangements that would allow people to use sulphuric acid in the normal way, perhaps with the benefit of a licence. ""But simply walking around the street with a bottle of sulphuric acid, that should be an offence,"" he said. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister viewed acid attacks as ""horrific"". ""We are working with the police to see what more we could do. The prime minister's view is that the use of acid in this way is horrific."" Home Office minister Sarah Newton told BBC Radio 5 live Breakfast the government was considering tighter controls on some chemicals in response to the acid attacks in East London and elsewhere. But she said regulation would be difficult, as ""these chemicals are under everyone's kitchen sinks"". She said it was clear acid was being used ""as a weapon"" and work had been commissioned ""to understand the motivation"" of people who use it to injure others. She also said the government was examining sentencing for those who use acid to injure people. This video can not be played What should you do in case of a chemical burn?

Why are acid attacks on the rise?,"Resham Khan was left with burns on her face, arms, legs and shoulder after having acid thrown at her The latest acid attacks in north-east London on Thursday, which saw five people being sprayed with a corrosive liquid, add to a growing number of cases being reported in the UK. Last month cousins Resham Khan and Jameel Muhktar were left with life-changing injuries aftera corrosive liquid was thrown at them through a car window. And in Aprilclubbers in east Londonwere caught up in an attack involving acid, which left 20 people injured. Assaults involving corrosive substances have more than doubled in England since 2012, police figures show. The vast majority of cases were in London. It is legal to purchase strong acid but there have been growing calls for regulations to be tightened in the wake of recent incidents. The National Police Chiefs Council lead for corrosive attacks, Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Kearton, told theBBC Asian Networkthat reported acid attacks had seen a significant rise in percentage terms, but that compared with knife crime the number of incidents were ""tiny"". Imran Khan suffered facial injuries after being attacked while delivering food in east London Takeaway restaurant owner Imran Khan was attacked while out delivering food in Barking, east London, in November. He was confronted by a group of youths who demanded money and food while hurling racist abuse at him. When he got back into his vehicle they squirted a corrosive liquid in his face. Mr Khan says the pain ""overtook everything"" and he feared he would be left completely blind. He was saved from long-term damage by a quick thinking shopkeeper who washed his face with clean water at the scene of the attack. He says the attack affected him ""big time"" leaving him feeling unsafe in public, especially after dark. Metropolitan Police figuresobtained by the BBCshow men are twice as likely to be victims of acid attacks in London than women after being linked to a number of gang crimes. The vast majority of cases never reach trial. Dr Simon Harding, a criminologist and expert on gangs at Middlesex University, says acid is becoming ""a weapon of first choice"". ""Acid throwing is a way of showing dominance, power and control, building enormous fear among gang peer groups,"" he says. Gang members know there are advantages in using acid to hurt someone rather than a knife because ""the charges are more serious if you are caught with a knife and the tariff for prison sentences are much higher"". Dr Harding added that ""acid is likely to attract a 'GBH  with intent' charge while using a knife is more likely to lead to the attacker being charged with attempted murder"" ""There's no specific offence of throwing acid. It's a harder offence to prove because there is rarely any DNA evidence and its much easier to dispose of a plastic bottle than it is a knife."" Dr Harding says the government needs to attack the problem on three fronts. He says acid is too easily available, sentencing needs to be brought into line with knife crime and a programme of education is required. ""Gang members do respond when they realise a victim of an acid attack may never work again or may need 15 or 20 plastic surgery operations."" Isobella Fraser was caught up in the acid attack at a London nightclub in April and was treated for injuries to her back and arms ""This is a horrendous crime, it maims, it disfigures,"" ACC Kearton explains. ""What particularly disgusts me about this crime is that it's premeditated, no-one carries acid around on the streets for any other reason than using it for this reason. ""The intention behind this is for someone to live with this for the rest of their lives. ""That is lasting physical and emotional damage, its sometimes why some people choose this as a form of attack."" Asked what can be done to stop it she says: ""To have an acid in a different bottle to the one it was purchased in can be an offence, we can also regulate volumes of sale, we can regulate ages at which people can buy it."" Jaf Shah, from the London charityAcid Survivors Trust International,externalsays the phenomenon isn't new and dates back to the Victorian times in Britain, but says the recent figures are shocking. ""The recent spike in attacks means the UK has the highest number of reported acid attacks per capita in the world."" He is among those calling for regulations on the sale of acid to be tightened. This video can not be played What should you do in case of a chemical burn? There are no age restrictions on buying household bleach or drain cleaning products containing acid in the UK. There are rules which limit the sale of certain substances under theexplosives precursors and poisons (EPP) rules,externalaimed at businesses who sell or supply such chemicals in bulk. The Met said it was working with retailers to raise awareness that people might be buying corrosive substances to use as weapons. But Jaf Shah wants the government to make it compulsory when purchasing corrosive chemicals to pay by card that is traceable to an individual and to make acid available only under licence. Labour MP for East Ham Stephen Timmshas tabled an adjournment debate for Monday in the House of Commons,externalon the rise in the number of acid attacks. About a third of last year's acid attacks in the capital took place in the London borough of Newham, which is in his constituency.

New Doctor Who actor to be revealed,"This video can not be played Itâs almost time to meet the Thirteenth Doctor The wait is nearly over for Doctor Who fans, as the identity of the 13th Doctor is due to be revealed later. There is speculation the Time Lord could be a woman for the first time. A trailer featuring the number 13 in different locations,externalaired on Friday, finishing with the words: ""Meet the 13th Doctor after the Wimbledon men's final, Sunday 16th July."" The actor will succeed Peter Capaldi, who took the role in 2013 and leaves in the 2017 Christmas special. Capaldiannounced he was leavingduring an interview with BBC Radio 2 presenter Jo Whiley in January. All the Doctors, from Hartnell to Capaldi Peter Capaldi will bow out in this year's Christmas special, featuring David Bradley as the First Doctor The Glasgow-born star said: ""I feel it's time to move on. I feel sad, I love Doctor Who, it is a fantastic programme to work on."" The announcement about the 13th Doctor will come directly after the final -between Roger Federer and Marin Cilic- comes to an end. David Tennant, the 10th Doctor, is among the audience watching at Centre Court. Phoebe Waller-Bridge has denied involvement in the sci-fi show Phoebe Waller-Bridge - the star of hit comedy Fleabag - is among the favourites tipped to become the first female Doctor. Former companion Billie Piper told the BBC it would ""feel like a snub"" if the role went to another man - but would Phoebe be able to squeeze the Tardis in around adventures on the Millennium Falcon? The 32-year-old actress recently started filming the new Star Wars Han Solo movie. Jodie Whittaker found fame in the hit ITV drama Broadchurch The bookies seem confident the role will go to one of the stars of ITV's Broadchurch - even if it isn't Phoebe, who starred in the show's second series as barrister Abby Thompson. Both Jodie Whittaker and Olivia Colman have been the subject of much speculation, especially as incoming show boss Chris Chibnall was the creator of Broadchurch. David Tennant - otherwise known as the 10th Doctor and Colman's Broadchurch co-star - told the BBC he thought Colman would be ""great"" in the role, but added: ""Whether that's in her sights at the moment, I suspect probably not."" Olivia Colman won a golden globe for her role in The Night Manager Former Death in Paradise actor Kris Marshall, Sherlock's Andrew Scott and Ben Whishaw - who plays Q in the James Bond films - alsomake the list of contenders, should bosses go for a more traditional casting. Read more about the runners and riders Pearl Mackie, who plays current companion Bill Potts, posted a picture of herself with a pink Tardis at Lovebox festival on Sunday, with the message: ""Wonder who is inside..?!"". Some of those whose names have been linked to the role posted tongue-in-cheek tweets as speculation mounted over the identity of the Doctor. The locations in the latest trailer included 10 Downing Street, Beachy Head cliffs and the Statue of Liberty. The popular sci-fi series features a Time Lord, known only as the Doctor, who travels through time and space in the Tardis, which resembles a 1960s police telephone box. The main character has the ability to regenerate, a quirk that has allowed a number of actors to have played the role over the years. The series was first broadcast in 1963. It underwent a relaunch in 2005, with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor. Sophie Aldred, who played Doctor Who's companion Ace in the 1980s, said: ""I've been lucky enough to meet most of the Doctors and they've all been amazing people. Slightly eccentric in some way... very talented actors. ""They just have to be a person who (has) really got something different about them."" Capaldi, who replaced Matt Smith as the Doctor, was previously best known for his role as foul-mouthed spin-doctor Malcolm Tucker in the BBC series The Thick of It.

"Turkey dismisses 7,000 in fresh purge","Turkey has seen mass arrests and dismissals in the public sector since the 2016 coup attempt Turkey has dismissed more than 7,000 police, ministry staff and academics, ahead of the first anniversary of an attempted coup. It comes as part of a major purge of state institutions, including the judiciary, police and education, in response to last year's unrest. On Saturday, Turkey marks one year since rogue soldiers bombed buildings and opened fire on civilians. More than 250 people were killed in the violence. The Turkish authorities accuse a movement loyal to the Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, of organising the July 2016 plot to bring down President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr Gulen, who remains in the United States, denies any involvement. Washington has so far resisted calls from the Turkish authorities to extradite the cleric. Turkey's trauma after night of the tanks A brief guide to Turkey's coup The latest dismissals came in a decree from 5 June but only published by the official government Gazette on Friday. It says the employees are people ""who it's been determined have been acting against the security of the state or are members of a terrorist organisation"". Among those listed were 2,303 police officers and 302 university academics. Another 342 retired officers and soldiers were stripped of their ranks and grades, Reuters reports. This video can not be played BBC speaks to man run over by tanks during the attempted coup Turkey has already dismissed more than 150,000 officials since the coup attempt, and arrested another 50,000 from the military, police and other sectors. The government says the measures are necessary given the security threats it faces but critics say Mr Erdogan is using the purges to stifle political dissent. The human impact of Turkey's purges The officers who cannot go home Istanbul is awash with giant anniversary billboards and posters showing people confronting pro-coup soldiers. Huge rallies are due to take place, with President Erdogan, who avoided capture last year, addressing parliament at the exact time that it was bombed. He and his supporters see the defeat of the coup as Turkey's rebirth, but for others it's less triumphant, says the BBC's Mark Lowen.

Dad delivers baby on dual carriageway,"Chloe was born on Collector Road in Birmingham A dad delivered his baby daughter in the car after his partner's waters broke on a Birmingham dual carriageway. Steven Sandford, who says he is squeamish, had no option when it became clear they would not reach the hospital in time. Daughter Chloe was safely delivered five minutes before paramedics arrived at Collector Road, with an operator giving instructions over the phone. The couple's other daughter was also in the car during the birth. See more stories from Birmingham and the Black Country here The couple thought they had plenty of time when Ms Winters' contractions started Mr Sandford, 45, and his partner Joanne Winters, 39, were driving from their Chelmsley Wood home on 27 June when they had to pull over. He said: ""It was six in the morning and my partner Joanne was having pains every 10 minutes so I thought I'd take my time. ""Next thing you know it's every four minutes then three minutes. The nurse on the phone said 'You need to get to Good Hope Hospital straight away'. ""Her waters broke in the car so I was panicking; I put my foot down a bit."" ""I don't know how I delivered a baby,"" Mr Sandford said Mr Sandford added: ""The nurse said you need to pull over, because Jo was screaming at this point in the car. ""I pulled over and then the woman said you need to check if you can see the baby's head. I could see some hair so I started to panic and sweat. ""I said 'give it one big push Jo' and she pushed and the baby came out in my hands. ""I had tears in my eyes, I couldn't speak."" The couple's other daughter Charlotte was in the back seat when Ms Winters gave birth The couple's other daughter, 16-month-old Charlotte, was in the back seat throughout the dramatic birth. Mr Sandford said: ""She sat in the back of the car- we were going to take her to my mom's but the plan went out the window.  It all happened within minutes.""

Grenfell exposes differences in fire response,"Most UK fire services would have automatically sent a high ladder to Grenfell Tower had the fire happened in their area, BBC Newsnight can reveal. ANewsnight investigation last weekrevealed the London Fire Brigade failed to dispatch a high ""aerial"" ladder immediately to the west London blaze. But 31 of the 44 UK fire services with high-rise blocks would have sent a high ladder, the programme has learned. The Home Office said it was up to each fire authority to manage its resources. Last week's investigation found that a high ladder had not been included in the London Fire Brigade's ""predetermined attendance"" plan and it took more than 30 minutes for such an appliance to arrive at the 24-storey west London tower. The London Fire Brigade is one of several services which has changed its procedures since Grenfell and will now automatically send high ladders to tower block fires as an interim measure. Newsnight's latest findings came after the programme requested the predetermined attendance plans - or PDAs - for high rise fires from every fire service in the country. The PDAs detail what each service will do automatically in the moments after a fire is reported. They show that 70% of the fire services in the UK which have high-rise blocks in their regions would automatically have dispatched a high ladder to a tower blaze before the Grenfell disaster. Since then, four services, including London, have altered their plans. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map However, Newsnight's research reveals that nine brigades still would not immediately send an aerial ladder to a tower blaze. The investigation also shows significant variations in the number of response vehicles dispatched by services across the country. In Kent, three fire engines would be sent to a reported fire in a tower block, with no high ladder. Fire services in Hampshire and Surrey - for the same fire in the same tower - would send six fire engines and a high ladder as first response. A fire engine is expected to carry five firefighters. Manchester, Humberside, London and Warwickshire have all increased their PDA with fires in tall buildings to include a high ladder since Grenfell. But Leicestershire, Lancashire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands, Kent and Essex fire services will still not automatically send a tall ladder to a fire in a high-rise building unless specifically requested. The figures have led to calls for the government to implement mandatory minimum requirements for fire services attending high-rise fires. Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack told Newsnight: ""It was absolutely indefensible before Grenfell Tower to have such a postcode lottery of how we respond to fires in residential blocks of flats. After Grenfell Tower it's completely outrageous."" This video can not be played Why did it take so long to get an aerial platform to the tower block? BBC Newsnight investigates Referring to the Grenfell Tower disaster, he added: ""An aerial appliance applying large quantities of water to the outside of the building could have made a big difference. It clearly did make a difference when it arrived."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""It is the responsibility of each fire and rescue authority to manage their resources across prevention, protection and operational response to meet local risk."" ""Local areas consider risk through their Integrated Risk Management Plan and over the past 10 years there has been a 52% decrease in the total number of fires attended by fire and rescue services."" Newsnight requested PDAs for tower block fires from all 52 fire services in the UK. Every service responded and all bar one sent details to the BBC. Seven brigades have no high rise tower blocks in their area. Last week, a London Fire Brigade spokesmantold Newsnight: ""It is important to understand that fires in high-rise buildings are nearly always dealt with internally, not usually needing an aerial appliance. ""The fundamental issue of high rise safety remains that buildings are maintained to stop fires spreading."" The spokesman said: ""An 'interim' change to pre-determined attendance for high rise buildings was introduced in direct response to the government's action to address concerns of cladding on buildings. ""The brigade's pre-determined attendance to high-rise buildings had already been increased in June 2015 from three fire engines to four as part of our ongoing review of high rise firefighting.""

Abuse probe chair's pay deal broke rules,"Professor Jay was a panel member before being named chair The Home Office has been fined Â£366,900 for breaching the government's senior salary pay cap when it appointed the head of a child sex abuse inquiry. It was penalised by the Treasury for failing to get clearance in advance before agreeing to pay Professor Alexis Jay Â£185,000 a year. Since 2010, all jobs with salaries of more than Â£142,500 agreed by ministers have had to be signed off in advance. The Home Office said it had reviewed procedures to avoid future breaches. Prof Jay became the fourth chair of the troubled inquiry after replacing Lowell Goddard in August 2016. The fine also relates to the pay of the inquiry's three panel members one of whom, Drusilla Sharpling, received a basic salary of Â£152,424 in 2015-6. On becoming chancellor in 2010, George Osborne ruled that public servants directly appointed by ministers should not be paid more than then Prime Minister David Cameron - who was earning Â£142,500 at the time - unless they were approved by the Treasury. It was part of an austerity drive which saw the pay of ministers cut by 5% and then frozen for five years. Prof Jay was named as chair by Home Secretary Amber Rudd at short notice in August 2016. Her predecessor, a leading New Zealand judge, resigned suddenly following criticism of her conduct of the troubled inquiry. The inquiryis investigating historical allegations of sex abuseagainst local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye - spanning decades. The leading academic and child protection expert was already a panel member, working in that capacity alongside Ms Sharpling, barrister Ivor Frank and academic Professor Malcolm Evans. Details of the ""exemplary fine"" emerged in theHome Office's accounts,externalfor the past financial year. A Home Office spokesman said the department had been punished for having to secure ""retrospective approval"" for Prof Jay's salary when she became chair as well as the remuneration of other panel members agreed when the inquiry was set up in 2015. ""The Treasury has the power to consider fines for departments who breach agreed spending control processes, including those relating to senior salary approval,"" it said. ""The Home Office have since reviewed appointment procedures to prevent further such breaches."" The fine does not relate to Dame Lowell Goddard's remuneration The Home Office said Prof Jay had been appointed swiftly in order to minimise disruption to the inquiry and this meant getting sign-off for her salary ""in parallel"" with her appointment - which was subsequently approved. According to the inquiry's accounts,,externalProf Jay was paid Â£118,360 for the period from 18 August 2016 to 31 March 2017. She also received an Â£27,478 accommodation allowance and expenses of Â£2,281. She also received Â£34,465 for her work as a panel member during the first four months of the financial year before becoming its chair. The accounts show Ms Sharpling was paid Â£152,285 in 2015-6, rising to Â£154,423 in 2016-7. The inquiry has agreed to subsidise 80% of what she was earning in her previous capacity as Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary. Over the same period, Prof Evans was paid Â£65,540 while Mr Frank received Â£96,332,50. In the past financial year, these salaries - which are set at a fixed rate of Â£565 a day - rose to Â£76,840 and Â£138,990 retrospectively. The Home Office stressed the fine did not relate to Dame Lowell Goddard's remuneration arrangements, which were heavily criticised during her 16 months in the post, but for which officials said ""all the necessary approvals"" had been granted. In 2015-6, she was paid Â£355,000 and received an accommodation and utilities allowance worth Â£119,207. She also received Â£29,156 in relocation costs and Â£75,246 in travel costs including the cost of air fares between the UK and New Zealand. She was paid Â£123,871 for the period between 1 April and her resignation on 4 August 2016 while her allowances and expenses for the period totalled more than Â£80,000. The inquiry has been beset by problems since its inception with its first two chairs, Lady Butler-Sloss and Dame Fiona Woolf, stepping down before beginning their work. The inquiry's chief lawyer, Ben Emmerson, resigned last year but Prof Jay has insisted it is continuing with its work.

Prince's beach photos complaint upheld,"A complaint by Prince Harry over photos of him on a beach in Jamaica published by Mail Online has been upheld by the independent press watchdog. The prince said the images had been taken in circumstances in which he had a reasonable expectation of privacy, as it was on a private beach. Prince Harry was on the beach with his girlfriend Meghan Markle. Mail Online said it had been provided with credible information that the prince had been on a public beach. Prince Harry also complained that he was engaged in private activities unconnected to his public role and was unaware that he was being photographed. The prince said Mail Online had made no attempt to seek his consent or to establish the circumstances in which the photographs had been taken before publication. The article, published on 4 March, was headlined: ""Time to cool off! Happy (and hunky) Prince Harry enjoys a dip in the ocean as he and Meghan relax on the beach in Jamaica."" It included several photos showing Prince Harry wearing swimming shorts, at a beachside bar and in the sea. Mail Online said it had relied on the information it received and had published the images in good faith. It added that it was unfortunate and regrettable that it had been misinformed about the circumstances in which the images had been taken and it had not been its intention to cause distress to the prince. In its ruling,external, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) said: ""The complainant had been photographed during his leisure time on a private beach at a private resort. ""Indeed, the article itself stated that the complainant was staying at a private resort."" It continued: ""The images, which had been taken without consent, showed the complainant wearing swimwear and engaging in private leisure activities in circumstances in which he had a reasonable expectation of privacy. ""Photographing an individual in such circumstances is unacceptable, unless it can be justified in the public interest. ""The publication had not sought to justify the publication of the images in the public interest."" Ipso ordered Mail Online to publish the adjudication on its website. Prince Harry also complained to the watchdog on the basis of accuracy but this was not upheld.

Acid attack laws and Charlie Gard doctor,"Five people were attacked with acid within 90-minutes on Thursday in London The front page ofthe Times,externalreports that new laws to restrict the sale and possession of corrosive substances will be proposed ""within days"", because of the rise in acid attacks. The plans are predicted to feature tougher sentencing guidelines and a ban on the sale of the chemicals to under-18s. They will be released in the next 48 hours, the newspaper says. In an editorial, the paper notes that Britain has one of the highest rates of recorded acid attacks in the world and calls on MPs to make the ""liquid weapons"" harder to obtain. It also urges regulators to make readily available products less dangerous. Two front pages lead on the arrival in Britain next week of the US specialist who will examine the seriously ill baby Charlie Gard to see if an untested therapy can save his life. Doctors tell theI newspaper,externalthat it is a ""sensible, ethical solution"". While theDaily Mirror,externalsays the intervention has given new hope to Charlie's parents. Many of the papers carry reports on President Trump's visit to Paris to mark Bastille Day. The Guardian,externalsays Mr Trump revelled in the pomp and ceremony and was beaming from ear to ear as he prepared to fly home. President Trump visited Paris on Bastille Day The Daily Mail,externalcalls the parade on the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es - held to mark the centenary of America's entry into World War One - ""extraordinary"". But it says from the prominence of the French and American military hardware on display, one might have thought that the two countries had won the conflict without any help. The Sun,externalsays Chancellor Phillip Hammond sparked ""sexist fury"" when he remarked - in front of the entire cabinet - that driving a modern train is so easy, ""even a women could do it"". Mr Hammond then tried to dig himself out of trouble, according to the Sun, earning him this rebuke from Theresa May: ""Mr chancellor, I am going take your shovel away from you."" Sources close to Mr Hammond insist to the Sun that he made no such comment and some suggest another minister had unfairly caricatured the chancellor's position. The governing body of women's tennis, the WTA, is criticisedin the Times,external. The organisation invited readers of its Facebook page to vote on which female competitor dressed the best at SW19. In the poll, a dress worn by Heather Watson is praised for creating ""a harmony between contemporary sporty elements and feminine flair of the English rose pattern and pleats"". A dress worn by Heather Watson was featured in the poll Those who commented on the post were more direct. One accused the WTA of asking a ""stupid question"", which set tennis back 50 years. The organisation defended its conduct to the Times, saying ""there's nothing wrong with promoting athleticism while promoting Wimbledon's wonderful dress code"". The Express,externalfeatures a surreptitious snap taken by a passenger on board an Emirates flight, appearing to show a flight attendant pouring a glass of champagne back into its bottle. The paper quotes a former flight attendant, who describes the recycling of liquid refreshments which have been exposed to cabin air as ""unsanitary and disgusting"". The airline says it has begun an investigation into an apparent breach of its standards. The Daily Mail,externalwarns British tourists about what it calls ""the summer car hire rip-off"". The paper quotes a study showing that firms have hiked the insurance excess charges they can impose in the event of an accident. The average figure is Â£1,000, even when the driver isn't to blame, with the highest rising to Â£2,200. Experts tell the Mail the ""astonishingly high figures"" are being used to persuade travellers to pay for costly extra cover before they set off. The Guardian,externalprofiles a creature that's likely to be the last organism standing, if an apocalyptic catastrophe threatens life on earth. The tardigrade, just one millimetre long, is extraordinarily hardy - shrugging off the vacuum of space, absolute-zero temperatures and extreme doses of radiation as if it was nothing. The Guardian styles them as the ""ultimate hope for terrestrial life as we know it"", as researchers say they could survive virtually any disaster. Until the sun eventually enlarges and boils away the oceans, that is. The Daily Telegraph,externalreports on efforts by the British Museum to boost interest in its forthcoming exhibition about the Scythians - a fierce, horse-back tribe of nomads who roamed central Asia. On the museum's website, they're likened to the Dothraki - a fictional people from the book and television series Game of Thrones. In an editorial, the Telegraph laments the need for TV fantasy comparisons. And while the paper acknowledges some similarities - bloodthirstiness, master bowmanship - it suggests the Scythians, unlike their fantasy counterparts, may have worn a few more clothes.

Vogue blasted over Zayn and Gigi shoot,"Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid in the US Vogue photoshoot US Vogue has apologised for ""missing the mark"" by saying Zayn Malik and his girlfriend Gigi Hadid were ""embracing gender fluidity"". In an interview, the former One Directioner and the US model talked about borrowing each other's clothes. They were photographed in colourful, fairly androgynous clothes. But readers mocked the magazine for its definition of the phrase, pointing out that what you wear does not make you ""gender fluid"". Many on social media pointed out that the term refers to people with a particular transgender identity, who do not conform to societal expectations of male or female or identify as either. For instance Jacob Tobia wrote in Cosmopolitan,external: ""If you're going to talk about a marginalised community, talk to that community. ""Unlike how this new Vogue cover shoot presents it, the lived experience of being gender-nonconforming is rarely that fun and glamorous."" Vogue describes a conversation between the pair, with Hadid telling Malik: ""I shop in your closet all the time, don't I?"". The 24-year-old singer then replies that he borrowed an Anna Sui T-shirt from her, adding: ""I like that shirt. And if it's tight on me, so what? It doesn't matter if it was made for a girl."" Hadid, 22, agrees, saying: ""Totally. It's not about gender. It's about, like, shapes. And what feels good on you that day. ""And anyway, it's fun to experiment."" Vogue writer Maya Singer comments in the piece, in US Vogue's August issue, that for many young people ""gender is a more or less arbitrary distraction"" and that there is ""a terrific opportunity for play"". She says ""this new blase attitude toward gender codes marks a radical break"", adding: ""For these millennials, at least, descriptives like boy or girl rank pretty low on the list of important qualities - and the way they dress reflects that."" But poet Tyler Ford, who's quoted in the accompanying article exploring gender norms,tweeted,external(with an eyeroll emoji): ""The only mention of the word 'trans' is by me via interview."" Journalist and author Hannah Orenstein said she would have preferred Tyler to have been profiled instead of Hadid and Malik,tweeting,external: ""Zayn and Gigi are profiled in this piece on gender fluidity because... they borrow each other's clothes sometimes?"" Another reader noted on Twitter: ""Y'all notice Zayn isn't out here wearing dresses."" And Colette Fahywrote,external: ""All Z & G say is that they borrow each other's clothes. Such a big jump for the mag to declare gender fluidity."" In a statement issued on Friday, a Vogue spokeswoman said: ""The story was intended to highlight the impact the gender-fluid, non-binary communities have had on fashion and culture. ""We are very sorry the story did not correctly reflect that spirit - we missed the mark. ""We do look forward to continuing the conversation with greater sensitivity.""

Two Germans killed in Egypt stabbing,"Hurghada is a popular resort renowned for its scuba diving Two German tourists have been killed in stabbings at a hotel beach in the popular Red Sea resort of Hurghada, Egyptian officials say. At least four other people were injured and a man has been arrested. The suspect is being questioned by police to determine his motives, the interior ministry said. The knifeman initially killed the two women before injuring two other tourists at the Zahabia hotel, officials told Reuters news agency. He then swam to a nearby beach and attacked and wounded two more people at the Sunny Days El Palacio resort before he was overpowered by staff and arrested. ""He had a knife with him and stabbed each of them three times in the chest. They died on the beach,"" El Palacio hotel Security Manager Saud Abdelaziz said. Mr Abdelaziz said the injured include two Czechs and two Armenians.  All are now being treated in hospital. The attacker's motive was still under investigation, the interior ministry said. ""He was looking for foreigners and he didn't want any Egyptians,"" a member of staff at the Zahabia hotel said. Three foreign touristswere stabbed at the same resort,renowned for its scuba diving, in January 2016 by two suspected militants from the Islamic State militant group (IS). Emergency services were quick to arrive at the scene of the attacks Hurghada has a high number of foreign tourists Egypt 'let down' by continued UK flight ban to Sharm Can Egypt's tourism recover? Initial reports had said those killed were Ukrainian, but Ukrainian officials denied this. It is unclear whether the attacker had any links to jihadist groups or whether he was psychologically disturbed, officials said. Egypt's security forces are dealing with an Islamist uprising in the country's Sinai Peninsula. The tourist industry has been targeted by militants in North Africa over the past few years.

Reality Check: When can't parents decide?,"Parents, it is generally agreed, are allowed to choose what happens to their children. Of course, parents may make good or bad choices, but they have the right to make those decisions, whether that is about their child's diet and physical activity, their name, what school they go to, what religion they are raised in or what medical treatment they receive. Professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford, Dominic Wilkinson, says: ""The principle is that if parents' decisions risk significant harm to their child then they should not be allowed to make those decisions. But the state doesn't intervene every time parents don't make the best decision."" The concept of parental responsibility is set out in law. The Children Act 1989 describes it as ""all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which, by law, a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property."" If a public body disagrees with those choices, they must go to court in order to override this parental responsibility. In the case of terminally ill baby Charlie Gard, medical professionals disagree with his parents over what is in his best interests. They want to stop his parents taking him to the US for experimental medical treatment, something they say is futile. And they want to stop providing his life support and allow him to die. His parents say they believe that Charlie is ""not in pain and suffering"" as doctors have claimed, and there is nothing to be lost in trying the experimental therapy. The team at Great Ormond Street has said Charlie is suffering and that that outweighs the ""tiny theoretical chance there may be of effective treatment"". Charlie Gard case explained Video: Charlie's parents continue their campaign Charlie is unable to move his legs and arms, breathe unaided or hold his eyelids open. He is also deaf, has severe epilepsy and his heart, liver and kidneys are affected. Undoubtedly, both doctors and parents want the best for Charlie. But in the final analysis, it will be for a judge to decide. This is because in the UK, in the absence of a parent's consent, a hospital needs a court order if stopping treatment would bring about death. So far, the courts have ruled that Charlie should not be given treatment and that Great Ormond Street Hospital should be allowed to withdraw Charlie's life support. Chris Fairhurst, children's law expert from Slater and Gordon, explains that in these situations, parents' wishes can only be overridden by going to court because a hospital has no legal right or responsibility to make such a decision without either the parents' or the courts' permission. It takes a judge ruling in favour of the hospital in order for the legal status of the parent's responsibility to be overridden. The hospital has given evidence that it does not believe keeping Charlie on life support is in his best interests. Connie Yates and Chris Gard have fought a long legal battle to take their baby to the US for treatment When it comes to cases involving the medical treatment of children, views range from thinking that the doctor always knows best to the idea that parents should have complete freedom to make all decisions over their children's health. The law in the UK falls somewhere in-between. In 2006, the parents of adisabled baby boy called Mahdi Bacheikh,externalwon their fight against the hospital's request to turn off the ventilator that kept him alive. The 19-month-old  had spinal muscular atrophy, was almost totally paralysed and could not breathe unaided, but did not have any sign of brain damage. He died later, aged two. In 2009, the parents ofa baby known only as OT,externalwho, like Charlie suffered from a form of mitochondrial disease, lost their right to keep him on life support. The judge heard he had suffered brain damage and was in discomfort and pain. He died the next day. In the US, though, where Charlie's parents are suggesting he could be treated, the law falls much more heavily on the side of the parents even if this goes against the recommendations of medical professionals. Charlie is thought to be the 16th baby ever to be diagnosed with his condition In the UK, while parents have the right to make decisions about their children's medical treatment, their wishes will be overruled if they refuse a reasonable life-saving treatment which has a very high chance of working. The classic example of this is parents who are Jehovah's Witnesses and refuse blood transfusions due to their faith. There have been many cases where the courts have sided with the doctors against the wishes of the parents. There is a difference, of course, between parents refusing recommended treatment and parents, as in Charlie's case, asking for treatment against advice. It is far simpler to prove that a treatment that almost certainly will keep a child alive is in their best interests than it is to argue that keeping a child alive is not in their best interests. When it comes to disputes between parents and the state, the vast majority involve a local authority going to court to remove a child from the care of their parents. In these cases, the authority must prove that a child is at risk of significant harm. But because cases like Charlie's are relatively rare, unlike in care cases there is no statutory test for how judges should treat them. This means it varies case by case as to whether a judge decides what is in a child's best interests or uses the more onerous test of whether they are likely to come to significant harm.

An unlikely (and calculated) friendship is born,"This video can not be played Toned-down Trump: What happened to the tough talk on Paris? President Trump has made a new friend - Emmanuel Macron, the French president. The alliance, say analysts, is good for both Europe and the US. Trump and Macron sat next to each other and watched a Bastille Day parade on the Champs-Elysees. Trump put his hand on Macron's shoulder. A moment later Macron placed his hand on the other man's back, a sign of their new friendship. French and US troops both marched in the parade, honouring the fact that the Americans helped France survive two world wars. More recently French and US militaries have worked together to combat al-Qaeda in West Africa and the Islamic State group in Syria. Afterwards Trump headed back to the US, and one of his advisors, Thomas Bossert, who was travelling with him, talked about the importance of the friendship between the two leaders. While the president was in a private cabin on Air Force One, Bossert told me and other reporters on the aeroplane that Trump and Macron would now be able work together more closely on issues such as counterterrorism and defence. INTERACTIVE: What has President Trump said about your country? What is in the Paris climate agreement? ""The relationship that the two presidents has forged will increase the trust that's required"" for intelligence sharing and other delicate matters, Bossert explained. Their friendship came about in a surprising way. This video can not be played The US president and his French counterpart shared a handshake that seemed like it would never end When they met in Brussels in May, Macron gave Trump a manly hand shake, showing he was a force to be reckoned with. Trump also made something clear during his first trip to Europe as president: he expected a lot from his friends. Trump said that members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) should increase their defence spending. A European official who's close to Macron told me that Trump also shared an idea with them about the contributions to Nato that members make. The European official said that Trump wanted to present Macron with an invoice on camera as a way of showing that the French should pay more money for their defence. The Europeans said they did not like the idea of a mini-drama about Nato spending, while a White House official told me the president never suggested it. This video can not be played The US president told Brigitte Macron she was ""in good shape"" The discrepancy in these two accounts hints at a bigger problem: Trump hasn't gotten along with Europeans. He made disparaging remarks about Nato and pulled the US out of the 2015 Paris climate accord. Afterwards Macron called Trump, asking him to come to Paris for Bastille Day. ""Macron's invitation to Trump was a bold stroke,"" said Charles Kupchan, who served as the national security council's senior director during the Obama administration. Macron's invitation was a subtle form of flattery, a national pastime in France, but in this case there was more than a kernel of sincerity too. ""If Macron is seen to be trying to ingratiate himself, that is in itself flattering,"" said Richard Stengel, who served as an under secretary of state for the Obama administration and is the author of a book called You're Too Kind: A Brief History of Flattery. Macron did not agree with much of what Trump has said and done since taking office, but still Macron wanted to get along. France's relationship with the US - for military and other reasons - is considered to be a top priority for Macron and his deputies. The official visit saw a few protesters ""They need to make sure they don't screw it up,"" said Jeremy Shapiro, former US state department official. The charm strategy worked - in part because Macron had a willing victim. Trump likes to single people out in hostile-ish groups and turn them into allies. In Europe, an area filled with leaders who resent Trump, Macron offered hope. Besides that, as the German Marshall Fund's Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, said: ""Trump has a lot of respect for Macron."" Trump arrived in Paris on Thursday. That evening he and Macron sat at a table in Jules Verne, a restaurant on top of the Eiffel Tower with a spectacular view of the city, and they talked about food. Watching the Bastille Day parade, Trump spoke to Macron in an animated way, throwing his arms around. The troops wore white gloves and feathered hats, and they carried swords and marched in lockstep. They looked like tin solders come to life, and Trump clapped exuberantly. This video can not be played US President Donald Trump attended the parade Trump has said lots of bad things about Europe, but Macron managed to turn things around. He gave a speech that afternoon with Trump standing next to him. At the end of his remarks, Macron said: ""Vive la France.""

Five situations where cards don't cut it,"Sometimes only cash will do: Most street performers only take spare change Visa is waging a war on cash, with a scheme in the US encouraging small businesses to ditch it as a form of payment. Chief executive Al Kelly told investors last month that the company was ""focused on putting cash out of business,"" and is considering bringing the initiative to these shores. The move is good business sense for Visa, which makes money every time it facilitates a transaction. But is it just a sign of the times? Now that payments under Â£30 can be made with the tap of a contactless card, perhaps it's hard to see why anyone would bother to carry cash. But figures show the British public still has a soft spot for good old paper and coins.  While the number of cash payments fell 11% between 2015 and 2016, cash is still the single most popular method of payment, accounting for 40% of all transactions in the UK last year. Whether it's for convenience, symbolism or simply to avoid transaction charges, there are still situations where cash is the best way to pay. Visa considers incentives for UK firms to go cashless Tipping: A guide to who gets what and how much Most people hope that a service charge would go directly to the waiting staff. But some restaurants keep tips paid for with a card, or distribute them across the whole of the workforce. However, if you choose to leave a tip in cash, you have a much better chance that it will benefit the person you intended it for. Likewise, if you want to leave money for the housekeeping staff in a hotel, a bartender or a cloakroom attendant, leaving cash is the best way to make sure it gets to the intended beneficiary. Collections Famously, it was revealed that the Queen does occasionally carry cash in her statement Launer handbag. Why? So that on Sundays so she can make a donation to the church collection. Giving money to a religious service or local event still tends to be a cash-based gesture, while charity collection tins are designed so passersby can put in their spare change as they walk past. However, quick-off-the-mark churches, charities and even buskers are adapting to our increasing propensity to go cash-free.  Pet charity The Blue Cross sent out ""tap dogs"" last year with contactless payment jackets, allowing the public to ""pat and tap the dog"" to make a Â£2 donation. This video can not be played Meet Smudge, the world's first contactless dog Market stalls There are occasional cases where market stalls take card payments.  But in general, whipping out a credit or debit card to pay for a punnet of cherries will be met with a blank stare.  For small businesses and independent traders, the cost of taking cards can eat into their margins as they have to pay several fees to cover the cost of the transaction. So for them, cash is often the preferred option -and it means they won't pass on that cost to you. Weddings In China it is customary to give red envelopes filled with cash at weddings and New Year Yes, you can tuck a cheque into the card, or ask the recipient for their bank details, but it doesn't quite have the same effect as a crisp Â£20 (or maybe even Â£50) note. And for some cultures the symbolism of cash is particular poignant. At Chinese weddings, it is customary to give a red envelope containing cash, while in Greece guests are often invited to pin banknotes on to the bride and groom. At Indian weddings, cash is sometimes given in odd numbers, as giving a sum ending in one is seen as lucky. In 2014, London buses went cashless, only accepting pre-paid plastic travelcards or contactless bank cards as a form of payment.  By contrast, there are still some bus operators in other parts of the country who only take cash, unless you have bought a ticket in advance. It's not just public transport: getting around by car can also be much easier if you keep cash on you. Many know the experience of borrowing 20p from a stranger to feed a parking machine that only takes exact change, while some taxis are still a card-free zone.

'My son was groomed to sell drugs',"Children from middle-class backgrounds are in danger of being groomed by criminal gangs to sell drugs, a new report has found. One mother says her son turned from ""an angel into a monster"". ""I was going out there looking for him myself,"" Claire - not her real name - explains to theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""I was a nervous wreck."" In 2012, her son was exploited by a criminal gang to sell Class A drugs in his early teens, which led to him going missing for long periods of time - in one instance for three months. ""There was one occasion when he came home, and I heard a rustling at my door. ""To my horror, he was actually dealing from my home. ""He was getting calls on his mobile phone and asking whoever it was who was willing to purchase to come to my gate. ""Then it progressed to him being out on the streets most of the time - nowhere to be heard, nowhere to be seen."" Claire describes her son as being a high achiever at school, who ""never had any problems with his behaviour"". ""He was actually featured in the local newspaper for very good work,"" she adds. Her story comes asa report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Runaway and Missing Children and Adults,externalwarns that children and young people from ""stable and economically better-off backgrounds"" are being drawn in, coerced and exploited by criminal gangs. ""Any child can be groomed for criminal exploitation,"" according to the report Labour MP Ann Coffey, who chairs the group, told the programme: ""People think it's children from a particular group that are vulnerable to this and of course they are vulnerable, but we also forget that it is all children and we have a duty to protect all children, including children from better-off backgrounds who we may not think are vulnerable to this kind of exploitation and may go unnoticed."" The report says children are being used in so-called ""county lines"" operations -  supplying Class A drugs from urban areas to county towns. It says such grooming of missing children is ""very similar"" to sexual exploitation, but that those drawn in are effectively being blamed for their own participation in criminal activity, rather than being considered a victim. Exploited children can be perceived as having ""made a choice"" and be seen as criminals rather than victims of the gangs controlling them. The report calls for the risks of grooming and exploitation to be taught in both primary and secondary schools. ""Any child can be groomed for criminal exploitation. It affects boys and girls,"" it adds. The National Crime Agency says the issue has spread out from London gangs to the rest of the country, including Liverpool and Greater Manchester. Claire believes her son was coerced into selling drugs. ""It could be that one of his peers, who had family members who were into criminal activity, asked their brother or sister to recruit within their mates,"" she says. ""There's the other side, where [he could have been] approached outside the school. ""I think personally he has gone through all of those stages."" Claire says she ""screamed and shouted"" for support Asked if she received any help from social services, she says: ""Unfortunately with every service I was always told my son would have to have worse problems to have the support that I needed. ""I have screamed, I have shouted, I have done everything possible to try and prevent my son from getting deeper. ""Every way I turned I was backed up in a corner."" Referring to Claire's case, Ann Coffey says: ""Her son's missing episodes were perhaps not seen in the way that they should have been because maybe the agencies didn't connect the risk to him in the way they might have done to another child from another different kind of background."" The cross-party report also called for a new national database for missing people, noting a lack of information-sharing that Claire also experienced. ""There has to be a response team that's working together, because I had to be dealing with so many services just for one child,"" she says. ""There was never anybody who could see what the other person was doing."" The government made tackling county lines one of its priorities in 2016 for ending gang violence and exploitation, saying: ""It is essential that police forces and their partners develop an understanding of what this means locally."" A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""There is more that all partners can do, which is why we are tackling county lines through a national action plan and reviewing our cross-government strategy on missing children and adults and developing a clear implementation plan for delivery."" Claire says she just feels ""fortunate"" that her son is still alive. ""He nearly passed away after being stabbed,"" she explains. ""He's alive and he's in a hospital bed, but when I saw him I broke down. ""His words to me were: 'I'm all right, Mum, I'm OK - it could have been worse.'"" Asked for her advice for any parents in similar situations, she says: ""Reach out - reach out for any help you can get.""

Is teleportation now a reality?,"Are we about to boldly go where no-one has gone before? Chinese scientists say they have ""teleported"" a photon particle from the ground to a satellite orbiting 1,400km (870 miles) away. For many, however, teleportation evokes something much more exotic. Is a world previously confined to science fiction now becoming reality? Well, sort of. But we are not likely to be beaming ourselves to the office or a beach in the Bahamas anytime soon. Sorry. Simply put, teleportation is transmitting the state of a thing rather than sending the thing itself. Some physicists give the example of a fax machine - it sends information about the marks on a piece of paper rather than the paper itself. The receiving fax machine gets the information and applies it to raw material in the form of paper that is already there. This video can not be played China teleports first photon from the earth to orbit using quantum entanglement What it is not is teleportation in the Star Trek sense - transferring matter instantly from one location to another - which is how many instinctively see it. Instead, it relies on a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. Indeed. The phenomenon arises when two particles are created at the same time and place and so effectively have the same existence. This entanglement continues even when the photons are then separated. It means that if one of the photons changes, the other photon in the other location changes too. Prof Sandu Popescu, from Bristol University, has been working on quantum entanglement since the 1990s. ""Even then people were thinking about Star Trek. But we are talking about sending the state of a single particle, not the billions of billions of billions of particles that form a person,"" he says. ""If you are thinking about a remote planet, first you would have to exchange billions of entangled pairs of particles and then you have to send other information as well. This is highly non-trivial. One should not get excited by that."" Let's go back to our two entangled particles. If a third particle interacts with the first entangled particle, the change that occurs in the entangled particle is mirrored in its twin. So the twin contains information about the third particle and effectively takes on its existence. It has been impossible to create a long-distance link between two entangled particles because an entangled photon can only travel about 150km down a fibre-optic channel before becoming absorbed. China's Micius satellite is equipped with a sensitive photon receiver Researchers have long seen the potential of a satellite link because photons can travel more easily through space, but it has been difficult to transmit them through the earth's atmosphere - varying atmospheric conditions can deviate the particles. Quantum computing: Game changer or security threat? 'Dead or alive' cat in physics top 10 Justin Trudeau meets quantum challenge The pro-ballerina and quantum physicist They created 4,000 pairs of quantum-entangled photons per second at their laboratory in Tibet and fired one of the photons from each pair in a beam of light towards a satellite called Micius, named after an ancient Chinese philosopher. Micius has a sensitive photon receiver that can detect the quantum states of single photons fired from the ground. Their report -published online,external- says it is the first such link for ""faithful and ultra-long-distance quantum teleportation"". ""It is a very nice experiment - I would not have expected everything to have worked so fast and so smoothly,"" says Professor Anton Zeilinger from the University of Vienna, who taught Chinese lead scientist Pan Jianwei. The main goal for quantum teleportation at present is the creation of unhackable communications networks. ""The laws of nature offer protection,"" says Prof Popescu. ""If someone was to intercept the information you could detect it because whenever you try to observe a quantum system you disturb it."" Quantum computer networks offer greater security The Chinese city of Jinan has already begun trials of a secure network based on quantum technology and a network linking Beijing and Shanghai is under development with so-called ""trusted nodes"" every 100km where the quantum signal is measured and sent again, Prof Zeilinger says. ""It is the first quantum internet. Data rates are low so it is not useful for the current internet. But it is useful for refreshing the quantum key used to send encrypted information,"" Prof Zeilinger says. The quantum network could be used for sensitive financial or electoral information, says Professor Ian Walmsley from Oxford University. ""There are significant barriers still to overcome. But this is how transformative change begins,"" he says. Quantum computing: Game changer or security threat? Justin Trudeau meets quantum challenge.

Reality Check: Can Scotland and Wales block the repeal bill?,"The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, known as the repeal bill, will convert EU laws into UK laws. Some of these will be in areas such as the environment and agriculture, which are normally the responsibility of the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones, have described the bill as a ""naked power-grab"" that undermines devolution. But do they have the power to block it? The UK government says it will negotiate with the devolved governments and attempt to seek consensus. Ultimately, though, the bill could pass even without the agreement of Scotland and Wales, but not without the potential for severe political consequences. What is the repeal bill all about? Brexit: All you need to to know Devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland transfers the power to make laws in some policy areas from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly. But there are times when the UK Parliament still legislates in these areas. The Sewel Convention states that when it does so, it should normally seek the consent of the devolved legislature. And the convention is just that, a political convention, not a legally enforceable rule. It is named after Lord Sewel, who first set it out when the Scottish Parliament was established. A system was established whereby the UK government seeks a ""legislative consent motion"" from the devolved legislatures when it passes laws on devolved matters. Scottish Parliament (left) and Welsh Assembly (right) The convention was written into a memorandum of understanding between the UK and devolved governments in 2001. It states: ""The UK government will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters, except with the agreement of the devolved legislature."" The memorandum was intended as a political agreement not a legally binding code. And the word ""normally"" implies it is not absolutely essential for Westminster to seek consent. The convention as it applies to Scotland and Wales has recently been written into law. The Scotland Act 1998 said the power of the Scottish Parliament to make laws ""does not affect the power of the United Kingdom to make laws for Scotland"". However, the Scotland Act 2016 inserted an extra clause saying that Westminster: ""will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish Parliament"". A similar clause for Wales was included in the Wales Act 2017. There has been no such Act of Parliament for Northern Ireland, but the convention still applies there. Despite the new statutory basis, the Sewel Convention does not give the Scottish Parliament or Welsh Assembly an absolute veto. That was determined by theSupreme Court in its judgement,externalin the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. The Supreme Court found that the new clauses do not mean that the Sewel Convention has been converted into a legally enforceable rule. It remains a political convention - albeit one which is recognised as a permanent feature of devolution. The devolved legislatures in Scotland and Wales do not have the legal power to block the repeal bill. But if the UK government were to bulldoze it through without their consent, it could be politically explosive. It may just be a convention but it is regarded by many as a key aspect of the devolution settlement and an important part of the UK's constitution.

Messages and mementos were also left outside Sunderland's Stadium of Light. Speakers broadcast the funeral service to the crowds outside the church who were unable to make it inside. Bradley's family wore football shirts in honour of his love of the sport. See more on this and other stories on our Local Live page. His mother, Gemma, told the congregation: ""He had a smile so big and beautiful it could brighten any room. A real brave superhero, he left us all too soon. ""He touched the hearts of many - the most inspirational boy. A loving, caring son and brother - a beautiful star. ""Although your time with us was short, you must have a job to do in heaven with the angels as God has chosen you. ""For now my baby we'll say goodbye.

A vigil and minute's applause were also held at Grey's Monument in Newcastle city centre to coincide with the funeral, while balloons were released at the Sunderland's ground.

How an agoraphobic travels the world,"Jacqui Kenny's agoraphobia means a trip to the supermarket can trigger an anxiety attack and fears of impending ""catastrophe"". But she says her Instagram account is helping her and sufferers like her to explore remote corners of the world. Jacqui, 43, takes shots from Google Street View - among them a group of nuns in Peru and high-rise flats in Russia - posting images to her 20,000 followers under the pseudonym ""Agoraphobic Traveller"". Since her 20s she has feared busy places and public transport - despite living in central London -  but says the digital age has helped her travel to places she would otherwise never see. ""I'll go anywhere that feels a little bit magical,"" she says. ""They are places that would be incredibly difficult for me to travel to, so inevitably I'm attracted to them."" Children playing near the Atacama Desert in Chile Jacqui, who was diagnosed with agoraphobia in 2009, chooses remote, eerie places to capture and says she likes anywhere with an ""other-worldly feel"". ""There's a lot of isolation in the shots but there is also colour and hope in there,"" she says. ""The photos I take reflect how I feel and my agoraphobia is part of that."" But her ""thrill"" at discovering faraway places contrasts with her fear of everyday situations. She describes going to the local supermarket as ""a nightmare"" and says she has not taken a Tube train in 10 years. ""I'll start to panic - my palms are sweaty, I have a racing heart, I feel that my feet aren't touching the floor,"" she says. ""Thoughts are racing through my mind - that I'm going to lose control, smash everything in the aisle - and everyone will see."" A remote bus stop in Belgorod Oblast in Russia Jacqui was 23 and living in Australia when she had her first panic attack during a busy day at work. ""No one told me what it was and I thought I was dying,"" she says. ""Later, a doctor said it must've been something I'd had for dinner. ""He blamed it on the black bean sauce - no one was talking about mental health."" Before starting theproject,externalin 2016, Jacqui managed to hide her symptoms from everyone except her family. At work, she ran a digital marketing company but only went to meetings in the office which was two minutes' walk from her house. She says finding and posting the images has helped her come to terms with being agoraphobic, which she had felt angry about for a long time. ""Before my anxiety set in I dreamed of being a photographer,"" says Jacqui. ""I'd resigned myself to this never happening."" ""Now I feel that the condition doesn't define me but is within a part of me,"" she says. Fallen branches from a tree in Senegal, Western Africa But does spending hours online posting photos really help her condition? Jacqui admits she ""thought it could be an unhealthy thing to do"" to trawl the internet for hours at a time. But she says it has given her the confidence to speak about the condition and come to terms with it. ""It's only when I started posting these photos I went beyond telling my family and really close friends,"" she says. ""Before, nobody knew,"" she says. ""Now people from all over the world are coming to me sharing similar struggles - it's amazing."" High-rise flats in Russia She says many people misunderstand agoraphobia as a fear of open spaces, but she has discovered how varied people's anxiety can be. She has been contacted by an agoraphobic journalist who struggles in a busy newsroom and photographers who may fear travelling to a photo shoot. ""Quite a few young women have asked me for advice,"" she says. ""I tell them about my experience, but I can only offer my viewpoint as I'm obviously not a psychologist."" She adds: ""Everybody's dealing with something and I'm really starting to realise that."" A street dog chases the Google car Arequipa, Peru Jacqui now manages her anxiety with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which aims to change patterns of thinking - recently attending her sister's wedding in New Zealand. ""I had therapy which involved a lot of anxiety and not sleeping for three months,"" she says. But she managed the flight after seeing a psychologist, who made her act out her worst fears. ""I pretended to bang down the door of the plane, trying to get out of there,"" she says. ""I realised how funny the situation was, and we both fell around laughing, and when I actually boarded the plane that humour helped me through it."" It was not easy - but she says the trip has given her hope. ""I try to do these things,"" she says. ""There are times when I can't do it and I go home - but I know that is making it worse."" Agoraphobics may fear being left alone, in a situation where they feel trapped, or travelling away from a ""safe"" place The condition usually starts between the ages of 18 and 35 and is twice as common in women as men Many agoraphobics fear having a panic attack others might see, or suffer an anxiety attack They may get anxious when waiting in long lines, being in crowded places, or in wide-open spaces People can seek advice fromNHS Choices,external. their GP or the charityAnxiety UK,external How helpful is social media for our mental health?

Two tourists killed in Egypt stabbing,"Hurghada is a popular resort renowned for its scuba diving Two German tourists have been killed in stabbings at a hotel beach in the popular Red Sea resort of Hurghada, Egyptian officials say. At least four other people were injured and a man has been arrested. The suspect is being questioned by police to determine his motives, the interior ministry said. The knifeman initially killed the two women before injuring two other tourists at the Zahabia hotel, officials told Reuters news agency. He then swam to a nearby beach and attacked and wounded two more people at the Sunny Days El Palacio resort before he was overpowered by staff and arrested. ""He had a knife with him and stabbed each of them three times in the chest. They died on the beach,"" El Palacio hotel Security Manager Saud Abdelaziz said. Mr Abdelaziz said the injured include two Czechs and two Armenians.  All are now being treated in hospital. The attacker's motive was still under investigation, the interior ministry said. ""He was looking for foreigners and he didn't want any Egyptians,"" a member of staff at the Zahabia hotel said.

NHS ranked 'number one' health system,"The NHS has been ranked the number one health system in a comparison of 11 countries. The UK health service was praised for its safety, affordability and efficiency, but fared less well on outcomes such as preventing early death and cancer survival. The research by the Commonwealth Fund, a US think tank, looked at countries across the world, including the US, Canada, Australia, France and Germany. The US came bottom. It is the second time in a row that the UK has finished top. Three years ago, when the survey was last done, the UK was also number one. It comes despite the NHS being in the grip of the tightest financial squeeze in its history with lengthening waiting times. The NHS was praised for the safety of its care, the systems in place to prevent ill-health, such as vaccinations and screening, the speed at which people get help and that there was equitable access regardless of income. Only in one of the five themes looked at did the NHS perform poorly compared with the other nations - health outcomes. This covers general health of the population, early deaths and cancer survival among other measures. 1 UK 2 Australia 3 Netherlands 4 = New Zealand 4 = Norway 6 = Sweden 6 = Switzerland 8 Germany 9 Canada 10 France 11 US England's Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""These outstanding results are a testament to the dedication of NHS staff, who despite pressure on the front line are delivering safer, more compassionate care than ever. â""Ranked the best healthcare system of 11 wealthy countries, the NHS has again showed why it is the single thing that makes us most proud to be British."" But others pointed out that in terms of quality of care - as shown by the health outcomes - the findings were more damning. Kate Andrews, of free-market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the NHS was ""far from being the envy of the world"". ""The UK has one of the highest rates of avoidable deaths in western Europe, and tens of thousands of lives could be saved each year if NHS patients with serious conditions such as cancer were treated by social health insurance systems in neighbouring countries, such as Belgium and Germany. ""It is not just low-income earners who receive poor care, the NHS's provision of care is equally poor for everybody, irrespective of income.""

TV producer jailed over hitmen plot,"Harris approached three different men to ask them to kill his partner A retired TV producer who was convicted of trying to hire a hitman to kill his partner has been jailed for 17 years. David Harris, 68, offered Â£200,000 for the murder of Hazel Allinson so he could inherit her fortune, sell her Â£800,000 Sussex home and run off with a sex worker, an Old Bailey trial heard. Jurors heard he approached two men over the deal but was reported to police. Harris was later filmed trying to make a deal with a third prospective hitman - but who was an undercover officer. During the trial, the former producer of the police drama series The Bill said he was researching a spy novel and denied soliciting murder, but jurors found him guilty on three counts. The court heard he wanted his partner killed in a ""mugging gone wrong"". Harris wanted to run off with Ugne Cekaviciute who he met in a brothel Judge Anne Molyneux QC told Harris: ""For your pipe dream, for your obsessive infatuation with a young woman, Ms Allinson, who had protected and nurtured you, was to die a painful and terrifying death in an isolated spot. ""Her death was to fund your life. You had used her until she had outlasted her usefulness to you. ""All that you wanted from her was that she should die and you should inherit her money."" This video can not be played CCTV and audio of the 'hitman hire' was released by police The court heard Harris became besotted with Lithuanian Ugne Cekaviciute, 28, whom he met in a brothel. He had been with Ms Allinson - a retired scriptwriter who had survived breast cancer - for 27 years and the couple shared her home in the village of Amberley. But during his five-year affair with Ms Cekaviciute, Harris became entangled in a web of lies and debt as he lavished gifts on her. The court heard he spent Â£50,000 of Ms Allinson's savings and told elaborate lies that included pretending to umpire cricket matches away from home, and claims he was looking after his sick brother in a mental hospital. He first approached mechanic Chris May to kill his partner, but he tried to warn Ms Allinson. Harris was then put in contact with Duke Dean, but he reported him to City of London Police. After Harris was videoed meeting an undercover officer, police arrested him at a hotel where they found him in bed with Ms Cekaviciute. David Harris lied to Hazel Allinson about visiting his sick brother, when he was seeing his mistress Earlier, the court heard Harris had all the hallmarks of ""social anxiety and a narcissistic personality disorder"" with manipulative traits and a lack of remorse and guilt. Prosecutor Philip Gee told the court the twice-divorced father-of-one had a ""complex and dysfunctional relationship with women"", including his partner and girlfriend. But in mitigation, Anthony Rimmer said Harris had been a ""silly old fool"" although his infatuation did not excuse the offences. He said Ms Cekaviciute was now ""out of the picture"" and his relationship with Ms Allinson remained an ""open question"". Giving evidence, Harris had claimed he was writing a thriller and told the court: ""I thought what was happening to me at that time, at that particular juncture, might form the basis of a good thriller. ""It was based on a guy based on me, my sort of age, meets a young girl, falls in love, becomes besotted and over development decides he wants to be with her and decides what he has to do about his wife Holly."" Harris used Ms Allinson's good reputation to borrow money from their neighbours After the hearing, Det Ch Insp Edelle Michaels, from City of London Police, said the offence involved ""significant planning and persistence"" by Harris. Describing him as ruthless, she said he had shown to be ""calculating"" and ""intent on causing serious harm"". ""His persistence was evident in his approaching not one but three different supposed hitmen,"" she added. ""This has been a hugely difficult time for the victim, who has been significantly affected. ""The situation could have been far worse had Harris succeeded with his plan and there was an element of good fortune that one of the men Harris approached informed the police, prompting our swift response.""

'Rooney to China'?: The real impact of fake football news,"This spoof news story was widely circulated on Facebook Dubiously sourced rumours about football transfers spread wildly on social media, and while experts say they don't usually affect where players end up, they can put pressure on clubs and move betting markets. It's a type of story that long pre-dates the current mania about ""fake news"". Transfer rumours have long dominated the back pages of newspapers during the summer transfer window, and many commentators view such stories as pure speculation. Take, for instance, Match of the Day presenter and former England playerGary Lineker who recently tweeted,external: ""90% of transfer stories are guesswork in the hope of getting lucky."" But just like in many other areas of the media and entertainment industries, social media is changing the game when it comes to transfer rumours - in this case allowing fake stories to spread wider and faster than ever before. To take one example, as speculation surged recently around the impending transfer of Wayne Rooney, a satirical story was posted on a popular Facebook group, ""Manchester United Dream Team Forever"", which has more than 550,000 members. The story was created by a humour website, ""Soccer on Saturday"". Most who clicked on it would have picked up on the satire right away - the story was packed with jokes about Chinese politics, Rooney's hairline, his recent form and much else besides. However, when viewed on Facebook, the article could easily be mistake for a legitimate news headline. It features a Photoshopped image of Rooney standing with a club official, holding a Shanghai shirt with his name and number printed on the back and the headline ""Rooney Signs for Shanghai in Â£700,000 per week Deal"". It's unclear how many people clicked beyond the headline and noticed the jokes and fictitious quotes in the actual story, and of course any misapprehension was quashed when Rooneysigned for Everton, his boyhood team. But can fake headlines impact the transfer market while negotiations between clubs are ongoing? The teen who duped the football world Rooney rejoins Everton from Man Utd Visit BBC Trending onFacebook,external Raffaele Pilo, Head of CIES Football Observatory based in Switzerland, investigates the value of football players. He tells BBC Trending radio that individuals involved in transfer negotiations have an incentive to encourage rumours, regardless of whether they're accurate or not. ""Sometimes, spreading rumours gives an indication that a player is on the marketâ¦ or if there is a negotiation, it puts pressure on the buying club,"" Pilo says. In this vein, players themselves often fuel speculation by posting subtle - or not-so-subtle - hints on social media, possibly in an effort to increase their value. Wayne Farry, a sports writer for the websiteJOE.co.uk,external, says that players are increasingly using their big social media followings to influence transfers. One example from this summer has been Kylian Mbappe, a young Monaco striker who's been linked with moves to Real Madrid, Arsenal and Liverpool. Mbappe recently changed his Twitter header to a photo showing him celebrating a goal in front of an advertising hoarding with the word ""Priceless"" written on it: Real Madrid and other clubs are reportedly interested in Mbappe Lotte, who's valued at roughly Â£100 million It was a change that, perhaps predictably, fuelled tremendous speculation online. The striker's name has been mentioned more than 800,000 times on Twitter in the last month. ""Even if there had not been any bids, that level of [online] interest would have pushed the hand of the club to have to do something,"" Farry says. ""You either sell and grant the player his move, or you increase his contract."" Rumours also have an impact beyond contracts and transfer fees. Farry says the whispers can have a big effect on betting markets, where punters can gamble on which club a player or manager moves to next. BBC Sport:Confirmed football transfers Woman dons male disguise to get into Iranian soccer stadium Listen to Trending on the BBC World Service For instance in June, Spanish-born manager and former Real Madrid defender Fernando Hierro became an unlikely favourite for the vacant Leeds United managerial position, largely due to social media. On 13 June, a Twitter user messaged betting company Sky Bet, asking for Hierro to be added to the Leeds United manager betting market. Sky obliged, and listed Hierro's odds at 33/1. After seeing Hierro's name appear on the list, many punters began to bet on his appointment, and social media speculation was rampant. This process drove down his odds, which eventually reached 2/1 - leading some publications tolabel,externalHierro a favourite for the job. Farry says he's observed this same process several times. When a potential manager is added to a betting list, Ferry says, people often assume that the betting company has some sort of inside information. Twitter speculation can drive a surge of bets, which can drive down the odds of the new candidate - which generates further rumours that they might be in line for the job. In the case of Hierro, the fan who requested the bet had no inside knowledge. He later stated on Twitter: And, as it turns out, all the speculation was wrong. Former Barcelona player Thomas Christiansen has since been appointed as Leeds manager, leaving Hierro punters without a payout.

Charlie Gard: US doctor to fly to UK,"New York physician Dr Michio Hirano has offered to treat Charlie in the US The US neurologist Michio Hirano, who offered to treat terminally ill Charlie Gard, is due to meet the infant's medical team in London on Monday. The High Court has resumed hearing a request to consider fresh evidence thatexperimental therapy offers a 10% chance of Charlie's health improving. He has a rare genetic condition and is under the care of Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) doctors who argue that his brain damage is irreversible. Further tests might settle the dispute. Charlie Gard's medical case explained Reality Check: When can't parents decide? Therapy 'offers Charlie 10% chance of meaningful success' The US boy who outlived medical expectations In April, Mr Justice Francis ruled that life support should be removed and Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. He has a rare genetic condition called encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS) for which there is no known cure. He cannot move, he is on life support, his heart, liver and kidneys are affected and it is unclear whether he feels any pain. This video can not be played The six-year-old US boy who outlived medical expectations Charlie's parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, from Bedfont in west London, havelost a succession of court casesto overturn the judge's ruling. The US President Donald Trump and Pope Francis have offered them support, along with New York physician Dr Hirano who has waived his anonymity and offered to treat Charlie in the US. The case has returned to the High Court following reports of new data from foreign healthcare experts who suggest nucleoside therapy might improve Charlie's condition. Mr Justice Francis said he intends to give his ruling on 25 July, after GOSH medics and Dr Hirano have had a chance to meet and discuss Charlie's care. Connie Yates will be allowed to attend the experts' meeting on Monday, the judge has ruled The size of Charlie's skull remains in dispute. GOSH doctors previously said its size indicates a lack of brain function, but a lawyer for the family disputed the measurements and the judge said it was ""absurd"" the discrepancy was undermining the science of the case. GOSH's lawyer said an MRI scan would allow for more accurate measurement but it would not be for therapeutic reasons. She also said an electroencephalogram (EEG) brain scan might detect whether Charlie was experiencing internal seizures that doctors were currently unaware of. The judge said any tests would require the parents' consent and must be carried out prior to the medical experts' meeting on Monday. 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the family division of the High Court in London 11 April: He says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: The Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose their fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case, after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court Great Ormond Street Hospital Dr Michio Hirano, Columbia University Medical Center Elcella: London scientists develop 'all-natural' alternative to weight loss jabs like Ozempic 'I had a stroke - and then started speaking with an Italian accent' Walworth Town Hall shows off majestic transformation as it reopens 11 years after horrific fire Lloydâs of London chief executive John Neal to leave for Aon Sadiq Khan's deputy could overturn refusal of 46-storey student tower The World Club returns with the Revive-all repair workshop in Kingston for 2025 At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Cheeki Rafiki yacht deaths boss guilty,"Douglas Innes ran Stormforce Coaching, the company responsible for the Cheeki Rafiki The boss of a yachting firm has been found guilty of failing to ensure the safety of a boat which capsized in the Atlantic with the loss of four lives. Douglas Innes had been responsible for the Cheeki Rafiki, which lost its keel 700 miles off Nova Scotia in May 2014. His company, Stormforce Coaching, was also convicted of the same charge. The jury at Winchester Crown Court was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on four manslaughter charges, which will be the subject of a retrial. The guilty verdicts on the safety charges were by a majority of 10-1. The bodies of James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren, Paul Goslin have never been found Andrew Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, James Male, 22, from Southampton, Steve Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56, both from Somerset, had been returning the 40ft (12m) vessel to Southampton from Antigua Sailing Week when it capsized. The US Coastguard was criticised for calling off its search for the stricken vessel after two days, but it was restarted following intervention by the British government. The vessel was eventually found with the life raft but no sign of the four men. Their bodies have never been found. Jurors were told some of the bolts holding the keel in place had been broken for some time During the trial, Innes, 42, of Whitworth Crescent, Southampton, was accused of cost cutting and failing to get the vessel checked before the voyage. Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC told jurors the yacht had been given a ""category two"" code, which meant it was only authorised to be used commercially up to 60 miles away from a ""safe haven"", and the code certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy. The court also heard the vessel, which had grounded three times in three years, had an undetected fault with the bolts which held the keel to the hull. The vessel had been on its way to Southampton from Antigua Sailing Week Jurors were told that when Innes was contacted by Mr Bridge to inform him there was a problem on board Innes, who was in a pub at the time, did not inform the coastguard. Instead, he went to another pub where he was again contacted by Mr Bridge who told him the situation had worsened. Innes returned home, called the coastguard and emailed the crew suggesting they check the bolts of the keel. Mr Lickley said it later emerged that some of the bolts had been broken ""for some time"" before the yacht left the UK in October.

Beyonce shares first picture of her twins,"Beyonce has shared the first picture of herself with her twins to celebrate them turning one month old. The US singer also confirmed they are called Sir Carter and Rumi -which had been rumouredafter she and husband Jay-Z filed a trademark for the names. The picture,externalshowed the 35-year-old mother-of-three and the twins draped in a purple floral sheet, while she wore a blue veil. It clocked up more than two million likes on Instagram in an hour. Beyonce wrote: ""Sir Carter and Rumi 1 month today"", with a string of emojis of prayer hands and a woman, man, little girl and two babies. As well as the twins, Beyonce and rapper Jay-Z are also parents to five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy. The style of the image, in which Beyonce stands in a garden barefoot in front of a floral archway,echoes the photoshootshe used to announce her pregnancy on the network. That post, in February, became the most-liked in the history of Instagram. The picture which Beyonce used to share news of her pregnancy Jay-Z's real name is of course Shawn Carter. Beyonce wrote that their babies' names are ""Sir Carter and Rumi"". So is Sir Carter actually Sir Carter Carter? Or does Rumi just have one name? Beyonce's mum Tina cleared things up a little,posting a message saying,external: ""hello Sir Carter and Rumi Carter"" and also confirmed their genders: ""Boy and girl what a blessing."" Beyonce and Jay-Z aren't the first couple to choose some sort of grandiose honorific as a forename - Kim and Kanye have little Saint, Michael Jackson's eldest son is Prince, and Jackson's brother Jermaine named a son, er, Jermajesty. Rumi, meanwhile, is a popular Japanese girl's name but some people have suggested Rumi may be named after the 13th Century Persian poet. Eight memorable celebrity baby names The world had been eagerly awaiting the first glimpse of the babies ever sinceAmerican media reportedthe Lemonade singer had given birth last month. But neither she nor Jay-Z had confirmed any details of the twins until now. Her father Mathew Knowles had tweetedon 18 June, saying: ""They're here!"" and ""Happy birthday to the twins"" - but the timing of Beyonce's post suggest they were actually born on 13 June. It's no surprise that fans were quick to share their thoughts on the picture. BBC Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfowrote on Twitter,external: ""Soooo extra and I LOVE it.""

'Truly unique' lioness nurses leopard cub,"Lion expert Dr Luke Hunter told the BBC the images are a once-in-a-lifetime sight A baby leopard can't change his spots, but this lioness doesn't seem to mind. These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were spotted by Joop Van Der Linde, a guest at Ndutu Safari Lodge in Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area. The scene is the Serengeti; the attentive mother, five-year-old Nosikitok. The lioness has a GPS collar fitted byKope Lion,external, a conservation NGO, and three young cubs of her own - born around the 27-28 June. The lioness Nosikitok recently had her second litter of cubs Dr Luke Hunter, President and Chief Conservation Officer forPanthera,external, a global wild cat conservation organisation which supports Kope Lion, told the BBC the incident was ""truly unique"". ""It's not something that I'm aware has ever happened before between large cats like this,"" he said. ""We know there are cases where lionesses will adopt other lion cubs... But this is unprecedented. ""I know of no other case - between any large cat, for that matter - where the species has adopted or nursed the cub of another species."" Most lionesses would normally kill a baby leopard if they found one, seeing just another predator in a competitive food-chain. The leopard cub, whose gender is not known, is around 2-3 weeks old The little cub is lucky it wasn't killed on sight, Dr Hunter says Dr Hunter says Nosikitok has cubs the same age as the young leopard - two to three weeks. She was around a kilometre from her den, where her own cubs are hidden, when she found the spotted substitute. ""She's encountered this little cub, and she's treated it as her own. She's awash with maternal hormones, and this fierce, protective drive that all lionesses have - they're formidable mums,"" the lion expert notes. Tanzania: A profile Why baby animals melt our hearts How I saved big cats by introducing âmagic dogsâ How do you get a rhino to fly? It is not clear yet where the baby leopard's mother is, or if the lioness will try to adopt it full-time. The local safari lodge say there is a resident female leopard there who almost certainly has cubs. And as Nosikitok's pride are unlikely to prove as indulgent as she is, the best outcome for the leopard would be a safe return to mum. Dr Hunter says his team are on tenterhooks to see what comes next. ""It's a unique thing, it will be fascinating to see how it unfolds. Nature is unpredictable. Up until earlier this week, we would have said 'Nah, that never happens' - and now it happens!""

How to choose the perfect care home,"Choosing a care home has been likened toplaying Russian roulette. The warning - by campaigners - comes after inspectors revealed one in four care homes had been found to be failing on safety. For nursing homes, it was even worse - more than one in three. So how do you find the right one? For many, navigating a way around the care system can be incredibly difficult. The first thing you need to do is to find out whether you - or the person on whose behalf you are looking - can get help towards the costs. The local council is in charge of deciding this. You are entitled to ask them for an assessment. Only those with modest means - assets of below Â£23,250 - are given any help. And even if you are, you may find yourself paying a top-up fee to get the care home of your choice if it costs more than your council is willing to pay. You obviously have more choice if you have to pay for yourself. But the price can be much higher - the average cost of a care home for a self-funder is Â£618 a week, compared with Â£486 paid for by councils. You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating. average amount of care provided per week, by your council average paid per hour by your council, 2014-15 average paid per hour in your region if you pay for your own care, 2016 You live in a care home that provides round-the-clock support with everyday tasks.      TBCpay for their own care  You live in a care home which provides round-the-clock support for everyday tasks and nursing care. Depending on your medical needs, the NHS may contribute to your costs.      TBCpay for their own care    Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there.  The move is permanent. Once in a care home, you are unlikely to be coming home. So experts suggest that people explore all the avenues before they take the plunge. There are a variety of options. High-intensity care in your own home for daily tasks such as washing, dressing and eating can avoid the need to move into a care home. Other avenues, which are growing in popularity, include getting live-in carers. There are about 150 shared-lives schemes in the country, two-thirds of which are run by councils. Then there are retirement villages where residents usually buy an apartment on the site, although in some schemes they can part-buy or even rent the property. People can pay for care and support services, which are on-site, as and when they need them. The properties on them have been designed to keep the individual living independently as long as possible and so can be kitted out with alarms, fall sensors and easily accessible showers. Such complexes are popular in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, but have yet to completely take off in the UK. There are fewer than 30,000 units in the UK. There are also many different types of sheltered-housing schemes. These have wardens, communal areas and, sometimes, run social events for residents. For those needing more support, extra-care sheltered housing may be available, where residents can have personal care and meals provided. The alternative options If you do decide to move into a home, there are two choices - a residential care home or nursing home. Latest figures show there are 220,000 nursing home beds, compared with nearly 240,000 care home ones. If you have a medical condition that requires a lot of care, a nursing home could be for you and you may find you are entitled to some NHS funding to cover the costs. Residential care homes do not have to employ nurses, although that does not mean there will be no input from health staff. Community nurses and GPs should both provide support to residents as they would to anyone in their own homes. But it may be worth asking what support there is available. A diagnosis of dementia does not necessarily mean you will get NHS funding, so you might want to check what help can be provided and what training there is for staff for such conditions. It may also be worth considering that you may need nursing support as you get older - some care homes will also have wings with nursing beds. And end-of-life care should also be a consideration - most people die within two years of moving into a home and good palliative care can avoid the need for potentially distressing trips back-and-forth to hospital. Dot and Colin Coulson One person who has found a great care home is Colin Coulson. He had to move his wife, Dot, 73, into a care home when her dementia worsened. Mr Coulson had been looking after her at home in Kent for five years before she needed to move into residential care. The first home she moved to was not good. ""It was understaffed, and it just wasn't right for Dot,"" he says. ""She had been in hospital, and it was all a bit of a rush to be honest."" He quickly decided to look for another - and, with more time, found Brambling House in Dover, which, he says, was ""lovely, friendly and welcoming"" from the start. ""I looked around on the internet. I read the inspection reports and looked at what support they could provide. ""I then went to visit the home. When we first arrived, we received a lovely, friendly welcome, as if they had known us for years. The other residents looked very happy and content, and the home is laid out to look and feel so homely. ""My wife was, of course, totally disorientated, but before we left, she had already been given a drink and a bowl of fruit salad. ""Everywhere we went in the home it was clean and tidy, and the staff we met were polite and made us very welcome. ""We were told by Sue, the manager, that their home was our home. ""Now five weeks on, we were completely right. If I had any advice for others I would say, 'Do a bit of research, visit the place and then trust your gut feeling.'"" A vital source of information is the library inspection reports produced by the Care Quality Commission. These - as well as a guide to which homes are close to you - can be foundhere,external. Each provides an overall rating and individual grades for safety, leadership, care, effectiveness and responsiveness. Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of care homes, urges people to check them. ""I ask my staff, when they are inspecting them, to apply the 'Mum test' - are they good enough for their mum or anyone they loved? ""That has guided our approach to inspections, and so the reports should provided a clear picture about the performance of the care."" There are other sources of information too. A browse of the internet will bring up a number of different guides to care homes that can also provide a picture of what to expect. Nothing, of course, actually beats seeing the care home for yourself. Caroline Abraham, of Age UK, says: ""Really take your time. Have a good walk around, talk to staff, families and managers. They will all provide you with a real insight into what it is like."" To help you, Age UK has produced a checklist of things to ask. Some of the suggested questions are: Can residents choose their daily routines? Are senior staff on duty at all times? What is the ratio of staff to residents? What is the annual turnover of staff? What dementia support is available? Do GPs visit the home? What is included in the fees? What meals are provided? ""Don't be afraid to ask awkward questions either - the answers will reveal a lot about the home,"" says Ms Abrahams.

An eyewitness said he heard a victim, who he believed was a delivery driver, ""screaming in pain"". One victim suffered ""life-changing injuries"".

Labour MP for East Ham Stephen Timmshas tabled an adjournment debate for Monday in the House of Commons,externalon the rise in the number of acid attacks. About a third of last year's acid attacks in the capital took place in the London borough of Newham, which is in his constituency. Mr Timms told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""most concerned about sulphuric acid"" and that carrying a bottle without justification should be treated as an offence, like carrying a knife. ""We could certainly come up with arrangements that would allow people to use sulphuric acid in the normal way, perhaps with the benefit of a licence. ""But simply walking around the street with a bottle of sulphuric acid, that should be an offence,"" he said. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister viewed acid attacks as ""horrific"". ""We are working with the police to see what more we could do. The prime minister's view is that the use of acid in this way is horrific."" Home Office minister Sarah Newton told BBC Radio 5 live Breakfast the government was considering tighter controls on some chemicals in response to the acid attacks in East London and elsewhere. But she said regulation would be difficult, as ""these chemicals are under everyone's kitchen sinks"". She said it was clear acid was being used ""as a weapon"" and work had been commissioned ""to understand the motivation"" of people who use it to injure others. She also said the government was examining sentencing for those who use acid to injure people. This video can not be played What should you do in case of a chemical burn?

Turkey's trauma after night of the tanks,"This video can not be played During the failed coup a man was run over twice by a tank and a crowd of people rushed to help Sabri Unal bears the scars of Turkey's failed coup - quite literally. On the night of 15 July last year, he joined thousands on the streets to resist the rogue soldiers attempting to seize control. ""I saw tanks approaching - so I threw myself to the ground to block the first one"", he said, pointing out the spot on the busy road. ""It didn't stop and it drove over me."" CCTV footage showed the miraculous moment that Sabri got up, the tracks of the tank having passed either side of him. Then a second tank came. He tried again - but this time it drove over his arm. Sabri still bears the scars of the night he was run over by a tank on 15 July ""I wasn't scared and I don't regret it,"" he told me. ""I came here for the sake of God - to gain his blessing."" He initially feared the doctors would amputate his arm. After a skin graft and three months in hospital, the scar covers half of his arm. ""To have been a hero, I would have had to stop the tanks"", Sabri said. ""I could have done far more."" It is just one of the iconic stories from arguably the gravest ever attack on the Turkish state. A brief guide to Turkey's coup Rebel troops bombed government buildings, including parliament, and opened fire on civilians. At least 260 people were killed but by dawn, the coup had collapsed. Turks took to the streets to challenge the heavily armed rebels as the coup unfolded A year on, the aftermath still convulses Turkey. More than 50,000 people have been arrested and about 150,000 dismissed or suspended, accused of links to the alleged mastermind: the US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who denies any involvement. His followers indeed worked in every corner of society - business, academia, the civil service and the media - but the government has been widely criticised for seizing the opportunity to crush all opponents, not just the plotters. President Erdogan called the coup attempt ""a gift from God"". Inside Erdogan's Turkey Rights groups outraged by Turkey arrests Turkey protesters stage long march against Erdogan ""There is a commission to look at all the cases of those separated from the state"", Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek told me. ""If there have been mistakes, the commission continues to rectify it. We have already reinstated thousands of civil servants."" He insisted that the government was acting lawfully in its response to the attempted putsch. ""We are actually saving Turkey's democracy, rule of law and future from a power-hungry criminal network,"" he said, referring to the Gulen movement. ""Nobody questioned the US after 9/11. The United Kingdom has suffered acts of terror and there's been a response to that."" This video can not be played Mark Lowen asked Turkeyâs Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek about the year since the coup I put it to him that no Western government facing terror attacks has arbitrarily dismissed tens of thousands of people without charge and imprisoned 150 journalists. ""Why don't you give Turkey the benefit of the doubt?"" he asked. ""Turkey deserves some empathy - it has been through a lot. You will ultimately see that democracy and the judiciary are working here."" Some caught up in the purge have simply disappeared. At home in Ankara, Emine Ozben broke down as she told me of her husband, Mustafa, who taught at a Gulen-linked university. Emine Ozben last saw her husband Mustafa Ozben in May On his way home in May, eyewitnesses say he was bundled into a car by masked men. He hasn't been since and the police have offered no information. Several other families have also reported similar kidnappings. Purged: The officers who cannot go home to Turkey The Turkish teachers on hunger strike 'Open, police!' The day a Turkish writer's life changed It is a dark reminder of the 1990s, when many Kurds disappeared at the height of the conflict between the Turkish state and Kurdish militants. ""I pray he's alive,"" said Emine, sobbing beside her six-month old daughter. ""I don't believe he backed the coup. If they want to prosecute him, do it legally - not by abduction. I can't raise my children without their father."" Others are trying to fight back, although under a state of emergency, resistance is limited. There are regular protests in Ankara to support two academics, Nuriye Gulmen and Semih Ozakca, who have been on hunger strike for over four months to demand their jobs back. They were struck off on alleged terrorism charges but given no details of any evidence against them, and later detained. Esra Ozakca (R) has gone on hunger strike in support of her husband The protests take place next to a human rights monument, itself sealed off and under police guard: a bleak metaphor for what has happened to Turkey. Semih's wife, Esra, is also on hunger strike in solidarity. ""One day, your name is on a list and you're struck off,"" she told me, before she too was arrested. ""Your life is turned upside down - you're killed off by the system."" Are Semih and Nuriye prepared to die for this cause, I ask. ""They want to live but for their demands to be met. I can't think of the alternative."" Posters in Istanbul proclaim the heroes of ""the legend of 15 July"" A life-and-death protest in the heart of a country trying to join the EU; an unprecedented nationwide purge; a bloody coup attempt and repeated terror attacks: Turkey's descent in the past three years has been extraordinary. Across the country, posters have gone up for the coup commemoration: slightly kitsch drawings of people confronting soldiers, beneath the motto ""the legend of 15 July"". For some, it marked Turkey's rebirth - a glorious moment in their history. But for others it is a painful chapter that is still being written.

Cheeki Rafiki yacht boss guilty over deaths,"Douglas Innes ran Stormforce Coaching, the company responsible for the Cheeki Rafiki The boss of a yachting firm has been found guilty of failing to ensure the safety of a boat which capsized in the Atlantic with the loss of four lives. Douglas Innes had been responsible for the Cheeki Rafiki, which lost its keel 700 miles off Nova Scotia in May 2014. His company, Stormforce Coaching, was also convicted of the same charge. The jury at Winchester Crown Court was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on four manslaughter charges, which will be the subject of a retrial. The guilty verdicts on the safety charges were by a majority of 10-1. The bodies of James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren, Paul Goslin have never been found Andrew Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, James Male, 22, from Southampton, Steve Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56, both from Somerset, had been returning the 40ft (12m) vessel to Southampton from Antigua Sailing Week when it capsized. The US Coastguard was criticised for calling off its search for the stricken vessel after two days, but it was restarted following intervention by the British government. The vessel was eventually found with the life raft but no sign of the four men. Their bodies have never been found. Jurors were told some of the bolts holding the keel in place had been broken for some time During the trial, Innes, 42, of Whitworth Crescent, Southampton, was accused of cost cutting and failing to get the vessel checked before the voyage. Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC told jurors the yacht had been given a ""category two"" code, which meant it was only authorised to be used commercially up to 60 miles away from a ""safe haven"", and the code certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy. The court also heard the vessel, which had grounded three times in three years, had an undetected fault with the bolts which held the keel to the hull. The vessel had been on its way to Southampton from Antigua Sailing Week Jurors were told that when Innes was contacted by Mr Bridge to inform him there was a problem on board Innes, who was in a pub at the time, did not inform the coastguard. Instead, he went to another pub where he was again contacted by Mr Bridge who told him the situation had worsened. Innes returned home, called the coastguard and emailed the crew suggesting they check the bolts of the keel. Mr Lickley said it later emerged that some of the bolts had been broken ""for some time"" before the yacht left the UK in October.

Five terror plots foiled in recent months,"Eight people died and dozens were injured in the London Bridge attack Several terror plots that ""were very close to an attack"" were thwarted ""within minutes"" of being carried out, London's most senior police officer has said. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick told LBC that five terror attacks had been prevented in the last few months. Four terror attacks have taken place in the UK in 2017 - three in the capital. Ms Dick, whotook charge of the Metin February, said the attacks in London and Manchester had been ""horrific"". She said a ""very large number of plots"" have been foiled over the last few years. Ms Dick said she could not reveal details about the nature of the terror plots because arrests had been made, but added: ""We've had a huge number of successful operations. ""It's well into the teens in the past couple of years, where we know people were intent on attacking and that's been stopped."" Ms Dick told LBC terror culprits were ""living in our communities and that's a problem for all of us"" She added: ""In addition, [police have made] hundreds and hundreds of arrests of people who are radicalised and are either spreading hatred or supporting terrorism and wanting to carry out a terror attack."" Ms Dick, who was previously the police's lead on counter-terrorism, praised officers for their response to the attacks. ""At London Bridge it was utterly astonishing,"" she said. The attackers - who killed eight people on London Bridge and in nearby Borough Market - were shot dead by armed police within eight minutes of the first emergency call. Westminster Bridge on 22 March: Six people died, including the attacker, and at least 50 were injured when Khalid Masood drove a car into pedestrians and stabbed a policeman Manchester Arena on 22 May: Bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 people and injured 116 in a suicide attack at an Ariana Grande concert London Bridge on 3 June: Eight people were killed when three men drove a van into pedestrians on the bridge and launched a knife attack in nearby Borough Market Finsbury Park on 19 June: A van drove into a group of worshippers close to a north London mosque, where one person - who had been taken ill before the attack - died and nine were taken to hospital Ms Dick, who hascalled for more funding in the wake of recent attacks, said police officers relied on information from local communities to identify terror suspects. ""We clearly need a lot more [information] because what has happened in the last few months alone is horrific,"" she said. ""We are undoubtedly seeking examples of people who have carried out attacks or people who are violent extremists,"" she added.

Yacht boss guilty after Cheeki Rafiki deaths,"Douglas Innes ran Stormforce Coaching, the company responsible for the Cheeki Rafiki The boss of a yachting firm has been found guilty of failing to ensure the safety of a boat which capsized in the Atlantic with the loss of four lives. Douglas Innes had been responsible for the Cheeki Rafiki, which lost its keel 700 miles off Nova Scotia in May 2014. His company, Stormforce Coaching, was also convicted of the same charge. The jury at Winchester Crown Court was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on four manslaughter charges, which will be the subject of a retrial. The guilty verdicts on the safety charges were by a majority of 10-1. The bodies of James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren, Paul Goslin have never been found Andrew Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, James Male, 22, from Southampton, Steve Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56, both from Somerset, had been returning the 40ft (12m) vessel to Southampton from Antigua Sailing Week when it capsized. The US Coastguard was criticised for calling off its search for the stricken vessel after two days, but it was restarted following intervention by the British government. The vessel was eventually found with the life raft but no sign of the four men. Their bodies have never been found. Jurors were told some of the bolts holding the keel in place had been broken for some time During the trial, Innes, 42, of Whitworth Crescent, Southampton, was accused of cost cutting and failing to get the vessel checked before the voyage. Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC told jurors the yacht had been given a ""category two"" code, which meant it was only authorised to be used commercially up to 60 miles away from a ""safe haven"", and the code certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy. The court also heard the vessel, which had grounded three times in three years, had an undetected fault with the bolts which held the keel to the hull. The vessel had been on its way to Southampton from Antigua Sailing Week Jurors were told that when Innes was contacted by Mr Bridge to inform him there was a problem on board Innes, who was in a pub at the time, did not inform the coastguard. Instead, he went to another pub where he was again contacted by Mr Bridge who told him the situation had worsened. Innes returned home, called the coastguard and emailed the crew suggesting they check the bolts of the keel. Mr Lickley said it later emerged that some of the bolts had been broken ""for some time"" before the yacht left the UK in October.

The Chinese dissident memorialised in social art,"Artist Badiucao's cartoon commemorating Liu Xiaobo's death, called Final Freedom Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo was an inspiring figure for a new generation of Chinese pro-democracy activists and his death is being remembered by political artists. Many activists saw him as a godfather for their cause, and have paid tribute to a man who was branded a criminal by Chinese authorities for his activism and jailed several times for ""subversion"". One source of inspiration was the well-documented love between Liu Xiaobo and his wife, Liu Xia, who has also been placed under house arrest. Who was Liu Xiaobo? Love that survived a labour camp This image of them, which was circulated recently by their activist friends, particularly resounded with many. It has prompted several artworks paying tribute to their love, such as this one by political artist Badiucao, entitled The Patient of China. The Australia-based artist also put up a version of the work on a wall on Hosier Lane in Melbourne on Wednesday, calling for Mr Liu's release. Prominent political cartoonist Rebel Pepper drewand tweeted,externalan alternative take on the photo. Chinese cartoonist Xiaoguai also drew inspiration from the same picture andtweeted,externalthis image of two candles symbolising the couple. In 2010, Mr Liu was not allowed to travel to Sweden to receive his Nobel Peace Prize. An image of his empty chair has been inspiration for artists - such as in this work by Badiucao. Rebel Pepper meanwhile drew a tribute to the chair with Liu Xiaobo's striped pyjamas. In Hong Kong, where activists had been calling for Mr Liu's release, 17-year-old student Anson Hui told AFP news agency earlier this week that he feared what Mr Liu's death would mean. ""I feel scared. If we lose Liu Xiaobo, nobody could replace him... If there's no Liu Xiaobo we can't unite the whole world to speak out. ""The world will lose a spiritual leader.""

Legal highs and chemsex to be targeted,"New legislation to tackle ""legal highs"" was introduced last year So-called legal highs and chemsex drugs will be targeted in a government move aimed at cutting illicit drug use. Fewer than one in ten adults in England and Wales now take drugs, according to the Home Office, but drug-related deaths have risen sharply. The strategy,externalwill target psychoactive substances, performance-enhancing drugs and the misuse of prescribed medicines. Drugs charities praised the strategy's focus on recovery, but raised concerns that budget cuts could affect delivery. The strategy applies across England, with some elements spreading to Wales and Scotland. New psychoactive substances (NPS), formerly known as legal highs, mimic the effects of other drugs, such as cannabis. This video can not be played Harry Shapiro, from Drugwise, says drugs on the streets are ""at the highest purity levels"" Last year,laws were introducedto criminalise the production, distribution, sale and supply of them, but they continue to fall into the hands of users. Chemsex- using drugs as part of sexual activity - often involves crystal methamphetamine, GHB/GBL and mephedrone. Government studies show the practice increases health risks, both mentally and physically, including aiding the spread of blood-borne infections and viruses. It comes as the number of drug deaths in England and Wales increased by 10.3% to 2,479 in 2015, following rises of 14.9% in 2014 and 19.6% in 2013. Home Office statistics show the number of adults aged between 16 and 59 who take drugs is at now at 8% - a 2.5% drop from 10 years ago. In December 2010, with Home Office priorities centred on police reform and immigration, the last government drug strategy felt like a box-ticking exercise. Just 25 pages long, it contained little detail or original thinking and just one paragraph on the problem that was later to engulf prisons, legal highs. The theme of the last strategy was supporting people to live a ""drug-free life"". It emphasised the need for ""abstinence"" and said too many users were reliant on drug-substitute treatments such as methadone. The 2017 strategy makes no mention of abstinence or limiting methadone use, but it sets more demanding and wide-ranging measurements of treatment success. At double the length of the previous document, there is a sense that the Home Office is more focused on the issue than before, prompted perhaps by the recent rise in drug deaths and the need to prevent a new generation of drug users sparking a fresh crime-wave. The strategy includes: The appointment of a national ""champion"" to help increase drug recovery rates More ""targeted interventions"" to give addicts a ""tailored"" treatment, with employment, health and housing support New education programmes for young people to highlight the dangers of drug use Stronger border controls and greater intelligence sharing with other countries Support for prison officers help drug offenders recover in prisons Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who will chair a new cross-government drug strategy board, said she was ""determined to confront the scale of this issue"". The chief executive of the drug treatment campaign Collective Voice, Paul Hayes, welcomed the fact that recovery was being put ""at the heart"" of the government's response. While also welcoming the shift in the government's focus, Harry Shapiro, director of online advice service DrugWise, said he was concerned about a lack of funding. ""It has shifted from the 2010 strategy [when] there was an emphasis that recovery from addiction was just about abstinence,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Anyone working in the sector knew that that wasn't the case, because if you are going to recover, you have got to have something to recover to. ""The government has recognised that more needs to be done in that area, but it all has to be delivered at a local level and local authorities are struggling with budgets, drug services are suffering from cuts."" Ron Hogg, the Police and Crime and Victims Commissioner in County Durham, said he agreed with a focus on helping users recover, but said it was ""shameful"" the strategy did not look into decriminalising drugs. He said that in Portugal - where drugs were decriminalised 12 years ago - drug use, drug-related deaths and the number of people injecting had all fallen. Home Office Minister Sarah Newton said she had looked at arguments for decriminalisation, but added: ""When you look at all the other available evidence, we just don't agree."" The National Police Chiefs' Council's lead for drugs, Commander Simon Bray said police ""will play our part"" in delivering the plan.

Footballer Jermain Defoe, who forged a strong bond with Bradley, joined his family in the cortege. The service, held at St Joseph's Church in the village, paid tribute to an ""incredible little boy with a huge personality"". The funeral cortege was led out by a bagpiper An emotional Jermain Defoe wore an England shirt bearing Bradley's name Ex Sunderland boss David Moyes was among the high-profile names from football in attendance Roads leading to the church were decked with balloons and tributes. Messages and mementos were also left outside Sunderland's Stadium of Light. Speakers broadcast the funeral service to the crowds outside the church who were unable to make it inside. Bradley's family wore football shirts in honour of his love of the sport. See more on this and other stories on our Local Live page. His mother, Gemma, told the congregation: ""He had a smile so big and beautiful it could brighten any room. A real brave superhero, he left us all too soon. ""He touched the hearts of many - the most inspirational boy. A loving, caring son and brother - a beautiful star. ""Although your time with us was short, you must have a job to do in heaven with the angels as God has chosen you. ""For now my baby we'll say goodbye. We'll meet again our superhero high up in the sky.""

""As a big football fan, Bradley saw that sport teaches us the basic life lesson that one must get up after getting knocked down. It taught him to never ever quit."" A vigil and minute's applause were also held at Grey's Monument in Newcastle city centre to coincide with the funeral, while balloons were released at the Sunderland's ground. A single piper led the funeral procession and the applause down the street could be heard well before the horse and carriage carrying Bradley's coffin could be seen. It was preceded by a collection of superheroes - including Batman, Spider-Man and Captain America. Bradley's parents, Gemma and Carl, followed the hearse and behind them came footballer Jermain Defoe - who had flown back in from a pre-season training camp in Spain. There followed a number of players and staff from Bradley's beloved Sunderland. At the family's request, hundreds wore football shirts including the red and white of Sunderland, black and white of Newcastle, blue of Everton and green and white of Celtic.

Farron: I decided to quit before election,"This video can not be played Tim Farron told 5 live's Emma Barnett he ""had a cry"" when his 15-year-old texted him Outgoing Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has revealed he decided to quit several weeks before the general election but did not announce his decision publicly. Mr Farron said he had put the decision ""to bed"" about two weeks into the campaign, and denied deceiving voters by continuing to fight the election. ""I absolutely threw everything at it,"" he said. He announced his departure six days after polling day, saying he was ""torn"" between the leadership and his faith. The Tim Farron story Farron quits over clash between faith and politics The Liberal Democrats increased their tally of seats from nine to 12 at last month's general election, but their vote share fell from 7.9% to 7.4%. In an interview with BBC Radio 5 live's Emma Barnett, Mr Farron said that under his leadership, the party had ""left intensive care and is back relevant"". ""My job was to save the party,"" he said. ""The Liberal Democrats still exist and we're moving forward."" Mr Farron faced repeated questions about his views on gay sex during the campaign, and when he announced his resignation, said he had found it impossible to be a committed Christian and lead a ""progressive liberal party"". Asked about his decision to quit, he said he had not wanted to ""become the story"". ""I made the decision about two weeks into the election campaign,"" he said. ""I thought there isn't a way forward out of this without me either compromising or just causing damage to the party in the long run."" This video can not be played Tim Farron: Living as a Christian and being a political leader 'has felt impossible' He said he had told himself to ""put that into a drawer, don't talk to anybody else about it, get on and do as good a job as you can during the election"". Mr Farron said this had ""not in the slightest"" deceived voters, adding that ""in every election there is a reasonable chance that leaders will step down"". ""I just thought 'I am here to do a job,'"" he said. A leadership contest is under way to replace Mr Farron - and with a week to go before nominations close, just one candidate, former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable, has come forward. Mr Farron - who criticised Theresa May's unopposed ""coronation"" as Tory leader - said Sir Vince had already been subject to ""plenty of scrutiny"". ""If there's only one candidate, then that's how it is,"" he added.

Israeli police killed in Jerusalem attack,"This video can not be played The attackers were shot dead after being pursued into the sacred compound Two Israeli policemen have been killed and a third wounded in a shooting attack near a sacred site in Jerusalem. They were shot by three Israeli Arabs close to the compound known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary). Police chased the attackers into the site and shot them dead. There has been a wave of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings of Israelis predominantly by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs since late 2015. Two of the previous attackers were Jordanians. Sgt Maj Hail Sattawi (left) and Sgt Maj Kamil Shanan died of their wounds Identity cards, believed to belong to the attackers, were pictured at the site Police say the three men who carried out Friday's attack were aged between 19 and 29 and came from the northern Israeli city of Umm al-Fahm.  Israel's Shin Bet security agency said that they were not previously known to the security services. Jerusalem's flashpoint holy site What makes Jerusalem so holy? Is Palestinian-Israeli violence being driven by social media? Police say the gunmen opened fire as they made their way from the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif towards Lions' Gate, an opening in the Old City walls about 100ft (30 metres) away. The attackers were then pursued back to the compound, where they were killed. Mobile phone footage showed at least one of the attackers in a confrontation with members of the security forces in the holy site before being shot. The two policemen who died of their injuries in hospital were named as Advanced Staff Sergeant Major Kamil Shanan, aged 22, and Advanced Staff Sergeant Major Hail Sattawi, who was 30. They were Druze from Israel's northern Galilee region. Tom Bateman, BBC's Jerusalem correspondent The Old City has often been a flashpoint in the conflict, which since the autumn of 2015 has seen an increase in violence involving attacks often carried out by lone individuals. But an attack with guns by multiple assailants in the vicinity of the heavily guarded holy site, a very sensitive location, is highly unusual in recent times. And the confirmation from Israel's security agency that the attackers were Israeli Arab citizens of Umm Al Fahm, and not previously known to the authorities, will also cause concern about the ability of Israel to prevent such incidents. For the Israeli government, the event has crossed ""red lines"" and there will be fears of an increase in tensions following the severity of the attack and the rare decision to close the site. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was ""a sad day in which our Druze brothers pay the heaviest price in our joint mission to protect the security of our country. I salute them and their heroism"". Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack in a phone call to Mr Netanyahu, the prime minister's office said. Mr Netanyahu has previously accused the Palestinian leader of failing to denounce such attacks. Worshippers held Friday prayers outside Lions' Gate after police shut the holy site In the wake of the incident, police sealed off the site to search it for weapons. It is the first time in decades that the compound, which contains the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, has been closed for Muslim Friday prayers, which normally draws thousands of worshippers. The site is administered by an Islamic authority (Waqf), though Israel is in charge of security there. Police are investigating how the attackers managed to smuggle in a handgun, sub-machine gun and knife. The Palestinian Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Hussein, who had urged worshippers to defy the closure, was detained by police, but later released. His son said the cleric was not facing any charges over his call for Muslims to converge on Jerusalem. Elsewhere, a Palestinian was shot dead in clashes with Israeli forces at a refugee camp near Bethlehem on Friday, Palestinian sources said. Barra Hamamdeh, 21, was killed during a raid by troops on the Dheisheh camp, the Palestinian Wafa news agency reported. The Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif is the holiest site in Judaism and third holiest in Islam and is one of the most politically sensitive sacred places in the world. It is located in East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. Israel considers the entire city its sovereign capital, while Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of their sought-after future state. The attack happened despite heightened security around the Old City in Jerusalem Israel's Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said the attack was ""a serious and severe event in which red lines were crossed"", adding that security arrangements in and around the site would be reviewed. No group has said it was responsible, though the militant Palestinian Hamas movement, which runs the Gaza Strip, praised the attack as a ""natural response to the Zionist ongoing crimes"". The shooting comes weeks after an Israeli policewoman was killed in a knife and gun attack outside the Old City by three Palestinians from the occupied West Bank. Forty-four Israelis and five foreign nationals have been killed in nearly two years of such attacks. At least 255 Palestinians - most of them attackers, Israel says - have also been killed in that period, news agencies report. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops. Israel says Palestinian incitement has fuelled the attacks. The Palestinian leadership has blamed frustration rooted in decades of Israeli occupation. Jerusalem's flashpoint holy site.

Building rules review after Grenfell fire,"Grenfell Tower Officials have begun preparations for a major review of building regulations in England, Newsnight has learned. The decision reflects official alarm at the state of building safety in the wake of last month's Grenfell Tower fire, in which at least 80 people died. As results of checks on tall buildings have come in, civil servants have expressed shock at how the official rulebooks have been interpreted. They remain unclear whether the problem is the rules or their enforcement. Over the past month, officials in the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) have sought both to explain how the catastrophe at the Grenfell Tower in west London came about, and why so many other buildings have been found to have problems with fire safety. It is not clear when the government review will be officially announced, but it is likely that it will be complicated by the ongoing police investigations and the public inquiry. Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Tower tragedy caused by 'years of neglect' Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? The three processes may need to investigate some overlapping questions. The discovery, in particular, that combustible material has been installed on a wide range of tall local authority and housing association buildings has alarmed officials. While it is permissible to use combustible insulation on buildings of more than 18m in height, it must follow strict guidelines. Cladding must follow principles which are designed to help prevent fires from spreading across the exterior of buildings. To get cladding signed off by building inspectors, it must follow one of a few routes. Newsnight has identified weaknesses in each of them. Cladding from tower blocks has been tested in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire First, the regulations state that materials used in the construction of the cladding can all be either ""non-combustible"" or of ""limited combustibility"". This is the so-called ""prescriptive"" route to getting sign-off and is the simplest route to compliance. If every part attached to the exterior of the building meets this standard - which, in practice, means they cannot catch or spread fire - no further action is needed. This, at least, is how the rule is interpreted by the government and sector bodies, such as the Building Control Alliance. But ambiguous drafting in the building regulations mean that some developers, cladders and architects have assumed that this rule only applied to the insulation on the outsides of buildings, not the exterior of the cladding. Adrian Buckmaster, director of TetraClad, a cladding company, said: ""The government is now... saying that both the insulation layer and the outer layer they believe should be of a... non-combustible class, whereas if I read the documents as they are at the moment, the clauses specifically say just the insulation and the outer layer is a completely different standard."" London fire: Six questions for the investigation How are fires fought in high-rise blocks? Reality Check: Why don't all high-rises have sprinklers? Second, if you wish to use materials that cannot meet the prescriptive route, you can commission a fire test. This entails building a mock-up of your proposed design and then lighting a fire beneath it to see what happens. The evidence gathered by this process can then be used to persuade building inspectors. But some industry figures have told Newsnight that they fear this process, officially the ""BS 8414"" test, is not sufficiently robust. A critical concern is that the test is based on a perfectly installed portion of wall. In reality, items that have been installed imperfectly or suffered wear and tear may be much more vulnerable to fire. Philip Preston of IF P&C Insurance, a company that has commissioned its own tests, explained ""We were concerned that the laboratory tests... didn't really reflect the risk in the real world. ""The buildings are not perfect and the panels are not perfect... Through the lifetime of the building, they get damaged and that exposes the insulating material."" Third, people can commission so-called ""desktop studies"". If an engineer believes your proposed design is very similar to something that has already been tested, you need not test it again. The purpose of this route is to avoid testing functionally similar designs unnecessarily. But Newsnight found engineers arguing that the results oftests using ceramic tiles could be used instead of tests on designs using aluminium composite panels- a very different material. Fire safety experts consulted by Newsnight said that the documents ""extrapolated apples into oranges"". There are broader problems, too. This part of the system also has problems with confidentiality: the fire test results - and any desktop studies - are confidential to the sponsoring organisation, who is usually the manufacturer. Developers must, therefore, rely on often vague product information that they choose to distribute. Newsnight also revealed how a major sector body and building inspection agency stated it would sign off the use of combustible insulation and combustible aluminium panels in a range of circumstanceswithout even commissioning a desktop study. This was, they said, on the basis of the volume of fire-test data and desktop studies that they had reviewed. But NHBC, the body in question, has now suspended this guidance. Building control officers, industry figures and fire engineers have separately told Newsnight of their concerns about fire safety issues. These range from specific concerns about cladding, fire doors and paints through to whether the materials that are sold to builders are always the same as the materials supplied to laboratories for testing.

Turkey's trauma after 'night of the tanks',"This video can not be played During the failed coup a man was run over twice by a tank and a crowd of people rushed to help Sabri Unal bears the scars of Turkey's failed coup - quite literally. On the night of 15 July last year, he joined thousands on the streets to resist the rogue soldiers attempting to seize control. ""I saw tanks approaching - so I threw myself to the ground to block the first one"", he said, pointing out the spot on the busy road. ""It didn't stop and it drove over me."" CCTV footage showed the miraculous moment that Sabri got up, the tracks of the tank having passed either side of him. Then a second tank came. He tried again - but this time it drove over his arm. Sabri still bears the scars of the night he was run over by a tank on 15 July ""I wasn't scared and I don't regret it,"" he told me. ""I came here for the sake of God - to gain his blessing."" He initially feared the doctors would amputate his arm. After a skin graft and three months in hospital, the scar covers half of his arm. ""To have been a hero, I would have had to stop the tanks"", Sabri said. ""I could have done far more."" It is just one of the iconic stories from arguably the gravest ever attack on the Turkish state. A brief guide to Turkey's coup Rebel troops bombed government buildings, including parliament, and opened fire on civilians. At least 260 people were killed but by dawn, the coup had collapsed. Turks took to the streets to challenge the heavily armed rebels as the coup unfolded A year on, the aftermath still convulses Turkey. More than 50,000 people have been arrested and about 150,000 dismissed or suspended, accused of links to the alleged mastermind: the US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who denies any involvement. His followers indeed worked in every corner of society - business, academia, the civil service and the media - but the government has been widely criticised for seizing the opportunity to crush all opponents, not just the plotters. President Erdogan called the coup attempt ""a gift from God"". Inside Erdogan's Turkey Rights groups outraged by Turkey arrests Turkey protesters stage long march against Erdogan ""There is a commission to look at all the cases of those separated from the state"", Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek told me. ""If there have been mistakes, the commission continues to rectify it. We have already reinstated thousands of civil servants."" He insisted that the government was acting lawfully in its response to the attempted putsch. ""We are actually saving Turkey's democracy, rule of law and future from a power-hungry criminal network,"" he said, referring to the Gulen movement. ""Nobody questioned the US after 9/11. The United Kingdom has suffered acts of terror and there's been a response to that."" This video can not be played Mark Lowen asked Turkeyâs Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek about the year since the coup I put it to him that no Western government facing terror attacks has arbitrarily dismissed tens of thousands of people without charge and imprisoned 150 journalists. ""Why don't you give Turkey the benefit of the doubt?"" he asked. ""Turkey deserves some empathy - it has been through a lot. You will ultimately see that democracy and the judiciary are working here."" Some caught up in the purge have simply disappeared. At home in Ankara, Emine Ozben broke down as she told me of her husband, Mustafa, who taught at a Gulen-linked university. Emine Ozben last saw her husband Mustafa Ozben in May On his way home in May, eyewitnesses say he was bundled into a car by masked men. He hasn't been since and the police have offered no information. Several other families have also reported similar kidnappings. Purged: The officers who cannot go home to Turkey The Turkish teachers on hunger strike 'Open, police!' The day a Turkish writer's life changed It is a dark reminder of the 1990s, when many Kurds disappeared at the height of the conflict between the Turkish state and Kurdish militants. ""I pray he's alive,"" said Emine, sobbing beside her six-month old daughter. ""I don't believe he backed the coup. If they want to prosecute him, do it legally - not by abduction. I can't raise my children without their father."" Others are trying to fight back, although under a state of emergency, resistance is limited. There are regular protests in Ankara to support two academics, Nuriye Gulmen and Semih Ozakca, who have been on hunger strike for over four months to demand their jobs back. They were struck off on alleged terrorism charges but given no details of any evidence against them, and later detained. Esra Ozakca (R) has gone on hunger strike in support of her husband The protests take place next to a human rights monument, itself sealed off and under police guard: a bleak metaphor for what has happened to Turkey. Semih's wife, Esra, is also on hunger strike in solidarity. ""One day, your name is on a list and you're struck off,"" she told me, before she too was arrested. ""Your life is turned upside down - you're killed off by the system."" Are Semih and Nuriye prepared to die for this cause, I ask. ""They want to live but for their demands to be met. I can't think of the alternative."" Posters in Istanbul proclaim the heroes of ""the legend of 15 July"" A life-and-death protest in the heart of a country trying to join the EU; an unprecedented nationwide purge; a bloody coup attempt and repeated terror attacks: Turkey's descent in the past three years has been extraordinary. Across the country, posters have gone up for the coup commemoration: slightly kitsch drawings of people confronting soldiers, beneath the motto ""the legend of 15 July"". For some, it marked Turkey's rebirth - a glorious moment in their history. But for others it is a painful chapter that is still being written.

Rooney mania grips East Africa,"This video can not be played Wayne Rooney: Returning Everton striker scores long-range goal in friendly Wayne Rooney marked his second debut for Everton with a stunning goal after receiving a raucous welcome from the 35,000 crowd at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Rooney had the first touch of the game between Everton and Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia and scored after 35 minutes, lifting a clever effort over the home goalkeeper from 25 yards. The goal was even cheered by fans of the opposing team, with one dressed in a Manchester United shirt forcing the game to be stopped after invading the pitch to give Rooney a hug. The former England captain responded by returning the favour before the fan was bundled off the pitch. Everton ultimately won the match 2-1, with Kieran Dowell scoring a later winner after Jacques Tuyisenge levelled for the hosts. Many fans - some of whom travelled from the neighbouring East African nations of Kenya and Uganda - chanted ""Rooney, Rooney"" as the players left the stadium at the end of their two-day stint in Tanzania. Rooney was replaced at half-time and several Gor Mahia players stopped him to pose for photographs after the final whistle before he was escorted away. Everton winger Aaron Lennon also made his first appearance since February 11 after receiving treatment for a stress-related illness. Gor Mahia earned the right to play Everton after winning the regional SportPesa Super Cup, which pitted teams from Tanzania against those from Kenya. Kenyan betting firm SportPesa sponsors both Kenya's and Tanzania's top-flight leagues and were confirmed as Everton's new shirt sponsor in May. Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories How a footballer became Africa's first Cognac maker When Everton found Rooney - the inside story Rooney's unfinished business at Everton Everton have been given royal treatment since they arrived in the East African state. The wild chants for Rooney, along with stomping performances by Maasai cultural dancers, created a spectacle to behold. Everton's Democratic Republic of Congo winger Yannick Bolasie rivalled Rooney, England's former captain, in the popularity stakes with a band of Congolese fans welcoming him to Tanzania. They were draped in T-shirts emblazoned with his face. However, Rooney, who has rejoined Everton after 13 years at Manchester United, was the fans' favourite. Even Tanzania's Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan attested to this. ""Wayne Rooney made me support Manchester United and now I don't know what to do because he has gone back to Everton,"" she said. Rooney replied: ""Being here, it has been a new experience for me and I hope the vice-president will now be able to support Everton."" On Wednesday, Everton's Mo Besic, Tom Davies and newly-signed Michael Keane joined Albino United in a training session in the coastal city of Dar es Salaam, soon after they landed. The visit was aimed at helping to break the stigma against people with albinism who risk being killed in Tanzania. ""From spending time with them today, I have learnt that the players go through some tough times. It's not easy for them over here,"" said Keane, who made his debut in the second half. ""It's good that they can enjoy football and look forward to playing together. You can see their coach is really good with them.""

Strategy targets legal highs and chemsex,"New legislation to tackle ""legal highs"" was introduced last year So-called legal highs and chemsex drugs will be targeted in a government move aimed at cutting illicit drug use. Fewer than one in ten adults in England and Wales now take drugs, according to the Home Office, but drug-related deaths have risen sharply. The strategy,externalwill target psychoactive substances, performance-enhancing drugs and the misuse of prescribed medicines. Drugs charities praised the strategy's focus on recovery, but raised concerns that budget cuts could affect delivery. The strategy applies across England, with some elements spreading to Wales and Scotland. New psychoactive substances (NPS), formerly known as legal highs, mimic the effects of other drugs, such as cannabis. This video can not be played Harry Shapiro, from Drugwise, says drugs on the streets are ""at the highest purity levels"" Last year,laws were introducedto criminalise the production, distribution, sale and supply of them, but they continue to fall into the hands of users. Chemsex- using drugs as part of sexual activity - often involves crystal methamphetamine, GHB/GBL and mephedrone. Government studies show the practice increases health risks, both mentally and physically, including aiding the spread of blood-borne infections and viruses. It comes as the number of drug deaths in England and Wales increased by 10.3% to 2,479 in 2015, following rises of 14.9% in 2014 and 19.6% in 2013. Home Office statistics show the number of adults aged between 16 and 59 who take drugs is at now at 8% - a 2.5% drop from 10 years ago. In December 2010, with Home Office priorities centred on police reform and immigration, the last government drug strategy felt like a box-ticking exercise. Just 25 pages long, it contained little detail or original thinking and just one paragraph on the problem that was later to engulf prisons, legal highs. The theme of the last strategy was supporting people to live a ""drug-free life"". It emphasised the need for ""abstinence"" and said too many users were reliant on drug-substitute treatments such as methadone. The 2017 strategy makes no mention of abstinence or limiting methadone use, but it sets more demanding and wide-ranging measurements of treatment success. At double the length of the previous document, there is a sense that the Home Office is more focused on the issue than before, prompted perhaps by the recent rise in drug deaths and the need to prevent a new generation of drug users sparking a fresh crime-wave. The strategy includes: The appointment of a national ""champion"" to help increase drug recovery rates More ""targeted interventions"" to give addicts a ""tailored"" treatment, with employment, health and housing support New education programmes for young people to highlight the dangers of drug use Stronger border controls and greater intelligence sharing with other countries Support for prison officers help drug offenders recover in prisons Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who will chair a new cross-government drug strategy board, said she was ""determined to confront the scale of this issue"". The chief executive of the drug treatment campaign Collective Voice, Paul Hayes, welcomed the fact that recovery was being put ""at the heart"" of the government's response. While also welcoming the shift in the government's focus, Harry Shapiro, director of online advice service DrugWise, said he was concerned about a lack of funding. ""It has shifted from the 2010 strategy [when] there was an emphasis that recovery from addiction was just about abstinence,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Anyone working in the sector knew that that wasn't the case, because if you are going to recover, you have got to have something to recover to. ""The government has recognised that more needs to be done in that area, but it all has to be delivered at a local level and local authorities are struggling with budgets, drug services are suffering from cuts."" Ron Hogg, the Police and Crime and Victims Commissioner in County Durham, said he agreed with a focus on helping users recover, but said it was ""shameful"" the strategy did not look into decriminalising drugs. He said that in Portugal - where drugs were decriminalised 12 years ago - drug use, drug-related deaths and the number of people injecting had all fallen. Home Office Minister Sarah Newton said she had looked at arguments for decriminalisation, but added: ""When you look at all the other available evidence, we just don't agree."" The National Police Chiefs' Council's lead for drugs, Commander Simon Bray said police ""will play our part"" in delivering the plan.

AirBnB host fined for refusing Asian,"Dyne Suh spoke emotionally about the incident after her room was cancelled An AirBnB host who made a racist comment to an Asian guest has been fined $5,000 - and told she must attend a course on Asian-American studies. Tami Barker cancelled Dyne Suhâs booking, telling her in a message: ""One word says it all. Asian.â The fine was imposed due to a new agreement between AirBnB and Californiaâs Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). It lets the DFEH examine hosts that have had discrimination complaints. AirBnB is a service that allows members of the public to rent out spare rooms, or entire properties, to visitors. The measures followed research and anecdotal evidence that suggested certain races found itmore difficult to book rooms than others. AirBnB has acknowledged it faces a challenge to combat racial discrimination on the service The fine and demand to attend a course, as well as community service with a civil rights organisation, marks the first time the landmark agreement has been used to punish an AirBnB host. ""The host walked into this mediation with an attitude of contribution,â Kevin Kish, director of the DFEH, told the BBC. ""That opened the door to a lot of creative thinking."" Cancelled Ms Barker cancelled Ms Suhâs booking shortly before the 26-year-old was due to arrive at the location in Big Bear, California, the DFEH said. In messages sent via the AirBnB app, Ms Barker said: ""I wouldnât rent it to u if u were the last person on earth.â Later, she added: âI will not allow this country to be told what to do by foreignersâ and âItâs why we have Trumpâ. In a recording made just after the accommodation was cancelled, Ms Suhgave an emotional account of what had happened,external. ""It stings that after living in the US for over 23 years, this is what happens,â she said. ""No matter how well I treat others, it doesnât matter. If youâre Asian, youâre less than human. People can treat you like trash.â According to the Guardian,external, a lawyer for Ms Barker said she regretted her behaviour, and that the DFEHâs action will hopefully be a ""positive outcome out of an unfortunate incidentâ. âFundamentally goodâ Ms Suh got in touch with the DFEH to make a complaint. The department is now working with AirBnB to make it clearer to discriminated-against guests that there is a strong complaints procedure. ""Not everybody knows that weâre here,â the DFEHâs Mr Kish told the BBC. ""People donât intuitively know where to turn. In the agreement that we reached with Airbnb, they will mandatorily provide guests with information about us.â However, such close ties only currently exist in California, AirBnBâs home state, where regulators have been aggressive in clamping down on various issues that have arisen from the companyâs growth. ""Thereâs nothing to prevent other states - or other countries - from reaching similar agreements.  Itâs going to create work for AirBnB, but I donât think people create one of these platforms with the intent that people will discriminate. I think it can come as a surprise to some of these founders,â Mr Kish said. He added that he was impressed with the way in which AirBnB was dealing with the issue ""head on"". In an interview with the BBC last year, AirBnB co-founder Brian Chesky said: ""We started this company with the belief people are fundamentally good. ""Mostly everyone is really good, but when you have 100 million people, there are some who donât believe in what you believe in."" ___________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Airbnb account hijackers burgle homes.
