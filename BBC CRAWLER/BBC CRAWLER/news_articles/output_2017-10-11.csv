Village pub 'best restaurant in world',"The family-owned pub is on the edge of the North York Moors A village pub has been named the best restaurant in the world in an international poll based on customer reviews. The Black Swan in Oldstead, North Yorkshire, beat Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck and Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir. TripAdvisor said it was the first time a British restaurant had won the title since the awards began in 2012. Blanc's Belmond Le Manoir Aux Quat'Saisons in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, came second. The travel website said the winner was selected based on the millions of reviews and opinions collected on the site over a 12-month period. Tommy Banks became the UK's youngest chef to win a Michelin star at the age of 24 The Black Swan, which has a Michelin star and 4 AA Rosettes, is a family-owned pub on the edge of the North York Moors, near Thirsk. It is run by the UK's youngest Michelin-starred chef Tommy Banks, who won the accolade four years ago at the age of 24, and his brother James. Head chef Tommy said: ""It's a huge honour to win this award, but what makes it really special is that it's been awarded because of feedback from our customers."" MartÃ­n Berasategui in Spain has held the title since 2015. Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck came 12th in the website's Travellers' Choice Favourite Fine Dining Restaurants Worldwide poll. TripAdvisor said the awards differed from others as they were based on feedback from guests and ""not based on a small judging panel"". The worldwide poll 1.

Queen will not lay Remembrance wreath,"It will be the first time the Queen has not laid the wreath since 1999 The Queen will not lay a wreath at the Cenotaph this year as part of the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremony. She will watch the event on 12 November in Whitehall from the balcony of the Foreign Office with Prince Philip. Prince Charles will take her place in laying the floral tribute on behalf of the nation, along with the Duke of Edinburgh's equerry. The Queen has not laid wreaths in six previous ceremonies since her coronation. Two were during her pregnancies with Prince Andrew, in 1959, and Prince Edward, in 1963. The other four occasions were when she was on visits abroad -  in 1961, when she was in Ghana, in 1968, when in Brazil, in 1983, when in Kenya and in 1999, when in South Africa. It will be the first time, as head of state, that the Queen will observe the ceremony from a nearby balcony. The Queen traditionally lays the wreath at the Cenotaph on behalf of the nation Royal officials told the BBC that the Queen chose to ask her eldest son and heir to carry out the royal duty. It will be the second time the Prince of Wales has laid the wreath, after standing in for the Queen when she was on a trip to Kenya 34 years ago. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman added: ""The Queen wishes to be alongside the Duke of Edinburgh and he will be in the balcony."" BBC Royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the change was ""another sign of the Royal Family in transition"", as well as ""an acknowledgment of the fact the Queen is 91."" Earlier this yearPrince Philip retired from his public duties, but he has continued to join the Queen at some of her official engagements. In 2015,the ceremony was made shorterto limit the amount of time the Queen, Prince Philip and the veterans in attendance would have to stand. This move included making some members of the Royal Family lay wreaths together, rather than separately. However, plans for the prime minister to lay one wreath on behalf of all the political parties were scrapped, with opposition leaders still being allowed to place individual wreaths.

Osborne robbery-bid moped gang jailed,"This video can not be played George Osborne was one of the gang's 103 victims A moped gang that robbed more than 100 people, including an attempted robbery on former chancellor George Osborne, has been jailed. Claude Parkinson, 18, and two boys aged 16 and 15, carried out the robberies over a five-day spree that ""spiralled out of control"". All three had previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery. A fourth unknown member used a hammer to intimidate victims in Camden, Westminster, Islington and Chelsea. The gang were sentenced at Southwark Crown Court. After they were arrested in May, police reported a 40% drop in moped-related robberies in Westminster. Shamsul Chowdhury, 40, and Claude Parkinson, 18, were both jailed for their part in the spree The gang rode the streets of London snatching items of value out of victims' hands before driving away. Mr Osborne was one of an estimated 103 victims of the gang when an attempt was made to snatch his mobile phone outside the BBC in May. In a victim impact statement previously read out to the court, Mr Osborne said he had felt ""shocked and stunned"" after the attempted robbery. CCTV footage from near Broadcasting House showed a passenger on the moped trying to grab the phone out of his hand, before fleeing empty-handed. In sentencing, Judge David Tomlinson said: ""With or without weapons, throughout this course of conduct there was a risk to the safety and wellbeing of members of our community. ""Your willingness to use weapons to threaten violence showed that your offending had spiralled out of control."" The gang was paid Â£55 to Â£200 for the stolen handsets, the court heard. A fifth member of the gang Shamsul Chowdhury, 40, of Bethnal Green, would traffic the phones to Bangladesh. Chowdhury was sentenced to four years and 10 months after admitting handling stolen goods. Parkinson, from Islington, was sentenced to five years and three months for robbery. The 16 and 15-year-olds - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were both jailed for four years and two months.

Our Girl return faces 'glamour' criticism,"Michelle Keegan has returned for the third series of Our Girl The first episode of the new series of Our Girl has been criticised by viewers who thought Michelle Keegan looked too glamorous to play an army medic. Ed Power inThe Telegraph,externalwrote that Keegan, as Georgie Lane, had a ""straight-from-the-beauty salon complexion"" - but added that she put in a ""solid"" performance. Viewers had mixed views on the return of the BBC drama. And some were unimpressed with a simulated earthquake in the episode. The Mirror praised Keegan for her acting prowess ""On paper, there's nothing wrong with the Nepalese earthquake storyline,""wrote Ian Hyland in The Mirror.,external ""But, sadly, Our Girl clearly lacks the budget to do it justice. ""As Lane's colleagues rolled off their camp beds during an aftershock, it was like William Shatner and the Starship Enterprise gang throwing themselves around the set of Star Trek in the 1960s."" Some Twitter users agreed, with one also comparing the camerawork to that of the 1960s. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prison staff 'attacked with pool balls',"This video can not be played Emergency crews were seen arriving at the prison Staff were attacked with pool balls during a disturbance at a high-security prison, the BBC understands. A total of 81 inmates at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire became violent, forcing staff to retreat, a source said. By 04:30 BST the disturbance was resolved with no injuries. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said he understood about 10 ""Tornado teams"" of riot officers had been sent to the prison on Wednesday. Eighteen prisoners have since been moved to other jails. Midlands Live: Prison bosses 'dodged a bullet'; Scandinavian travellers mow illegal camp James Treadwell, professor of criminology at Staffordshire University, said he understood there had been violence at the prison in the lead up to the disturbance.

The disturbance at the maximum security jail should be ""ringing alarm bells at the most senior level"", the Prison Governors Association [PGA] said. John Attard, national officer for the group, said the trouble was symptomatic of cutbacks and changes in the Prison Service management structure. ""Last year the PGA called for an independent public inquiry into the state of our prisons due to cuts... It fell on deaf ears. That call has not gone away,"" he said. ""I think we've dodged a bullet on this. They brought this under control very quickly and it's fantastic that they've dealt with it."" Our correspondent said staff on E wing had retreated, after inmates started throwing pool balls, but it had been secured so the troublemakers could not go elsewhere. There were also reports of a separate protest elsewhere in the jail, our correspondent said. The disturbance followed riots at prisons including Lewes, Bedford, Birmingham and Swaleside. Five inmates who started a 15-hour riot that caused more than Â£6m damage at HMP Birmingham in Decemberwere sentenced earlier this month. Also in December,part of a prison wing was taken overby about 60 inmates at HMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. Long Lartin has housed a number of high-profile inmates, including radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza and murderer Christopher Halliwell. I understand the trouble at Long Lartin prison has been brewing for several months. A source with good connections to the prison said there was anger among prisoners over changes introduced by the new Governor, Claire Pearson, who'd previously been in charge at Belmarsh Prison. Among the changes were tighter restrictions on the clothes prisoners were allowed to wear, tougher rules on family visits and family photographs, more rigorous security clearance procedures for visitors which meant some inmates waiting longer for visits, and more time spent by prisoners in their cells during the afternoons and evenings. In addition a smoking ban was introduced. The source said the former legal high, Spice, was also prevalent in the jail, as it is in many others. Long Lartin has capacity for 622 male inmates A Prison Service spokeswoman said: ""Specially trained prison staff successfully resolved an incident at HMP Long Lartin on 12 October. There were no injuries to staff or prisoners. ""We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars."" Long Lartin is one of the highest-security prisons in England and Wales, with two-thirds of the inmates serving life sentences, BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said. He said the prison had suffered cuts and lost a fifth of its staff. Four prisoners have been killed at the site - which holds up to 622 male inmates - in the last four years. Child murderer Subhan Anwar was strangled in 2013, while killer John York was beaten to death in his cell in 2015. In June 2016, Sidonio Eugenio Teixeira was killed using a rock wrapped in a pair of socks. Two inmates who murdered a fellow prisoner were jailed for lifelast month. An inspectionreport,externalpublished in 2014 described a ""calm, well controlled prison"". ""But, while violence and bullying were few, there continued to be some very serious incidents,"" it added.

May: We'll spend what's needed on Brexit,"The prime minister said she wanted a deal and believed one was achievable The government will spend whatever is necessary to make sure the UK is ready for Brexit, Downing Street has said. A No 10 spokesman said Â£250m of new money had been allocated this year to prepare for leaving the EU, ""including the possibility of a no-deal scenario"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said ""where money needs to be spent it will be spent"". Earlier, Chancellor Philip Hammond said funding for a no-deal plan would not happen ""until the very last moment"". He suggested it was not wise to spend money - which could alternatively go to the NHS or schools - at this stage on an outcome which may or may not happen, merely to ""send a message"" to the EU. In response, several Tory MPs have criticised the Treasury, one accusing it of ""incompetence"" and another suggesting the EU would not listen to the UK unless it was sure it was seriously preparing for the possibility of leaving in March 2019 without a negotiated agreement. Kuenssberg: Comments highlight Brexit divisions Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? Hammond's 'last moment' plan for 'no deal' The BBC understands a row broke out at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting over the issue of contingency funding in the event of a ""no deal"" scenario in the Brexit negotiations. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said two different cabinet sources confirmed there was a ""robust"" exchange. Downing Street denied there was a row but acknowledged there had been a brief discussion. She added that how much to spend on preparations for leaving the EU without a deal, and when to spend it, had become a new faultline in the Tories' divisions over Brexit. Mrs May announced the Â£250m Brexit contingency funding in response to a question from ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith, who sought assurances ""all necessary monies"" would be spent in case of a no-deal outcome. ""We are preparing for every eventuality,"" she told MPs. ""We are committing money to prepare for Brexit including a 'no deal' scenario. ""The Treasury has committed over Â£250m of new money to departments like DEFRA, the Home Office, HMRC and DfT in this financial year for Brexit preparations and in some cases, departments will need to spend money before the relevant legislation has gone through the House."" Mrs May said the UK was striving for a good deal with the EU and rejected claims from a Labour MP that she was ""running scared"" of her backbenchers and ""ramping up"" talk about the odds of there being no deal. This video can not be played Hammond: Not time yet for 'no deal' spending Two hours earlier, the chancellor - who has been accused of being too pessimistic about Brexit - told the Treasury committee of MPs that he was ""committed"" to supporting departments prepare for Brexit but said it would be premature to spend money now on the assumption there would be no deal between the UK and EU. ""We are prepared to spend when we need to spend against the contingency of a 'no deal' outcome,"" he said. ""I am clear we have to be prepared for a 'no deal' scenario unless and until we have clear evidence that this is not where we will end up."" ""What I am not prepared to do is allocate funds to departments in advance of the need to spend,"" he added. ""Every pound we spend on contingency planning on a hard customs border is a pound we can't spend on the NHS, social care or education. I don't believe we should be in the business of making potentially nugatory expenditure until the very last moment when we need to do so."" This video can not be played Heidi Alexander says the British people ""deserve better than a prime minister simply running scared"" Illustrating what he said was one worst case scenario for a ""no deal"", he said there could be no air travel taking place between the UK and the EU on Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - but added that he did not see that as likely to happen, even if the UK/EU talks failed to reach agreement. The current state of Brexit negotiations were a ""cloud of uncertainty"" hanging over the UK economy, he said, which could only removed by progress and the EU agreeing to begin talks on its future relations with the UK. One ex-minister, David Jones, has said billions should be set aside in November's Budget for a ""no deal"" scenario, arguing that if this did not happen it would be seen as a ""a sign of weakness"" by EU leaders. And Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Treasury's conduct with regard to Brexit had been ""incompetent bordering on the dishonest"" and planning for all possible outcomes was a necessary ""insurance policy"". ""If you think the EU is claiming 100bn euros from us, to have credibility for the no deal scenario we have to show that it's real and it can happen,"" he said. ""And most of the money that would be spent for no deal would be money that's needed for the end result anyway. ""So, changes to the borders, changes to customs and excise, will need to take place regardless of whether there is a deal or not. So it's not wasted money, it will be money that's very well spent.""

Trump threatens NBC after nuclear report,"President Trump criticised NBC's report as he welcomed Canada's prime minister to the White House US President Donald Trump has raised the prospect of challenging media licences for NBC News and other news networks after unfavourable reports. He took aim at NBC, which made him a star on The Apprentice, after it reported he wanted to boost America's nuclear arsenal almost tenfold. Mr Trump labelled the report ""fake news"" and ""pure fiction"". NBC also angered the White House last week when it said the secretary of state had called Mr Trump ""a moron"". Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation Trump and the nuclear codes What is Donald Trump's IQ? Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning: ""With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!"" Welcoming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Washington later in the day, the US president denied the NBC story. ""It is frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write, and people should look into it,"" he said at the White House. When asked if he wanted to increase the country's arsenal, Mr Trump said he only ever discussed keeping it in ""perfect condition"". ""No, I want to have absolutely perfectly maintained - which we are in the process of doing - nuclear force. This video can not be played Trump: 'I want nuclear weapons in perfect condition' ""But when they said I want 10 times what we have right now, it's totally unnecessary, believe me."" He added: ""I want modernisation and I want total rehabilitation. It's got to be in tip-top shape."" Defence Secretary Jim Mattis also disputed NBC's story. ""Recent reports that the President called for an increase in the US nuclear arsenal are absolutely false,"" he said in a statement. ""This kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible.""

The president's tweet about US broadcast networks provoked a free-speech uproar. Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent Trump critic, tweeted: ""Mr President: Are you recanting of the Oath you took on Jan 20 to preserve, protect, and defend the 1st Amendment?"" Walter Shaub, who led the US Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama, said it could lead to ""the point when we cease to be a democracy"". The Committee to Protect Journalists said the US president's comment was a poor example for other world leaders. According to NBC News,external, Mr Trump told a top-level meeting at the Pentagon in July that he wanted to dramatically boost the American stockpile of atomic missiles. He reportedly made the request after seeing a downward-sloping curve on a briefing slide charting the gradual decrease in US nuclear weapons since the 1960s. Attributing its report to three officials in the room, NBC said Mr Trump's request surprised those present, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. This video can not be played Rex Tillerson reacts to a report he called the president a moron. The network reported that Mr Trump had also called for additional US troops and military equipment. The US has 7,100 nuclear weapons and Russia has 7,300, according to the US non-partisan Arms Control Association. Media commentators say the president would struggle to remove broadcasters' licences if he wished to do so. The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates US broadcasters, issues licences not to networks as a whole, but to local stations. NBC owns nearly 30 local stations. It would be difficult to challenge a licence on the basis that coverage is unfair, say pundits. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Last week, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders assured reporters that Donald Trump was an ""incredible advocate"" of constitutional free-press protections. This week, the president is contemplating  whether a broadcaster could be forced off the airwaves because he doesn't approve of its news coverage. Never mind that the federal government licenses local televisions stations, only some of which are owned by national broadcasters like NBC. Just because a threat is unworkable in the extreme doesn't mean the president won't make it. Media-bashing is one of Mr Trump's favourite pastimes - a means of venting frustration, apportioning blame and, perhaps, distracting reporters who always enjoy a bit of journalistic navel-gazing. As with the NFL anthem-kneeling controversy, the cultural battle lines form quickly when it comes to questions of media bias. The president knows this and uses it to his advantage. Taking pot-shots at journalists is one thing, of course. Contemplating the use of government coercion to stifle a broadcaster because of its news content is another. Even if such an outcome is unthinkable in the US at the moment, there are places in the world where press freedoms aren't as deeply entrenched. Their leaders are watching the president, too.

Spain issues deadline to Catalans,"This video can not be played Mr Rajoy accused the Catalan leader of creating confusion Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given Catalonia's separatist leader five days to say whether or not he has declared independence. If Carles Puigdemont confirms by Monday that he has, he will be given a further three days to withdraw the declaration. Failing that, Madrid will invoke Article 155 of theconstitution,externalallowing it to suspend the region's autonomy and impose direct rule. Catalan leaders signed a declaration of independence on Tuesday. However, they halted its implementation to allow for talks with Madrid. Spain has been in turmoil since the separatist government held a disputed referendum in Catalonia on 1 October which was declared invalid by the country's Constitutional Court. Almost 90% of voters backed independence with a turnout of 43%, Catalan officials say. Anti-independence voters largely boycotted the ballot and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they tried to stop the vote taking place. Catalan crisis in 300 words Catalans' verdicts on latest turmoil The view from Barcelona v Madrid What are the options now? Mr Rajoy said his government had asked the regional government to clarify whether or not it had declared independence. He accused Mr Puigdemont of having created ""deliberate confusion"" and said he wanted to restore ""certainty"". ""This call - ahead of any of the measures that the government may adopt under Article 155 of our constitution - seeks to offer citizens the clarity and security that a question of such importance requires,"" Mr Rajoy said. ""There is an urgent need to put an end to the situation that Catalonia is going through - to return it to safety, tranquillity and calm and to do that as quickly as possible."" Mr Rajoy was speaking after holding an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the government's next steps. Catalans are divided on the independence issue Speaking later in parliament, Mr Rajoy said Spain was facing the most serious threat to its 40-year-old democracy. He accused the separatists of hatching an ""anti-democratic plan foisting their will on all the people of Catalonia"", and said the Spanish government had had no choice but to restore order. ""It falls to the Catalan leader to restore constitutional normality,"" he told deputies, rejecting any suggestion of outside mediation in the dispute. He added that he was willing to negotiate on the issue of regional autonomy and changes to the constitution - but this had to be within the framework of the law. Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor, Madrid Spain's prime minister tried today to put the ball back in the Catalan court. He has asked the Catalan president to clarify if he is making a declaration of independence or not. In the meantime, sources in the Senate (Spain's upper house of parliament, where Prime Minister Rajoy's Popular Party has a majority) say the request has been made to trigger Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, under which Mr Rajoy would be able to suspend Catalan autonomy - possibly immediately, or bit by bit. Article 155 has never been used before, so we are in a kind of Brexit situation before Article 50 was triggered. The article legally exists but there are disagreements about how far-reaching it is, how it would/should work (and how quickly) in practice. Reports in Spanish media have suggested that if the Spanish prime minister were to activate Article 155 in the absence of a response from the Catalan president, pro-independence parties in the Catalan parliament would then declare independence. The leader of the opposition Socialists, Pedro Sanchez, told reporters that his party and the government had agreed to examine the possibility of using constitutional reform to end the crisis. This would be focused on ""how Catalonia remains in Spain, and not how it leaves"", he added. This video can not be played Catalan leader seeks talks to secure independence Addressing the Catalan parliament in Barcelona on Tuesday evening, Mr Puigdemont said the autonomous region had won the right to be independent as a result of the vote. He urged the international community to recognise Catalonia as an independent and sovereign state. He said the ""people's will"" was to break away from Madrid but he also said he wanted to ""de-escalate"" the tension around the issue. With this in mind he announced that he was ""suspending the effects of the declaration of independence"" for more talks with the Madrid government, which he said were needed to reach a solution. He and other Catalan leaders then signed the declaration of independence. It is not clear if the declaration has any legal status. The man who wants to break up Spain Would Catalonia be a viable country? Catalan crisis: Six things you need to know Crowds of independence supporters in Barcelona cheered Mr Puigdemont's initial remarks but many expressed disappointment as he clarified his stance. Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions but a stream of companies has announced plans to move head offices out of the province in response to the crisis. The European Union has made clear that should Catalonia split from Spain, the region would cease to be part of the EU. Are you in Catalonia? What do you think of the latest developments?

Matt Damon denies 'killing' Weinstein story,"Matt Damon and Harvey Weinstein pictured with Ben Affleck in 2010 Actor Matt Damon has denied trying to ""kill"" a story about Harvey Weinstein's behaviour when it was investigated by a reporter 13 years ago. Sharon Waxman has said she looked into rumours that an employee of Weinstein in Italy was procuring women for him. She said Damon and Russell Crowe called her to vouch for the employee. But Damon has said he did not know the detail of the allegations. ""I would never, ever, ever try to kill a story like that,"" he told Deadline. ""I just wouldn't do that. It's not something I would do, for anybody."" Waxman, who then worked for the New York Times, was ultimately unable to publish any allegations relating to Weinstein's sexual behaviour. Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories Bafta suspends disgraced mogul Weinstein's wife leaves him The horror of Weinstein's casting couch Sharon Waxman accused the New York Times of ""gutting"" her story Weinstein had asked Damon and Crowe to call her, she told BBC Newsnight. ""That was Harvey's attempt to beat the story back,"" she said. ""They were calling me to vouch for this executive. They were calling me to say that they knew the guy, they hung out with him in Italy, and he seemed like a good guy."" Damon said Weinstein told him the New York Times story would be claiming the Italian executive ""had no professional experience"". He said the producer asked him to ""tell her that he was a professional and you had a good experience, and that was it"". He said: ""I was never conscripted to do anything. We vouch for each other, all the time."" Damon added: ""I'm sure I mentioned to her that I didn't know anything about the rest of her piece, because I didn't."" The accusations that have now come out against Weinstein are ""the kind of sexual predation that keeps me up at night"", Damon said, adding that he had never seen inappropriate behaviour during time spent making films with Weinstein. ""I think a lot of actors have come out and said, 'everybody's saying we all knew'. That's not true,"" Damon said. ""This type of predation happens behind closed doors, and out of public view. If there was ever an event that I was at and Harvey was doing this kind of thing and I didn't see it, then I am so deeply sorry, because I would have stopped it."" Crowe hasn't commented. Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor claims groping Ben Affleck apologises for 'groping' TV host Waxman claimed the 2004 New York Times story was ""gutted"" after ""intense pressure"" from Weinstein. The paper went on to break the story of the latest allegations at the weekend. The New York Times's executive editor Dean Baquet, who wasn't working for the paper in 2004, said: ""It is unimaginable to me that The Times killed a story because of pressure from Harvey Weinstein, who was and is an advertiser.""

Is the SNP's childcare pledge 'unmatched'?,"The claim:Nicola Sturgeon told her party conference that the Scottish government's commitment to early years education and childcare was ""unmatched anywhere else in the UK"" as she fleshed out plans to expand childcare provision. Reality Check verdict:Overall, Scotland's planned childcare provision would be the most generous in the UK, as it plans to offer 1,140 hours a year, regardless of whether parents are in work. However, a pilot scheme under way in Wales is better for working parents as it offers 1,440 hours a year. When Nicola Sturgeon took to the stage at the SNP conference, she said she was committed to giving children in Scotland ""the best possible start in life"". She confirmed that the Scottish government would increase its offer of free childcare from 16 hours a week to 30 hours for three- and four-year-olds, as well as vulnerable two-year-olds, by 2020. And she pledged to double investment in early years education and childcare, from Â£420m to Â£840m a year, by the end of the current parliament. ""This is a commitment unmatched anywhere else in the UK,"" she said. ""And it's the best investment we can make in Scotland's future."" The first minister's office confirmed that what she meant was that the universality of care offered to children north of the border would be better than that provided in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Reality Check has looked into the claims. Parents of three- and four-year-olds and vulnerable two-year-olds in Scotland are currently offered 600 hours of free childcare a year. It works out at roughly 16 hours a week over 38 weeks of the year but families can choose to spread the hours over a longer period. The Scottish government wants to increase annual childcare provision to 1,140 hours by 2020. Funded childcare is currently offered to all families in Scotland - regardless of the employment status of their parents. That is where Nicola Sturgeon's plans differ from those in practice across the rest of the UK. All families in England are currently offered 570 free hours a year. However, where both parents (or one in single-parent families) work more than 16 hours a week, they are entitled to 1,140 hours a year. In Wales, a pilot scheme is under way where working families in seven authorities are offered 1,440 hours of childcare a year. That works out at 30 hours a week over 48 weeks. As in England, it is available only to families where both parents (or one in a single-parent family) work more than 16 hours a week. Every child in Wales is eligible for 10 hours of early years education a week, from the term after their third birthday. That is incorporated into the 30 free hours in the pilot areas. Families in Northern Ireland can access between 12.5 and 22.5 hours of funded pre-school education a week over 38 weeks for all three- and four-year-olds. One of the key actions of the NI executive's draft programme for government was to ""extend responsive, high-quality provision in early childhood education and care"" for families with young children. However, Northern Ireland has been without an executive for 10 months, following a row between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The parties are in discussions to restore the government.

Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories,"Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out Salma Hayek, Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow are among dozens of women who have come forward with allegations ranging from rape to sexual harassment by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. He is currently facing five charges relating to two women in New York. He has previously admitted his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"". His spokesperson has said ""any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied"" and there were ""never any acts of retaliation"" against women who turned him down. Clockwise from top left: Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Cara Delevingne, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette and Lea Seydoux Here are some of those who have made allegations against him. The actress has accused Weinstein of raping her by performing oral sex in a hotel at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997, when she was 23 and had just appeared in Scream. She later reached a $100,000 settlement with him - andsays he offered her$1m for a further non-disclosure deal to stay silent. She declined and has been one of his most vocal accusers. The Emmy-nominated former Sopranos actresshas allegedthat Weinstein forced himself into her apartment in New York in 1992 and raped her. ""I was so ashamed of what happened,"" Sciorratold the New Yorker,external. ""And I fought. I fought. But still I was like, Why did I open that door?"" The actress says Weinstein asked her to go to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting, but appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she could watch him shower. She refused, and says he got revenge by seeking to damage her career.Director Peter Jackson has come forward to say he removed her from a casting list ""as a direct result"" of what he now thinks was ""false information"" provided by Weinstein. In May 2018 Juddsued Weinstein claiming he damaged her career in retaliation for her rejecting his sexual advancesbut a Los Angeles court later dismissed her sexual harassment suit. Her defamation claim may still proceed, the judge said. Mira Sorvino was photographed at a Weinstein Company party in January 2017 The Mighty Aphrodite star says he harassed her in a hotel room in 1995. ""He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,"" she said. Like with Ashley Judd,Peter Jackson said Weinstein warned him off casting her. Hayek said Weinstein threatened to kill her The Frida actress saysshe turned down repeated sexual advances from Weinstein while making the 2002 film Frida. And she says his persuasion tactics included threats. Hayek said Weinstein once told her: ""I will kill you, don't think I can't."" The Italian actress and director Asia Argento says she reluctantly agreed to give him a massage in a hotel room on the French Riviera, but he then raped her. Weinstein ""terrified me, and he was so big"", she said. ""It wouldn't stop. It was a nightmare."" Lucia Evans - nee Stoller - encountered Weinstein in 2004 in a New York club when she was an aspiring actress. She says she was forced to perform oral sex by the producer after going to his office for what she thought was a casting meeting. ""The type of control he exerted, it was very real,"" she told The New Yorker. ""Even just his presence was intimidating."" The Boardwalk Empire starhas accused Weinsteinof raping her twice in New York in 2010. The first time was after he offered her a ride home, and the second was when he turned up uninvited at her apartment. ""I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, 'I don't want to do this',"" she said. Gwyneth Paltrow with Harvey Weinstein in 2002 Paltrow says Weinstein asked her to give him a massage in his hotel suite after casting her in the leading role of 1996's Emma when she was 22. She refused. ""He screamed at me for a long time. It was brutal,"" she said. She told then boyfriend Brad Pitt - who threatened to kill the producer if he did anything like that to Paltrow again. Former production worker Mimi Haleyi alleges that she was raped by Weinstein when he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 in his New York apartment. ""I told him 'no, no, no'. But he insisted,"" Ms Haleyi told a press conference in New York. The actress also alleges she was raped by Weinstein when he performed oral sex on her without her consent. She says he lured her to a hotel room in 2010 under the guise of helping her procure future TV and film roles. ""I didn't know how to say no to someone like him at the time, which I regret,"" she said. The Norwegian actress accuses Weinstein of raping herin a London hotel after the 2008 Bafta Awards ceremony. She also alleges that he then asked her to engage in a threesome with him and another woman when back in Los Angeles following the Baftas. British actress Lysette Anthony says he carried out a ""pathetic, revolting"" attack at her London home in the late 1980s, which left her ""disgusted and embarrassed"". Lysette Anthony toldThe Sunday Times,externalshe had reported an attack by Weinstein to the Metropolitan Police in London. In anInstagram post,external, Delevingne writes how uncomfortable she felt during an encounter with Weinstein in a hotel room and describes what allegedly happened when she told him she wanted to leave. ""He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room,"" she says. The French actress has written about how he invited her to come to his hotel room for a drink. ""We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,""she wrote in The Guardian,external. ""I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him."" Angelina Jolie with Gillian Anderson at the premiere of Playing by Heart in 1998 Jolie says she was propositioned by Weinstein in a hotel room in 1998. ""I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,"" she said. The Pulp Fiction actress saysWeinstein pushed her down and ""tried to expose himself"" at the producer's hotel room in London during the 1990s. ""He tried to shove himself on me... He did all kinds of unpleasant things,"" Thurman said. ""But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard."" Harvey Weinstein and Heather Graham at a film party in 1999 The Boogie Nights actress toldVariety,externalshe was once propositioned by Weinstein in the early 2000s when she met him to discuss being cast in one of his movies. She alleges he implied she had to sleep with him to get a film role, telling her that his wife would have been fine with it. This video can not be played Model Zoe Brock tells Radio 4's Today that she was one of Harvey Weinstein's victims The model and actress says he asked for a massage in the south of France in 1997. She said: ""I didn't know what to do and I felt that letting him maybe touch me a little bit might placate him enough to get me out of there somehow."" Before long, she ""bolted"" into the bathroom. He banged on the door with his fists before eventually retreating, putting on a dressing gown and starting to cry. Louisette Geiss holding a press conference on Tuesday The actress and producer says she was attacked by Weinstein when he invited her to his office in a hotel for a meeting about a script she had written at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008. He insisted on listening to her pitch in his hot tub, then asked her to watch him masturbate, she says - and told her he could green-light her script if she did so. She left. The Splash actress saysshe repeatedly turned down Weinstein's advances during promotion for Kill Bill and its sequel. He tried, she says, to get into her hotel room on multiple occasions, once getting a key and ""burst[ing] in like a raging bull."" He asked to grope her breasts and then asked her to expose herself to him, she alleges. She suffered physical repercussions as her flights were cancelled and she was left stranded after she turned him down on one occasion, she adds. The actress says she rejected Weinstein's advances and that she believes her acting career suffered as a result. She told the New York Times,externalin the early 1990s she was directed to his hotel room, where he was in a bathrobe and asked her for a massage. When she refused she says he grabbed her hand and pulled it toward his crotch. ModelAmbra Battilana Gutierrezhas said she was groped by Weinstein and later went to New York police in 2015, saying the producer assaulted her. She then met Weinstein wearing a hidden microphone. But prosecutors took no action. Other stars to have detailed how he made advances in his home or hotel rooms includeBrit Marling,external,Lupita Nyong'O,external,Lena Headey,externalandKate Beckinsale,external.

ActressClaire Forlanihas said ""nothing happened"" between her and Weinstein - but only because she ""escaped five times"". In an interview with Canadian TV, actressLauren Hollysaid the producer approached her naked and requested a massage, at which point she ""pushed him and ran"". Zelda Perkins, a British former assistant of Harvey Weinstein,says she resignedafter a colleague accused him of trying to rape her. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister issued a statement on 10 October in response to the allegations of sexual harassment and assault.

'Why UK passports need to have an X',"Mia Violet says its important everybody is recognised UK passports currently have ""M"" or a ""F"" for people to specify their gender - but what about ""X""? A campaigner has today been given the go-ahead to challenge the government over gender-neutral passports. Christie Elan-Cane wants there to be an ""X"" - which stands for unspecified - for people who don't identify as male or female. Transgender blogger Mia Violet, who backs the call, says it would be a sign of ""respect"" to trans people. She says it's fantastic the campaign has taken its next step and describes it as a ""sign of progress"". ""Trans rights do feel as though they've stagnated in the UK and I do hope this pushes forward more changes. ""We need to ensure everybody is recognised. For trans people to be seen, I think that's going to be incredibly important to them because so often they are overlooked."" Mia says gender-neutral passports would be an important step Mia, 28, from Dorset, came out as transgender around two years ago. She told Newsbeat: ""Initially, I identified as non-binary. I didn't see myself as fully female or fully male, I was kind of in the middle. ""Over time, I've become more comfortable with using female to describe myself. But it was very awkward and uncomfortable in that time because there was basically no way to select a gender that felt like mine."" Mia says gender-neutral passports in the UK would be an important step because ""it's recognition and it's respect"". ""When I changed my passport gender to female, I had to get a letter from my doctor that basically said 'OK Mia is trans. This transition is permanent. She is now considered female, please change it'. It wasn't enough for just my permission to do it. ""It's almost like the government is looking the other way and not really thinking about trans issues but at the same time we have thousands of thousands of trans people in this country who are having to deal with systems that are just not set up to recognise them."" Christie Elan-Cane took the fight for gender-neutral passports to the High Court Christie launched a High Court fight for the right to have ""X"" passports in the UK. The campaigner has now been given permission to challenge the government in a judicial review. Christie believes it's wrong to force people to choose either M or F on their passports if they define as neither. Gender-neutral passports are already available in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Germany, Malta, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Ireland and Canada.

The man diagnosed with pathological laughter,"Paul Pugh was in the most critical meeting of his life. He was being told what his future would be like after receiving a brain injury in a brutal assault. He laughed the whole way through the discussion but, to him, it felt like he was sobbing. He would later be diagnosed with pathological laughter. Pugh, now 38, had been on a night out with his Cwmaman Football Club teammates in January 2007 when he was targeted in an unprovoked attack on a cold January night. As he left a pub in his home town of Ammanford in Carmarthenshire, west Wales, four men he didn't know rounded on him and repeatedly punched and kicked him. Pugh's skull was fractured and he fell into a coma for more than two months. A blood clot which measured 10cm x 4cm formed on his brain and he was left with slurred speech, chronic fatigue and mobility difficulties which resulted in him having to use a wheelchair. ""I've had to learn to walk and talk again and come to terms with the fact that I will never fully recover,"" he says. ""Life has been a struggle for me and my family, but we're ploughing through it."" Pugh spent 13 months in hospital, but it wasn't until month four that he had his first laughing fit. ""It was a serious meeting with my consultant, rehabilitation therapists and my family to discuss what my life and future was going to be like,"" he says. ""When they started talking about me, I was frightened and it triggered something off in my brain and I laughed right through the meeting. ""I was actually crying my eyes out, but it came out on the surface as laughter."" At first, no one understood his behaviour, his family even thought he was ""making a scene in public, pleading for attention"". It took several years before Pugh's fits of ""full on laughter"" were diagnosed as pathological laughter or the Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA). The condition arises when there is a disconnect between the frontal lobe of the brain - which keeps emotions in check - and the cerebellum and brain stem - which regulate the expression of emotion. It's a real crossed-wires moment. PBA can affect those with neurological conditions or injuries such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer's disease. Andy Tyerman, consultant clinical neuropsychologist of brain injury charity Headway, says: ""The term refers to uncontrolled expression of emotion that is disproportionate or inappropriate to the social context and may be inconsistent with what the person is actually feeling. ""A person might also appear very distressed about something that would previously have been only slightly upsetting."" In Pugh's case, he laughed when he thought he was crying. ""I know when I'm laughing or crying, but other people don't,"" he says. ""Some have been upset and reacted by being sarcastic with me or even aggressive and try to hurt my feelings because they think I'm laughing at them. ""It's amazing how important laughing is. You take it for granted but it has a really powerful effect, if you share a joke with someone it's special."" Pugh says his family are very understanding. His mum has become his full-time carer to help with his mobility issues, his dad, aged 72, still works and his brothers - Simon and Matthew - have both had a hand in helping him over the past decade. He says the diagnosis ""hit me hard"" and sometimes attracts unwanted attention but he can now sense when an episode is imminent. ""I feel a laugh coming a few seconds before it happens - sometimes I can control it but a blip can happen. The laugh doesn't last long, a minute at the most, but it can cause a lot of problems if people don't understand."" Pugh has developed his own method to avert an episode by ""thinking of something or someone bad without giving it feeling"" and estimates he can control nine out of 10 laughing fits. It's been an ""extremely tough 10 years"" since the assault, he says. He had to give up work as an electrician and now spends his time in therapy or visiting the charity Headway Carmarthenshire which, he says, gave him an ""insight of being with people with brain injury"" and reassurance he wasn't on his own. ""Since the incident we've met the most incredible people you'll ever meet, all wanting to help me,"" he says. ""On the other side of the dice, I feel like I'm under house arrest because the injury affected my mobility and balance, therefore I need assistance whenever I go outdoors."" In 2014, Pugh started Paul's Pledge - a campaign to educate people about alcohol-fuelled violence which Dyfed-Powys Police is also involved in. He makes visits to schools, colleges and youth clubs and has had an ""absolutely fantastic"" response because ""they can see that it's real and not theatrical"". ""This is my life now - I've moved on from what happened,"" he says. ""There are many things I can't do - but this [campaign] I can do. I think it sends a powerful message to the world. I don't want to see anyone, nobody in the situation it left me and my family in."" The four men responsible for Pugh's attack were jailed for between nine months and four years. Pugh says: ""The one that kicked me in the head with full force from point blank range, almost killing me, was let out. What about me? Ten years later, I'm still serving my sentence.""

What to do if your child is overweight,"One in ten young people in the UK, aged between five and 19, is obese, according tonew research that looks at obesity trends in over 200 countries. It's not always easy to tell if your child is overweight - especially as even slimmer people are heavier than they would have been 10 years ago. Consultant paediatrician Prof Mary Rudolf, who advises the government on obesity, says many parents would not know that ""a healthy 10-year-old's ribs should be clearly visible - many parents would consider that such a child was quite underweight"". The ""most robust"" way is to check their body mass index (BMI) to see if their weight falls within the healthy range for their height - according to the Department of Health. All children in England are measured and weighed for their BMI in reception class (aged four to five) and in year six (aged 10 to 11), under the government's National Child Measurement Programme. Some local authorities send letters informing parents of the result. Generally, the higher the BMI, the greater the risk of medical problems. If your local authority does not do this, you can check your child's BMI usingthe NHS's BMI calculator,external- you will need to know their height and weight. Experts believe one of the most powerful ways to encourage your child to eat well and be active is to do so yourself, as children learn by example. Research cited by the NHS in 2009 found,externalthat the risk of a girl being obese at the age of eight was significantly raised - a ten-fold increase in fact - if her mother was obese. The risk for a boy was increased six-fold if his father was obese. NHS Choices advises,externalthat any changes made to a child's diet and lifestyle are much more likely to be accepted if the changes involve the whole family. Its list of10 tips,externalincludes advice such as eating together at the table, banning sweetened drinks, preparing more meals at home or choosing healthier takeaways. Children are recommended to have 60 minutes of exercise a day - but this does not have to be done all at once. It can be done in several short 10 or five-minute bursts of activity throughout the day. Overweight children do not need to do more exercise than slimmer children, as their extra body weight means they will naturally burn more calories for the same activity. Swapping the car for walking or cycling on small journeys is seen as an easy way to get the whole family moving. Children, like adults, should aim to eat five or more portions of fruit and vegetables every day. Experts say unsweetened 100% fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies should only count as one portion of a child's five a day, because of the high level of sugar they contain. They recommend a combined total of no more than 150ml a day - which is one small glass. This is because when fruit is blended or juiced it releases natural sugars which increase the risk of tooth decay, so it is also best to drink fruit juice or smoothies at meal times. The NHS says many children are gettinghalf of their sugar intake,externalfrom sweetened soft drinks and unhealthy snacks. For example, one can of coke can have up to nine cubes of sugar in it. But the maximum daily amounts of added sugar for children are: 4-6 years old - 5 cubes of sugar or 19 grams 7-10 years old - 6 cubes of sugar or 24 grams over 11 - 7 cubes of sugar or 30 grams There is little official guidance on precisely how much food children require. But experts advise avoiding adult-sized plates for younger children as it encourages them to eat more than they need. Other tips include starting meals with small servings and letting your child ask for more if they are still hungry. It is also advised that children be encouraged to eat slowly, and not forced to finish everything on their plate. It also helps to have set meal times. Sleep is important for children as it has been shown that those who do not have the recommended amount of sleep are more likely to be overweight. Researchers foundthat those children who had less sleep in their earlier years were at greater risk of having a higher BMI at age seven. This link continued even when other risk factors, such as gender and physical activity, were accounted for in their research. Using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), poor sleep has been shown to affect the brain areas responsible for complex decision-making, and our response to rewards, causing us to favour unhealthy foods. Although getting the recommended amount of sleep at night is encouraged, sitting and lying around too much in the day makes children more likely to put on weight. Experts advise that children should watch no more than two hours of television each day. And parents are encouraged to remove all screens, including mobile phones, from their bedroom at night. Aisling Pigott, a paediatric dietitian and spokesperson forthe British Dietetic Association,external, says it is important to ""talk to children from a young age openly and honestly about food as a positive thing"". ""Have open discussions about enjoying food, take the focus away from body image to health and wellbeing, as opposed to look and image,"" she says. ""Don't use negative words like 'fat' and 'ugly' with your children - don't talk about cutting down and not eating certain foods as it makes children want them more,"" she adds. With older children there are many more influences so teenagers should be approached sensitively, Ms Pigott points out. ""Don't attack and don't talk about long-term consequences for their health because they don't care, as teenagers live in the here and now,"" she explains. ""Focus on how they look at the moment and help them work on gaining more positive self-esteem."" Overweight teenagers will display unhealthy eating behaviours - often restricting their food intake and then overeating. Boosting their self esteem can work well in stabilising their eating habits, according to Ms Pigott. ""Reassure them and remind them everyone is a different shape and size - and it's just about keeping within healthy norms.""

Hammond's comments highlight Brexit divisions,"It is traditionally the job of a chancellor to look after the nation's money, not to be flash with taxpayers' cash, to balance the books, and not to go around making promises that can't be paid for. And in normal times under Conservative governments there is usually customary support from the backbenches for them to err on the side of caution when it comes to controlling the purse strings. But there is very visible anger from some Tory quarters today about Philip Hammond's approach to spending when it comes to making preparations for life outside the EU. Why? Well, how much to spend on preparing for leaving the EU without a deal, and when to spend it, has become the new faultline in the Tories' never ending divisions over Brexit. The chancellor wrote in the Times this morning that he'd only be prepared to spend money when it was necessary and not in next month's Budget. And he went even further in front of MPs this morning, saying that he wouldn't spend until the ""very last moment"". That is a direct challenge to some Brexiteers who have been pushing for billions to be spent now, yes, to be ready just in case, but also in order to demonstrate to Brussels that the threat to walk away is a real one. UK to wait until 'last moment' to spend on 'no deal' plan And two different cabinet sources say his comments today come on top of a row at cabinet yesterday over precisely this issue, an exchange described as ""robust"". Number 10 acknowledges that there was a brief discussion of the preparation for the ""no deal"" scenario, although they deny (as they would) that there was anything like a ding-dong. But one of the cabinet sources suggests Mr Hammond's behaviour is either ""deliberate and divisive or politically stupid"". But it led today to what Brexiteers are claiming was a ""deliberate slapdown"" of the chancellor by Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions, when she made plain that money would be forthcoming for ""no deal"" planning as and when it was necessary, striking a rather different tone to the chancellor's ""very last moment"", comments. As Numbers 10 and 11 point out, the Treasury has already allocated more than half a billion to specific contingency planning and held back billions in last year's spending round to provide headroom if Brexit goes awry. But right now, the Treasury is clearly not willing to give in to some of his colleagues' demands to write big cheques for the ""what if"". For Mr Hammond's team it makes no sense to be spending money when there's hardly any around, unnecessarily, and certainly not to send political signals to Brussels. But for those in the Tory party who already resent and disagree with his attitude, it's another reason to have a pop. For those of us watching on, it's another sign of how the Tories are consumed with fighting each other over Brexit, rather than the opposition.

Four ideas to tackle coffee cup waste,"Is the price of our growing addiction to takeaway hot drinks an ever higher mountain of landfill? Since last year, when we were allmade awareof the UK's unrecycled cup mountain, some of us have found it hard to buy a takeaway coffee without being wracked with guilt. In the UK, we throw away an estimated 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year. In theory, they are ""recyclable"", but in practice, only a tiny percentage is dealt with sustainably. Yet so far, there's no agreed way forward. Parliament's environmental audit committee has been hearing the latest thoughts from campaigners and industry on how we can improve on our record in this area. A lot of the biggest names in takeaway beverages, including Caffe Nero, Costa Coffee, McDonald's, Pret A Manger and Starbucks, have signed up to a scheme to collect and recycle more of the current type of cups. Costa is also collecting cups from rival brands in its shops. But others believe a more fundamental rethink would work better. Here are four ways the coffee cup waste problem might be tackled. Conventional cups can be recycled, but only in special facilities, thanks to the lamination that makes them waterproof. Frugalpac, based in Ipswich in the UK, manufactures cardboard cups that can be recycled in regular recycling plants. ""We looked at this three years ago: everyone was blaming someone else, the cup makers, the coffee shops, councils. We thought, why don't we go out there and solve the problem?"" says Frugalpac's founder, Martin Myerscough. He has a patent for his cup - made of recycled materials, with an only very lightly attached plastic lining (representing about 10% of the weight of the cup), that separates easily during recycling. It's a more pragmatic solution, he argues, than trying to set up specialist collection points for conventional cups, because we already have recycling bins. He has done trials with independent coffee shops and is working with Starbucks. Of course, consumers will still have to remember to put them in the right bin, and he is still working on replacing the plastic lid. Safia Qureshi points to chai wallahs in India as one of her initial inspirations. There, tea is poured into glasses that are washed and reused. We all used to drink milk and Coca Cola from returnable, reusable bottles. So why not coffee? ""The current model for reusable cups is that the consumer needs to buy the cup and take it in. The ratio of consumers doing that is 2% of all the total coffee sold,"" she points out. Instead, she proposes that the customer joins Cup Club and picks up a reusable cup when they buy their coffee. It can be returned later to one of several collection points. Cup Club is responsible for collecting washing and redistributing the clean cups to participating retailers. Because the cups are tagged and registered to your account - using RFID, the same technology that's on an Oyster travel card - Cup Club can text you a reminder if you've forgotten to return a cup and charge you if you keep it. ""I'm very passionate about putting an end to products that are only used one time,"" says Ms Quereshi ""It's a selfish and arrogant stance."" She's starting with company offices and universities, but is aiming ultimately for a London-wide scheme. Its success will rely on enough retailers subscribing, but she has received an Ellen MacArthur Circular Design Challenge award, which will support her in developing the idea further. Tom Chan, an engineering student from Hong Kong studying in the US, said he saw the coffee cups piling up in the rubbish bins outside his university building and wanted to do something about it. He has now patented his TrioCup, a triangular-shaped cardboard cup, with sticking up flaps ""like bunny ears"". Those ears can be folded down and tucked in to close it. The entire cup is recyclable and, without the need for a separate plastic lid, potentially cheaper than normal cups. ""I decided if I were to make a new cup, it needed to have more features than just being eco-friendly,"" he says. So he aimed for some other selling points too, such as spill-resistance. ""From my anecdotal research, a lot more people spill their coffee than you think."" He says you can drop a TrioCup from waist height and most of the coffee will stay in the cup. He thinks the shape makes the cups easier to hold and gives them ""a cool aesthetic"". Even the origami folding technique is pretty simple, he says. Next month, Mr Chan, another recipient of an Ellen MacArthur award, will be making several thousand cups per week for use in the university coffee shop. The ultimate waste-free cup, though, must be this: a coffee cup made of cereals that you can munch on like an ice cream cone, once you've downed your drink. Three friends from Plovdiv in Bulgaria, Miroslav Zapryanov, Mladen Dzhalazov and Simeon Gavrailov, came up with their ""waffle"" recipe containing no preservatives, colourings or coatings a few years ago and have been working on commercialising it ever since. Apparently slightly sweet and crisp, it will hold your coffee for up to 40 minutes. And if you decide not to snack on it, it will biodegrade within weeks. They say they were inspired by a desire to change the world. They might only be changing the diets of a limited number of Bulgarian coffee drinkers, but they are ambitious. The founders say that with a shelf life of six months the Cupffee could meet the needs of the big High Street coffee chains. But many other firms are thinking along similar lines, at least when it comes to compostable cups. Companies such as Bristol-based Planglow have successfully commercialised what they say is fully biodegradable food packaging, including coffee cups. And they boast clients from restaurants to contract caterers, sandwich shops to Parliament, so policy makers presumably are familiar with this option.

Wineries count cost of wildfires disaster,"Grapes of wrath - The flaming terror on the terroir struck at the heart of wine country Call it the grapes of wrath - the California wildfires have struck at the heart of wine country, razing at least five wineries and damaging others. Most of this season's grapes have already been harvested, which limits possible damage from smoke. But many business owners have not been able to inspect their properties since the areas remain evacuated. ""We just don't know yet,"" said John Aguirre, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers. This video can not be played Fire survivor: 'I don't have any neighbours any more.' ""It's not clear how many vineyards have been damaged and to what extent they can be rehabilitated."" The wildfires are the deadliest in California since 2003 and among the worst in the state's history. At least 21 people have been killed and hundreds of people are missing. Napa and Sonoma counties, where the terror on the terroir struck hardest, are home to about 10% wine grapes grown in California, according to the Wine Institute. They're also home to about a fifth of the state's 4,700 wineries, which buy and process grapes ,and welcome millions of tourists each year. This video can not be played Residents return home: 'It looks like a nuclear bomb went off' While California is accustomed to risks from wildfires, the severity of these blazes is ""unprecedented"" for the wine industry, Mr Aguirre said. At least five wineries have suffered total or very significant losses, and 11 more have reported damage, according to Napa Valley Vintners. The organisation had not heard reports from about a dozen wineries in particularly vulnerable areas. About 90% of grapes had already been harvested. A decline in tourism and damage to vineyards are likely to add significantly to costs, once the damage is fully understood, said Rob McMillan, founder of the wine division for Silicon Valley Bank. For individual businesses, the fires could be devastating as destroyed vines take about four years to grow back. Mr McMillan said consumers, however, can rest easy: the fires are unlikely to lead to a wider rise in prices for California wine. ""There's plenty of wine. There's plenty of choices,"" he said. ""But it is going to be very painful for [individual] vineyard owners and winery owners.""

The entire town of Calistoga, in Napa County, was told to leave - about 5,000 residents - and police stopped all traffic trying to approach the area. The Rippeys died on Sunday at their home in Napa, California, where the fast-moving fires trapped them inside. The couple's son, Mike Rippey said he and his brother found their parents' remains near each other amid the rubble of their home on Tuesday. ""We kids would always talk about what it would be like if one of them died and the other was still alive,"" Mr Rippey, 71, told the newspaper. ""They just couldn't be without each other.

'Too many people' in boxer death ring,"Kuba Moczyk's trainer described his fatal fight as like an ""unlicensed"" event A medic at a boxing match where a young fighter was knocked out and later died has told an inquest there were too many people in the ring as she tried to save him. Jakub Moczyk, 22, known as Kuba, wasknocked out in the third roundof his first fight at the Atlantis Arena, Great Yarmouth, in November 2016. The medical technician described the ring as ""disorganised"" as she worked on Polish-born Mr Moczyk. He died two days later in hospital. More on this story and others from Norfolk Mr Moczyk's fight at the Atlantis Arena was filmed by a spectator Giving evidence at Norfolk Coroner's Court in Great Yarmouth, emergency medical technician Susan Mitchison said she was called to provide medical cover on the afternoon of the fight. She works with her husband, Andrew Cawlard, for his firm, Lifeshield Medical Services, providing medical cover at boxing matches, small festivals and on film sets. When the bout started she and her husband were at a ringside table and they went into the ring when Mr Moczyk was knocked down. ""He was unconscious, he was fitting and he was bringing up a lot of fluid,"" Ms Mitchison said. She said they cleared his airway and put him on oxygen and another man helped support his head. Paramedics arrived within 10 minutes, she added. Kuba Moczyk's twin Magdalena Moczyk (far right) with their mother, Jolanta Smigaj, and her partner Mr Moczyk's twin sister, Magdalena Moczyk, asked if she thought there were too many people in the ring. ""Yes, there were, and there were people who didn't need to be there and I did ask some to leave on more than one occasion,"" Ms Mitchison said. ""There were so many people there. It was disorganised,"" she added. Ms Mitchison said she carried out the medicals before the fight but that no area was prepared for medicals and she was given no details about the boxers, no list of names or disclaimer forms. She said she set up a table beside the DJ booth, and got each boxer to write their name on a piece of paper as they were checked to see if they were fit to fight. The inquest continues.

Flooding closes roads and schools,"The village of Blennerhasset saw some of the worst flooding Some parts of Cumbria saw more than 8ins (206mm) of rain fall in less than 24 hours, according to provisional figures from the Environment Agency. Honister, Seathwaite and Ennerdale were the worst hit areas as torrential downpours closed schools and disrupted road and rail travel. The agency,externalissued 18 flood alerts and eight flood warnings, while a Met Office yellow warning for rain was in place for much of Wednesday. No serious injuries were reported. BBC weather presenter Paul Mooney said the amount of rainfall had been ""significant"" but not on the scale ofStorm Desmond in 2015. The Borrowdale area was also badly affected, with two bridges forced to close. Northern Rail said lines were blocked due to floods between Carlisle and Maryportcausing major disruption,external.

Grenfell survivors offered full residency,"Grenfell Tower fire survivors whose immigration status was uncertain will have the chance to be granted permanent UK residency, the Home Office has said. This is a change to the one-year immigration amnesty announced after the June blaze in west London. Immigration minister Brandon Lewis said the government ""believed it is right"" to give survivors greater certainty. Meanwhile, the chancellor has said the government will not ""automatically"" fund fire safety measures for councils. Mr Lewis also announced that relatives of survivors and victims who have been allowed to come into the UK for reasons relating to the fire will have the right to stay for six months. In a statement, Mr Lewis wrote: ""Our initial response to this terrible tragedy was rightly focused on survivors' immediate needs in the aftermath of the fire and ensuring they could access the services they need to start to rebuild their lives. ""However, since the Grenfell Tower immigration policy was announced, we have been planning for the future of those residents affected by these unprecedented events"". The story of Grenfell's 21st floor Fire chief calls for sprinklers in tower blocks He added that the granting of permanent residency would depend on the completion of security and financial checks. Anyone wishing to apply for permanent residency under the proposal must come forward by 30 November. The announcement came on the same day as another inquest opened into the death of a resident of the tower. Ligaya Moore was a 78-year-old grandmother who had moved to London from the Philippines in 1974. Mrs Moore's inquest is the 68th inquest to be opened in relation to the fire. The chancellor said that money for works ordered in the wake of the tragedy in west London will be available only as the ""last resort"". Instead, Philip Hammond will remove rules which ring-fence some parts of council budgets to allow local authorities to use their own money. However, he insisted that all ""safety-critical"" changes would be made. Speaking to MPs, Mr Hammond said he had asked councils that said they did not have the money to set out details of the shortfall, but that none has yet done so. The chancellor said the government would act when it was certain that a council ""genuinely does not have any available resource"". The measures could include the removal of flammable cladding and retrofitting sprinkler systems in council-owned tower blocks. Councils said many of the changes had been recommended by local fire services. The inquest into Ligaya Moore's death opened on Wednesday On 16 June, two days after the Grenfell fire whichclaimed at least 60 lives, Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid pledged that the government would ""do whatever it takes"" to improve safety in tower blocks. Yet several councils havealready complainedthat money has not been forthcoming. The leader of the Labour opposition group on Westminster City Council, Adam Hug, said the local authority had struggled to secure funding from Mr Javid's department to pay for the removal of cladding and the installation of sprinklers. ""Ultimately these are things that the London Fire Brigade says have to be done and ultimately the cost is having to be borne by the housing revenue account, which is tenants' rents and service charge fees,"" Mr Hug said. Mr Javid says Kensington and Chelsea Council plans to have all former residents of the tower moved out of emergency hotel accommodation by Christmas, unless they want to stay, Most survivors in emergency housing Victims 'not being forced to move away' He stressed that no one would be forced to decide on a new home before they were ready. He said that of the 203 households left homeless by the fire, 92 were still living in hotels with no other offer of accommodation. Just 10 of them have moved into permanent new homes, and 44 were in temporary accommodation. Another 40 households have accepted the offer of permanent homes and 17 have taken temporary placements, but have not yet moved in, he said.

Spain takes step to Catalan direct rule,"This video can not be played Mr Rajoy accused the Catalan leader of creating confusion Spain's prime minister has put Catalonia on notice that it could impose direct rule on the region. Mariano Rajoy said his government had asked the regional government to clarify whether or not it had declared independence. The move is the first step towards suspending Catalonia's autonomy under the constitution. Catalan leaders signed a declaration of independence on Tuesday but halted implementation to allow for talks. The government in Madrid has now given Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont five days to say whether or not he has declared independence, Spanish news agency Efe reports. If Mr Puigdemont confirms he has declared independence, he will be given a further three days to withdraw the declaration before Article 155 of the constitution - allowing central government to suspend a region's autonomy and impose direct rule - is invoked, Efe adds. Catalan crisis in 300 words Spain has been in turmoil since the separatist government held a disputed referendum in Catalonia on 1 October which was declared invalid by the country's Constitutional Court. Almost 90% of voters backed independence with a turnout of 43%, Catalan officials say. Anti-independence voters largely boycotted the ballot and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they tried to stop the vote taking place. Catalans' verdicts on latest turmoil The view from Barcelona v Madrid What are the options now? Mr Rajoy accused Mr Puigdemont of having created ""deliberate confusion"" and said he wanted to restore ""certainty"". ""This call - ahead of any of the measures that the government may adopt under Article 155 of ourconstitution,external- seeks to offer citizens the clarity and security that a question of such importance requires,"" Mr Rajoy said. ""There is an urgent need to put an end to the situation that Catalonia is going through - to return it to safety, tranquillity and calm and to do that as quickly as possible."" Mr Rajoy was speaking after holding an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the government's next steps. Speaking later in parliament, Mr Rajoy said Spain was facing the most serious threat to its 40-year-old democracy. He accused the separatists of hatching an ""anti-democratic plan foisting their will on all the people of Catalonia"", and said the Spanish government had had no choice but to restore order. ""It falls to the Catalan leader to restore constitutional normality,"" he told deputies, rejecting any suggestion of outside mediation in the dispute. He added that he was willing to negotiate on the issue of regional autonomy and changes to the constitution - but this had to be within the framework of the law. Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor, Madrid Spain's prime minister tried today to put the ball back in the Catalan court. He's asked the Catalan president to clarify if he is making a declaration of independence or not. There is no official timeframe for the response, although political sources and Spanish media are now talking about five days (and then there is an argument about whether that includes the weekend and Thursday's national holiday). In the meantime, sources in the Senate (Spain's upper house of parliament, where Prime Minister Rajoy's Popular Party has a majority) say the request has been made to trigger Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, under which Mr Rajoy would be able to suspend Catalan autonomy - possibly immediately, or bit by bit. Prime Minister Rajoy has threatened to use Article 155 if Catalan independence is declared but the article has not yet been activated. Article 155 has never been used before, so we are in a kind of Brexit situation before Article 50 was triggered. The article legally exists but there are disagreements about how far-reaching it is, how it would/should work (and how quickly) in practice. Reports in Spanish media suggest that if the Spanish prime minister activates Article 155 in the absence of a response from the Catalan president, pro-independence parties in the Catalan parliament will then declare independence. The leader of the opposition Socialists, Pedro Sanchez, told reporters that his party and the government had agreed to examine the possibility of using constitutional reform to end the crisis. This would be focused on ""how Catalonia remains in Spain, and not how it leaves"", he added. This video can not be played Catalan leader seeks talks to secure independence Addressing the Catalan parliament in Barcelona on Tuesday evening, Mr Puigdemont said the autonomous region had won the right to be independent as a result of the vote. He urged the international community to recognise Catalonia as an ""independent and sovereign state"". He said the ""people's will"" was to break away from Madrid but he also said he wanted to ""de-escalate"" the tension around the issue. With this in mind he announced that he was ""suspending the effects of the declaration of independence"" for more talks with the Madrid government, which he said were needed to reach a solution. He and other Catalan leaders then signed the declaration of independence. It is not clear if the declaration has any legal status. The man who wants to break up Spain Would Catalonia be a viable country? Catalan crisis: Six things you need to know Crowds of independence supporters in Barcelona cheered Mr Puigdemont's initial remarks but many expressed disappointment as he clarified his stance. Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions but a stream of companies has announced plans to move head offices out of the province in response to the crisis. The European Union has made clear that should Catalonia split from Spain, the region would cease to be part of the EU. Are you in Catalonia? What do you think of the latest developments?

Ebay paid UK tax of Â£1.6m in 2016,"The UK arm of eBay paid only Â£1.6m in corporation tax last year, even though its US parent had total revenues from its UK operations of $1.32bn (Â£1bn). Ebay'sUK accounts,externalrecord only Â£200m in revenues, which came entirely from a Swiss parent firm, seemingly for acting as its advertising agency. The company declined to explain how its UK revenues were not booked though its UK business. However, an eBay spokesman said its tax affairs were entirely legal. ""In all countries and at all times, eBay is fully compliant with national, EU and international tax rules including those of the OECD, including the remittance of VAT to the appropriate authorities,"" he said. The pre-tax profit eBay UK made on its revenues in 2016 was Â£7.7m, according to the accounts, and it was on this figure that the UK corporation tax was levied. Ebay is a huge international business that makes money mainly from advertisers and the commission on sales made through its auction site. The total revenues of $1.32bn that the parent US business generated from the UK included those from subsidiaries such as the Stubhub ticket exchange and Gumtree classifieds site. Within the group, the UK arm of eBay is wholly owned by eBay International, which is based in Switzerland and is itself owned byeBay in the US,external. The firm's UK accounts describe the role of eBay UK as providing ""services to eBay International by recommending market penetration and advertising strategies for the UK internal marketplace and related third party advertising sales in the UK, Germany, Italy, Belgium and Australia"". The seeming ability of the company to shelter most its UK profits from the UK tax authorities raises again the ability of big international companies to route their revenues to the countries with the most favourable tax regimes. This has led in the past few years to intense scrutiny of the tax practices of big firms such as Apple, Amazon, Google and Starbucks. Ebay in the US, whose international revenues hit $9bn last year, acknowledged that its tax affairs were under scrutiny in several countries, which may leave it with more tax to pay. ""The material jurisdictions where we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities for tax years after 2002 include, among others, the US (Federal and California), Germany, Korea, Israel, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Canada,"" its US accounts said.

Unsent text accepted as dead man's will,"A court in Australia has accepted an unsent, draft text message on a dead man's mobile phone as an official will. The 55-year-old man had composed a text message addressed to his brother, in which he gave ""all that I have"" to his brother and nephew. The message was found in the drafts folder on the man's phone after he took his own life last year . Brisbane Supreme Court ruled that the wording of the text indicated that the man intended it to act as his will. In the message, the man gave details of how to access his bank account and where he had hidden money in his house. ""Put my ashes in the back garden,"" he wrote. ""A bit of cash behind TV and a bit in the bank."" According toABC News,external, the man's wife applied to manage his assets and argued that the text message was not valid as a will because it was never sent. Typically, for a will to be valid in Queensland, it must be written and signed by two witnesses. Justice Susan Brown said the wording of the text message, which ended with the words ""my will"", showed that the man intended it to act as his will. ""The reference to his house and superannuation and his specification that the applicant was to take her own things indicates he was aware of the nature and extent of his estate, which was relatively small,"" she said. She said the ""informal nature"" of the message did not stop it representing the man's intentions, especially as it was ""created on or about the time that the deceased was contemplating death, such that he even indicated where he wanted his ashes to be placed"". In 2006, the law in Queensland was changed to allow less formal types of documents to be considered as a will. Another unusual will accepted in Queensland includes a DVD marked with ""my will"", in 2013. The UK's Law Commission is currently fieldinga public consultation on the legal rules applying to wills,external. The proposals listed by the body includes giving courts the capacity to ""dispense with the formalities for a will where it's clear what the deceased wanted"".

What is Donald Trump's IQ?,"Question: How often does President Trump talk about IQ? Answer: All the time. When Mr Trump recently boasted that his IQ was higher than Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's, it was part of a pattern. In 2013, he tweeted that his IQ was ""much higher"" than Barack Obama and George W Bush. He has also claimed a higher IQ than comedian Jon Stewart and British star of The Apprentice, Lord Sugar. Despite this, Mr Trump has never revealed his own IQ. So can we work it out? Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An Intelligence Quotient is a score given to someone after taking an intelligence test. There is no single ""IQ test"" - Mensa accepts results from more than 200 tests, including its own. Some tests last an hour, while some have no time limit. Dr Frank Lawlis, the supervisory psychologist of American Mensa, says they usually test spatial, quantitative, and verbal skills. Broadly, spatial questions are about shape and measurement; quantitative questions are mathematical; and verbal questions are about words - for example, how one word is similar to another. Mensa accepts those who score in the top 2%. That equates - very roughly - to an IQ of 130. 1.What is the four-digit number in which the first digit is one-fifth the last, and the second and third digits are the last digit multiplied by 3?

""But you can easily find a list of presidents inducted into Phi Beta Kappa in their universities."" Founded in 1776, Phi Beta Kappa honours ""the best and brightest liberal arts and sciences undergraduates from 286 top schools across the nation"". Of the 44 presidents,17 have been Phi Beta Kappa,externalmembers. Bill Clinton, George H W Bush, and Jimmy Carter were the most recent. Dr Perry puts forward, among others, Herbert Hoover (""a very, very bright scientist, a geologist""), Woodrow Wilson (""our only PhD president""), and William H Taft (""a brilliant lawyer""). And, although a president's IQ has never been confirmed, in 2006 the University of California estimated that John Quincy Adams wasthe most intelligent of all presidents,external. Winston Churchill, Franklin D Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin at Yalta in 1945 Dr Perry also says some presidents have undeserved reputations. ""Gerald Ford was viewed as being a klutz, because he would trip in public, but that was so unfair. ""He had an undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan, where he was from, he was an Eagle Scout, he went to Yale Law School, and he was a star footballer on top of that."" Trump challenges Rex Tillerson to IQ test 13-year-old from Essex scores 161 in IQ test She also says that intelligence is only part of what makes a good president. ""It was the Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes who famously said Franklin Delano Roosevelt had 'a second class intellect but a first class temperament'. ""Roosevelt was re-elected in '36 by two-thirds of the electorate."" ""I would put Warren Harding in that category,"" says Dr Perry. ""He was a journalist by training."" This is awkward... ""Some of my best friends are journalists!"" says Dr Perry, laughing. ""And my brother is. But my point is, he wasn't from Harvard or Yale, and he wasn't a brilliant lawyer who ended up on the supreme court."" ""If he ever releases his IQ, I just have a feeling - especially since he is daring Tillerson to release his - that it's higher than people would presume,"" says Dr Perry. ""People who don't like him say 'oh he's such an idiot, oh he's so stupid'. But I bet you it's higher than we might realise."" Professor Fred I Greenstein, professor of politics emeritus at Princeton University, listssix qualities that bear on presidential performance,external. They are: public communication, organisational capacity, political skill, vision, cognitive style, and emotional intelligence. ""Trump scores low on emotional intelligence, cognitive style, vision, and organisational capacity,"" says Dr Perry. ""Where he has been superb, in order to win the presidency, is public communication and political skill."" 4.Tabitha likes cookies but not cake.

But - whether Mr Trump's IQ is high or low - Dr Lawlis from Mensa says it doesn't tell you everything. ""If you take someone we consider to be a genius like Einstein, he would probably not do well on an IQ test, because he thinks outside the box,"" he says. ""He could probably think of a dozen answers to one question."" Either way, the time for talking may soon be over - Mensa has offered to test both Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson's IQ.

Phone-in-bed pupils given alarm clocks,"Heather Hanbury handed out school branded alarm clocks to students at an assembly marking world Mental Heath Day A school has handed out free alarm clocks to students in an effort to stop mobile phones interrupting their sleep. Heather Hanbury, head teacher at Lady Eleanor Holles in west London, advised parents to ban phones, televisions and computers from their children's bedrooms. ""Students often claim they need their phone to wake them up in the morning,"" Mrs Hanbury told the BBC. But she said mobile phones were distracting them from sleeping. ""Young people are regularly online, dealing with social media distracted by the idea of missing out if they're not online,"" she said. Every girl in the Senior School in Hampton - 700 students in total - was given an alarm clock at an assembly marking World Mental Health Day. The Â£20,000-a-year private girls school also carried out workshops for students on how ""to rewire an anxious brain"". Parents of pupils at Lady Eleanor Holles school have been asked to ban phones, televisions and computers from their children's bedrooms. In ablog,externalon the school's website, Mrs Hanbury wrote: ""Without a proper amount of sleep nightly, it is very difficult to learn efficiently and effectively.

Van crashes into thatched cottage,"No-one is thought to have been injured in the crash A white van has crashed through the front door of a listed 16th Century thatched cottage. It is thought the vehicle came off at a bend on Ampthill Road, in Maulden, Bedfordshire, on Tuesday before it crossed a grass verge, went through a hedge and embedded itself in the house. A 34-year-old man from Maulden was arrested on suspicion of being unable to drive through drink or drugs. No-one is thought to have been hurt in the crash. Val Fossey, who lives in the cottage, said there was ""a dreadful noise - like an earthquake"" when the van struck. The van crashed through the front door and is said to have gone into the hall and kitchen She was in the living room with her husband Steve when the van crashed into their home, which they have lived in for 14 years, at about 22:35 BST. ""This van came flying over a hedge and crashed into our hall and kitchen,"" she said. ""If I had left the room I don't know what would have happened. ""We are not right on the bend and we are about 20 yards from the road,"" she said. ""He must have been going fast to go over the verge. ""There are cracks going up the wall into the bedroom. ""I don't know when we will be allowed back in."" Val and Steve Fossey have lived in the 16th Century cottage for 14 years Central Bedfordshire Council's structural engineers have said the house is structurally safe. A spokesman said an expert had checked the building, and the area that the van damaged had been shored up. The authority said it was waiting for the insurers to take over the case and it was not clear when the family would be able to return home.

'Upside-down ice canyon' revealed,"Graphic: Some fast-thinning glaciers drain into the Amundsen Sea Scientists have identified a way in which the effects of Antarctic melting can be enhanced. Their new satellite observations of the Dotson Ice Shelf show its losses, far from being even, are actually focused on a long, narrow sector. In places, this has cut an inverted canyon through more than half the thickness of the shelf structure. If the melting continued unabated, it would break Dotson in 40-50 years, not the 200 years currently projected. ""That is unlikely to happen because the ice will respond in some way to the imbalance,"" said Noel Gourmelen, from the University of Edinburgh, UK. ""It's possible the area of thinning could widen or the flow of ice could change. Both would affect the rate at which the channel forms. ""But the important point here is that Dotson is not a flat slab and it can be much thinner in places than we think it is and much closer to a stage where it might experience major change."" British mission to giant berg approved Giant iceberg splits from Antarctic Shells record Antarctic glacier retreat Satellite's ice vision is boosted This video can not be played This animation shows how warm water gets under and melts the ice shelf Dr Gourmelen's new study,published in Geophysical Research Letters,external, uses the European Space Agency'sCryosat,externalandSentinel-1,externalspacecraft to make a detailed examination of the thickness and movement of Dotson. The 70km by 40km ice shelf is the floating projection of two glaciers, Kohler and Smith. As they stream off the west of Antarctica, their fronts lift up and join together, pushing out over the Amundsen Sea. The shelf acts as a buttress to the ice behind. If Dotson were not present, Kohler and Smith would flow much faster, dumping more of their mass in the ocean, contributing to sea-level rise. Satellites have long tracked the behaviour of the shelf, but in Cryosat in particular researchers now have an altimeter instrument that is able to retrieve much higher-resolution elevation information than ever before. Ice shelves are the floating protrusions of glaciers flowing off the continent Taking the period of its observations from 2010-2016, Dr Gourmelen's team can see that Dotson's surface is lowering on average by about 26cm per year, which suggests the roughly 400m-thick shelf as a whole is thinning by about 2.5m per year. But Cryosat's sharper vision also reveals that this thinning is concentrated at a surface depression that is roughly 5km wide and 60km long. It extends from the point where the glacier ice starts to float as it comes off the land, all the way out to the front edge of the shelf where icebergs are calved into the ocean. What the team is able to show is that this surface depression corresponds to an incised canyon on the underside of the shelf. The average width of this inverted gorge is 10-15km but it cuts up into the shelf by as much as 200m in places. The Edinburgh-led group says all the evidence suggests warm water from the deep ocean around Antarctica has got under the shelf to melt out the canyon. ""We say warm; it's 0.6-0.7 degrees,"" explains Dr Gourmelen. ""It makes its way into the cavity under the shelf along a trough to the grounding line, and then it starts to rotate clockwise and rises. And it comes out on the west side. That's where we see the thinning and the basal melt."" Artist's impression: Cryosat, with its radar altimeter, was launched into orbit in 2010 This export of fresh melt-water from the underside of the shelf carries with it a lot of iron from rocks scraped from the continent, and drives strong growth in plankton and other biological activity in front of Dotson. Just a simple forward projection using the pattern and rates of thinning observed by Cryosat and Sentinel-1 in this study would lead to complete melt-through of Dotson's front in 20 or so years, and its rear in about 40 years. That is on the order of 170 years earlier than Dotson would thin to zero using the ice-shelf-averaged thinning rate. But as previously stated - the shelf is not a static structure and it will react to the formation of the canyon. ""An ice shelf can be a complicated thing,"" says co-author Prof Andy Shepherd from Leeds University and principal scientific adviser on the Cryosat mission. ""As you thin them it reduces the traction on the feeding glaciers, allowing those glaciers to speed up; and as they speed up, they should put more ice into the ice shelf so that it thickens again. It is supposed to be a stabilising effect."" Prof Shepherd saida new high-resolution swath modeused by Cryosat at Dotson was now being deployed elsewhere around Antarctica to look for more patterns of enhanced thinning on other ice shelves.

10 toughest places for girls to go to school,"South Sudan has been named as the worst place in the world for education for girls Debates about schools in richer countries are often about the politics of priorities, what subjects should be given most importance, who needs extra help and what needs more public spending. But for families in many developing countries questions about education can be a lot more basic - is there any access to school at all? Figures from the United Nations suggest there has been ""almost zero progress"" in the past decade in tackling the lack of school places in some of the world's poorest countries. A further report examined the quality of education, and the UN said the findings were ""staggering"", withmore than 600 million children in school but learning next to nothing. In Niger, four out of five adult women remain illiterate While in affluent Western countries, girls are often ahead of boys in academic achievement, in poorer parts of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, girls are much more likely to be missing out. And on the UN's International Day of the Girl, the development campaign, One, has created a ranking for the toughest places for girls to get an education. Across these 10 countries, most of those without school places are girls. These are fragile countries, where many families are at risk from poverty, ill health, poor nutrition and displacement from war and conflict. Refugees displaced by fighting this summer in South Sudan Many young girls are expected to work rather than go to school. And many marry young, ending any chance of an education. UN figures indicate girls are more than twice as likely to lose out on education in conflict zones. Refugees in Chad: Conflicts have disrupted the educations of tens of millions The rankings are based on: the proportion of girls without a primary school place the proportion of girls without a secondary school place the proportion of girls completing primary school the proportion of girls completing secondary school the average number of years girls attend school female illiteracy rates teacher training levels the teacher-pupil ratio public spending on education For some countries, such as Syria, there was insufficient reliable data for them to be included. Here are the top 10 toughest places for girls' education: South Sudan: the world's newest country has faced much violence and war, with the destruction of schools and families forced from their homes. Almost three-quarters of girls do not even make it to primary school Central African Republic:one teacher for every 80 pupils Niger: only 17% of women between the ages of 15 and 24 are literate Afghanistan: wide gender gap, with boys more likely to be in school than girls Chad: many social and economic barriers to girls and women getting education Mali: only 38% of girls finish primary school Guinea: the average time in education among women over the age of 25 is less than one year Burkina Faso: only 1% of girls complete secondary school Liberia: almost two-thirds of primary-age pupils out of school Ethiopia: two in five girls are married before the age of 18 A shortage of teachers is a common problem across poorer countries. Last year, the UN said another 69 million teachers would need to be recruited worldwide by 2030 if international promises on education were to be kept. Florence Cheptoo learned to read at 60, when her grandchild brought home a library book The report says there are great economic dividends if girls can be kept in school. And there are great gains for individuals, such as Florence Cheptoo, who lives in a remote village in Kenya andlearned to read at the age of 60. Gayle Smith, president of the One campaign, called the failures in education for girls a ""global crisis that perpetuates poverty"". ""Over 130 million girls are still out of school - that's over 130 million potential engineers, entrepreneurs, teachers and politicians whose leadership the world is missing out on.""

Hammond's 'last moment' plan for 'no deal',"This video can not be played Hammond: Not time yet for 'no deal' spending Taxpayers' money will not be spent on preparing for a ""no-deal"" Brexit until the ""very last moment"", Chancellor Philip Hammond has suggested. He said he was preparing for ""no deal"" and all other outcomes and would make money available when needed. But he said he wouldn't take money from other areas, like health or education, now just to ""send a message"" to the EU. At PM's questions Theresa May rejected claims she was ramping up ""no deal"" talk, insisting she wanted agreement. ""We are actively working... with the EU to ensure a good deal, the right deal for Britain for a brighter future for this country,"" Mrs May told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions. One ex-minister, David Jones, has said billions should be set aside in November's Budget for a ""no deal"" scenario, arguing that if this did not happen it would be seen as a ""a sign of weakness"" by EU leaders who would think the UK was not serious about leaving the EU without a deal. Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? May won't say if she'd vote for Brexit now Laura Kuenssberg: PM's Brexit vote hesitation may haunt her EU's Tusk warns over 'slow pace' of talks The chancellor, who has been accused of being too pessimistic about Brexit, told the Treasury committee of MPs a ""cloud of uncertainty"" over the outcome of negotiations was ""acting as a dampener"" on the economy. He said this could only be removed by progress in the talks, which he said was dependent on the EU agreeing to discuss its future relationship with the UK as soon as possible. He told MPs one worst case scenario for a ""no deal"", would see no air travel taking place between the UK and the EU on Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - but added that he did not see that as likely to happen, even if the UK/EU talks failed to reach agreement. Writing in the Times,externalahead of next month's Budget, Mr Hammond said he had a responsibility to be ""realistic"" about the challenges of leaving the EU and would spend money only when it was ""responsible"" to do so. This video can not be played Mrs May said she would not answer ""hypothetical questions"" An extra Â£412m has already been allocated to government departments to prepare for Brexit over the next four years and Treasury sources suggested more would be made available if negotiations faltered. Asked about the article as he appeared before the Commons Treasury committee, Mr Hammond said he was ""committed"" to funding departments for Brexit preparation and he was ""rather surprised"" that the article might be interpreted as saying that he was reluctant to do so. ""We are prepared to spend when we need to spend against the contingency of a 'no deal' outcome,"" he said. ""I am clear we have to be prepared for a 'no deal' scenario unless and until we have clear evidence that this is not where we will end up."" ""What I am not prepared to do is allocate funds to departments in advance of the need to spend,"" he added. This video can not be played Would it have been better if the UK voted Remain? Newsnight's Emily Maitlis presses Damian Green ""We should look in each area at the last point that spending can begin to ensure we are ready for a day-one 'no deal' scenario. ""Every pound we spend on contingency preparations on a hard customs border is a pound we can't spend on the NHS, social care or education. I don't believe we should be in the business of making potentially nugatory expenditure until the very last moment when we need to do so."" Theresa May was pressed on the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, in which former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith sought assurances ""all necessary monies"" would be spent preparing for a no deal outcome. ""Where money needs to be spent it will be spent,"" the prime minister replied, adding that government departments would be given an extra Â£250m this year to prepare for a range of Brexit outcomes. This video can not be played Heidi Alexander says the British people ""deserve better than a prime minister simply running scared"" Labour's Heidi Alexander accused Mrs May of ""running scared"" of Tory backbenchers - prompting the PM to reply ""the honourable lady could not be more wrong... we are not ramping up a no deal scenario"". On Tuesday, Mrs May - who backed Remain in last year's vote - repeatedly refused to say if she would now vote for Brexit, telling LBC radio: ""I don't answer hypothetical questions."" At PMQs, the SNP's Ian Blackford claimed the PM ""could not answer a simple question"" and urged her to ""come off the fence"" and recognise the risk to jobs in Scotland from leaving the single market and customs union. In response, the prime minister said she was clear the UK would be leaving the EU in March 2019 and that there would be no second referendum.

Want to live happy? Choose a spa town,"The Warwickshire town of Royal Leamington Spa has been ranked the happiest place to live in Britain, in a survey which saw several spa towns make the list. Harrogate, Royal Tunbridge Wells and Epsom also featured in the top 10 ""happy at home"" index compiled by property website, Rightmove. Meanwhile Llandrindod Wells was deemed the happiest place to live in Wales. Spa towns have natural springs with waters thought to have health benefits. Is Leamington Spa really that happy? The Romans knew how to live happy as they took the waters in Bath There are spa towns all across England and Wales - including Cheltenham and Bath which came in 29th and 38th place in terms of happiness rating. Dumfries was identified as the happiest place to live in Scotland. Where can I afford to live? Is Dumfries the happiest place in Scotland? Where is the best place to be a woman in Britain? More than 17,000 people were asked how happy they are with aspects of where they live. Community spirit, feeling safe, the friendliness of locals, the amenities and local services available and earning enough to live comfortably were all taken into account. The Pittville Pump Room was the largest spa building built in Cheltenham Rightmove said Royal Leamington Spa scored highly for friendly neighbours and a strong sense of belonging. But happiness comes with a price, with the average asking price of a home in Leamington Spa at Â£330,848, compared with a national average of Â£310,003, according to Rightmove. The town's mayor, Caroline Evetts, said Royal Leamington Spa ""has it all"" - from Regency buildings, to independent boutiques. Last year's winner, Leigh-On-Sea, Essex, took the runner-up spot in this year's survey. The spa town of Harrogate consistently comes out as one of the happiest places to live Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire Leigh-on-Sea, Essex Wirral, Merseyside and Cheshire Harrogate, North Yorkshire Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent King's Lynn, Norfolk Epsom, Surrey Richmond upon Thames, London Poole, Dorset Chichester, West Sussex Source: Rightmove Is Leamington Spa really that happy?

Reality Check: Is the SNP's childcare pledge 'unmatched'?,"The claim:Nicola Sturgeon told her party conference that the Scottish government's commitment to early years education and childcare was ""unmatched anywhere else in the UK"" as she fleshed out plans to expand childcare provision. Reality Check verdict:Overall, Scotland's planned childcare provision would be the most generous in the UK, as it plans to offer 1,140 hours a year, regardless of whether parents are in work. However, a pilot scheme under way in Wales is better for working parents as it offers 1,440 hours a year. When Nicola Sturgeon took to the stage at the SNP conference, she said she was committed to giving children in Scotland ""the best possible start in life"". She confirmed that the Scottish government would increase its offer of free childcare from 16 hours a week to 30 hours for three- and four-year-olds, as well as vulnerable two-year-olds, by 2020. And she pledged to double investment in early years education and childcare, from Â£420m to Â£840m a year, by the end of the current parliament. ""This is a commitment unmatched anywhere else in the UK,"" she said. ""And it's the best investment we can make in Scotland's future."" The first minister's office confirmed that what she meant was that the universality of care offered to children north of the border would be better than that provided in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Reality Check has looked into the claims. Parents of three- and four-year-olds and vulnerable two-year-olds in Scotland are currently offered 600 hours of free childcare a year. It works out at roughly 16 hours a week over 38 weeks of the year but families can choose to spread the hours over a longer period. The Scottish government wants to increase annual childcare provision to 1,140 hours by 2020. Funded childcare is currently offered to all families in Scotland - regardless of the employment status of their parents. That is where Nicola Sturgeon's plans differ from those in practice across the rest of the UK. All families in England are currently offered 570 free hours a year. However, where both parents (or one in single-parent families) work more than 16 hours a week, they are entitled to 1,140 hours a year. In Wales, a pilot scheme is under way where working families in seven authorities are offered 1,440 hours of childcare a year. That works out at 30 hours a week over 48 weeks. As in England, it is available only to families where both parents (or one in a single-parent family) work more than 16 hours a week. Every child in Wales is eligible for 10 hours of early years education a week, from the term after their third birthday. That is incorporated into the 30 free hours in the pilot areas. Families in Northern Ireland can access between 12.5 and 22.5 hours of funded pre-school education a week over 38 weeks for all three- and four-year-olds. One of the key actions of the NI executive's draft programme for government was to ""extend responsive, high-quality provision in early childhood education and care"" for families with young children. However, Northern Ireland has been without an executive for 10 months, following a row between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The parties are in discussions to restore the government.

Harvey Weinstein's wife leaves him,"Ms Chapman, pictured here with her husband, said his actions were ""unforgivable"" The wife of producer Harvey Weinstein has said she is leaving him following allegations of sexual harassment from a string of actresses. Georgina Chapman, 41, described Weinstein's actions as ""unforgivable"". Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow are the latest women to come forward. Both said the incidents happened early in their careers. On Tuesday, Weinstein also denied allegations of rape made inThe New Yorker,externalmagazine. Weinstein was fired on Sunday from his own film studio. The Weinstein Company board said on Tuesday that they would help any criminal investigation. ""My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,"" Georgina Chapman, 41,told People magazine,external. Chapman and Weinstein, 65, have two children together. In a statement, the film mogul said: ""âI support her decision, I am in counselling and perhaps, when I am better, we can rebuild.""

""This behaviour towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable."" Gwyneth Paltrow said she was ""terrified"" when Weinstein made advances on her In a statement, Paltrow alleged that, after Weinstein cast her in the leading role in Emma, he summoned her to his hotel suite, where he placed his hands on her and suggested massages in his bedroom. ""I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,"" she told the newspaper. She said she told her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt about the incident, and said he confronted Weinstein. ""I thought he was going to fire me,"" she said.

Amol Rajan: Weinstein's casting couch horror,"Harvey Weinstein is believed to be in Europe to seek therapy The scandal surrounding Harvey Weinstein shows it is impossible to understand the history of film and television without recognising the central role, and potential horror, of the so-called casting couch. This colloquialism refers to the capacity for auditions to turn into mechanisms for sexual exploitation. The casting couch is a kind of erotic theatre in itself: one in which would-be performers exhibit their suitability for a particular role and provide sexual favours. It is a place with a very hierarchical power dynamic: ambitious, not to say desperate, talent; and producer, director or whoever with the capacity to make dreams come true. As both the cliche and the grim reality have it, the talent is often a young woman, and the dream-maker an older man. This is the situation in which a 22-year-old Gwyneth Paltrow found herself when, she alleges, Weinstein made unwanted advances towards her. In the revolting revelations emerging about sexual bullying by Weinstein - who denies the bulk of allegations against him - the power dynamic of the casting couch is shown to be a forum for sickening exploitation and potentially criminal abuse. The most striking thing about the New York Times and New Yorker's reports is the elaborate lengths to which Weinstein and those around him allegedly went to facilitate casting couch sessions, usually in hotels. According to several actresses quoted in recent stories, assistants would deliver on-screen talent before leaving them to their private rendezvous with Weinstein; and afterward, if they were upset, would help smooth things over by hushing things up or speaking to relatives. It may be lazy or dangerous to extrapolate from the individual case of Weinstein to a broader problem in the media and film industries - though as I saidin an earlier blog post, it is impossible not to see these awful allegations alongside those levelled at Bill O'Reilly, the late Roger Ailes, Bill Cosby and even Donald Trump. I also said perhaps some good could come of this awful story. If the casting couch ceases to be a forum for sexual exploitation of vulnerable, desperate performers by perverts; and if other women who have experienced the sordid worst of the casting couch feel they can come forward, the media and film industries may yet benefit from the depredations of this Hollywood thug.

India rules sex with child bride is rape,"The age of consent in India is 18, but marital rape is not considered an offence India's Supreme Court has struck down a legal clause that permits men to have sex with their underage wives. The clause, which was part of India's law on rape, said intercourse between a man and his wife was permissible as long as she was over 15 years of age. The legal age of consent and marriage in India is 18 but marital rape is not considered an offence. The verdict has been hailed by women's rights activists but correspondents say the order will be difficult to enforce. The judgement said that girls under 18 would be able to charge their husbands with rape, as long as they complained within one year of being forced to have sexual relations. The child marriage tradition of an Indian tribe India girl ends child 'marriage' ""This is a landmark judgement that corrects a historical wrong against girls. How could marriage be used as a criterion to discriminate against girls?"" Vikram Srivastava, the founder of Independent Thought, one of the main petitioners in the case, told the BBC. However, the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi says that while welcome, the order will be difficult to implement in a country where child marriage is still rampant. ""Courts and police cannot monitor people's bedrooms and a minor girl who is already married, almost always with the consent of her parents, will not usually have the courage to go to the police or court and file a case against her husband,"" our correspondent says. India's government says the practice of child marriage is ""an obstacle to nearly every developmental goal: eradicating poverty and hunger; achieving universal primary education; promoting gender equality; protecting children's lives; and improving women's health"".

Anoraks are ""extremely important"" items of clothing, he says. He goes on to say that there is ""no legal barrier"" to the EU allowing a post-Brexit UK access to EU data protection authorities. He says the UK is ""seeking an arrangement at least as strong"" as current data agreements with the EU.

Childcare debate Westminster Hall Labour's Ruth George tells MPs that the Conservative manifesto promise of more free hours childcare had been popular in the 2015 general election - and had even pushed the Conservatives ahead in some polls. She recalls that at the time Conservatives said the policy would be funded by reducing pension contributions tax relief. However she says that at the time of the budget the money was instead spent on cutting inheritance tax. As a result, she argues that the number of promised available places has been reduced by two thirds. Westminster Hall MPs in Westminster Hall now begin a debate on the effects of30 hours free childcare. The Childcare Act 2016 provides for an additional 15 hours
of free childcare for certain working parents. Funding for childcare places is a devolved matter and this
debate applies to England only. Some education charities and nursery providers are warning that the new scheme is underfunded, and that parents may face higher costs and nurseries could close.

From Disney to Pompey for Portsmouth boss Eisner,"Michael Eisner watched a lot of football in Europe and the US before buying Portsmouth Two decades at the helm of global entertainment giant Walt Disney might seem a strange apprenticeship for taking over a lower-level English football club, but Michael Eisner insists it is the latest logical move in his high-flying business career. The 75-year-old American completed his takeover ofhistoric south coast club Portsmouth in Augustfor Â£5.67m, buying it from fans who had stepped in with their own money to save the club. The club, nicknamed Pompey, had fallen on hard financial times since winning the FA Cup in 2008, and had dropped from the Premier League to the bottom tier, but did get promoted back to League One at the end of last season. Michael Eisner completes takeover of Portsmouth Esiner knows Portsmouth takeover will be 'daunting' After a lifetime working for some of the biggest US and international TV and film firms, including ABC and Paramount as well as Disney, the native of New York state had launched his own investment firm, and was looking for interesting projects to back. Mr Eisner,whose net worth is estimated at $1bn,external(Â£760m), and his Tornante group will invest Â£10m in the club. ""What is an American guy doing getting involved with English football?,"" he says. ""Well, I am qualified for this new role. In a way I feel my whole career has led up to this."" Portsmouth FC is starting out on what Mr Eisner hopes is a march back up the league tables Indeed, during his time in the entertainment industry Mr Eisner was involved in a number of sports-related projects, including TV scheduling, film production, and the acquisition of clubs. ""There are differences between sport and entertainment - one must be scripted, planned, produced, and the other is more spontaneous, extemporaneous. But both have conflict, a climax and an ending,"" he observes. ""And whatever your brand, product, league, club - the idea of loyalty or passion is key."" And Eisner says it was the raucous fan reaction to Portsmouth winning promotion, and the League Two title, last season that was the final factor in convincing him to buy the club. Mr Eisner says it was the passion of the fans that convinced him to buy Portsmouth FC ""Because of this mad enthusiasm I found Pompey irresistible,"" he said at the Leaders sports conference in London. ""I had first heard about the possibility of acquiring the club when I was looking at the possibility of buying a US sports team. Investing in US sport is very expensive. The NFL has its physical problems which scare me. ""It [football] just seemed a great thing to me and my family. We got hooked on the game in the UK."" Mr Eisner and his three sons, Breck, Eric, and Anders, make up the Portsmouth board, along with Andy Redman, president of Tornante, and Portsmouth FC chief executive Mark Catlin. Despite its recent woes the club has a strong heritage, winning the League title in 1949 and 1950, and FA Cup in 1939 as well as nine years ago. Mr Eisner says he was struck by Portsmouth's historic past ""When I passed through the Fratton Park turnstiles I felt like I did when I stepped through the doors at Disney - a sense of excitement and of a rich history,"" he says. ""Portsmouth fans are passionate. [After] four strange owners the fans stepped in and bought the team. ""Pompey fans had done a remarkable job but it seemed they would need additional investment to build the brand."" He says there were another reasons, apart from fan passion and history, that he and his family wanted to buy a football club. The new owners say they have plans to upgrade Fratton Park stadium One is the fact that football has a global appeal, and also - in a currently fractured media landscape - ""the only appointment-to-view [TV] is for sports events"". ""Today, viewers can watch the shows they want any time they want on on multiple devices. But sport fans want to watch their teams compete in real time,"" he says. That means that sports, and football, TV rights will always be in high demand by broadcasters looking for content. Mr Eisner was introduced to the fans before the opening game of the season against Rochdale As well as the expertise and cash that Eisner is providing, he is also promising to improve the stadium and promote managerial stability. ""Over time we will make the match day experience the pleasure it should be,"" he says, adding the club will also continue to build on its strong community work, for which it has won a number of Football League awards. Michael Eisner at the launch of an ESPN sports-themed restaurant ""At ABC TV in 1970 we made a crack in the traditional entertainment wall, by moving NFL Football to prime time on a Monday night. ABC was the smallest network and needed success,"" he says. It became one of the longest-running prime time shows ever on commercial network TV. At Paramount he oversaw production of sports films Players, North Dallas Forty, and the Bad News Bears trilogy. In 1984 he became Disney chairman and the company produced the film The Mighty Ducks.  Disney in 1993 then created an actual ice hockey team called the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, now the Anaheim Ducks. In 2006-07 the team won the NHL's Stanley Cup. Disney also produced baseball film Angels in the Outfield in 1984. In 1997 Disney took over the California Angels team. It was renamed the Anaheim Angels and under Disney's ownership won its first World Series championship in 2002. During Mr Eisner's time at Disney it also acquired leading sports cable TV channel ESPN in 1996. His current private firm bought the Topps sports trading card firm in 2007.  It is licensed to produce English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Uefa Champions League, and Indian Premier League cricket products. Mr Eisner now says the club, which sits mid-table in League One, now needs stability and continuity on and off the playing field. He believes if club owners give their manager support, then the coaching team will have the confidence to lead the team to success. ""If you look at the great sports teams, you try to find a great manager and stick with him through thick and thin,"" he says. Mr Eisner says there are similarities between Portsmouth and Disney fans He says he hopes current manager Kenny Jackett will be in the post for a decade, and oversee success during that time. ""The Disney fans are similar to Portsmouth fans,"" he says. ""When I went there it was about to be broken up. The fans' love of Disney helped support it. ""All of Disney's sports films had the same theme - the triumph of the underdog. With Portsmouth we hope to get it right in fact, not fiction. ""We will get there - being slow, steady and smart.""

Are men forgotten in miscarriage?,"James and his wife Joanna had seven miscarriages before they had their son Samuel. One in four couples who discover they are pregnant have a miscarriage, but men are often forgotten both in terms of emotional support and as the potential cause. But researchers are working on a treatment which focuses on how their health could affect pregnancy. James Barnett and his partner endured seven miscarriages before successfully having a son, Samuel, who is now nine months old. Despite their ordeal he says he only cried in front of his wife once. At their 12-week scan the couple found the baby had no heartbeat and were sent home with drugs to induce the miscarriage. Within a few hours of agony on their bed, Joanna delivered the baby. ""She passed it to me and I looked at it and that really was the first time it hit home that this was a baby,"" he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""I was so upset, the potential this baby could have had, what it could have been, what it could have achieved. And I broke down, just to see it in front of you, just what it could have been."" Men say they can find themselves overlooked in terms of the emotional impact of miscarriage. Gareth Watkins, whose wife Jo had three miscarriages before their two-year-old daughter Jessica, said he found explaining how he felt to others was the hardest thing. Gareth Watkins said he tried to be a supporting figure for his wife Jo when they had three miscarriages. ""I'd make an excuse to go out to the shops just so I have ten minutes were I could compose myself, even crying sometimes, just out there on my own just trying to work through it. Just so you can go back into the house, try and be that supportive figure for your partner who's obviously in bits with what's gone on,"" he said. And despite the fact that one in 100 couples will have three or more miscarriages, some men say the emotional support available from medical professionals is ""next to nothing"" unless you are able to pay for it. Al Ferguson has three children, but has experienced six miscarriages. He said very little support is offered to couples afterwards: ""There's no follow-up appointment. [It would help] even if there was just one appointment or something which the GPs could do, to ask 'how's it going?'"" Prof Lesley Regan, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says the lack of care for men comes down to resources. ""Offering counselling and bereavement counselling often in this cash-strapped NHS that we're working in at the moment, is difficult, and it's maybe the one thing that's considered, for example in the clinic I'm running, to be non-essential,"" she said. ""I would have to prioritise the investigative tests I'm doing and try and encourage the couple to find the support and the counselling from other sources, from family, from friends."" Often miscarriage is caused by problems with chromosomes, but one of hardest things for parents is not knowing why it has gone wrong. But last year the UK's first national research centre dedicated to understanding miscarriage opened at Birmingham Women's Hospital. It is funded by Tommy's baby charity, in partnership with the University of Birmingham, the University of Warwick and Imperial College London. Simon and his wife, Kate, had three miscarriages while having their sons Isaac and Ethan. One of the researchers is Dr Jackson Kirkman-Brown, who said around half of miscarriages currently have no explanation. But they think a lot may be due to the male's sperm. ""Until now, everybody has thought, after the man has got the lady pregnant, that's the end of his role. And if she loses the child, that's something that's wrong with her. Our research is really starting to turn that on its head. Now we think around half the time we can't find an answer about miscarriage, it may be down to sperm DNA,"" he said. The researchers have developed a dietary supplement which they hope to be able to give to those men to correct the problem in how they make sperm. ""If we get the trial data to support this supplement working, we'd aim to have it out there on the market within a very few years to treat these problems,"" Dr Kirkman-Brown said. ""We're incredibly optimistic about this research, and excited to push through to the next stage. We estimate that tens of thousands of miscarriages each year in the UK may be down to a male factor so we hope if we could correct that, perhaps 10,000 babies more a year would be born that otherwise would have had a miscarriage."" This video can not be played The Victoria Derbyshire programme hears from four men who have had 19 miscarriages between them Simon Webb and his wife Kate experienced three miscarriages while having their two sons. Simon said the development sounded amazing, but he remains cautious. ""You listen to the news and you hear of it all time, 'they've found a cure for this, they've found a cure for that'. When they actually find that cure, then you can start really believing,"" he said. ""I would like to have another child. I'd find it hard, but going through the experience and actually having a child, gives me that hope.""

US flies bombers over Korean peninsula,"The bombers took off from Guam and flew over the East Sea and Yellow Sea The US has conducted a joint military exercise with South Korea, flying two strategic bombers over the Korean peninsula. The B-1B combat bombers were joined by two South Korean F-15K fighter jets, and carried out air-to-ground missile drills off South Korean waters. It comes amid heightened tensions with North Korea over its nuclear programme. Pyongyang conducted its sixth nuclear test, and launched two missiles over Japan, in recent months. The bombers took off from the US Pacific territory of Guam on Tuesday night, before entering South Korean airspace and conducting firing exercises over the East Sea and Yellow Sea, South Korea's military said.

Uncovering China's state aid empire,"China has a long list of state secrets - how many people it puts to death every year, and even the birthdays of its top leaders. But now, overseas researchers have uncovered another Chinese state secret: how much money Beijing gives in aid to other countries. Not very long ago, China was a foreign aid recipient. Now, it rivals the United States as one of the world's largest donors, through traditional development aid or through financial loans. For the first time, a large group of researchers outside China have compiled a majordatabase detailing virtually all of China's financial money flow to recipient countries,external. Citing more than 5,000 projects found across 140 countries, it reveals that China and the US rival each other in terms of how much they offer to other countries. However, ""they spend those budgets in radically different ways. And the different compositions of those portfolios have far-reaching consequences"", explains Brad Parks, the project's chief researcher. He heads the AidData research lab at the College of William & Mary in Virginia, which teamed up with other researchers at Harvard University and the University of Heidelberg in Germany to complete the research. Pictured in 2015, Chinese workers build railway infrastructure to link Djibouti with Addis Ababa, in neighbouring Ethiopia The AidData team had to develop its own methodology to answer the questions that weren't provided by the Chinese government. They tracked money flows from China to recipient countries using news reports, official embassy documents and aid and debt information from China's counterparts. Piece by painstaking piece, the information came together to draw a relatively complete picture of where Chinese aid is going and what impact it's having. ""We think the methodology has revealed the known knowable universe,"" Brad Parks says. ""If the Chinese government really wants to conceal something, we won't necessarily pick it up."" But if there are sizeable money transfers going from China to a recipient country, ""word is going to get out"", he adds. One major finding from the study: China and the US, the world's biggest donor, have handed out similar amounts of money in the years covered in the database, but the countries distribute that money in radically different ways. The vast majority (93%) of US financial aid fits under the traditional definition of aid that's agreed upon by all Western industrialised countries. That aid is given with the main goal of developing the economic development and welfare of recipient countries. At least a quarter of that money represents a direct grant, not a loan that needs to be repaid. In contrast, only a small portion (21%) of the money that China gives to other countries can be considered as traditional aid. And the rest of that money? The ""lion's share"" of that money is given in commercial loans that have to be repaid to Beijing with interest. ""China wants to get attractive economic returns on its capital,"" Brad Parks explains. The team's other major finding: when China gives out traditional aid, the recipient countries reap impressive economic rewards. For a long period, there were suspicions that Chinese aid projects were only set up to benefit China; infrastructure projects built by imported Chinese workers, for instance, that did little to improve the lives of people on the ground. However, this research shows that China is just as capable of managing development aid projects as Western donors. Since 2000, African countries have captured a large slice of the aid and loans given by China. However, China's wealth is distributed to points across the globe, from hospitals in Senegal to ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In 2014, the most recent year covered by AidData, Russia topped the recipient list, followed by Pakistan and Nigeria. In contrast, the US list in 2014 was topped by Iraq and Afghanistan, followed by Pakistan. Chinese cash has funded the development of Pakistan's Gwadar port Politics plays a big part in how both China and the US decide to spend their money. Earlier studies by the researchers behind AidData show that both Beijing and Washington tend to offer money to countries which support them at the United Nations. But for China, economics play a key role: the AidData researchers found Beijing is often focused on promoting Chinese exports or market rate loans where China wants to get the loan repaid with interest. China is often cited as the main source of aid propping up the fragile North Korean economy. But the AidData researchers tracked down just 17 Chinese projects in North Korea over the 14-year period, totalling a measly $210m. Brad Parks calls North Korea ""an informational black hole"", admitting that it's the only recipient country that truly evaded the researchers. To a large extent, the vast amounts of money and other kinds of aid that China is believed to give North Korea fall outside the global financial system. Researchers have struggled to track the Chinese aid flowing into secretive North Korea In the 1960s to the 1990s, Western countries offered high-interest market-rate loans to developing countries. However, that strategy misfired when recipient countries could not begin to repay the interest on the debts they had acquired. Outrage ensued and the Western aid model was overhauled. ""There was a shared principle that we should not be offering market-rate loans to developing countries,"" Brad Parks says. ""And now, here comes China, enter stage left. They're not part of that coalition. They haven't been socialised to that principle and they're very willing and able to provide loans near or at market rate. ""Increasingly, countries that don't want to go the IMF for a bailout when they're in trouble, they will go to China instead."" So far, the data shows that the countries that receive China's market-rate loans are not suffering economically, but they aren't experiencing economic growth either. Researchers fear that could change in 10 or 15 years, when countries build up debts because they can't repay the money they will owe to Beijing. At that point, China might have to rethink things. ""They may very well 10 years from now, or 15 years from now, encounter the same problems that Western donors and creditors encountered when loans are not getting repaid,"" Brad Parks explains. ""If and when that point of reckoning occurs, then perhaps Beijing will revisit how it structures these loans."" China's prestige projects around the world China pledges $60bn to develop Africa Is China a brake on Africa's progress? Already, researchers have uncovered signs that China's starting to shift its approach to lending, researcher Xiaojun Li from the University of British Columbia says. Increasingly, Beijing is lending through multilateral institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, China's answer to the World Bank. There is evidence that China's no-strings loans have had an effect on the entire global lending system, forcing traditional donors to stop placing so many requirements on receiving countries. Using AidData's database, economist Diego Hernandez revealed that China's role as a major lender has boosted competition between traditional donors. ""When an African country is also assisted by China,"" he writes, ""the World Bank provides fewer conditions attached to its loans"". For every 1% increase in Chinese aid, Hernandez found the World Bank lessened its typical demands for things like market liberalisation or economic transparency by 15%. Critics have long charged that ""rogue aid"" from China allows some countries to avoid democratic reforms because they can simply turn to China for aid, dodging the scrutiny of traditional Western donors. Cambodia is a recent example; independent newspapers and western NGOs have been shuttered, as Cambodian leaders' strengthening ties with China embolden them to turn away from Washington's demands to hold fair elections. Xiaojun Li studied how Chinese aid has changed countries in Africa, arguing that democratic reforms have slowed as the developing countries concluded they could bypass the political demands of Western donors by turning to Chinese aid. ""Traditional donors have criticised China's approach to aid,"" he says, but ""many African countries embrace the assistance from Beijing, or at least are glad to have more options"".

Spain demands clarity from Catalan leader,"This video can not be played Mr Rajoy accused the Catalan leader of creating confusion Spain's prime minister has put Catalonia on notice that it could impose direct rule on the region. Mariano Rajoy said his government had asked the regional government to clarify whether or not it had declared independence. The move is the first step towards suspending Catalonia's autonomy under the constitution. Catalan leaders signed a declaration of independence on Tuesday but halted implementation to allow for talks. The government in Madrid has now given Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont five days to say whether or not he has declared independence, Spanish news agency Efe reports. If Mr Puigdemont confirms he has declared independence, he will be given a further three days to withdraw the declaration before Article 155 of the constitution - allowing central government to suspend a region's autonomy and impose direct rule - is invoked, Efe adds. Catalan crisis in 300 words Spain has been in turmoil since the separatist government held a disputed referendum in Catalonia on 1 October which was declared invalid by the country's Constitutional Court. Almost 90% of voters backed independence with a turnout of 43%, Catalan officials say. Anti-independence voters largely boycotted the ballot and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they tried to stop the vote taking place. Catalans' verdicts on latest turmoil The view from Barcelona v Madrid What are the options now? Mr Rajoy accused Mr Puigdemont of having created ""deliberate confusion"" and said he wanted to restore ""certainty"". ""This call - ahead of any of the measures that the government may adopt under Article 155 of ourconstitution,external- seeks to offer citizens the clarity and security that a question of such importance requires,"" Mr Rajoy said. ""There is an urgent need to put an end to the situation that Catalonia is going through - to return it to safety, tranquillity and calm and to do that as quickly as possible."" Mr Rajoy was speaking after holding an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the government's next steps. Speaking later in parliament, Mr Rajoy said Spain was facing the most serious threat to its 40-year-old democracy. He accused the separatists of hatching an ""anti-democratic plan foisting their will on all the people of Catalonia"", and said the Spanish government had had no choice but to restore order. ""It falls to the Catalan leader to restore constitutional normality,"" he told deputies, rejecting any suggestion of outside mediation in the dispute. He added that he was willing to negotiate on the issue of regional autonomy and changes to the constitution - but this had to be within the framework of the law. Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor, Madrid Spain's prime minister tried today to put the ball back in the Catalan court. He's asked the Catalan president to clarify if he is making a declaration of independence or not. There is no official timeframe for the response, although political sources and Spanish media are now talking about five days (and then there is an argument about whether that includes the weekend and Thursday's national holiday). In the meantime, sources in the Senate (Spain's upper house of parliament, where Prime Minister Rajoy's Popular Party has a majority) say the request has been made to trigger Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, under which Mr Rajoy would be able to suspend Catalan autonomy - possibly immediately, or bit by bit. Prime Minister Rajoy has threatened to use Article 155 if Catalan independence is declared but the article has not yet been activated. Article 155 has never been used before, so we are in a kind of Brexit situation before Article 50 was triggered. The article legally exists but there are disagreements about how far-reaching it is, how it would/should work (and how quickly) in practice. Reports in Spanish media suggest that if the Spanish prime minister activates Article 155 in the absence of a response from the Catalan president, pro-independence parties in the Catalan parliament will then declare independence. The leader of the opposition Socialists, Pedro Sanchez, told reporters that his party and the government had agreed to examine the possibility of using constitutional reform to end the crisis. This would be focused on ""how Catalonia remains in Spain, and not how it leaves"", he added.

He urged the international community to recognise Catalonia as an ""independent and sovereign state"". He said the ""people's will"" was to break away from Madrid but he also said he wanted to ""de-escalate"" the tension around the issue. With this in mind he announced that he was ""suspending the effects of the declaration of independence"" for more talks with the Madrid government, which he said were needed to reach a solution. He and other Catalan leaders then signed the declaration of independence. It is not clear if the declaration has any legal status. The man who wants to break up Spain Would Catalonia be a viable country? Catalan crisis: Six things you need to know Crowds of independence supporters in Barcelona cheered Mr Puigdemont's initial remarks but many expressed disappointment as he clarified his stance. Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions but a stream of companies has announced plans to move head offices out of the province in response to the crisis. The European Union has made clear that should Catalonia split from Spain, the region would cease to be part of the EU. Are you in Catalonia? What do you think of the latest developments?

Anne Robinson on her abortion 'black doom',"TV presenter Anne Robinson has recalled feeling the ""most terrible black doom"" after having an abortion the year after they were partially legalised. Robinson spoke of it for the first time in a BBC Two documentary, Abortion On Trial, being shown to mark 50 years since the 1967 Abortion Act. Overall, most of those involved in the programme said the decision to have an abortion was right for them. They argued it was their right to have control over their own body. Speaking ahead of the documentary's broadcast, Robinson questioned why abortion was not more openly talked about. ""This all has been there for 50 years and we are still hesitant and ashamed,"" she said. Robinson, who later had one child, said ""keeping quiet"" about her own experience was ""out of the question"" when she had asked people to talk about theirs. Online abortion pill sales 'increasing' From relief to regret: Readers' experiences of abortion 'I had an abortion when money made the difference between life and death' Abortion should not be crime, say doctors In the documentary, filmed at her home in Gloucestershire, the journalist tells the group of eight women and one man - who all have experiences of abortion - that she had a termination in 1968 when she was newly married. Robinson, from a Catholic family, describes feeling confused, terrified and ""very, very lonely"". ""The only way I felt I could go through with an abortion was if I didn't talk about it,"" she says. ""I was ashamed of what I had done... I have tried very hard not to think about it. ""And I can see a lot of that is inherent shame in me after all these years. And it is nearly 50 years ago."" In the years since, she said, she ""hadn't allowed herself to regret"" the decision. Robinson had previously written about the experience in her 2001 book, Memoirs Of An Unfit Mother, but this documentary is the first time she has talked about it on camera. Sally (second from left) with seven of the other people featured in the documentary Some of the other women in the film described the problems they faced travelling long distances to clinics for an abortion, and debated where they felt the legislation around termination needed to change. One woman explained how she'd had two terminations but had later adopted an anti-abortion view. Mum Sally said she had faced some ""hard questions"" from friends over her decision to have three abortions, as she had eight miscarriages while trying for a second child. ""To not be able to talk about it, if you are not happy [with a pregnancy], is very damaging,"" she said. ""Women need to be able to stand up and talk openly with the confidence they will be listened to and supported."" Her view on anti-abortion demonstrators changed during the filming, she says, having heard the views of another contributor, Rachel. She ""just wants there to be an alternative for women"", Sally said, adding: ""It was refreshing to be friends with someone with an opposing view."" The Abortion Act allows terminations to legally be performed under certain conditions - they have to be agreed by two doctors and carried out by a doctor in a government-approved hospital or clinic. But a poll of 2,002 adults conducted for the documentary found that 69% thought abortion was completely legal if a woman simply requested it. The survey found that attitudes were split on whether abortion should be a criminal matter, with 39% thinking it should be and 34% not. It also found: 38% said abortion should be permitted if any type of disability was found which the parent(s) feel unable to cope with 55% said abortion on the grounds of gender should never be allowed 37% think there should be no legal limit on the number of abortions a woman should have in her lifetime The programme also discusses whether women should have the right to take abortion pills at home. Self-induced abortion is a criminal offence under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and two women have been jailed in recent years for using medication bought online. In 2012, Sarah Catt, 40, was jailed for eight years forterminating her pregnancyat 39 weeks. Natalie Towers, 26, was sentenced to two-and-a half-years in 2015 afterterminating her pregnancywhile she was between 32 and 34 weeks. MPsdebated the decriminalisation,externalof abortion in March 2017. Most abortions are carried out before 24 weeks of pregnancy - for example, when two doctors agree that continuing the pregnancy would involve greater risk to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family than if there was a termination They can be carried out after 24 weeks in certain circumstances - for example, if the mother's life is at risk Abortions are usually available free-of-charge on the NHS Abortion is a criminal offence in Northern Ireland. The exceptions include to save a woman's life, or if there is a risk to her health Source:NHS choices,external Abortion On Trial is on BBC Two at 21:00 BST on Monday 16 October Rees-Mogg 'completely opposed' to abortion NI women to get free abortions in England Abortion should not be crime, say doctors Online abortion pill sales 'increasing' From relief to regret: Readers' experiences of abortion Why are people talking about this picture?

Rajoy demands clarity from Catalan leader,"This video can not be played Mr Rajoy accused the Catalan leader of creating confusion Spain's prime minister has put Catalonia on notice that it could impose direct rule on the region. Mariano Rajoy said his government had asked the regional government to clarify whether or not it had declared independence. The move is the first step towards suspending Catalonia's autonomy under the constitution. Catalan leaders signed a declaration of independence on Tuesday but halted implementation to allow for talks. The government in Madrid has now given Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont five days to say whether or not he has declared independence, Spanish news agency Efe reports. If Mr Puigdemont confirms he has declared independence, he will be given a further three days to withdraw the declaration before Article 155 of the constitution - allowing central government to suspend a region's autonomy and impose direct rule - is invoked, Efe adds. Catalan crisis in 300 words Spain has been in turmoil since the separatist government held a disputed referendum in Catalonia on 1 October which was declared invalid by the country's Constitutional Court. Almost 90% of voters backed independence with a turnout of 43%, Catalan officials say. Anti-independence voters largely boycotted the ballot and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they tried to stop the vote taking place. Catalans' verdicts on latest turmoil The view from Barcelona v Madrid What are the options now? Mr Rajoy accused Mr Puigdemont of having created ""deliberate confusion"" and said he wanted to restore ""certainty"". ""This call - ahead of any of the measures that the government may adopt under Article 155 of ourconstitution,external- seeks to offer citizens the clarity and security that a question of such importance requires,"" Mr Rajoy said. ""There is an urgent need to put an end to the situation that Catalonia is going through - to return it to safety, tranquillity and calm and to do that as quickly as possible."" Mr Rajoy was speaking after holding an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the government's next steps. Speaking later in parliament, Mr Rajoy said Spain was facing the most serious threat to its 40-year-old democracy. He accused the separatists of hatching an ""anti-democratic plan foisting their will on all the people of Catalonia"", and said the Spanish government had had no choice but to restore order. ""It falls to the Catalan leader to restore constitutional normality,"" he told deputies, rejecting any suggestion of outside mediation in the dispute. He added that he was willing to negotiate on the issue of regional autonomy and changes to the constitution - but this had to be within the framework of the law.

Madrid scorns Catalan leader's move,"A pro-independence crowd gathered in Barcelona to hear Carles Puigdemont's address The Spanish government has rejected a statement of independence signed by Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and dismissed calls for mediation. Spain's deputy prime minister described Mr Puigdemont as someone ""who does not know where he is, where he's going"". Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is holding an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the government's next steps. Mr Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence on Tuesday, but halted implementation to allow negotiations. There had been speculation that the Catalan president might declare independence and put the move into effect, plunging Spain into an even deeper political crisis. This video can not be played Catalan leader seeks talks to secure independence Spain has been in turmoil since a disputed referendum on 1 October which was declared invalid by the country's Constitutional Court. Addressing the Catalan parliament in Barcelona on Tuesday evening, Mr Puigdemont said the autonomous region had won the right to be independent as a result of the vote. ""We call on international states and organisations to recognise the Catalan republic as an independent and sovereign state,"" he said. He said the ""people's will"" was to break away from Madrid, but he also said he wanted to ""de-escalate"" the tension around the issue. ""I propose suspending the effects of the declaration of independence to undertake talks in the coming weeks without which it is not possible to reach an agreed solution,"" Mr Puigdemont told MPs. The view from Barcelona v Madrid Catalonia crisis: What are the options now? He and other Catalan leaders then signed the declaration of independence. It is not clear if the declaration has any legal status. Crowds of independence supporters in Barcelona cheered Mr Puigdemont's initial remarks, but many expressed disappointment as he clarified his stance. Sources involved in the talks say Mr Puigdemont drafted three potential speeches covering three possible outcomes ahead of the speech he delivered last night. The first draft declared a motion for immediate unilateral independence that parliament would vote on within 48 hours. Some members of the coalition government threatened to walk in that event, arguing that that kind of language was too strong and would provoke an immediate response of force from the Spanish government. The second argued for a symbolic declaration of independence, but expressed no intent to push ahead with plans to separate. This time members of the left-wing CUP party who support a minority Catalan separatist government threatened to walk out. The speech that was delivered appears to be the third and final draft, which suspends any declaration of independence, and is said to have been influenced by the intervention of the EU Council President Donald Tusk, who urged Mr Puigdemont ""not to announce a decision that makes dialogue impossible"". The Catalan government appears to have read this as a sign that the EU could be open to future dialogue, even if Spain is not. In Madrid, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria rejected Mr Puigdemont's proposal for talks through an international mediator. ""Neither Mr Puigdemont nor anybody else can claim... to impose mediation,"" she said. ""After having come so far, and taken Catalonia to the greatest level of tension in its history, President Puigdemont has now subjected his autonomous region to its greatest level of uncertainty. ""The speech the president... gave today is that of a person who does not know where he is, where he's going, nor who he wants to go there with."" Spain's Justice Minister Rafael Catala reiterated the government's position that the referendum was illegal and its results invalid. Ara (Barcelona - centre-left, pro-independence)says the Catalan leader ""risks the unity of pro-independence groupings in order to try to achieve mediation for a negotiation"" with the Spanish state. El PaÃ­s (Madrid - centrist, unionist)says the government has been studying the application of Article 155 - which would suspend Catalonia's autonomy - for days. El Mundo (Madrid - centre-right, unionist)says the Spanish government could declare a state of emergency if it considers there is a serious risk of public disorder but says triggering Article 155 is the most likely measure. La Vanguardia (Barcelona - centre-right, pro-independence)says that in attempting to find a middle way between proclaiming independence and maintaining the status quo, Mr Puigdemont has created ""confusion and chaos"". El PeriÃ³dico (Barcelona - centre-left, unionist)says Mr Puigdemont's speech has sent Catalonia into ""political limbo"". Almost 90% of voters backed independence with a turnout of 43%, Catalan officials say. Anti-independence voters largely boycotted the ballot and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they tried to stop the vote taking place. Puigdemont's announcement - reaction and analysis Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country?

Brexit: No spending on 'no deal' plan yet,"This video can not be played Hammond: Not time yet for 'no deal' spending Taxpayers' money will not be spent on preparing for a ""no-deal"" Brexit until the ""very last moment"", Chancellor Philip Hammond has suggested. He said he was preparing for ""no deal"" and all other outcomes and would make money available when needed. But he said he wouldn't take money from other areas, like health or education, now just to ""send a message"" to the EU. At PM's questions Theresa May rejected claims she was ramping up ""no deal"" talk, insisting she wanted agreement. ""We are actively working... with the EU to ensure a good deal, the right deal for Britain for a brighter future for this country,"" Mrs May told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions. One ex-minister, David Jones, has said billions should be set aside in November's Budget for a ""no deal"" scenario, arguing that if this did not happen it would be seen as a ""a sign of weakness"" by EU leaders who would think the UK was not serious about leaving the EU without a deal. Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? May won't say if she'd vote for Brexit now Laura Kuenssberg: PM's Brexit vote hesitation may haunt her EU's Tusk warns over 'slow pace' of talks The chancellor, who has been accused of being too pessimistic about Brexit, told the Treasury committee of MPs a ""cloud of uncertainty"" over the outcome of negotiations was ""acting as a dampener"" on the economy. He said this could only be removed by progress in the talks, which he said was dependent on the EU agreeing to discuss its future relationship with the UK as soon as possible. He told MPs one worst case scenario for a ""no deal"", would see no air travel taking place between the UK and the EU on Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - but added that he did not see that as likely to happen, even if the UK/EU talks failed to reach agreement. Writing in the Times,externalahead of next month's Budget, Mr Hammond said he had a responsibility to be ""realistic"" about the challenges of leaving the EU and would spend money only when it was ""responsible"" to do so. This video can not be played Mrs May said she would not answer ""hypothetical questions"" An extra Â£412m has already been allocated to government departments to prepare for Brexit over the next four years and Treasury sources suggested more would be made available if negotiations faltered. Asked about the article as he appeared before the Commons Treasury committee, Mr Hammond said he was ""committed"" to funding departments for Brexit preparation and he was ""rather surprised"" that the article might be interpreted as saying that he was reluctant to do so. ""We are prepared to spend when we need to spend against the contingency of a 'no deal' outcome,"" he said. ""I am clear we have to be prepared for a 'no deal' scenario unless and until we have clear evidence that this is not where we will end up."" ""What I am not prepared to do is allocate funds to departments in advance of the need to spend,"" he added. This video can not be played Would it have been better if the UK voted Remain? Newsnight's Emily Maitlis presses Damian Green ""We should look in each area at the last point that spending can begin to ensure we are ready for a day-one 'no deal' scenario. ""Every pound we spend on contingency preparations on a hard customs border is a pound we can't spend on the NHS, social care or education. I don't believe we should be in the business of making potentially nugatory expenditure until the very last moment when we need to do so."" Theresa May was pressed on the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, in which former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith sought assurances ""all necessary monies"" would be spent preparing for a no deal outcome. ""Where money needs to be spent it will be spent,"" the prime minister replied, adding that government departments would be given an extra Â£250m this year to prepare for a range of Brexit outcomes. This video can not be played Heidi Alexander says the British people ""deserve better than a prime minister simply running scared"" Labour's Heidi Alexander accused Mrs May of ""running scared"" of Tory backbenchers - prompting the PM to reply ""the honourable lady could not be more wrong... we are not ramping up a no deal scenario"". On Tuesday, Mrs May - who backed Remain in last year's vote - repeatedly refused to say if she would now vote for Brexit, telling LBC radio: ""I don't answer hypothetical questions."" At PMQs, the SNP's Ian Blackford claimed the PM ""could not answer a simple question"" and urged her to ""come off the fence"" and recognise the risk to jobs in Scotland from leaving the single market and customs union. In response, the prime minister said she was clear the UK would be leaving the EU in March 2019 and that there would be no second referendum.

HIV hairdresser 'boasted of condom rip',"Daryll Rowe met his partners on dating app Grindr, jurors at Lewes Crown Court were told A hairdresser accused of deliberately infecting his lovers with HIV said ""I got you"" to one of them, a court heard. Daryll Rowe, 26, denies infecting four men from the Brighton area with the virus and attempting to give it to a further six. Lewes Crown Court heard he bombarded his second victim with texts and calls after the pair had sex. During one call, jurors heard, Mr Rowe said: ""I ripped the condom. Burn. I got you."" The man told the court he and the defendant exchanged explicit images via dating app Grindr before agreeing to meet. In messages between the pair, the complainant said, Mr Rowe had told him he wanted to have sex without a condom. When the pair met, he said, the defendant attempted to initiate unprotected sex, but the man refused and insisted he put one on. Addressing the complainant, Prosecutor Caroline Carberry QC said: ""You told the police that he said, 'Come on, come on, I'm fine, you know you want it'."" He said that was correct, and that he had taken it to mean Mr Rowe was ""clean. That he had no diseases"". After the encounter, the court heard, the defendant began sending aggressive messages to the other man, who blocked him on several platforms. Mr Rowe began repeatedly calling him, jurors heard, and when the phone was answered said he had ripped the condom. Giving evidence, the man told the court: ""That's a really crazy thing to say to somebody and then I just got worried, so I wanted to listen to what he had to say and that was it. It was just panic.

No energy bill price cap this winter,"A price cap on energy bills proposed by the prime minister last week is unlikely to take effect before winter. Theresa May had vowed to revive a plan to cap charges for an extra 12 million consumers. However, Ofgem said it would have to wait for legislation to be in force before it could take action on standard variable tariffs. Until then a more limited price cap will cover another one million low income households, the regulator said. That move will, on average, save households Â£120 a year, the regulator said. Last week Business Secretary Greg Clark said a gas and electricity price capcould be imposed as early as this wintershould Ofgem decide to use its powers. This video can not be played Ofgem CEO tells Today he won't speculate on how long it will take government to introduce cap The BBC understands that Ofgem is reluctant to do so because it believes energy companies could challenge its decision. A Department for Business spokesperson said draft legislation on an energy price cap for default tariffs would be introduced this week. The legislative process could take as long as a year, and then a further five months for Ofgem to implement a cap. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour's shadow business secretary, said legislation must force the regulator to implement a price cap. One million households who get the Warm Home Discount will see an energy price cap from February - an extension ofthe cap already in place for prepayment meter customers. This will also apply to another two million vulnerable households the following winter. When customers' fixed-term deals end they usually automatically move to this tariff, which applies to 12 million households. Ofgem says the price difference between the average standard variable tariff default deal and the cheapest rate in the market recently hit more than Â£300. It has revived a plan to cap these variable tariffs, overseen by Ofgem, but the regulator says this will not happen until new legislation has been passed by Parliament. It is unclear just how long this will take. Some suppliers are moving towards abandoning variable tariffs. Ofgem has also changed the rules to allow suppliers to default customers on to another fixed deal. Customers are still likely to be better off by searching and switching themselves. Dermot Nolan, the regulator's chief executive, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that energy firms should be doing more to move people off standard variable tariffs. ""I would challenge the entire industry to say the standard variable tariffs are not good deals. The ball in some senses is in your court - do more,"" he said. Michael Lewis, UK chief executive of E.on, claimed the retail energy market was working well. ""We've got 60 competitors in the market with new entrants approaching 20% market share, we've got high levels of switching, with 3.5 million customers switching so far this year, which is a significant increase on 2016,"" he told Today. Mr Lewis reiterated E.on's plans to move customers off its standard variable tariff from next year. Analysis By Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter Dermot Nolan, chief executive of the energy regulator Ofgem, gave a less-than-ringing endorsement of Theresa May's flagship price-caps plan this morning. It is a ""difficult issue"", he says, noting it had ""split"" the Competition and Markets Authority, and that his organisation ""will try and make it work"" so that average prices would fall. Mr Nolan, perhaps, sees the next twist in the price cap saga's plot. The big six energy suppliers, spurred into action by Theresa May's threats, are making plans to scrap the standard variable tariff - the (sometimes) expensive price plan that has led to the most anger over energy bills. E.on has already stopped offered the standard variable tariff, instead forcing customers to make a decision about what kind of deal they would like. Ian Conn, who runs British Gas owner Centrica, gave a heavy hint that the UK's biggest energy supplier would do something similar. It would be a fitting end to a tortuous tale if price caps for standard variable tariffs were introduced in a year's time - only for those tariffs to have melted away in the meantime.

World's children rapidly turning obese,"Child and teenage obesity levels have risen ten-fold in the last four decades, meaning 124m boys and girls around the globe are too fat, according to new research. The analysis inthe Lancet,externalis the largest of its kind and looks at obesity trends in over 200 countries. In the UK, one in every 10 young people aged five to 19, is obese. Obese children are likely to become obese adults, putting them at risk of serious health problems, say experts. These include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and certain types of cancer, such as breast and colon. The Lancet analysis, released on World Obesity Day, comes as researchers from theWorld Obesity Federation,externalwarn that the global cost of treating ill health caused by obesity will exceed Â£920bn every year from 2025. Although child obesity rates appear to be stabilising in many high-income European countries, including the UK, they are accelerating at an alarming rate in many other parts of the world, lead researcher Prof Majid Ezzati from Imperial College London says. Researchers believe wide availability and promotion of cheap, fattening food is one of the main drivers. Charts produced by the World Health Organisation,externalshow how weight gain is measured in boys and girls, according to theirBMI (body mass index). The largest increase in the number of obese children and adolescents has been in East Asia. China and India have seen rates ""balloon"" in recent years. Polynesia and Micronesia have the highest rate of all - around half of the young population in these countries is overweight or obese. The researchers say that if current world trends continue, 'obese' will soon be more common than 'underweight'. The number of underweight girls and boys worldwide has been decreasing since a peak in the year 2000. The highest rates of obesity are shown in red, followed by orange and yellow. Green and blue means fewer than 5% of the young population is obese The highest rates of obesity are shown in red, followed by orange and yellow. Green and blue means fewer than 5% of the young population is obese In 2016, 192m young people were underweight - still significantly more than the number of young people who were obese, but that looks set to change. East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have seen a shift from underweight to obesity within the space of a few decades. Globally, in 2016 an additional 213m young people were overweight although still below the threshold for obesity. Obesity researcher Dr Harry Rutter, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""This is a huge problem that will get worse. ""Even skinny people are heavier than they would have been ten years ago. ""We have not become more weak-willed, lazy or greedy. The reality is the world around us is changing."" Dr Fiona Bull from the World Health Organization called for tough action to crack down on ""calorie-dense, nutrient-poor food"" and promote more physical activity. So far, just over 20 countries around the world have introduced a tax on sugary drinks. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: ""Our sugar reduction programme and the government's sugar levy are world-leading, but this is just the beginning of a long journey to tackle the challenge of a generation. ""The evidence is clear, that just telling people what to do won't work. Whilst education and information are important, deeper actions are needed to help us lower calorie consumption and achieve healthier diets.""

Anti-abortion protest ban approved,"Protestors said women were not being offered alternatives to abortion An ""unprecedented"" ban on protesters outside abortion clinics could be introduced in a London borough. Councillors in Ealing overwhelmingly backed a proposal to stop anti-abortion groups protesting outside a Marie Stopes clinic in the borough. Binda Rai, who brought the motion, said it would allow women to access ""legal healthcare without intimidation"". The Good Counsel Network, which holds daily vigils outside the centre in Mattock Lane, denies harassing women. Two councillors abstained at Tuesday's meeting. Some protesters used ""deliberately disturbing and graphic images"" outside the Marie Stopes clinic, the council said The council motion said 3,593 residents signed a petition, delivered by campaign group Sister Supporter, backing the move. It said dozens also wrote letters describing ""disruption and distress"" caused by the protesters. Speaking after the vote, Ms Rai said there could be ""national implications"", and that Ealing could be the first council to take action against protesters outside abortion clinics. ""I'm absolutely thrilled that there was such huge support in the chamber for the motion, and right across the parties,"" she said. ""It was really good. And this is really a stand for women, and for women's rights to access healthcare that is legally available to them."" She said the council may use a Public Space Protection Order (PSPOs), which give councils the power to crack down on perceived anti-social behaviour. Richard Bentley, managing director of Marie Stopes UK, hailed the decision as ""ground-breaking"". ""We hope that other local authorities will follow this example and act to increase protection for women in their area,"" he said. Local pro-choice group, Sister Supporter, demanded action to stop anti-abortion protesters holding vigils six days a week outside the clinic A spokesman for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service said it welcomed the vote result and urged the government to introduce legislation banning protests at all clinics. ""The situation in Ealing is sadly not unique, and women and clinic staff across the country report being followed, filmed, and harassed when trying to access or provide legal healthcare services. ""This has to stop,"" he said. The Good Counsel Network said it has held its vigil for 23 years ""without any criminal charges"" Clare McCullough, the Good Counsel Network's founder, told the BBC the group had held its vigil for 23 years ""without any criminal charges"". Responding to the prospect of a PSPO, Ms McCullough said: ""Most lawyers would agree those orders were not put in place for this kind of issue. ""They're not there to suppress freedom of speech. ""I think it would be a grave misuse and would have implications for all kinds of groups who are protesting all kinds of things.""

'Social media abuse tax' proposed,"Surveys suggest children find it hard to avoid bullying and abuse on social media platforms Facebook and Twitter could be asked to pay for action against the ""undeniable suffering"" social media can cause, the culture secretary has said. Cyber-bullying, trolling, abuse and under-age access to porn will be targeted in plans drawn up by Karen Bradley to make the online world safer. Ms Bradley wants social media groups to sign up to a voluntary code of practice and help fund campaigns against abuse. She also wants social media platforms to reveal the scale of online hate. Almost a fifth of 12 to 15-year-olds have seen something they found worrying or nasty, and almost half of adults have seen something that has upset or offended them, on social media - according to the government. Despite promising to introduce new laws regulating the internet in the Conservative Party's manifesto, Ms Bradley told the BBC that legislating would take ""far too long"". Ms Bradley said that the plan was for a ""collaborative approach"" with internet groups, adding that she sees a ""willingness from them"". She added: ""Many of them say: 'When we founded these businesses we were in our 20s, we didn't have childrenâ¦ now we're older and we have teenagers ourselves we want to solve this"". Ms Bradley said the internet had been an ""amazing force for good, but it has caused undeniable suffering and can be an especially harmful place for children and vulnerable people"". ""For too long there's been behaviour online that would be unacceptable if it was face-to-face."" One of the proposals is for an annual transparency report which could be used to show: the volume of content reported to companies and the proportion taken down how users' complaints are handled categories of complaints, including from under-18s, women, the LGBT community or on religious grounds information about how each site moderates content Ms Bradley said that the government ""could legislate in the future"", adding that any changes to existing law would be underpinned by the following principles: What is unacceptable offline, should be unacceptable online All users should be empowered to manage online risks and stay safe Technology companies have a responsibility to their users The government also wants to see a new body, similar to the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, to consider all aspects of internet safety. In response to the consultation, Facebook said: ""Our priority is to make Facebook a safe place for people of all ages which is why we spent a long time working with safety experts like the UK Safer Internet Centre, developing powerful tools to help people have a positive experience."" ""We welcome close collaboration between industry, experts and government to address this important issue."" A spokesperson for the NSPCC said keeping young people safe online was ""the biggest child protection issue of our time"". ""Social media companies are marking their own homework when it comes to keeping children safe, so a code of practice is definitely a step in the right direction but 'how' it is implemented will be crucial. ""Young people face a unique set of risks when using the internet and it is important any strategy recognises the challenges they face online and requires industry to act to protect them."" Vicki Shotbolt, chief executive at social enterprise Parent Zone, said it was encouraging to see the government taking ""concrete steps"" to make the internet a safer place for children. Asking social-media companies to contribute towards the costs of educating the public about online dangers has precedence in the gambling industry, which currently contributes an amount to the treatment of gambling addiction. The government also wants to see online safety given more attention at schools, with social-media safety advice built into existing education programmes. The consultation will close on 7 December, and the government expects to respond in early 2018.
