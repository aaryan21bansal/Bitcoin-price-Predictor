"'I'm being quoted Â£10,000 for a Â£1,600 container'","Helen White's lighting business is struggling to absorb a six-fold increase in freight costs. ""We were paying Â£1,600 per container in November, this month we've been quoted over Â£10,000,"" says Helen White. The founder of start-up Houseof.com, which imports lighting from China, says the rise in shipping costs means she's making a loss on what she sells. She's one of many UK importers facing soaring freight costs amid a global shipping crisis that may last months. A shortage of empty shipping containers in Asia and bottlenecks at the UK's deep sea ports are behind the problems. It was hoped the backlogs could be cleared during the Chinese New Year holiday in February, but instead a coronavirus outbreak in China is adding to the uncertainty facing firms. Trampoline prices 'to soar 50% on shipping costs' Will the UK refuse trade deals over human rights? 'Putting UK, not GB, delayed my fish for 24 hours' In the UK the difficulties in international shipping have coincided with problems faced by businesses trading with the EU after Brexit. One Manchester-based freight forwarder said the logistics industry is facing the most challenging conditions he's seen in the 17 years he's been in the business. Craig Poole from Cardinal Maritime said during lockdowns, people have been turning to online shopping, and that's causing a surge in demand for goods from China. Freight forwarder Craig Poole says the logistics industry is facing hugely challenging conditions But some companies can't absorb the skyrocketing freight costs that shipping lines are charging. That could lead to higher prices for consumers or businesses having to close. ""The really unfortunate thing is, the small businesses who can't afford to pay those rates are going to go under as a result,"" Mr Poole said. Helen White's lighting range is designed in the UK and manufactured in Guangzhou, China. She said the six-fold increase in shipping costs is hard to take, especially when getting hold of a container ""is like gold dust"". ""It's really hard for a small business to absorb those costs. We'll be making a loss on the goods we're selling."" Lighting seller houseof.com is struggling to import stock from China At the other end of the supply chain, Chinese manufacturers and logistics firms say they are equally frustrated. Johnny Tseng is the owner and director of Hong Kong-based J&B Clothing Company Ltd., which manufactures garments for some of the UK's most popular fashion sites including Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing. He's been supplying clothes to British retailers for more than 40 years, but he says his family-run firm won't be able to absorb inflated shipping rates for much longer. ""To be honest I don't even know how we can survive if we carry on shipping things at this kind of cost."" Johnny Tseng says sky-high shipping rates are putting his business at risk. He says he's now being quoted $14,000 to ship a container to the UK, when the usual price is $2,500. The shortage of empty containers in China and congestion at UK ports caused some of his stock to miss the busy Christmas trading period. Now some customers are holding orders for their Autumn-Winter collections until next year. ""It's chaos,"" he said. ""We are making a loss. We take it as a loss leader and keep our fingers crossed it will go back to normal after Chinese New Year, but it is a major issue if it persists this way."" Usually during the Chinese New Year holiday, factories in China shut down for two weeks.  There were hopes the pause in production would give UK ports a chance to clear the backlog of ships waiting to dock, and encourage shipping lines to move more empty containers back to Asia, which is a less profitable journey. Chinese workers usually travel home for the Chinese New Year holiday. But rising numbers of coronavirus cases have prompted the Chinese authorities to stagger factory closing dates so that not all workers are travelling to their home regions at the same time. A worsening outbreak could lead to travel restrictions, in which case some factories may not stop production at all. Craig Poole says some companies have been caught out by factories closing earlier than planned. ""A lot of businesses that can't get those goods away are delaying orders until after Chinese New Year, so this situation could continue 'til March,"" he said. Patrick Lee from the Hong Kong-based Unique Logistics International said it could be even longer than that. ""Middle of the year at the earliest is what we're hearing from end customers in the UK, and also from some of our people in the industry. Some of the carriers as well,"" he said. Mr Lee has called on the shipping lines to add more ships to help ease the backlog of stock orders building up at warehouses across China. ""They are increasing sailing but can increase a lot more. There are idle ships out there that they can reactivate without too much difficulty,"" he said. The disruption could last for several months, according to logistics specialist Patrick Lee But a spokeswoman for the World Shipping Council said carriers are using all available capacity. ""The demand for transportation service far exceeds supply. As in any free market, this puts upward pressure on rates,"" she said. Shipping lines have been trying to drive down demand from British importers by charging a premium for deliveries to the UK, or bypassing the country's ports altogether. One shipping line recently offered freight rates of $12,050 for a 40ft container from China to Southampton, but charged just $8,450 for the same container to travel from China to Rotterdam, Hamburg, or Antwerp. The UK's largest container port at Felixstowe has been experiencing long delays since October. Congestion has also been a problem at the Port of Southampton, albeit to a lesser extent. The bottlenecks were initially caused by a surge in imports as business activity picked up after the first wave of the pandemic. Huge shipments of PPE and the usual Christmas rush added to container volumes and ports struggled to cope. The UK's largest container port at Felixstowe has been experiencing bottlenecks for months ""Most of the carriers just don't want UK cargo because of the issues when the vessels dock, so mainly they're favouring European ports and we are having to truck containers over,"" said freight forwarder Craig Poole. He said that adds a cost of up to Â£2,000 per container, and takes an extra seven to ten days to reach the delivery point in the UK. For business-owners like Helen White, the difficulties affecting the shipping industry can't be solved quickly enough. ""Lots of little start-ups are really hurting,"" she said. ""It has been paired with logistical nightmares across Europe as well. It just feels like logistics is falling apart at the moment. It's hard to see where the resolution is.""

Cladding crisis: 'Delays could bankrupt us',"Amy says her flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe The government's fund to pay for the removal of dangerous cladding is woefully inadequate, oversubscribed and taking too long to make buildings safe, campaigners say. More than three and a half years since the Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding. The Â£1.6bn Building Safety Programme was set up in 2019. Concerns have emerged about the contract that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government requires applicants to the fund, usually managing agents or building owners, to sign. A clause in the contract, seen by the BBC, indicates applicants will be financially liable for any repair work not covered by the fund. The BBC has learnt that some managing agents are refusing to sign the document, further delaying the repair work, and have written to the government asking ministers to clarify the position. Christian Hansen, a solicitor at Bindmans LLP specialising in housing law and fire safety claims, said the contract showed that ""there's going to be a significant shortfall between the costs of the [repair] works that are required and the funding provided under the scheme"". ""Someone is going to need to pick up the bill and pay the difference. This contract makes clear it's going to be the leaseholders and for many, this could be tens of thousands of pounds, potentially ruinous costs,"" he warned. Mr Hansen said that leaseholders wanted the focus of government action ""to be on the manufacturers of the defective materials and construction companies who built these buildings"". ""At the moment, they are the ones profiting from putting people's lives at risk."" ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here,"" says Amy First-time buyer Amy Cottenden, who is 28, bought a one-bed flat in Metis Tower in the centre of Sheffield for Â£85,000 in 2017. Inspections of the 14-storey building in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed it had the same type of flammable ACM cladding and other safety faults. Work to remove the cladding started last month, but Ms Cottenden, who is a frontline NHS health worker, is frustrated at what she describes as a lack of progress. ""The pace of work is extremely slow. So far, they've put scaffolding up and removed three panels. They have told us it's going to take between 12 and 24 months just to take the cladding off,"" she said. ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here. With lockdown, they are saying not to go out, but you are in a building where all you want to do is not be in it. You can't leave. You can't sell. My flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe."" While the government's Building Safety Fund is paying for the Grenfell-style cladding to be removed, the building has other fire safety faults, including missing fire breaks, that aren't covered by the scheme. It could cost up to Â£6m to fix. Flat owners fear they may face huge bills of up to Â£50,000 each. ""We can't pay it and we shouldn't have to pay it. It is not our fault. We could all go bankrupt because of this,"" Ms Cottenden said. Metis Tower is in Sheffield's city centre A spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner, the company which manages Metis Tower, said government funding to remove ACM cladding had been approved totalling Â£6.3m. However, an application to the same fund to pay for the removal of other types of unsafe cladding was rejected and the company has appealed against that decision. The company added: ""We understand and sympathise with residents and owners about the uncertainty that this situation is causing and will do all we can to assist."" The Â£1.6bn Building Safety Programme was set up to remove Grenfell-style cladding, known as ACM cladding Ministers say the cladding has been removed or repairs have started on 95% of affected blocks But analysis ofdata released this week,externalshows that work has been fully completed on just 58% of social housing blocks Meanwhile, in the private sector, cladding repairs have been finished on 30% of blocks. What started as a cladding scandal has now become a much wider building safety crisis, exposing decades of regulatory failure. Safety inspections have revealed that many buildings have other serious faults, including missing fire breaks, flammable balconies and defective insulation. None of that is covered by the government's Building Safety Fund. Dr Nigel Glen, the chief executive of ARMA, the trade association for residential leasehold management, said the additional costs that leaseholders were currently facing for non-cladding-related issues remained a huge concern. ""In the longer term, the draining of reserve funds will also mean that in the years to come, any major works that were being saved up for, such as a new roof or lift repairs, will have to be funded anew by the leaseholders,"" he added. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that despite the pandemic, significant progress had been made to remove dangerous cladding, but ""building safety remains the responsibility of the building owner and we expect them to ensure any necessary work is carried out safely and effectively"". ""All applicants to the Building Safety Fund are told the amount of funding they have been awarded before being asked to sign contracts - this is clearly explained in the guidance,"" the spokesperson added.

Wedding party police revise numbers down to 150,"Guests fled when officers arrived at the Stamford Hill school, where the windows had been covered Police broke up a wedding party in north London, where they now say about 150 people had gathered. Officers found the windows at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School, in Stamford Hill, had been covered when they arrived at 21:15 GMT on Thursday. Guests fled from the strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school when the police arrived. The organisers face a Â£10,000 fine for breaking lockdown rules. The Met originally claimed that about 400 guests were at the gathering. In a statement, the school said its hall had been leased out. A spokesman for the school, whose principal Rabbi Avrahom Pinter died in April after contracting coronavirus, said ""we had no knowledge that the wedding was taking place"". He added: ""We are absolutely horrified about last night's event and condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" Boris Johnson supports the police for ""taking action against people who flagrantly and selfishly ignore the rules"", according to the prime minister's official spokesman. The spokesman said: ""Large gatherings such as that pose a health risk, not just to those who attend but those who they live with or others who they may come into contact with.""

Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, meanwhile, said the ""overwhelming majority"" of the Jewish community would be appalled at the event. Rabbi Mirvis, who serves as the head of the UK's orthodox Jewish community but is not the leader of the Charedi group, called the wedding party ""a most shameful desecration of all that we hold dear"". Five guests were issued with Â£200 fixed penalty notices, according to police, who said their inquiries had established those present at the school had gathered for a wedding.

They are then seen arriving at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School. Det Ch Sup Marcus Barnett of the Met Police said: ""This was a completely unacceptable breach of the law. ""People across the country are making sacrifices by cancelling or postponing weddings and other celebrations and there is no excuse for this type of behaviour. ""My officers are working tirelessly with the community and we will not hesitate to take enforcement action if that is required to keep people safe."" On Friday morning, a security guard at the school told the BBC there were more like 100 guests at the party than the much higher number given out by police. The Met later said in a statement: ""Although initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" Stamford Hill is part of the borough of Hackney, which has a Covid-19 infection rate of 625.43 cases per 100,000 people. The England average rate is 471.31 per 100,000 people. The mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that the wedding party had taken place, despite ""the number of lives that have already been lost in the Charedi community and across the borough"". He added: ""Unfortunately, similar events have taken place even at this venue before and we need to be really clear how unacceptable it is. ""We will be meeting with the Rabbinate and our community partners over the coming days to see how we can prevent further incidents of this nature.""

Men jailed for killing 39 migrants in lorry,"The 39 people who died in the back of a trailer as it crossed the North Sea between Zeebrugge and the UK Four men have been jailed for the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese migrants found dead in a lorry trailer in Essex. The migrants died ""excruciatingly painful"" deaths, having suffocated in the container en route from Belgium to Purfleet in October 2019, a judge said. Ronan Hughes, 41, and Gheorghe Nica, 43, played ""leading roles"" in the smuggling conspiracy and were jailed for 20 and 27 years respectively. At the Old Bailey, two lorry drivers were also jailed for manslaughter. [Left to right] Eamonn Harrison, Ronan Hughes, Gheorghe Nica and Maurice Robinson were all jailed for manslaughter Eamonn Harrison, 24, who towed the trailer to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge before their journey to the UK, was sentenced to 18 years. Maurice Robinson, 26, was given 13 years and four months, having collected the trailer and opened it in an industrial estate to find the migrants dead. The supposed 'VIP' journey that killed 39 people Three others members of the people-smuggling gang were also sentenced for conspiracy to facilitate unlawful immigration. Christopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, was jailed for seven years; Valentin Calota, 38, of Birmingham, for four-and-a-half years; and Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, was given a three-year sentence. [Left to right] Valentin Calota, Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga and Christopher Kennedy were also sentenced on Friday Sentencing,external, Mr Justice Sweeney said: ""I have no doubt that the conspiracy was a sophisticated, long-running and profitable one to smuggle mainly Vietnamese people across the channel."" He said on the fatal trip the temperature had been rising along with the carbon dioxide levels throughout, hitting 40C (104F) while the container was at sea on 22 October 2019. ""There were desperate attempts to contact the outside world by phone and to break through the roof of the container,"" the judge said. ""All were to no avail and, before the ship reached Purfleet, [the victims] all died in what must have been an excruciatingly painful death."" This video can not be played Video evidence showed how the trainer containing 39 Vietnamese migrants made its way to the UK The victims had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof but only managed to dent the interior. The court heard some of their final desperate phone messages, including one where a man spoke with ragged breaths as he apologised to his family. ""I can't breathe,"" he said. ""I want to come back to my family. Have a good life."" Justice Sweeney added: ""The willingness of the victims to try and enter the country illegally provides no excuse for what happened to them."" The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October 2019 During the trial, jurors were given a snapshot of the victims - who included a bricklayer, a university graduate and a nail bar technician - and their dreams of a better life. Many of their families borrowed heavily to fund their passage, relying on their potential future earnings once they got into the UK. The father of Nguyen Huy Tung, one of two 15-year-olds in the container, laterlearned of his son's death via social media. Harrison, of Newry, County Down, claimed he did not know there were people in the trailer when he towed it to the Belgian port, and that he watched ""a wee bit of Netflix"" in bed as they were loaded on. After receiving this message from his boss, Robinson got out of his cab, opened the trailer door and discovered the bodies Robinson, from County Armagh, collected the trailer when it arrived on UK shores just after midnight on 23 October. His boss, Hughes, had messaged him: ""Give them air quickly don't let them out."" Robinson gave a thumbs-up in reply. When Robinson stopped on a nearby industrial estate, he found that the migrants were all dead. His barrister said Robinson, who admitted manslaughter, being part of the trafficking plot and money laundering, was ""horrified by what he saw"". The moment lorry driver Maurice Robinson opened the trailer door and discovered the bodies inside was captured on CCTV The trial examined three smuggling attempts by the gang - two that were successful on 11 and 18 October, and the final trip on 23 October. On all three runs, Nica, of Basildon, Essex, had arranged cars and a van to transport the migrants at the UK end. When Robinson discovered the bodies, there was a series of telephone conversations between him and Nica and Hughes, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, before the driver eventually dialled 999. In his evidence, Nica said Robinson told him: ""I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Ronan Hughes (left) met Gheorghe Nica at a budget hotel in Thurrock, Essex While Hughes admitted manslaughter, both Nica and Harrison were convicted by a jury. Mr Justice Sweeney said that in the conspiracy ""two played leading roles, namely - in order of importance - Hughes and Nica"". He accepted Hughes was ""not at the very top of the conspiracy"" but said his role was ""pivotal... in that he ran a haulage business and supplied the trailers and drivers used to transport the migrants"". The judge said Nica ""recruited and paid the drivers whose job it was to collect the migrants when they reached the drop-off site in this country and to drive them to the safe house(s) where they were to be held until payment"". He added at the top of the conspiracy was a Vietnamese man called ""Fong"", who was based in London. Mr Justice Sweeney told the defendants jailed for manslaughter they would serve two-thirds of the term in custody, instead of the usual half. Earlier this month, Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Barclay Road, Tottenham, north London, was sentenced, havingadmitted his limited role in the people-smuggling operation. It was accepted he was not a member of the organised crime group behind the smuggling operation. Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten said: ""May this serve as a warning to those who think it's OK to prey on the vulnerabilities of migrants and their families, transporting them in a way worse than we would transport animals. ""My message to you is that we will find you and we will stop you."" He said the victims died in an ""unimaginable way, because of the utter greed of these criminals"".

"'Eerie' former Cold War bunker for saleA bunker built during the Cold War is being auctioned with a guide price of Â£25,000.","The bunker is in a rural location near St Agnes, Cornwall An ""eerie"" underground bunker built during the Cold War has been put up for sale with a guide price of Â£25,000. The former monitoring post near St Agnes, Cornwall was built in 1961 and is accessed down a 14ft (4.2m) ladder. Sellers have suggested ""a variety of uses"" for the ""out of the ordinary"" property, subject to planning permission from Cornwall Council. It was used in the Cold War to monitor aircraft and any potential nuclear threats, said auctioneer Adam Cook. The auction will be held online in February The bunker was manned by volunteers and consists of an access shaft, a toilet and a monitoring room. It is being auctioned online as part of a triangular piece of land on 18 February. The site was first opened in 1961 and closed in 1991 and is accessed down a ""rustic vehicular track"",according to the online advert.,external Mr Cook said it is a former Royal Observer Corps Monitoring Post ""but people love calling it a nuclear bunker"". He said the bunker would have been one of around 1,500 monitoring posts built in coastal regions in the UK between the 1960s and 1990s. Old bunk beds remain in the bunker Accessed by a hatch, Mr Cook described the reinforced concrete bunker as ""a little bit eerie when you're there on your own"". ""I'm glad I've been down there...[to have] half a chance of explaining it to customers."" He said there was still a sense of what it used to be with an ""old bunk bed"" and a toilet ""which I don't think you'd fancy using but it certainly gives you the atmosphere"".

Mine shaft 'blow out' may have flooded village,"This video can not be played Teresa Dalling says a river of orange water rushed through the village on Thursday Serious flooding which forced villagers from their homes was potentially caused by a mine shaft ""blow out"" during Storm Christoph, authorities have said. About80 people were evacuatedas water rushed through Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, on Thursday. Residents have been told they will not be able to return home this weekend or ""possibly longer"". The Coal Authority said initial checks suggested water had built up in the shaft and flooded the village. Carl Banton, from the Coal Authority, said there had been a ""tremendous amount"" of rain recently and potentially a blockage in the drainage system could have caused the mine shaft to ""blow out"". Mr Banton reassured people that officers had visually checked other mine shafts in the area and were ""not concerned"" any would collapse. ""The mine shaft in question is the one that was on actually on the water level, it has found its point of weakness,"" he said. Carl Banton said that while investigations were ongoing heavy rain may have overwhelmed the mine shaft A major incident was declared as water rushed into the village on Thursday, leaving eight streets underwater as Storm Christoph caused widespread flooding across Wales. On Friday, as firefighters continued to pump water out of the village, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) confirmed the Tennant Canal had been polluted ""from mine water"". Late on Friday evening, Neath Port Talbot council said, for safety reasons, people forced to leave their homes would ""not be able to return home this weekend, and the wait could possibly longer"". A support centre will open at Abbey Primary School from Saturday, with council officers on site to help people access emergency support. This video can not be played Parts of village underwater after flooding The Coal Authority, which manages the effects of historical coal mining, are investigating the cause of the flooding. Mr Banton said initial findings showed there may have been a build-up of water on the hillside which had ""found its way out"" through the mine shaft, flooding the village. ""The flow appears to be subsiding... but what we are unsure of is if there is a feed of additional water into the mine workings, from the extensive mine workings on the hillside,"" he added. At least 80 people have had to leave their homes in the village after flooding Mr Banton said officers would drill down into the shaft and investigate on Saturday, in the hope that people could soon be allowed back into their homes. ""A lot of the mining in this area is very old... some of it dates back to the early 1800s... we have no details of how the shaft in question here was originally filled or capped,"" he said. ""We will ensure the mine shaft is properly capped and sorted out."" Martyn Evans, of NRW, said officers were looking at how to minimise the risk of pollution to nearby rivers, and investigating any impacts on the River Neath. ""We have also carried out tests on other watercourses in the vicinity of the incident. Results indicate there has been no significant impact on those at present,"" he said. On Thursday night a further 20 homes were evacuated by emergency services as the water continued to rush through the village. First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed on Friday financial support would be made available to people affected by the recent floods, up to Â£1,000 per household. ""This is the same level of support available a year ago when storms Ciara and Dennis hit Wales, just before the pandemic,"" he said. The water is warmer than the air and is creating a mist along Dynevor Road Skewen resident John Thomas said he returned home from a funeral with wife Lynne on Thursday to find their house had turned into ""a lake"", he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. He said: ""The water was around the level of the bottom of the doors so we couldn't go in, so we just had to stand there and watch this orange-coloured water just piling up and up and up."" Mr Thomas said that with water up to his waist, he was unable to get in to rescue possessions. Financial help offered to flood victims Storm Christoph: Flood warnings and homes evacuated Storm Christoph in pictures Storm Christoph floods tracked by satellite radar He added: ""We're in a bit of a dip on the road, so you could see it gradually coming up, they were worried it might have been a sinkhole because of the coal mines. ""It's definitely mine workings, just by looking at the colour of the water, it's an orange colour. ""Other people who were evacuated had the chance to move things upstairs, I didn't have a chance to do that because I couldn't get in to it."" The couple are now staying with their daughter, with everyone else who was evacuated from their homes finding accommodation and told to avoid the area. More than 30 residents of Cwrt-Clwydi-Gwyn care home were among those moved as a precaution. It was a sleepless night for Skewen resident Teresa Dalling Teresa Dalling, who lives in Dynevor Road, said she had spent the night fearing for her safety. ""I haven't slept. I was up the back door every two hours checking the water level,"" she said. ""I didn't know we lived near old mines and if there's been a collapse, my fear is more could follow and that's terrifying."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As well as properties, vehicles were submerged in water Up to 45 firefighters were involved at the scene at the height of the flooding. In a joint statement, the police, fire service and Neath Port Talbot Council urged people not to return to their homes until it was safe. Ch Supt Trudi Meyrick said: ""We appreciate people are eager to get back to their homes and we are working with partners to allow this to happen as soon as it is safe to do so. ""In the meantime we ask people to please be patient as their safety is our top priority."" In one home, floodwater can be seen filling the living room Firefighters are continuing to pump water out of the village where people were forced to leave their homes Deputy Chief Fire Officer Roger Thomas, of Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said firefighters remained in the village, pumping out water. He said: ""We will continue to monitor the situation and support our partner agencies and those affected over the next few days."" Homes were evacuated at Goshen Park, in Skewen Neath Port Talbot council said a local rest centre was available, and measures had been put in place to protect against Covid-19. Chief executive Karen Jones said they would continue to support residents who had to leave their homes and they would ensure others had a safe place to go if further evacuations were necessary. Network Rail said engineers had checked for any potential damage to the railway line, but had found no ""cause for concern"". The water has rushed through the streets of the town A severe flood warning remains in force for the Lower Dee Valley, from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadows. Three flood warnings are in place for the River Wye at Monmouth, River Ritec at Tenby, and Bangor-on-Dee, where people were forced to leave their homes on Thursday as flooding saw a major incident declared. Eleven flood alerts are also in place. Snow and ice could also exacerbate issues for emergency services and those forced to leave their homes,with temperatures forecast to plummet in coming days.

Senedd drinking 'possible breach' of Covid rules,"Alun Davies, Paul Davies and Darren Millar have apologised but deny any wrongdoing An investigation has found that four members of the Welsh Parliament drank alcohol on its premises, days after a Wales-wide alcohol ban came into force. The Senedd has referred the ""possible breach"" of Covid rules to Cardiff Council and its own standards watchdog. Conservative group leader Paul Davies has apologised and won the ""unanimous"" support of the group to stay in post. Mr Davies, Tory chief whip Darren Millar and Labour's Alun Davies deny breaking any rules. Alun Davies has been suspended from the Labour group in the Senedd. BBC Wales has asked for clarification as to the identity of the fourth Senedd member investigators have referred to. A ban on serving drinks in pubs and bars came in four days before the meeting On 8 December, five individuals - four members of the Senedd (MS) and the Conservative group's chief of staff Paul Smith - were found to be consuming alcohol in the Senedd's licensed tearoom, according to an investigation by the Senedd Commission. Four days earliera ban on the serving of alcohol in pubs and licensed premises across Waleshad been imposed, leading the investigation to conclude the incident could amount to ""a possible breach"" of Covid-19 regulations. The Senedd's Presiding Officer Elin Jones MS said the matter had been referred to Cardiff Council to investigate a possible licence breach. ""The regulations in place at the time imposed strict restrictions on members of the public with regard to the consumption of alcohol,"" she said. ""Given that the possible breach in question occurred as a result of the consumption of alcohol by Members of the Senedd, I have also written to the Standards Commissioner to ask him to investigate whether these Members acted in accordance with the duty in the Code of Conduct to conduct themselves in a manner which maintains and strengthens the public's trust and confidence in the integrity of the Senedd."" A number of politicians were seen drinking on Senedd premises in Cardiff Bay In a meeting earlier, the Conservative group in the Senedd met to discuss what a statement issued on behalf of group chair Janet Finch-Saunders MS detailed as ""events involving three members of the Group"" on 8 December. ""The Group extended its unanimous support for Paul Davies to continue in his post as Leader of the Group,"" the statement read. BBC Wales has been told by several sources that Mr Davies said in the meeting he had considered resigning as leader. It is also understood the declaration of support was made before Tory group members had seen the Senedd investigation's conclusion. A grassroots Conservative Party member said it ""won't hold with the party membership"" if Mr Davies did not resign. ""The grassroots are on fire at the moment. He 100% needs to go now - his position is untenable,"" the member added. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the member of catering staff should not be left to ""carry the can"" When asked his opinion at the latest Covid press conference, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hoped the sole member of tearoom staff on duty that evening would not be blamed for the incident. ""I'm very anxious that this does not all result in that person carrying the can for what happened that evening,"" he said. ""That was a single female member of staff faced with a collection of senior Senedd members. ""The idea that the person, the staff member, was to blame seems to me completely incredulous and I very much hope that this does not head in that direction."" Plaid Cymru MS Helen Mary Jones said: ""Failure to address the members' actions is a grave error of judgment on behalf of the Conservative Senedd group. ""Their leader and their chief whip [Mr Millar] should be setting an example in the middle of a pandemic rather than getting embroiled in an incident which is in danger of bringing the Senedd into disrepute. ""It would seem that the internal machinations of the Tory group is stopping them from doing the right thing,"" she added. Cardiff Council confirmed the city licensing authority - a Shared Regulatory Service (SRS) also covering the Vale of Glamorgan - had been asked to investigate. ""The service works closely with South Wales Police to ensure that public protection and adherence to Covid regulations is maintained,"" a spokesperson said. ""Once the investigation is concluded, and if a breach of the regulations has been found, SRS will take the necessary action, which could see a fixed penalty notice served or a prosecution in the courts.""

It was brought to you by Sam Cabral, Penny Spiller, Max Matza, Georgina Rannard, Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady and Alix Kroeger. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The future for Trump - and the political movement he rode to victory in 2016 - is murky. Over his career, he has been declared dead more times than Freddy Krueger and has always managed to wriggle free. Until now. In the days following the US Capitol riot, Trump's overall public approval rating precipitously dropped to the mid-30s - some of the lowest of his entire presidency. At first blush, the numbers would indicate that his political prospects have been mortally wounded. A deeper dive, however, paints a less dire picture for the ex-president. While Democrats, independents and some moderate Republicans are against him, his Republican base appears to be intact. Read Anthony's analysis of what Trump's future looks like. After the riot at the US Capitol, videos of Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman luring the mob away from the Senate chambers - and possibly saving lawmakers' lives - went viral. Several members of Congress have since credited his quick thinking for distracting the rioters, and called him a hero. Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House introduced a bill to award Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal. Today, another bipartisan group - in the Senate - is proposing identical legislation. The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded to Americans who have made ""distinguished achievements and contributions"" to their country. Lawmakers are showing their gratitude on social media, sharing pictures with Goodman. On Wednesday, he escorted Vice-President Kamala Harris to her inauguration ceremony. Allow Twitter content?

Here's why so many people think Goodman may have saved lives. Twice as many Americans have searched on Google for information about the impeachment of Joe Biden, compared to Donald Trump, in the last 24 hours. Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory,filed articles of impeachment against the new president yesterday,external. Greene accuses Biden of bribery and other abuses of power, citing unproven claims that the president used his official capacity to help his son's business dealings in Ukraine. She announced this on Twitter in a short video which now has nearly 10 million views. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Greene has been widely condemned, and even banned temporarily from Twitter, for spreading false information about the US election results. Filing articles of impeachment does not indicate action on behalf of Congress. Any representative can file articles of impeachment. In fact, Texas Democrat Al Green tried and failed three times against Donald Trump. However, as indicated by Google Trends, her efforts have clearly gained the attention of many Americans. One might think that more would be searching for news on ""Trump impeachment"" after the announcement by Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor on Friday. He announced the second impeachment trial of former President Trump would begin next week. But that is not the case. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked earlier if Biden had any comment on the ongoing violence seen this week in the streets of Portland and Seattle. Despite fears of conservative mobs following the riot at the Capitol, it has actually been left-wing protesters who have clashed with police in the days before and after Biden's inauguration. On the day Biden was inaugurated this week, demonstrators carrying anti-Biden and anti-police signs marched in Portland and smashed the windows of the Democratic Party of Oregon. Psaki told reporters: ""Certainly we had our team on the ground, our national security team, even before 12:01, early in the morning on Inauguration Day because we wanted to be able to monitor events happening across the country and any unrest that was resulting from the last couple of weeks."" ""I haven't spoke with him specifically about those events but it is something our national security team... is closely monitoring of course, but if we have an additional update I'm happy to provide it to you."" Conservative news outlets criticised Psaki for not taking the opportunity to condemn radical left-wing groups, such as antifa. Protests continued on Thursday, the first full day of the Biden presidency. Demonstrations, and sometimes rioting, have recurred in Seattle and Portland in the months since the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May. The Biden administration is causing confusion over whether it believes China has engaged in the genocide of its minority Uighur population White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not commit to calling alleged rights abuses by the Chinese government against the minority Uighur population a genocide during the briefing earlier. ""The president has spoken before to the horrific treatment of Uighurs but I don't have anything more for you on it,"" she told reporters. ""I can check with our national security team and see if we have a more up-to-date statement."" The response prompted questions as earlier this week, Biden's Secretary of State nominee Anthony Blinken confirmed that he agreed with the Trump administration assessment that China had engaged in genocide. And, during the election last year, the Biden campaign also called the situation ""unspeakable oppression"" and ""genocide"". Need a bit more context? China has faced global criticism over its alleged persecution of the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group living mostly in the north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang. It is believed that the Chinese government has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as ""re-education camps"". The government has also been accused of forcibly sterilising Uighur women, which it denies. After initially denying the existence of these camps, China now says they were a necessary measure against separatist violence in Xinjiang. Read more about China and the Uighurs here. The president said the US death toll from the coronavirus could shoot up by another 200,000 with or without action from the government. ""A lot of America is hurting,"" said Biden. ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" According to the Johns Hopkins University, 412,239 American lives have now been lost to the virus. Making his case in the White House before he signed two executive orders to provide pandemic relief, Biden  said: ""We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act."" In his final hours in office, Donald Trump issued dozens of pardons. Several of those charged in the Capitol riots hoped they would receive pardons, but none came. A lawyer for the so-called QAnon Shaman - the Viking-like invader whose image ricocheted around the world - is speaking out now about the snub. In what appears to be some kind of media offensive, attorney Al Watkins has told various local media outlets that his client Jake Angeli was âdupedâ by the words and actions of President Trump. âMr. Chansley, along with many others who were similarly situated, are now compelled to reconcile a betrayal by a man whose back they felt they had for years,â said Watkins. Chansley, 33, called the FBI the day after the riot to say he had been there âat the request of the president that all âpatriotsâ come to DC on January 6, 2021.â He has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct. The president has apologised that some members of the National Guard drafted to protect the capital from violence were forced to sleep in a garage this week. He also called on the National Guard Bureau chief to say sorry to the soldiers, who had been asked to leave the Congressional buildings. Pictures of the troops sleeping in the unheated car park provoked outrage on Thursday, with some state governors calling their soldiers home. On Friday Biden's wife First Lady Jill Biden visited some of the National Guard to thank them for their work and hand out cookies. Around 7,000 soldiers are expected to remain in Washington until mid-March, with the other 18,000 leaving in the coming weeks. They were posted to the city after violent pro-Trump supporters stormed Congress on 6 January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reacting to today's news, that the House will send Trump's impeachment article to the Senate on Monday, setting up his trial to begin Tuesday, Biden had this to say: ""I havenât heard the detail of it,"" he says. ""The more time we have to get up and running to meet these crises, the better."" His answer seemed to hint that he preferred the Republican timeline offer, which would have seen the trial pushed back until early February to give both sides to prepare. The now-viral photo of Bernie Sanders at Joe Biden's inauguration There's little sign that the Bernie Sanders meme from Biden's inauguration is going away. You'd be forgiven for thinking that the 79-year-old Senator was the star of the show on Wednesday after pictures of him wrapped up in a practical coat and woollen mittens went viral. Now Sanders' team have announced you can buy a jumper showing the meme to raise money for charity. TheChairman Sanders Crewneck is on sale for $45,external(Â£33), with all proceeds going to Meals on Wheels in Vermont, where Sanders lives. ""Due to overwhelming demand for this item, it will be 3-6 weeks until you receive your sweatshirt,"" the website warns. About the viral photo, Sanders said on Thursday, âI was just sitting there, trying to keep warm, trying to pay attention to what was going on.â Sanders has been appointed chairman of the powerful Senate Budget Committee. President Biden says, if the US government does not act ""decisively and boldly"" now, it will cause a lot of pain. ""We're in a national emergency,"" said Biden. ""We need to act like we're in a national emergency."" The executive orders that the president is signing today aim to expand access to food aid for low-income families and protect federal workers. He reiterated the sentiments previously expressed by other members of the administration, noting that more needs to be done because ""a lot of America is hurting"". He urged action from Congress on his $1.9tn Covid rescue package, warning that that there was no time to waste. ""I don't believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs. I believe Americans are going hungry and losing jobs."" The president says the first part of his plan is to ""get direct financial relief"" to those who need it most. ""With our American rescue plan, the economy would return to full employment a year sooner,"" Biden says. He adds that the administration is going to ""finish the job"" of getting a total of $2,000 (Â£1,450) in economic payments out to the people. ""If we fail to act, there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures,"" he adds. ""because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months."" ""This would overwhelm emergency shelters,"" he says, adding that displaced Americans will be at a higher risk of catching coronavirus if they are forced to live in places where they are unable to social distance. Biden is now speaking from the White House about his plans to take the US out of the economic recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. ""If we don't act - the rest of the world is not standing still,"" Biden says, warning: ""We need more action and we need to move fast.""  Earlier, we reported that former President Trump's impeachment trial is poised to begin next week, as the House submits the charge against him to the Senate. Watch the moment Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer announced the news of Trump's upcoming ""full and fair trial"" - and see Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell's response - below. This video can not be played Schumer: Trump will have a 'full and fair trial' It's day two of the Biden administration and the new president is already facing some pushback. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit over a decision to halt most deportations from the US for 100 days, saying the administration is in violation of an agreement with the state signed under President Trump. That agreement from 31 December says that the federal government must discuss immigration matters with the state and provide six months' notice before enacting policy changes. Ending it requires 180 days' notice. Paxton argued the state would face ""irreparable harm"" if the moratorium went through, Reuters news agency reported. The White House has declined to comment on the matter. The White House has just put out a statement marking the 48th anniversary of Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court decision that essentially legalised the right to abortion. ""In the past four years, reproductive health, including the right to choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack,""the statement from Biden and Harris begins,external. They go on to say they are committed to ""codifying"" the judgement, which means pass legislation through Congress that enshrines abortion access into law. They will also appoint judges who will support abortion access, they say. Trump, during his time in office, was able to give the Supreme Court a conservative majority, making anti-abortion activists hopeful that Roe v Wade could eventually be overturned. Biden was the only candidate during the primary to say he endorsed the so-called Hyde Amendment, which says that no federal funds can go towards abortions. After nearly all 22 other candidates came out against the Hyde Amendment, he reversed his stance. Although abortion is technically legal across the US, multiple states have instituted laws that make it nearly impossible in practice. Abortion activists hope that a law would make it more difficult for local governments to restrict access. President Biden will make a call to another foreign leader later today: Mexican president AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. The call was first announced on Twitter by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard ""The bilateral relationship moves forward with communication and understanding,"" said Ebrard. It will be Biden's second foreign call of the day. He will also speak to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The White House says it will provide readouts of the two calls later in the day. The BBC's North America Editor Jon Sopel asks about the prospects for a free trade deal between the US and UK. Is it months or years away? Just yesterday, Janet Yellen - the former head of the US central bank who's now in line to be treasury secretary - said Biden would not be signing any new deals because his priority right now is on domestic economy and infrastructure. ""I can't give you any timeline,"" press secretary Jen Psaki begins. She goes on to say that trade agreements that benefit American families are ""certainly"" being considered. ""At this point in time we're working to get the pandemic under control [and] provide economic relief to the American public,"" she says. Joe Biden's administration is making it a priority to address domestic extremism, press secretary Jen Psaki announced a few minutes ago. It comes after the violent attack on the Capitol on 6 January in which hundreds of pro-Trump Americans stormed Congress. Many are believed to have subscribed to extremist views after viewing radical material online. On Friday, the White House requested a ""comprehensive threat assessment about domestic violent extremism"" from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. The Capitol riot underscored ""what we have long known - the rise of domestic extremism is a serious and growing national security threat"", Psaki said. She underlined that the president aims to increase communication and the sharing of information between the agencies tracking the threat. Read about the Capitol arrests. Â© 2025 BBC.

Here's why so many people think Goodman may have saved lives. Twice as many Americans have searched on Google for information about the impeachment of Joe Biden, compared to Donald Trump, in the last 24 hours. Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory,filed articles of impeachment against the new president yesterday,external. Greene accuses Biden of bribery and other abuses of power, citing unproven claims that the president used his official capacity to help his son's business dealings in Ukraine. She announced this on Twitter in a short video which now has nearly 10 million views. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Greene has been widely condemned, and even banned temporarily from Twitter, for spreading false information about the US election results. Filing articles of impeachment does not indicate action on behalf of Congress. Any representative can file articles of impeachment. In fact, Texas Democrat Al Green tried and failed three times against Donald Trump. However, as indicated by Google Trends, her efforts have clearly gained the attention of many Americans. One might think that more would be searching for news on ""Trump impeachment"" after the announcement by Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor on Friday. He announced the second impeachment trial of former President Trump would begin next week. But that is not the case. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked earlier if Biden had any comment on the ongoing violence seen this week in the streets of Portland and Seattle. Despite fears of conservative mobs following the riot at the Capitol, it has actually been left-wing protesters who have clashed with police in the days before and after Biden's inauguration. On the day Biden was inaugurated this week, demonstrators carrying anti-Biden and anti-police signs marched in Portland and smashed the windows of the Democratic Party of Oregon. Psaki told reporters: ""Certainly we had our team on the ground, our national security team, even before 12:01, early in the morning on Inauguration Day because we wanted to be able to monitor events happening across the country and any unrest that was resulting from the last couple of weeks."" ""I haven't spoke with him specifically about those events but it is something our national security team... is closely monitoring of course, but if we have an additional update I'm happy to provide it to you."" Conservative news outlets criticised Psaki for not taking the opportunity to condemn radical left-wing groups, such as antifa. Protests continued on Thursday, the first full day of the Biden presidency. Demonstrations, and sometimes rioting, have recurred in Seattle and Portland in the months since the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May. The Biden administration is causing confusion over whether it believes China has engaged in the genocide of its minority Uighur population White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not commit to calling alleged rights abuses by the Chinese government against the minority Uighur population a genocide during the briefing earlier. ""The president has spoken before to the horrific treatment of Uighurs but I don't have anything more for you on it,"" she told reporters. ""I can check with our national security team and see if we have a more up-to-date statement."" The response prompted questions as earlier this week, Biden's Secretary of State nominee Anthony Blinken confirmed that he agreed with the Trump administration assessment that China had engaged in genocide. And, during the election last year, the Biden campaign also called the situation ""unspeakable oppression"" and ""genocide"". Need a bit more context? China has faced global criticism over its alleged persecution of the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group living mostly in the north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang. It is believed that the Chinese government has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as ""re-education camps"". The government has also been accused of forcibly sterilising Uighur women, which it denies. After initially denying the existence of these camps, China now says they were a necessary measure against separatist violence in Xinjiang. Read more about China and the Uighurs here. The president said the US death toll from the coronavirus could shoot up by another 200,000 with or without action from the government. ""A lot of America is hurting,"" said Biden. ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" According to the Johns Hopkins University, 412,239 American lives have now been lost to the virus. Making his case in the White House before he signed two executive orders to provide pandemic relief, Biden  said: ""We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act."" In his final hours in office, Donald Trump issued dozens of pardons. Several of those charged in the Capitol riots hoped they would receive pardons, but none came. A lawyer for the so-called QAnon Shaman - the Viking-like invader whose image ricocheted around the world - is speaking out now about the snub. In what appears to be some kind of media offensive, attorney Al Watkins has told various local media outlets that his client Jake Angeli was âdupedâ by the words and actions of President Trump. âMr. Chansley, along with many others who were similarly situated, are now compelled to reconcile a betrayal by a man whose back they felt they had for years,â said Watkins. Chansley, 33, called the FBI the day after the riot to say he had been there âat the request of the president that all âpatriotsâ come to DC on January 6, 2021.â He has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct. The president has apologised that some members of the National Guard drafted to protect the capital from violence were forced to sleep in a garage this week. He also called on the National Guard Bureau chief to say sorry to the soldiers, who had been asked to leave the Congressional buildings. Pictures of the troops sleeping in the unheated car park provoked outrage on Thursday, with some state governors calling their soldiers home. On Friday Biden's wife First Lady Jill Biden visited some of the National Guard to thank them for their work and hand out cookies. Around 7,000 soldiers are expected to remain in Washington until mid-March, with the other 18,000 leaving in the coming weeks. They were posted to the city after violent pro-Trump supporters stormed Congress on 6 January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reacting to today's news, that the House will send Trump's impeachment article to the Senate on Monday, setting up his trial to begin Tuesday, Biden had this to say: ""I havenât heard the detail of it,"" he says. ""The more time we have to get up and running to meet these crises, the better."" His answer seemed to hint that he preferred the Republican timeline offer, which would have seen the trial pushed back until early February to give both sides to prepare. The now-viral photo of Bernie Sanders at Joe Biden's inauguration There's little sign that the Bernie Sanders meme from Biden's inauguration is going away. You'd be forgiven for thinking that the 79-year-old Senator was the star of the show on Wednesday after pictures of him wrapped up in a practical coat and woollen mittens went viral. Now Sanders' team have announced you can buy a jumper showing the meme to raise money for charity. TheChairman Sanders Crewneck is on sale for $45,external(Â£33), with all proceeds going to Meals on Wheels in Vermont, where Sanders lives. ""Due to overwhelming demand for this item, it will be 3-6 weeks until you receive your sweatshirt,"" the website warns. About the viral photo, Sanders said on Thursday, âI was just sitting there, trying to keep warm, trying to pay attention to what was going on.â Sanders has been appointed chairman of the powerful Senate Budget Committee. President Biden says, if the US government does not act ""decisively and boldly"" now, it will cause a lot of pain. ""We're in a national emergency,"" said Biden. ""We need to act like we're in a national emergency."" The executive orders that the president is signing today aim to expand access to food aid for low-income families and protect federal workers. He reiterated the sentiments previously expressed by other members of the administration, noting that more needs to be done because ""a lot of America is hurting"". He urged action from Congress on his $1.9tn Covid rescue package, warning that that there was no time to waste. ""I don't believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs. I believe Americans are going hungry and losing jobs."" The president says the first part of his plan is to ""get direct financial relief"" to those who need it most. ""With our American rescue plan, the economy would return to full employment a year sooner,"" Biden says. He adds that the administration is going to ""finish the job"" of getting a total of $2,000 (Â£1,450) in economic payments out to the people. ""If we fail to act, there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures,"" he adds. ""because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months."" ""This would overwhelm emergency shelters,"" he says, adding that displaced Americans will be at a higher risk of catching coronavirus if they are forced to live in places where they are unable to social distance. Biden is now speaking from the White House about his plans to take the US out of the economic recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. ""If we don't act - the rest of the world is not standing still,"" Biden says, warning: ""We need more action and we need to move fast.""  Earlier, we reported that former President Trump's impeachment trial is poised to begin next week, as the House submits the charge against him to the Senate. Watch the moment Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer announced the news of Trump's upcoming ""full and fair trial"" - and see Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell's response - below. This video can not be played Schumer: Trump will have a 'full and fair trial' It's day two of the Biden administration and the new president is already facing some pushback. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit over a decision to halt most deportations from the US for 100 days, saying the administration is in violation of an agreement with the state signed under President Trump. That agreement from 31 December says that the federal government must discuss immigration matters with the state and provide six months' notice before enacting policy changes. Ending it requires 180 days' notice. Paxton argued the state would face ""irreparable harm"" if the moratorium went through, Reuters news agency reported. The White House has declined to comment on the matter. The White House has just put out a statement marking the 48th anniversary of Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court decision that essentially legalised the right to abortion. ""In the past four years, reproductive health, including the right to choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack,""the statement from Biden and Harris begins,external. They go on to say they are committed to ""codifying"" the judgement, which means pass legislation through Congress that enshrines abortion access into law. They will also appoint judges who will support abortion access, they say. Trump, during his time in office, was able to give the Supreme Court a conservative majority, making anti-abortion activists hopeful that Roe v Wade could eventually be overturned. Biden was the only candidate during the primary to say he endorsed the so-called Hyde Amendment, which says that no federal funds can go towards abortions. After nearly all 22 other candidates came out against the Hyde Amendment, he reversed his stance. Although abortion is technically legal across the US, multiple states have instituted laws that make it nearly impossible in practice. Abortion activists hope that a law would make it more difficult for local governments to restrict access. President Biden will make a call to another foreign leader later today: Mexican president AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. The call was first announced on Twitter by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard ""The bilateral relationship moves forward with communication and understanding,"" said Ebrard. It will be Biden's second foreign call of the day. He will also speak to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The White House says it will provide readouts of the two calls later in the day. The BBC's North America Editor Jon Sopel asks about the prospects for a free trade deal between the US and UK. Is it months or years away? Just yesterday, Janet Yellen - the former head of the US central bank who's now in line to be treasury secretary - said Biden would not be signing any new deals because his priority right now is on domestic economy and infrastructure. ""I can't give you any timeline,"" press secretary Jen Psaki begins. She goes on to say that trade agreements that benefit American families are ""certainly"" being considered. ""At this point in time we're working to get the pandemic under control [and] provide economic relief to the American public,"" she says. Joe Biden's administration is making it a priority to address domestic extremism, press secretary Jen Psaki announced a few minutes ago. It comes after the violent attack on the Capitol on 6 January in which hundreds of pro-Trump Americans stormed Congress. Many are believed to have subscribed to extremist views after viewing radical material online. On Friday, the White House requested a ""comprehensive threat assessment about domestic violent extremism"" from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. The Capitol riot underscored ""what we have long known - the rise of domestic extremism is a serious and growing national security threat"", Psaki said. She underlined that the president aims to increase communication and the sharing of information between the agencies tracking the threat. Read about the Capitol arrests. Â© 2025 BBC.

It was brought to you by Sam Cabral, Penny Spiller, Max Matza, Georgina Rannard, Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady and Alix Kroeger. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The future for Trump - and the political movement he rode to victory in 2016 - is murky. Over his career, he has been declared dead more times than Freddy Krueger and has always managed to wriggle free. Until now. In the days following the US Capitol riot, Trump's overall public approval rating precipitously dropped to the mid-30s - some of the lowest of his entire presidency. At first blush, the numbers would indicate that his political prospects have been mortally wounded. A deeper dive, however, paints a less dire picture for the ex-president. While Democrats, independents and some moderate Republicans are against him, his Republican base appears to be intact. Read Anthony's analysis of what Trump's future looks like. After the riot at the US Capitol, videos of Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman luring the mob away from the Senate chambers - and possibly saving lawmakers' lives - went viral. Several members of Congress have since credited his quick thinking for distracting the rioters, and called him a hero. Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House introduced a bill to award Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal. Today, another bipartisan group - in the Senate - is proposing identical legislation. The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded to Americans who have made ""distinguished achievements and contributions"" to their country. Lawmakers are showing their gratitude on social media, sharing pictures with Goodman. On Wednesday, he escorted Vice-President Kamala Harris to her inauguration ceremony. Allow Twitter content?

She announced this on Twitter in a short video which now has nearly 10 million views. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Greene has been widely condemned, and even banned temporarily from Twitter, for spreading false information about the US election results. Filing articles of impeachment does not indicate action on behalf of Congress. Any representative can file articles of impeachment. In fact, Texas Democrat Al Green tried and failed three times against Donald Trump. However, as indicated by Google Trends, her efforts have clearly gained the attention of many Americans. One might think that more would be searching for news on ""Trump impeachment"" after the announcement by Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor on Friday. He announced the second impeachment trial of former President Trump would begin next week. But that is not the case. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked earlier if Biden had any comment on the ongoing violence seen this week in the streets of Portland and Seattle. Despite fears of conservative mobs following the riot at the Capitol, it has actually been left-wing protesters who have clashed with police in the days before and after Biden's inauguration. On the day Biden was inaugurated this week, demonstrators carrying anti-Biden and anti-police signs marched in Portland and smashed the windows of the Democratic Party of Oregon. Psaki told reporters: ""Certainly we had our team on the ground, our national security team, even before 12:01, early in the morning on Inauguration Day because we wanted to be able to monitor events happening across the country and any unrest that was resulting from the last couple of weeks."" ""I haven't spoke with him specifically about those events but it is something our national security team... is closely monitoring of course, but if we have an additional update I'm happy to provide it to you."" Conservative news outlets criticised Psaki for not taking the opportunity to condemn radical left-wing groups, such as antifa. Protests continued on Thursday, the first full day of the Biden presidency. Demonstrations, and sometimes rioting, have recurred in Seattle and Portland in the months since the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May. The Biden administration is causing confusion over whether it believes China has engaged in the genocide of its minority Uighur population White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not commit to calling alleged rights abuses by the Chinese government against the minority Uighur population a genocide during the briefing earlier. ""The president has spoken before to the horrific treatment of Uighurs but I don't have anything more for you on it,"" she told reporters. ""I can check with our national security team and see if we have a more up-to-date statement."" The response prompted questions as earlier this week, Biden's Secretary of State nominee Anthony Blinken confirmed that he agreed with the Trump administration assessment that China had engaged in genocide. And, during the election last year, the Biden campaign also called the situation ""unspeakable oppression"" and ""genocide"". Need a bit more context? China has faced global criticism over its alleged persecution of the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group living mostly in the north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang. It is believed that the Chinese government has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as ""re-education camps"". The government has also been accused of forcibly sterilising Uighur women, which it denies. After initially denying the existence of these camps, China now says they were a necessary measure against separatist violence in Xinjiang. Read more about China and the Uighurs here. The president said the US death toll from the coronavirus could shoot up by another 200,000 with or without action from the government. ""A lot of America is hurting,"" said Biden. ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" According to the Johns Hopkins University, 412,239 American lives have now been lost to the virus. Making his case in the White House before he signed two executive orders to provide pandemic relief, Biden  said: ""We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act."" In his final hours in office, Donald Trump issued dozens of pardons. Several of those charged in the Capitol riots hoped they would receive pardons, but none came. A lawyer for the so-called QAnon Shaman - the Viking-like invader whose image ricocheted around the world - is speaking out now about the snub. In what appears to be some kind of media offensive, attorney Al Watkins has told various local media outlets that his client Jake Angeli was âdupedâ by the words and actions of President Trump. âMr. Chansley, along with many others who were similarly situated, are now compelled to reconcile a betrayal by a man whose back they felt they had for years,â said Watkins. Chansley, 33, called the FBI the day after the riot to say he had been there âat the request of the president that all âpatriotsâ come to DC on January 6, 2021.â He has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct. The president has apologised that some members of the National Guard drafted to protect the capital from violence were forced to sleep in a garage this week. He also called on the National Guard Bureau chief to say sorry to the soldiers, who had been asked to leave the Congressional buildings. Pictures of the troops sleeping in the unheated car park provoked outrage on Thursday, with some state governors calling their soldiers home. On Friday Biden's wife First Lady Jill Biden visited some of the National Guard to thank them for their work and hand out cookies. Around 7,000 soldiers are expected to remain in Washington until mid-March, with the other 18,000 leaving in the coming weeks. They were posted to the city after violent pro-Trump supporters stormed Congress on 6 January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reacting to today's news, that the House will send Trump's impeachment article to the Senate on Monday, setting up his trial to begin Tuesday, Biden had this to say: ""I havenât heard the detail of it,"" he says. ""The more time we have to get up and running to meet these crises, the better."" His answer seemed to hint that he preferred the Republican timeline offer, which would have seen the trial pushed back until early February to give both sides to prepare. The now-viral photo of Bernie Sanders at Joe Biden's inauguration There's little sign that the Bernie Sanders meme from Biden's inauguration is going away. You'd be forgiven for thinking that the 79-year-old Senator was the star of the show on Wednesday after pictures of him wrapped up in a practical coat and woollen mittens went viral. Now Sanders' team have announced you can buy a jumper showing the meme to raise money for charity. TheChairman Sanders Crewneck is on sale for $45,external(Â£33), with all proceeds going to Meals on Wheels in Vermont, where Sanders lives. ""Due to overwhelming demand for this item, it will be 3-6 weeks until you receive your sweatshirt,"" the website warns. About the viral photo, Sanders said on Thursday, âI was just sitting there, trying to keep warm, trying to pay attention to what was going on.â Sanders has been appointed chairman of the powerful Senate Budget Committee. President Biden says, if the US government does not act ""decisively and boldly"" now, it will cause a lot of pain. ""We're in a national emergency,"" said Biden. ""We need to act like we're in a national emergency."" The executive orders that the president is signing today aim to expand access to food aid for low-income families and protect federal workers. He reiterated the sentiments previously expressed by other members of the administration, noting that more needs to be done because ""a lot of America is hurting"". He urged action from Congress on his $1.9tn Covid rescue package, warning that that there was no time to waste. ""I don't believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs. I believe Americans are going hungry and losing jobs."" The president says the first part of his plan is to ""get direct financial relief"" to those who need it most. ""With our American rescue plan, the economy would return to full employment a year sooner,"" Biden says. He adds that the administration is going to ""finish the job"" of getting a total of $2,000 (Â£1,450) in economic payments out to the people. ""If we fail to act, there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures,"" he adds. ""because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months."" ""This would overwhelm emergency shelters,"" he says, adding that displaced Americans will be at a higher risk of catching coronavirus if they are forced to live in places where they are unable to social distance. Biden is now speaking from the White House about his plans to take the US out of the economic recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. ""If we don't act - the rest of the world is not standing still,"" Biden says, warning: ""We need more action and we need to move fast.""  Earlier, we reported that former President Trump's impeachment trial is poised to begin next week, as the House submits the charge against him to the Senate. Watch the moment Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer announced the news of Trump's upcoming ""full and fair trial"" - and see Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell's response - below. This video can not be played Schumer: Trump will have a 'full and fair trial' It's day two of the Biden administration and the new president is already facing some pushback. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit over a decision to halt most deportations from the US for 100 days, saying the administration is in violation of an agreement with the state signed under President Trump. That agreement from 31 December says that the federal government must discuss immigration matters with the state and provide six months' notice before enacting policy changes. Ending it requires 180 days' notice. Paxton argued the state would face ""irreparable harm"" if the moratorium went through, Reuters news agency reported. The White House has declined to comment on the matter. The White House has just put out a statement marking the 48th anniversary of Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court decision that essentially legalised the right to abortion. ""In the past four years, reproductive health, including the right to choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack,""the statement from Biden and Harris begins,external. They go on to say they are committed to ""codifying"" the judgement, which means pass legislation through Congress that enshrines abortion access into law. They will also appoint judges who will support abortion access, they say. Trump, during his time in office, was able to give the Supreme Court a conservative majority, making anti-abortion activists hopeful that Roe v Wade could eventually be overturned. Biden was the only candidate during the primary to say he endorsed the so-called Hyde Amendment, which says that no federal funds can go towards abortions. After nearly all 22 other candidates came out against the Hyde Amendment, he reversed his stance. Although abortion is technically legal across the US, multiple states have instituted laws that make it nearly impossible in practice. Abortion activists hope that a law would make it more difficult for local governments to restrict access. President Biden will make a call to another foreign leader later today: Mexican president AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. The call was first announced on Twitter by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard ""The bilateral relationship moves forward with communication and understanding,"" said Ebrard. It will be Biden's second foreign call of the day. He will also speak to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The White House says it will provide readouts of the two calls later in the day. The BBC's North America Editor Jon Sopel asks about the prospects for a free trade deal between the US and UK. Is it months or years away? Just yesterday, Janet Yellen - the former head of the US central bank who's now in line to be treasury secretary - said Biden would not be signing any new deals because his priority right now is on domestic economy and infrastructure. ""I can't give you any timeline,"" press secretary Jen Psaki begins. She goes on to say that trade agreements that benefit American families are ""certainly"" being considered. ""At this point in time we're working to get the pandemic under control [and] provide economic relief to the American public,"" she says. Joe Biden's administration is making it a priority to address domestic extremism, press secretary Jen Psaki announced a few minutes ago. It comes after the violent attack on the Capitol on 6 January in which hundreds of pro-Trump Americans stormed Congress. Many are believed to have subscribed to extremist views after viewing radical material online. On Friday, the White House requested a ""comprehensive threat assessment about domestic violent extremism"" from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. The Capitol riot underscored ""what we have long known - the rise of domestic extremism is a serious and growing national security threat"", Psaki said. She underlined that the president aims to increase communication and the sharing of information between the agencies tracking the threat. Read about the Capitol arrests. Â© 2025 BBC.

It was brought to you by Sam Cabral, Penny Spiller, Max Matza, Georgina Rannard, Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady and Alix Kroeger. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The future for Trump - and the political movement he rode to victory in 2016 - is murky. Over his career, he has been declared dead more times than Freddy Krueger and has always managed to wriggle free. Until now. In the days following the US Capitol riot, Trump's overall public approval rating precipitously dropped to the mid-30s - some of the lowest of his entire presidency. At first blush, the numbers would indicate that his political prospects have been mortally wounded. A deeper dive, however, paints a less dire picture for the ex-president. While Democrats, independents and some moderate Republicans are against him, his Republican base appears to be intact. Read Anthony's analysis of what Trump's future looks like. After the riot at the US Capitol, videos of Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman luring the mob away from the Senate chambers - and possibly saving lawmakers' lives - went viral. Several members of Congress have since credited his quick thinking for distracting the rioters, and called him a hero. Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House introduced a bill to award Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal. Today, another bipartisan group - in the Senate - is proposing identical legislation. The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded to Americans who have made ""distinguished achievements and contributions"" to their country. Lawmakers are showing their gratitude on social media, sharing pictures with Goodman. On Wednesday, he escorted Vice-President Kamala Harris to her inauguration ceremony. Allow Twitter content?

Despite fears of conservative mobs following the riot at the Capitol, it has actually been left-wing protesters who have clashed with police in the days before and after Biden's inauguration. On the day Biden was inaugurated this week, demonstrators carrying anti-Biden and anti-police signs marched in Portland and smashed the windows of the Democratic Party of Oregon. Psaki told reporters: ""Certainly we had our team on the ground, our national security team, even before 12:01, early in the morning on Inauguration Day because we wanted to be able to monitor events happening across the country and any unrest that was resulting from the last couple of weeks."" ""I haven't spoke with him specifically about those events but it is something our national security team... is closely monitoring of course, but if we have an additional update I'm happy to provide it to you."" Conservative news outlets criticised Psaki for not taking the opportunity to condemn radical left-wing groups, such as antifa. Protests continued on Thursday, the first full day of the Biden presidency. Demonstrations, and sometimes rioting, have recurred in Seattle and Portland in the months since the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May. The Biden administration is causing confusion over whether it believes China has engaged in the genocide of its minority Uighur population White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not commit to calling alleged rights abuses by the Chinese government against the minority Uighur population a genocide during the briefing earlier. ""The president has spoken before to the horrific treatment of Uighurs but I don't have anything more for you on it,"" she told reporters. ""I can check with our national security team and see if we have a more up-to-date statement."" The response prompted questions as earlier this week, Biden's Secretary of State nominee Anthony Blinken confirmed that he agreed with the Trump administration assessment that China had engaged in genocide. And, during the election last year, the Biden campaign also called the situation ""unspeakable oppression"" and ""genocide"". Need a bit more context? China has faced global criticism over its alleged persecution of the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group living mostly in the north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang. It is believed that the Chinese government has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as ""re-education camps"". The government has also been accused of forcibly sterilising Uighur women, which it denies. After initially denying the existence of these camps, China now says they were a necessary measure against separatist violence in Xinjiang. Read more about China and the Uighurs here. The president said the US death toll from the coronavirus could shoot up by another 200,000 with or without action from the government. ""A lot of America is hurting,"" said Biden. ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" According to the Johns Hopkins University, 412,239 American lives have now been lost to the virus. Making his case in the White House before he signed two executive orders to provide pandemic relief, Biden  said: ""We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act."" In his final hours in office, Donald Trump issued dozens of pardons. Several of those charged in the Capitol riots hoped they would receive pardons, but none came. A lawyer for the so-called QAnon Shaman - the Viking-like invader whose image ricocheted around the world - is speaking out now about the snub. In what appears to be some kind of media offensive, attorney Al Watkins has told various local media outlets that his client Jake Angeli was âdupedâ by the words and actions of President Trump. âMr. Chansley, along with many others who were similarly situated, are now compelled to reconcile a betrayal by a man whose back they felt they had for years,â said Watkins. Chansley, 33, called the FBI the day after the riot to say he had been there âat the request of the president that all âpatriotsâ come to DC on January 6, 2021.â He has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct. The president has apologised that some members of the National Guard drafted to protect the capital from violence were forced to sleep in a garage this week. He also called on the National Guard Bureau chief to say sorry to the soldiers, who had been asked to leave the Congressional buildings. Pictures of the troops sleeping in the unheated car park provoked outrage on Thursday, with some state governors calling their soldiers home. On Friday Biden's wife First Lady Jill Biden visited some of the National Guard to thank them for their work and hand out cookies. Around 7,000 soldiers are expected to remain in Washington until mid-March, with the other 18,000 leaving in the coming weeks. They were posted to the city after violent pro-Trump supporters stormed Congress on 6 January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reacting to today's news, that the House will send Trump's impeachment article to the Senate on Monday, setting up his trial to begin Tuesday, Biden had this to say: ""I havenât heard the detail of it,"" he says. ""The more time we have to get up and running to meet these crises, the better."" His answer seemed to hint that he preferred the Republican timeline offer, which would have seen the trial pushed back until early February to give both sides to prepare. The now-viral photo of Bernie Sanders at Joe Biden's inauguration There's little sign that the Bernie Sanders meme from Biden's inauguration is going away. You'd be forgiven for thinking that the 79-year-old Senator was the star of the show on Wednesday after pictures of him wrapped up in a practical coat and woollen mittens went viral. Now Sanders' team have announced you can buy a jumper showing the meme to raise money for charity. TheChairman Sanders Crewneck is on sale for $45,external(Â£33), with all proceeds going to Meals on Wheels in Vermont, where Sanders lives. ""Due to overwhelming demand for this item, it will be 3-6 weeks until you receive your sweatshirt,"" the website warns. About the viral photo, Sanders said on Thursday, âI was just sitting there, trying to keep warm, trying to pay attention to what was going on.â Sanders has been appointed chairman of the powerful Senate Budget Committee. President Biden says, if the US government does not act ""decisively and boldly"" now, it will cause a lot of pain. ""We're in a national emergency,"" said Biden. ""We need to act like we're in a national emergency."" The executive orders that the president is signing today aim to expand access to food aid for low-income families and protect federal workers. He reiterated the sentiments previously expressed by other members of the administration, noting that more needs to be done because ""a lot of America is hurting"". He urged action from Congress on his $1.9tn Covid rescue package, warning that that there was no time to waste. ""I don't believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs. I believe Americans are going hungry and losing jobs."" The president says the first part of his plan is to ""get direct financial relief"" to those who need it most. ""With our American rescue plan, the economy would return to full employment a year sooner,"" Biden says. He adds that the administration is going to ""finish the job"" of getting a total of $2,000 (Â£1,450) in economic payments out to the people. ""If we fail to act, there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures,"" he adds. ""because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months."" ""This would overwhelm emergency shelters,"" he says, adding that displaced Americans will be at a higher risk of catching coronavirus if they are forced to live in places where they are unable to social distance. Biden is now speaking from the White House about his plans to take the US out of the economic recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. ""If we don't act - the rest of the world is not standing still,"" Biden says, warning: ""We need more action and we need to move fast.""  Earlier, we reported that former President Trump's impeachment trial is poised to begin next week, as the House submits the charge against him to the Senate. Watch the moment Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer announced the news of Trump's upcoming ""full and fair trial"" - and see Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell's response - below. This video can not be played Schumer: Trump will have a 'full and fair trial' It's day two of the Biden administration and the new president is already facing some pushback. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit over a decision to halt most deportations from the US for 100 days, saying the administration is in violation of an agreement with the state signed under President Trump. That agreement from 31 December says that the federal government must discuss immigration matters with the state and provide six months' notice before enacting policy changes. Ending it requires 180 days' notice. Paxton argued the state would face ""irreparable harm"" if the moratorium went through, Reuters news agency reported. The White House has declined to comment on the matter. The White House has just put out a statement marking the 48th anniversary of Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court decision that essentially legalised the right to abortion. ""In the past four years, reproductive health, including the right to choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack,""the statement from Biden and Harris begins,external. They go on to say they are committed to ""codifying"" the judgement, which means pass legislation through Congress that enshrines abortion access into law. They will also appoint judges who will support abortion access, they say. Trump, during his time in office, was able to give the Supreme Court a conservative majority, making anti-abortion activists hopeful that Roe v Wade could eventually be overturned. Biden was the only candidate during the primary to say he endorsed the so-called Hyde Amendment, which says that no federal funds can go towards abortions. After nearly all 22 other candidates came out against the Hyde Amendment, he reversed his stance. Although abortion is technically legal across the US, multiple states have instituted laws that make it nearly impossible in practice. Abortion activists hope that a law would make it more difficult for local governments to restrict access. President Biden will make a call to another foreign leader later today: Mexican president AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. The call was first announced on Twitter by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard ""The bilateral relationship moves forward with communication and understanding,"" said Ebrard. It will be Biden's second foreign call of the day. He will also speak to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The White House says it will provide readouts of the two calls later in the day. The BBC's North America Editor Jon Sopel asks about the prospects for a free trade deal between the US and UK. Is it months or years away? Just yesterday, Janet Yellen - the former head of the US central bank who's now in line to be treasury secretary - said Biden would not be signing any new deals because his priority right now is on domestic economy and infrastructure. ""I can't give you any timeline,"" press secretary Jen Psaki begins. She goes on to say that trade agreements that benefit American families are ""certainly"" being considered. ""At this point in time we're working to get the pandemic under control [and] provide economic relief to the American public,"" she says. Joe Biden's administration is making it a priority to address domestic extremism, press secretary Jen Psaki announced a few minutes ago. It comes after the violent attack on the Capitol on 6 January in which hundreds of pro-Trump Americans stormed Congress. Many are believed to have subscribed to extremist views after viewing radical material online. On Friday, the White House requested a ""comprehensive threat assessment about domestic violent extremism"" from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. The Capitol riot underscored ""what we have long known - the rise of domestic extremism is a serious and growing national security threat"", Psaki said. She underlined that the president aims to increase communication and the sharing of information between the agencies tracking the threat. Read about the Capitol arrests. Â© 2025 BBC.

It was a busy Friday as the new president spent his second full day in the top job:  Thanks for reading our live coverage. It was brought to you by Sam Cabral, Penny Spiller, Max Matza, Georgina Rannard, Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady and Alix Kroeger. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The future for Trump - and the political movement he rode to victory in 2016 - is murky. Over his career, he has been declared dead more times than Freddy Krueger and has always managed to wriggle free. Until now. In the days following the US Capitol riot, Trump's overall public approval rating precipitously dropped to the mid-30s - some of the lowest of his entire presidency. At first blush, the numbers would indicate that his political prospects have been mortally wounded. A deeper dive, however, paints a less dire picture for the ex-president. While Democrats, independents and some moderate Republicans are against him, his Republican base appears to be intact. Read Anthony's analysis of what Trump's future looks like. After the riot at the US Capitol, videos of Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman luring the mob away from the Senate chambers - and possibly saving lawmakers' lives - went viral. Several members of Congress have since credited his quick thinking for distracting the rioters, and called him a hero. Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House introduced a bill to award Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal. Today, another bipartisan group - in the Senate - is proposing identical legislation. The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded to Americans who have made ""distinguished achievements and contributions"" to their country. Lawmakers are showing their gratitude on social media, sharing pictures with Goodman. On Wednesday, he escorted Vice-President Kamala Harris to her inauguration ceremony. Allow Twitter content?

Here's why so many people think Goodman may have saved lives. Twice as many Americans have searched on Google for information about the impeachment of Joe Biden, compared to Donald Trump, in the last 24 hours. Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory,filed articles of impeachment against the new president yesterday,external. Greene accuses Biden of bribery and other abuses of power, citing unproven claims that the president used his official capacity to help his son's business dealings in Ukraine. She announced this on Twitter in a short video which now has nearly 10 million views. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Greene has been widely condemned, and even banned temporarily from Twitter, for spreading false information about the US election results. Filing articles of impeachment does not indicate action on behalf of Congress. Any representative can file articles of impeachment. In fact, Texas Democrat Al Green tried and failed three times against Donald Trump. However, as indicated by Google Trends, her efforts have clearly gained the attention of many Americans. One might think that more would be searching for news on ""Trump impeachment"" after the announcement by Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor on Friday. He announced the second impeachment trial of former President Trump would begin next week. But that is not the case.

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates throughout the day. Our coverage was brought to you by: James Clarke, Martha Buckley, Becky Morton, George Bowden, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Katie Wright, Gavin Stamp, Lucy Webster and Francesca Gillett. It's been another fairly busy day for coronavirus news, with Boris Johnson giving a press conference earlier. Here's a recap of the top headlines: People who drove 20 miles and then queued for two hours to get fresh milk from a farm's vending machine have been fined for breaching lockdown rules. The farmers who own the vending machine, Einion and Elliw Jones, in Trelogan near Holywell, say they feel North Wales Police have got ""it in for us"". They said even people living nearby were facing being fined, despite the force accepting milk was ""an essential item"". In Wales Covid  rules tell people to ""stay at home"" except for essential reasons, which include buying food. Welsh government guidance on the rules says there are no limits on how far people can travel to shop for essential items, but urge people to stay as ""local to your home as possible"". Ms Jones said some customers from ""just down the road"" in Trelawnyd and Mostyn had even been told they shouldn't be there. The police said the farm was working with the local council to ensure it was ""Covid-compliant surrounding queuing, social distancing etc"". There's more on this story here. New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. There is some evidence that the one that has become dominant in the UK may be associated with a higher degree of mortality, says PM Boris Johnson. Scientists are urgently studying these mutated versions to understand what threat they pose. So how worrying are the new UK, South Africa and Brazil coronavirus variants? The BBC's Michelle Roberts has a look at the evidencehere. Former tennis world number oneAndy Murray will miss the Australian Open having failed to find a ""workable quarantine""as he recovers from coronavirus. The 33-year-old Briton was set to fly out to Melbourne last week, but was not allowed to travel on a charter flight after being found to have Covid-19. The Victorian state government has put in place strict measures to allow players to fly into the country for the tournament, which starts on 8 February. Murray says: ""Gutted to share that I won't be flying out to Australia to compete at the Australian Open. ""We've been in constant dialogue with Tennis Australia to try and find a solution which would allow some form of workable quarantine, but we couldn't make it work. The famous Rovers Return pub on the set of Coronation Street ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are both seeing their filming schedules hit by the pandemic. An ITV spokeswoman confirms Emmerdale stopped filming last week after some members of the team tested positive for Covid-19. She adds they will return to filming on Monday. Meanwhile, Coronation Street will pause filming for two weeks on Monday ""to undertake some rewriting of stories and scripts as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic"". However, the break will not affect its TV schedule and the show will still be on six times a week, a statement adds. The news that the new variant of coronavirus may be more deadly is ""deeply alarming,"" said the shadow health secretary, ""not least
because Boris Johnson assured the nation back in December there was no evidence
the variant was more dangerous."" Jonathan Ashworth said: âWe urge
ministers to go further and faster on vaccination rollout now to save lives,
and introduce proper financial support for those needing to isolate to help
breaks chains of transmission.â  This video can not be played Covid: Wedding party in Stamford Hill broken up by police One of today's top stories about coronavirus in the UK has been police discovering people gathered at a wedding party in north London last night. Originally the police said 400 people had attended - but they have now revised that number down to 150. In a statement, the Met Police said: ""Although
initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now
believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" The organisers of the wedding party - which was held at a strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school in Stamford Hill - face fines. The Met said one organiser would be reported for consideration of a Â£10,000 fine while five other attendees were issued with Â£200 fixed penalty notices. ""This afternoon, an investigation has been launched to identify those others responsible for organising and who attended the wedding,"" the Met added. Read the full story here. There is still âa lot of uncertaintyâ about just how severe
the new UK variant is, according to another of the government's scientific advisers. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government's Scientific
Advisory Group on Emergencies, said the figures given during the Downing Street briefing suggested an increase of something like
30 to 40% in terms of mortality which âreally ties in with what weâre seeing in
the hospitalsâ. Speaking to Radio 4âs PM programme, he said: âIt is
obviously a blow. We were rather hoping that this virus was going to be quite
genetically stable. âThe realisation that this virus is capable of relatively
fast mutation and development of new variantsâ¦ has been a bit of a setback for
us.â Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent With new variants emerging in
different parts of the world, itâs worth highlighting Boris Johnsonâs comments
about borders. It seems pretty clear ministers are considering more
restrictions on people coming into the UK â to stop those variants coming into
the UK if possible. In the PMâs words, the UK may have to further to âprotect
our bordersâ. Reality Check Itâs impossible to say
exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being
in contact with someone who has tested positive, however
some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from
September suggests just 10.9% of peopleremained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report
when arguing people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it
suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do âto go to workâ. Most people reported going out for
things such as shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they
needed to quarantine as they didnât develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done
before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of
just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies (Sage) has also highlighted research that shows most peopleappear to be following the rules,external. This research also suggests those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate
than those better off. - By Ben Butcher Friday's coronavirus briefing was led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was joined by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser. Here's what they told us: Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether delaying the second vaccine dose risks creating more resistant variants of the virus. Patrick Vallance says the riskiest thing in terms of new mutations is high prevalence in the community. He says the mutations currently circulating came about naturally due to transmission - but adds there is always ""some risk"" when there is partial immunity. But he says that partial immunity also provides benefits in terms of protection for the most vulnerable. Chris Whitty says, ""Our overall view was that the balance of risks was in favour of having many more people in the UK vaccinated."" On support for businesses and jobs, the PM says the government will ""do what it takes"" to support livelihoods. And with that, he ends today's No 10 briefing. Asked whether the British public are
ready for lockdown to stay in place for a long time, the prime minister says we will have
to live with coronavirus for âa long while to comeâ but it is an open question ""when and in what way"" we can start to relax restrictions. He says it depends on the vaccine rollout going well, getting
case numbers down and whether there are discoveries of any more variants. That doesnât mean that ""Iâm not optimistic"" about the rollout of the vaccine, he says, âbut at this stage you
really have to be very cautious indeedâ. He adds that the first thing that the government wants to open is
schools, which is a priority. Patrick Vallance says he expects the virus âto be around, probably, forever"" but it is going to be controlled. However, he says it is a very different outlook with
increasing numbers of treatments and vaccines, but the key is ânot getting too
hooked up on specific datesâ. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The new variant has been causing
concern in government for a number of weeks. Now the scientists believe there
is some early evidence it could be causing slightly higher mortality â when you
look at everyone testing positive. The overall message from the prime minister
is pretty bleak, Iâm afraid; that the terrible death figures weâve seen in
recent days will continue for a while. We donât seem to heading for a tighter
lockdown in England because the PM believes the current measures are the right
ones if people follow them. But there was a clear message there that we canât
start unlocking society until the rates come down significantly â weâre in this
for a while. The Daily Telegraph's Gordon Raynor raises a video he says has been posted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock aimed at travel agents, suggesting the South African variant is 50% less susceptible to vaccines than the original strain of the virus. He asks whether this is correct and, if so, whether it will affect the government's approach to whether to tighten UK border controls. The PM runs through the measures that the UK has in place, including the ban on direct flights from South Africa and ""rigorous"" obligations for people entering the UK in terms of quarantine and tests. But he suggests ""we may need to go further to protect our borders"", saying the massive progress the UK is making in terms of vaccinations cannot be undermined.  Sky News's Sam Coates asks whether, if the new variant is more dangerous, it is right that more people are ""out and about"" during the current lockdown than the first one last year. The PM says that ""we are enforcing the law very strictly with increasing toughness"", meaning increased fines to dissuade risky behaviour. ""It depends on everybody doing the right thing and avoiding transmission,"" he says, adding that is  what will be more effective than police action. On why the new variant may be transmitting more readily, Sir Patrick Vallance says it is not believed the new variant has a higher viral load, meaning people ""shed more virus"". He suggests it may be other factors that make it more transmissible. On the current infection rate, Chris Whitty says that while infections are slowly going down ""it is at a very, very high level"". He says that among some age groups - including those 20 to 30 - infections may still be increasing. And on hospitalisations, he says that they are ""broadly flat"" for the UK as a whole, but there are variations between regions. ""That peak is not yet definitely going down yet,"" he says. Deaths will be delayed further with the peak expected in the future, he adds. This video can not be played Infection level 'very, very high' and 'extremely precarious' - Prof Whitty The next question asks about whether the UK variant means
lockdown restrictions will last longer. The prime minister says he thinks the country has âthe right package of
measuresâ to deal with the new variant and people need to comply with them. He says there are signs in the data that infections are
flattening, although the rates are still âvery highâ so the government âcanât begin
to consider unlockingâ. The vaccination programme could change this, he says, but the
UK is in a position where cases are so high that unlocking could lead to âa big
reboundâ. Asked whether the South African variant is in the UK, Patrick
Vallance says some cases have been detected but he says the key thing is to try to contain it. He adds that âthere is no evidenceâ that the South African or
Brazilian variants have transmission advantages over the variants already in
the UK and so having cases here doesnât mean âthey will take offâ. Now we move on to questions from journalists, the first of which is from the BBC's health editor, Hugh Pym. In light of the information about the danger posed by the new variant, he asks the PM whether he expects the current death trends to rise more steeply and then fall more slowly. In response, the PM says there was a big surge in deaths over the Christmas period which is continuing and he sadly believes this will continue to be so ""for a while to come"". Prof Whitty says the ""shape of the curve"" is driven by the rate of infections, which has been going up and is now coming down. Sir Patrick says the death numbers are ""awful"" and are likely to continue at current levels for some while, saying this is what was predicted for some time. In response to a separate question about evidence emerging from Israel that the Pfizer-BioTech vaccine might not be as effective as first thought, Sir Patrick says there needs to be further research but overall the efficacy of the approved vaccines is proven. The second question from a member of the public comes from Sally, from Oxfordshire, who asks whether those who have been vaccinated are allowed to mix together with others who have had a jab. Chris Whitty says that - even with the very effective vaccines - there is a period of time straight after a jab ""where there is no effect"". He says people won't see protection for around two to three weeks following their vaccination - and even then ""that protection will not be complete"". He says a large proportion of people in the community have currently got the virus - ""so the risk is if you have the vaccine you still have some residual risk"". Whitty adds that the lockdown is helping to get the rates of infection right down - to allow those who have been vaccinated more protection. ""Over time, the answer will be yes - but at this point in time the answer will be no,"" he says. Sir Patrick Vallance adds there is uncertainty around the vaccine's role in preventing transmission of the virus. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates throughout the day. Our coverage was brought to you by: James Clarke, Martha Buckley, Becky Morton, George Bowden, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Katie Wright, Gavin Stamp, Lucy Webster and Francesca Gillett. It's been another fairly busy day for coronavirus news, with Boris Johnson giving a press conference earlier. Here's a recap of the top headlines: People who drove 20 miles and then queued for two hours to get fresh milk from a farm's vending machine have been fined for breaching lockdown rules. The farmers who own the vending machine, Einion and Elliw Jones, in Trelogan near Holywell, say they feel North Wales Police have got ""it in for us"". They said even people living nearby were facing being fined, despite the force accepting milk was ""an essential item"". In Wales Covid  rules tell people to ""stay at home"" except for essential reasons, which include buying food. Welsh government guidance on the rules says there are no limits on how far people can travel to shop for essential items, but urge people to stay as ""local to your home as possible"". Ms Jones said some customers from ""just down the road"" in Trelawnyd and Mostyn had even been told they shouldn't be there. The police said the farm was working with the local council to ensure it was ""Covid-compliant surrounding queuing, social distancing etc"". There's more on this story here. New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. There is some evidence that the one that has become dominant in the UK may be associated with a higher degree of mortality, says PM Boris Johnson. Scientists are urgently studying these mutated versions to understand what threat they pose. So how worrying are the new UK, South Africa and Brazil coronavirus variants? The BBC's Michelle Roberts has a look at the evidencehere. Former tennis world number oneAndy Murray will miss the Australian Open having failed to find a ""workable quarantine""as he recovers from coronavirus. The 33-year-old Briton was set to fly out to Melbourne last week, but was not allowed to travel on a charter flight after being found to have Covid-19. The Victorian state government has put in place strict measures to allow players to fly into the country for the tournament, which starts on 8 February. Murray says: ""Gutted to share that I won't be flying out to Australia to compete at the Australian Open. ""We've been in constant dialogue with Tennis Australia to try and find a solution which would allow some form of workable quarantine, but we couldn't make it work. The famous Rovers Return pub on the set of Coronation Street ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are both seeing their filming schedules hit by the pandemic. An ITV spokeswoman confirms Emmerdale stopped filming last week after some members of the team tested positive for Covid-19. She adds they will return to filming on Monday. Meanwhile, Coronation Street will pause filming for two weeks on Monday ""to undertake some rewriting of stories and scripts as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic"". However, the break will not affect its TV schedule and the show will still be on six times a week, a statement adds. The news that the new variant of coronavirus may be more deadly is ""deeply alarming,"" said the shadow health secretary, ""not least

Originally the police said 400 people had attended - but they have now revised that number down to 150. In a statement, the Met Police said: ""Although
initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now
believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" The organisers of the wedding party - which was held at a strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school in Stamford Hill - face fines. The Met said one organiser would be reported for consideration of a Â£10,000 fine while five other attendees were issued with Â£200 fixed penalty notices. ""This afternoon, an investigation has been launched to identify those others responsible for organising and who attended the wedding,"" the Met added. Read the full story here.

the new UK variant is, according to another of the government's scientific advisers. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government's Scientific
Advisory Group on Emergencies, said the figures given during the Downing Street briefing suggested an increase of something like
30 to 40% in terms of mortality which âreally ties in with what weâre seeing in
the hospitalsâ. Speaking to Radio 4âs PM programme, he said: âIt is
obviously a blow. We were rather hoping that this virus was going to be quite
genetically stable. âThe realisation that this virus is capable of relatively
fast mutation and development of new variantsâ¦ has been a bit of a setback for
us.â Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent With new variants emerging in
different parts of the world, itâs worth highlighting Boris Johnsonâs comments
about borders. It seems pretty clear ministers are considering more
restrictions on people coming into the UK â to stop those variants coming into
the UK if possible. In the PMâs words, the UK may have to further to âprotect
our bordersâ. Reality Check Itâs impossible to say
exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being
in contact with someone who has tested positive, however
some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from
September suggests just 10.9% of peopleremained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report
when arguing people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it
suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do âto go to workâ. Most people reported going out for
things such as shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they
needed to quarantine as they didnât develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done
before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of
just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies (Sage) has also highlighted research that shows most peopleappear to be following the rules,external. This research also suggests those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate
than those better off. - By Ben Butcher Friday's coronavirus briefing was led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was joined by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser. Here's what they told us: Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether delaying the second vaccine dose risks creating more resistant variants of the virus. Patrick Vallance says the riskiest thing in terms of new mutations is high prevalence in the community. He says the mutations currently circulating came about naturally due to transmission - but adds there is always ""some risk"" when there is partial immunity. But he says that partial immunity also provides benefits in terms of protection for the most vulnerable. Chris Whitty says, ""Our overall view was that the balance of risks was in favour of having many more people in the UK vaccinated."" On support for businesses and jobs, the PM says the government will ""do what it takes"" to support livelihoods. And with that, he ends today's No 10 briefing. Asked whether the British public are
ready for lockdown to stay in place for a long time, the prime minister says we will have
to live with coronavirus for âa long while to comeâ but it is an open question ""when and in what way"" we can start to relax restrictions. He says it depends on the vaccine rollout going well, getting
case numbers down and whether there are discoveries of any more variants. That doesnât mean that ""Iâm not optimistic"" about the rollout of the vaccine, he says, âbut at this stage you
really have to be very cautious indeedâ. He adds that the first thing that the government wants to open is
schools, which is a priority. Patrick Vallance says he expects the virus âto be around, probably, forever"" but it is going to be controlled. However, he says it is a very different outlook with
increasing numbers of treatments and vaccines, but the key is ânot getting too
hooked up on specific datesâ. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The new variant has been causing
concern in government for a number of weeks. Now the scientists believe there
is some early evidence it could be causing slightly higher mortality â when you
look at everyone testing positive. The overall message from the prime minister
is pretty bleak, Iâm afraid; that the terrible death figures weâve seen in
recent days will continue for a while. We donât seem to heading for a tighter
lockdown in England because the PM believes the current measures are the right
ones if people follow them. But there was a clear message there that we canât
start unlocking society until the rates come down significantly â weâre in this
for a while. The Daily Telegraph's Gordon Raynor raises a video he says has been posted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock aimed at travel agents, suggesting the South African variant is 50% less susceptible to vaccines than the original strain of the virus. He asks whether this is correct and, if so, whether it will affect the government's approach to whether to tighten UK border controls. The PM runs through the measures that the UK has in place, including the ban on direct flights from South Africa and ""rigorous"" obligations for people entering the UK in terms of quarantine and tests. But he suggests ""we may need to go further to protect our borders"", saying the massive progress the UK is making in terms of vaccinations cannot be undermined.  Sky News's Sam Coates asks whether, if the new variant is more dangerous, it is right that more people are ""out and about"" during the current lockdown than the first one last year. The PM says that ""we are enforcing the law very strictly with increasing toughness"", meaning increased fines to dissuade risky behaviour. ""It depends on everybody doing the right thing and avoiding transmission,"" he says, adding that is  what will be more effective than police action. On why the new variant may be transmitting more readily, Sir Patrick Vallance says it is not believed the new variant has a higher viral load, meaning people ""shed more virus"". He suggests it may be other factors that make it more transmissible. On the current infection rate, Chris Whitty says that while infections are slowly going down ""it is at a very, very high level"". He says that among some age groups - including those 20 to 30 - infections may still be increasing. And on hospitalisations, he says that they are ""broadly flat"" for the UK as a whole, but there are variations between regions. ""That peak is not yet definitely going down yet,"" he says. Deaths will be delayed further with the peak expected in the future, he adds. This video can not be played Infection level 'very, very high' and 'extremely precarious' - Prof Whitty The next question asks about whether the UK variant means
lockdown restrictions will last longer. The prime minister says he thinks the country has âthe right package of
measuresâ to deal with the new variant and people need to comply with them. He says there are signs in the data that infections are
flattening, although the rates are still âvery highâ so the government âcanât begin
to consider unlockingâ. The vaccination programme could change this, he says, but the
UK is in a position where cases are so high that unlocking could lead to âa big
reboundâ. Asked whether the South African variant is in the UK, Patrick
Vallance says some cases have been detected but he says the key thing is to try to contain it. He adds that âthere is no evidenceâ that the South African or
Brazilian variants have transmission advantages over the variants already in
the UK and so having cases here doesnât mean âthey will take offâ. Now we move on to questions from journalists, the first of which is from the BBC's health editor, Hugh Pym. In light of the information about the danger posed by the new variant, he asks the PM whether he expects the current death trends to rise more steeply and then fall more slowly. In response, the PM says there was a big surge in deaths over the Christmas period which is continuing and he sadly believes this will continue to be so ""for a while to come"". Prof Whitty says the ""shape of the curve"" is driven by the rate of infections, which has been going up and is now coming down. Sir Patrick says the death numbers are ""awful"" and are likely to continue at current levels for some while, saying this is what was predicted for some time. In response to a separate question about evidence emerging from Israel that the Pfizer-BioTech vaccine might not be as effective as first thought, Sir Patrick says there needs to be further research but overall the efficacy of the approved vaccines is proven. The second question from a member of the public comes from Sally, from Oxfordshire, who asks whether those who have been vaccinated are allowed to mix together with others who have had a jab. Chris Whitty says that - even with the very effective vaccines - there is a period of time straight after a jab ""where there is no effect"". He says people won't see protection for around two to three weeks following their vaccination - and even then ""that protection will not be complete"". He says a large proportion of people in the community have currently got the virus - ""so the risk is if you have the vaccine you still have some residual risk"". Whitty adds that the lockdown is helping to get the rates of infection right down - to allow those who have been vaccinated more protection. ""Over time, the answer will be yes - but at this point in time the answer will be no,"" he says. Sir Patrick Vallance adds there is uncertainty around the vaccine's role in preventing transmission of the virus. Â© 2025 BBC.

Men jailed for killing 39 migrants in lorryThirty-nine Vietnamese migrants suffocated in a sealed container en route to Essex in October 2019.,"The 39 people who died in the back of a trailer as it crossed the North Sea between Zeebrugge and the UK Four men have been jailed for the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese migrants found dead in a lorry trailer in Essex. The migrants died ""excruciatingly painful"" deaths, having suffocated in the container en route from Belgium to Purfleet in October 2019, a judge said. Ronan Hughes, 41, and Gheorghe Nica, 43, played ""leading roles"" in the smuggling conspiracy and were jailed for 20 and 27 years respectively. At the Old Bailey, two lorry drivers were also jailed for manslaughter. [Left to right] Eamonn Harrison, Ronan Hughes, Gheorghe Nica and Maurice Robinson were all jailed for manslaughter Eamonn Harrison, 24, who towed the trailer to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge before their journey to the UK, was sentenced to 18 years. Maurice Robinson, 26, was given 13 years and four months, having collected the trailer and opened it in an industrial estate to find the migrants dead. The supposed 'VIP' journey that killed 39 people Three others members of the people-smuggling gang were also sentenced for conspiracy to facilitate unlawful immigration. Christopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, was jailed for seven years; Valentin Calota, 38, of Birmingham, for four-and-a-half years; and Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, was given a three-year sentence. [Left to right] Valentin Calota, Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga and Christopher Kennedy were also sentenced on Friday Sentencing,external, Mr Justice Sweeney said: ""I have no doubt that the conspiracy was a sophisticated, long-running and profitable one to smuggle mainly Vietnamese people across the channel."" He said on the fatal trip the temperature had been rising along with the carbon dioxide levels throughout, hitting 40C (104F) while the container was at sea on 22 October 2019. ""There were desperate attempts to contact the outside world by phone and to break through the roof of the container,"" the judge said. ""All were to no avail and, before the ship reached Purfleet, [the victims] all died in what must have been an excruciatingly painful death."" This video can not be played Video evidence showed how the trainer containing 39 Vietnamese migrants made its way to the UK The victims had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof but only managed to dent the interior. The court heard some of their final desperate phone messages, including one where a man spoke with ragged breaths as he apologised to his family. ""I can't breathe,"" he said. ""I want to come back to my family. Have a good life."" Justice Sweeney added: ""The willingness of the victims to try and enter the country illegally provides no excuse for what happened to them."" The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October 2019 During the trial, jurors were given a snapshot of the victims - who included a bricklayer, a university graduate and a nail bar technician - and their dreams of a better life. Many of their families borrowed heavily to fund their passage, relying on their potential future earnings once they got into the UK. The father of Nguyen Huy Tung, one of two 15-year-olds in the container, laterlearned of his son's death via social media. Harrison, of Newry, County Down, claimed he did not know there were people in the trailer when he towed it to the Belgian port, and that he watched ""a wee bit of Netflix"" in bed as they were loaded on. After receiving this message from his boss, Robinson got out of his cab, opened the trailer door and discovered the bodies Robinson, from County Armagh, collected the trailer when it arrived on UK shores just after midnight on 23 October. His boss, Hughes, had messaged him: ""Give them air quickly don't let them out."" Robinson gave a thumbs-up in reply. When Robinson stopped on a nearby industrial estate, he found that the migrants were all dead. His barrister said Robinson, who admitted manslaughter, being part of the trafficking plot and money laundering, was ""horrified by what he saw"". The moment lorry driver Maurice Robinson opened the trailer door and discovered the bodies inside was captured on CCTV The trial examined three smuggling attempts by the gang - two that were successful on 11 and 18 October, and the final trip on 23 October. On all three runs, Nica, of Basildon, Essex, had arranged cars and a van to transport the migrants at the UK end. When Robinson discovered the bodies, there was a series of telephone conversations between him and Nica and Hughes, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, before the driver eventually dialled 999. In his evidence, Nica said Robinson told him: ""I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Ronan Hughes (left) met Gheorghe Nica at a budget hotel in Thurrock, Essex While Hughes admitted manslaughter, both Nica and Harrison were convicted by a jury. Mr Justice Sweeney said that in the conspiracy ""two played leading roles, namely - in order of importance - Hughes and Nica"". He accepted Hughes was ""not at the very top of the conspiracy"" but said his role was ""pivotal... in that he ran a haulage business and supplied the trailers and drivers used to transport the migrants"". The judge said Nica ""recruited and paid the drivers whose job it was to collect the migrants when they reached the drop-off site in this country and to drive them to the safe house(s) where they were to be held until payment"". He added at the top of the conspiracy was a Vietnamese man called ""Fong"", who was based in London. Mr Justice Sweeney told the defendants jailed for manslaughter they would serve two-thirds of the term in custody, instead of the usual half. Earlier this month, Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Barclay Road, Tottenham, north London, was sentenced, havingadmitted his limited role in the people-smuggling operation. It was accepted he was not a member of the organised crime group behind the smuggling operation. Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten said: ""May this serve as a warning to those who think it's OK to prey on the vulnerabilities of migrants and their families, transporting them in a way worse than we would transport animals. ""My message to you is that we will find you and we will stop you."" He said the victims died in an ""unimaginable way, because of the utter greed of these criminals"".

Is flooding down to Wales' mining past?,"The water is warmer than the air and is creating a mist along Dynevor Road The coalmining heritage of Wales has been implicated in flooding of homes - but what has happened in Skewen? About80 people were evacuatedfrom the Neath Port Talbot village, with at least eight streets left under water. Council leader Rob Jones says the flood appears to be related to mine works - but the volume of water involved has hampered a full assessment so far. The Coal Authority is investigating how ""historic underground mining features"" in the area exacerbated the problem. A geologist says there are tens of thousands of old mine shafts across the former south Wales coalfield and it is ""incredibly difficult"" to monitor them all. Skewen lies within an old coal mining hotspot, with several former colliery sites near the village that operated in the 19th and early 20th Century. There were colliery sites near what is now Drummau Road, in the north of the village and another close to Old Road, near Neath Abbey. Skewen was part of a collection of collieries that stretched between Neath and Llanelli on the western side of south Wales' coalfield. Graham Levins, secretary of the Welsh Mines Preservation Trust, said old mines often contain groundwater which can flood in heavy rain. Financial help offered to flood victims Storm Christoph: Flood warnings and homes evacuated Storm Christoph in pictures Storm Christoph floods tracked by satellite radar He said: ""A lot of them go very, very deep down, much below the local water level and that's why they had all the big wheels to pump the water out. ""It fills up with water and will find a way out. Normally rainfall you get it doesn't cause a lot of problems but when you get really heavy rain, the water drains down through the ground and builds up."" Streets were turned into rivers in Skewen Geologist Tom Backhouse said water was coming out of an area near the junction of Goshen Park and Drummau Road, where there is a record of a mine shaft dating from the turn of the 20th Century. It then started ""rushing down"" Drummau Road, causing the flooding that forced evacuations. ""What we can expect to have happened is that the water level in the mines rose to a point where it's burst out of that entry point from the mine workings below. ""Also, there are images of very ochre like orange-coloured water and again, that may well be issuing from the mine workings on the highlands to the east of the property on the hill behind. ""That may be where the shallow workings have flooded."" He said old mine working across the former coalfield area hold water at a certain depth, but when an event such as Storm Christoph drops ""a huge amount in a small area"", the levels rise quickly. ""As it gets closer and closer to the surface, it basically looks for an escape, the pressure builds up,"" he continued. ""What it looks like has happened on the junction of Goshen Park and Drummau Road, where the mine shaft is recorded, is that pressure has built up at that point and then burst out through the shaft which is very likely to have been capped with wood or something like that. ""Where you've got those mine shafts, which ultimately are vertical tunnels down into the mine workings below, the water has literally forced itself up through that shaft, and the pressure is obviously so great it's caused this devastating flash flood."" As well as properties, vehicles were submerged in water There are about 13 shafts recorded within about 820ft (250m) of the one in Goshen Park, so Mr Backhouse said it is possible more than one may have burst. There are tens of thousands in south Wales and he said it was ""incredibly difficult"" to check them all, but there were ""tell tale signs"" as to why they may collapse such as age or what type of developments are around them. The clean up has continued on Friday morning ""Not to try and fear-monger or anything but of course this sort of thing can happen again,"" he said. ""If another event like Storm Christoph happens, the water levels in the mine rises as quickly as it did, there's absolutely nothing to say that it wouldn't happen again in the future. ""And obviously as climate changes and we have many more events like Storm Christoph, they are going to increase in frequency, they are going to be much more severe. ""The Coal Authority will have to consider the risk in places like Skewen, and they'll have to understand how it will affect residents and proactively manage that and look at how to reduce the risks for residents.""

Russia detains Navalny aides as protests go viralPolice hold aides to Putin critic Alexei Navalny as social media buzzes with plans for protests.Europe,"Police warned that unsanctioned protests would be ""immediately suppressed"" Russian police have detained close aides of the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny, as a string of nationwide protests gets under way. Police have broken up demonstrations in the eastern Khabarovsk region, amid stern warnings for people to stay home. Mr Navalny's supporters flooded social media with calls to rally at protests expected in dozens of cities later. He is Russian leader Vladimir Putin's most high-profile critic. He was arrested last Sunday after he flew back to Moscow from Berlin, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal nerve agent attack in Russia last August. On his return, he was immediately taken into custody and found guilty of violating parole conditions. He says it is a trumped-up case designed to silence him. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities More than 60m people have watched his new video about President Vladimir Putin's alleged luxury Black Sea palace. The Kremlin denies the property belongs to the president. Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' film Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Among those detained in Moscow on Thursday were his spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, and one of his lawyers, Lyubov Sobol. They face fines or short jail terms. Ms Sobol, who has a young child, was later released. But Ms Yarmysh has now been jailed for nine days. Prominent Navalny activists are also being held in the cities of Vladivostok, Novosibirsk and Krasnodar. Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh is accused of violating protest laws Unauthorised rallies are being planned in more than 60 cities across Russia for Saturday. Moscow police say any unauthorised demonstrations and provocations will be ""immediately suppressed"". A thousand people were reported to have come onto the streets in the Khabarovsk region, with some of them already detained. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia, who travelled back to Russia with him from Germany, said she would demonstrate in Moscow ""for myself, for him, for our children, for the values and the ideals that we share"". Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) has drawn millions of followers on social media, through slickly produced videos alleging large-scale official corruption. He has long denounced Mr Putin's administration as ""feudal"" and full of ""crooks and thieves"". For a long time the Russian authorities made out that Alexei Navalny was irrelevant. Just a blogger. With a tiny following. No threat whatsoever. Recent events suggest the opposite. First Mr Navalny was targeted with a nerve agent, allegedly by a secret group of FSB state security hitmen. Instead of investigating the poisoning, Russia is investigating him: on his return from Germany the Kremlin critic was arrested. Having put Mr Navalny behind bars, the authorities are putting pressure on his supporters. The Kremlin's greatest fear is of a Ukraine-style revolution in Russia that would sweep away those in power. There's no indication that such a scenario is imminent. But with economic problems growing, the Kremlin will worry that Mr Navalny could act as a lightning rod for protest sentiment. That explains the police crackdown on Navalny allies ahead of Saturday's potential protests. Plus, this is getting personal. Mr Navalny's video about ""Putin's Palace"" on the Black Sea was designed to cause maximum embarrassment to the Russian president. In the""Putin's palace"" video,externalMr Navalny alleges that rich businessmen close to Mr Putin paid for a sumptuous 17,691sq m (190,424sq ft) palace for him at Gelendzhik, by the Black Sea. It is alleged to have a casino, a theatre and many other comforts, including a vineyard and tea house in the sprawling grounds. The Kremlin dismissed the YouTube video as a ""pseudo-investigation"" aimed at earning money for Mr Navalny. Prosecutors have warned people against protesting in support of Mr Navalny on Saturday. Russia's education ministry has told parents not to allow their children to attend. Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' film Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Some Russian celebrities in the arts and sports have pledged support for Mr Navalny. They include ice hockey star Artemi Panarin. Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov - now a leading anti-Putin activist based in the US - tweeted that pro-Navalny posts were being widely blocked in Russia. Allow Twitter content?

In a phone call to President Putin on Friday, EU Council President Charles Michel voiced ""grave concern"" about the jailing of Mr Navalny. Mr Michel said the EU was ""united in its call on Russia to swiftly release Mr Navalny and proceed with the investigation into the assassination attempt on him, in full transparency and without further delay"". In October, the EU imposed sanctions on six top Russian officials and a Russian chemical weapons research centre over the Novichok poisoning of Mr Navalny. The Kremlin retaliated with tit-for-tat sanctions, denying any role in the attack and rejecting the expert finding that the Russian nerve agent had been used. The Black Sea palace allegedly features a casino, an ice rink and a vineyard The social media app TikTok has a flood of videos from Russians promoting the protests planned for Saturday. The messages about Mr Navalny have been going viral for several days. A well-known Russian TikTok user, Slava Varfolomeyev, told BBC Russian: ""I go on TikTok and find that every third video is about 'Putin's palace', the detention of Navalny and the 23 January rally!"" He said that on Thursday ""this swelled to a maximum: practically seven out of every 10 videos were on that topic [Navalny]"". TikTok's popularity is based on short-form videos. On Wednesday Russia's official media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, demanded that TikTok take down any information ""encouraging minors to act illegally"", threatening large fines.

Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) has drawn millions of followers on social media, through slickly produced videos alleging large-scale official corruption. He has long denounced Mr Putin's administration as ""feudal"" and full of ""crooks and thieves"". For a long time the Russian authorities made out that Alexei Navalny was irrelevant. Just a blogger. With a tiny following. No threat whatsoever. Recent events suggest the opposite. First Mr Navalny was targeted with a nerve agent, allegedly by a secret group of FSB state security hitmen. Instead of investigating the poisoning, Russia is investigating him: on his return from Germany the Kremlin critic was arrested. Having put Mr Navalny behind bars, the authorities are putting pressure on his supporters. The Kremlin's greatest fear is of a Ukraine-style revolution in Russia that would sweep away those in power. There's no indication that such a scenario is imminent. But with economic problems growing, the Kremlin will worry that Mr Navalny could act as a lightning rod for protest sentiment. That explains the police crackdown on Navalny allies ahead of Saturday's potential protests. Plus, this is getting personal. Mr Navalny's video about ""Putin's Palace"" on the Black Sea was designed to cause maximum embarrassment to the Russian president. In the""Putin's palace"" video,externalMr Navalny alleges that rich businessmen close to Mr Putin paid for a sumptuous 17,691sq m (190,424sq ft) palace for him at Gelendzhik, by the Black Sea. It is alleged to have a casino, a theatre and many other comforts, including a vineyard and tea house in the sprawling grounds. The Kremlin dismissed the YouTube video as a ""pseudo-investigation"" aimed at earning money for Mr Navalny. Prosecutors have warned people against protesting in support of Mr Navalny on Saturday. Russia's education ministry has told parents not to allow their children to attend. Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' film Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Some Russian celebrities in the arts and sports have pledged support for Mr Navalny. They include ice hockey star Artemi Panarin. Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov - now a leading anti-Putin activist based in the US - tweeted that pro-Navalny posts were being widely blocked in Russia. Allow Twitter content?

In a phone call to President Putin on Friday, EU Council President Charles Michel voiced ""grave concern"" about the jailing of Mr Navalny. Mr Michel said the EU was ""united in its call on Russia to swiftly release Mr Navalny and proceed with the investigation into the assassination attempt on him, in full transparency and without further delay"". In October, the EU imposed sanctions on six top Russian officials and a Russian chemical weapons research centre over the Novichok poisoning of Mr Navalny. The Kremlin retaliated with tit-for-tat sanctions, denying any role in the attack and rejecting the expert finding that the Russian nerve agent had been used. The Black Sea palace allegedly features a casino, an ice rink and a vineyard The social media app TikTok has a flood of videos from Russians promoting the protests planned for Saturday. The messages about Mr Navalny have been going viral for several days. A well-known Russian TikTok user, Slava Varfolomeyev, told BBC Russian: ""I go on TikTok and find that every third video is about 'Putin's palace', the detention of Navalny and the 23 January rally!"" He said that on Thursday ""this swelled to a maximum: practically seven out of every 10 videos were on that topic [Navalny]"". TikTok's popularity is based on short-form videos. On Wednesday Russia's official media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, demanded that TikTok take down any information ""encouraging minors to act illegally"", threatening large fines.

LiveLiveNew variant may be linked to higher mortality - PM2 minutes ago,"There is some evidence the new UK variant may be linked to a higher degree of mortality, PM tells press conference The chance of dying from it could be 30-40% higher than the old variant but data is uncertain There are more than 38,000 people in hospital, 78% more than at peak of the first wave, Boris Johnson adds The number of people catching the virus is âturning the cornerâ but from an exceptionally high level, chief medical officer Chris Whitty says A further 1,401 people have died in the UK with coronavirus within 28 days of a positive test UK R rate estimated to be between 0.8 and 1 - meaning the outbreak could now be shrinking Edited by Martha Buckley We're closing our live coverage of the pandemic for today. Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates throughout the day. Our coverage was brought to you by: James Clarke, Martha Buckley, Becky Morton, George Bowden, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Katie Wright, Gavin Stamp, Lucy Webster and Francesca Gillett. It's been another fairly busy day for coronavirus news, with Boris Johnson giving a press conference earlier. Here's a recap of the top headlines: People who drove 20 miles and then queued for two hours to get fresh milk from a farm's vending machine have been fined for breaching lockdown rules. The farmers who own the vending machine, Einion and Elliw Jones, in Trelogan near Holywell, say they feel North Wales Police have got ""it in for us"". They said even people living nearby were facing being fined, despite the force accepting milk was ""an essential item"". In Wales Covid  rules tell people to ""stay at home"" except for essential reasons, which include buying food. Welsh government guidance on the rules says there are no limits on how far people can travel to shop for essential items, but urge people to stay as ""local to your home as possible"". Ms Jones said some customers from ""just down the road"" in Trelawnyd and Mostyn had even been told they shouldn't be there. The police said the farm was working with the local council to ensure it was ""Covid-compliant surrounding queuing, social distancing etc"". There's more on this story here. New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. There is some evidence that the one that has become dominant in the UK may be associated with a higher degree of mortality, says PM Boris Johnson. Scientists are urgently studying these mutated versions to understand what threat they pose. So how worrying are the new UK, South Africa and Brazil coronavirus variants? The BBC's Michelle Roberts has a look at the evidencehere. Former tennis world number oneAndy Murray will miss the Australian Open having failed to find a ""workable quarantine""as he recovers from coronavirus. The 33-year-old Briton was set to fly out to Melbourne last week, but was not allowed to travel on a charter flight after being found to have Covid-19. The Victorian state government has put in place strict measures to allow players to fly into the country for the tournament, which starts on 8 February. Murray says: ""Gutted to share that I won't be flying out to Australia to compete at the Australian Open. ""We've been in constant dialogue with Tennis Australia to try and find a solution which would allow some form of workable quarantine, but we couldn't make it work. The famous Rovers Return pub on the set of Coronation Street ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are both seeing their filming schedules hit by the pandemic. An ITV spokeswoman confirms Emmerdale stopped filming last week after some members of the team tested positive for Covid-19. She adds they will return to filming on Monday. Meanwhile, Coronation Street will pause filming for two weeks on Monday ""to undertake some rewriting of stories and scripts as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic"". However, the break will not affect its TV schedule and the show will still be on six times a week, a statement adds. The news that the new variant of coronavirus may be more deadly is ""deeply alarming,"" said the shadow health secretary, ""not least
because Boris Johnson assured the nation back in December there was no evidence
the variant was more dangerous."" Jonathan Ashworth said: âWe urge
ministers to go further and faster on vaccination rollout now to save lives,
and introduce proper financial support for those needing to isolate to help
breaks chains of transmission.â  This video can not be played Covid: Wedding party in Stamford Hill broken up by police One of today's top stories about coronavirus in the UK has been police discovering people gathered at a wedding party in north London last night. Originally the police said 400 people had attended - but they have now revised that number down to 150. In a statement, the Met Police said: ""Although
initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now
believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" The organisers of the wedding party - which was held at a strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school in Stamford Hill - face fines. The Met said one organiser would be reported for consideration of a Â£10,000 fine while five other attendees were issued with Â£200 fixed penalty notices. ""This afternoon, an investigation has been launched to identify those others responsible for organising and who attended the wedding,"" the Met added. Read the full story here. There is still âa lot of uncertaintyâ about just how severe
the new UK variant is, according to another of the government's scientific advisers. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government's Scientific
Advisory Group on Emergencies, said the figures given during the Downing Street briefing suggested an increase of something like
30 to 40% in terms of mortality which âreally ties in with what weâre seeing in
the hospitalsâ. Speaking to Radio 4âs PM programme, he said: âIt is
obviously a blow. We were rather hoping that this virus was going to be quite
genetically stable. âThe realisation that this virus is capable of relatively
fast mutation and development of new variantsâ¦ has been a bit of a setback for
us.â Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent With new variants emerging in
different parts of the world, itâs worth highlighting Boris Johnsonâs comments
about borders. It seems pretty clear ministers are considering more
restrictions on people coming into the UK â to stop those variants coming into
the UK if possible. In the PMâs words, the UK may have to further to âprotect
our bordersâ. Reality Check Itâs impossible to say
exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being
in contact with someone who has tested positive, however
some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from
September suggests just 10.9% of peopleremained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report
when arguing people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it
suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do âto go to workâ. Most people reported going out for
things such as shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they
needed to quarantine as they didnât develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done
before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of
just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies (Sage) has also highlighted research that shows most peopleappear to be following the rules,external. This research also suggests those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate
than those better off. - By Ben Butcher Friday's coronavirus briefing was led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was joined by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser. Here's what they told us: Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether delaying the second vaccine dose risks creating more resistant variants of the virus. Patrick Vallance says the riskiest thing in terms of new mutations is high prevalence in the community. He says the mutations currently circulating came about naturally due to transmission - but adds there is always ""some risk"" when there is partial immunity. But he says that partial immunity also provides benefits in terms of protection for the most vulnerable. Chris Whitty says, ""Our overall view was that the balance of risks was in favour of having many more people in the UK vaccinated."" On support for businesses and jobs, the PM says the government will ""do what it takes"" to support livelihoods. And with that, he ends today's No 10 briefing. Asked whether the British public are
ready for lockdown to stay in place for a long time, the prime minister says we will have
to live with coronavirus for âa long while to comeâ but it is an open question ""when and in what way"" we can start to relax restrictions. He says it depends on the vaccine rollout going well, getting
case numbers down and whether there are discoveries of any more variants. That doesnât mean that ""Iâm not optimistic"" about the rollout of the vaccine, he says, âbut at this stage you
really have to be very cautious indeedâ. He adds that the first thing that the government wants to open is
schools, which is a priority. Patrick Vallance says he expects the virus âto be around, probably, forever"" but it is going to be controlled. However, he says it is a very different outlook with
increasing numbers of treatments and vaccines, but the key is ânot getting too
hooked up on specific datesâ. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The new variant has been causing
concern in government for a number of weeks. Now the scientists believe there
is some early evidence it could be causing slightly higher mortality â when you
look at everyone testing positive. The overall message from the prime minister
is pretty bleak, Iâm afraid; that the terrible death figures weâve seen in
recent days will continue for a while. We donât seem to heading for a tighter
lockdown in England because the PM believes the current measures are the right
ones if people follow them. But there was a clear message there that we canât
start unlocking society until the rates come down significantly â weâre in this
for a while. The Daily Telegraph's Gordon Raynor raises a video he says has been posted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock aimed at travel agents, suggesting the South African variant is 50% less susceptible to vaccines than the original strain of the virus. He asks whether this is correct and, if so, whether it will affect the government's approach to whether to tighten UK border controls. The PM runs through the measures that the UK has in place, including the ban on direct flights from South Africa and ""rigorous"" obligations for people entering the UK in terms of quarantine and tests. But he suggests ""we may need to go further to protect our borders"", saying the massive progress the UK is making in terms of vaccinations cannot be undermined.  Sky News's Sam Coates asks whether, if the new variant is more dangerous, it is right that more people are ""out and about"" during the current lockdown than the first one last year. The PM says that ""we are enforcing the law very strictly with increasing toughness"", meaning increased fines to dissuade risky behaviour. ""It depends on everybody doing the right thing and avoiding transmission,"" he says, adding that is  what will be more effective than police action. On why the new variant may be transmitting more readily, Sir Patrick Vallance says it is not believed the new variant has a higher viral load, meaning people ""shed more virus"". He suggests it may be other factors that make it more transmissible. On the current infection rate, Chris Whitty says that while infections are slowly going down ""it is at a very, very high level"". He says that among some age groups - including those 20 to 30 - infections may still be increasing. And on hospitalisations, he says that they are ""broadly flat"" for the UK as a whole, but there are variations between regions. ""That peak is not yet definitely going down yet,"" he says. Deaths will be delayed further with the peak expected in the future, he adds. This video can not be played Infection level 'very, very high' and 'extremely precarious' - Prof Whitty The next question asks about whether the UK variant means
lockdown restrictions will last longer. The prime minister says he thinks the country has âthe right package of
measuresâ to deal with the new variant and people need to comply with them. He says there are signs in the data that infections are
flattening, although the rates are still âvery highâ so the government âcanât begin
to consider unlockingâ. The vaccination programme could change this, he says, but the
UK is in a position where cases are so high that unlocking could lead to âa big
reboundâ. Asked whether the South African variant is in the UK, Patrick
Vallance says some cases have been detected but he says the key thing is to try to contain it. He adds that âthere is no evidenceâ that the South African or
Brazilian variants have transmission advantages over the variants already in
the UK and so having cases here doesnât mean âthey will take offâ. Now we move on to questions from journalists, the first of which is from the BBC's health editor, Hugh Pym. In light of the information about the danger posed by the new variant, he asks the PM whether he expects the current death trends to rise more steeply and then fall more slowly. In response, the PM says there was a big surge in deaths over the Christmas period which is continuing and he sadly believes this will continue to be so ""for a while to come"". Prof Whitty says the ""shape of the curve"" is driven by the rate of infections, which has been going up and is now coming down. Sir Patrick says the death numbers are ""awful"" and are likely to continue at current levels for some while, saying this is what was predicted for some time. In response to a separate question about evidence emerging from Israel that the Pfizer-BioTech vaccine might not be as effective as first thought, Sir Patrick says there needs to be further research but overall the efficacy of the approved vaccines is proven. The second question from a member of the public comes from Sally, from Oxfordshire, who asks whether those who have been vaccinated are allowed to mix together with others who have had a jab. Chris Whitty says that - even with the very effective vaccines - there is a period of time straight after a jab ""where there is no effect"". He says people won't see protection for around two to three weeks following their vaccination - and even then ""that protection will not be complete"". He says a large proportion of people in the community have currently got the virus - ""so the risk is if you have the vaccine you still have some residual risk"". Whitty adds that the lockdown is helping to get the rates of infection right down - to allow those who have been vaccinated more protection. ""Over time, the answer will be yes - but at this point in time the answer will be no,"" he says. Sir Patrick Vallance adds there is uncertainty around the vaccine's role in preventing transmission of the virus. Â© 2025 BBC.

Police break up '400-person' wedding party,"Guests fled when officers arrived at the Stamford Hill school, where the windows had been covered Police broke up a wedding party in north London, where they now say about 150 people had gathered. Officers found the windows at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School, in Stamford Hill, had been covered when they arrived at 21:15 GMT on Thursday. Guests fled from the strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school when the police arrived. The organisers face a Â£10,000 fine for breaking lockdown rules. The Met originally claimed that about 400 guests were at the gathering. In a statement, the school said its hall had been leased out. A spokesman for the school, whose principal Rabbi Avrahom Pinter died in April after contracting coronavirus, said ""we had no knowledge that the wedding was taking place"". He added: ""We are absolutely horrified about last night's event and condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" Boris Johnson supports the police for ""taking action against people who flagrantly and selfishly ignore the rules"", according to the prime minister's official spokesman. The spokesman said: ""Large gatherings such as that pose a health risk, not just to those who attend but those who they live with or others who they may come into contact with.""

Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, meanwhile, said the ""overwhelming majority"" of the Jewish community would be appalled at the event. Rabbi Mirvis, who serves as the head of the UK's orthodox Jewish community but is not the leader of the Charedi group, called the wedding party ""a most shameful desecration of all that we hold dear"". Five guests were issued with Â£200 fixed penalty notices, according to police, who said their inquiries had established those present at the school had gathered for a wedding.

They are then seen arriving at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School. Det Ch Sup Marcus Barnett of the Met Police said: ""This was a completely unacceptable breach of the law. ""People across the country are making sacrifices by cancelling or postponing weddings and other celebrations and there is no excuse for this type of behaviour. ""My officers are working tirelessly with the community and we will not hesitate to take enforcement action if that is required to keep people safe."" On Friday morning, a security guard at the school told the BBC there were more like 100 guests at the party than the much higher number given out by police. The Met later said in a statement: ""Although initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" Stamford Hill is part of the borough of Hackney, which has a Covid-19 infection rate of 625.43 cases per 100,000 people. The England average rate is 471.31 per 100,000 people. The mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that the wedding party had taken place, despite ""the number of lives that have already been lost in the Charedi community and across the borough"". He added: ""Unfortunately, similar events have taken place even at this venue before and we need to be really clear how unacceptable it is.

LiveLiveBiden to boost food aid to reduce US Covid toll8 minutes ago,"The new administration in the US is undertaking a ""comprehensive threat assessment on domestic extremism"" It follows the deadly storming of the Congress building by pro-Trump rioters on 6 January The attack led to the second impeachment of President Trump. His trial in the Senate is due to start next week President Joe Biden signs orders to expand federal food aid for millions of Americans The damage to the US economy from the coronavirus pandemic has left many families poorer and going hungry Edited by Jude Sheerin Biden's wife First Lady Jill Biden handed out biscuits to National Guard troops on Friday We're pausing our live coverage. It was a busy Friday as the new president spent his second full day in the top job:  Thanks for reading our live coverage. It was brought to you by Sam Cabral, Penny Spiller, Max Matza, Georgina Rannard, Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady and Alix Kroeger. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The future for Trump - and the political movement he rode to victory in 2016 - is murky. Over his career, he has been declared dead more times than Freddy Krueger and has always managed to wriggle free. Until now. In the days following the US Capitol riot, Trump's overall public approval rating precipitously dropped to the mid-30s - some of the lowest of his entire presidency. At first blush, the numbers would indicate that his political prospects have been mortally wounded. A deeper dive, however, paints a less dire picture for the ex-president. While Democrats, independents and some moderate Republicans are against him, his Republican base appears to be intact. Read Anthony's analysis of what Trump's future looks like. After the riot at the US Capitol, videos of Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman luring the mob away from the Senate chambers - and possibly saving lawmakers' lives - went viral. Several members of Congress have since credited his quick thinking for distracting the rioters, and called him a hero. Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House introduced a bill to award Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal. Today, another bipartisan group - in the Senate - is proposing identical legislation. The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded to Americans who have made ""distinguished achievements and contributions"" to their country. Lawmakers are showing their gratitude on social media, sharing pictures with Goodman. On Wednesday, he escorted Vice-President Kamala Harris to her inauguration ceremony. Allow Twitter content?

Here's why so many people think Goodman may have saved lives. Twice as many Americans have searched on Google for information about the impeachment of Joe Biden, compared to Donald Trump, in the last 24 hours. Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory,filed articles of impeachment against the new president yesterday,external. Greene accuses Biden of bribery and other abuses of power, citing unproven claims that the president used his official capacity to help his son's business dealings in Ukraine. She announced this on Twitter in a short video which now has nearly 10 million views. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Greene has been widely condemned, and even banned temporarily from Twitter, for spreading false information about the US election results. Filing articles of impeachment does not indicate action on behalf of Congress. Any representative can file articles of impeachment. In fact, Texas Democrat Al Green tried and failed three times against Donald Trump. However, as indicated by Google Trends, her efforts have clearly gained the attention of many Americans. One might think that more would be searching for news on ""Trump impeachment"" after the announcement by Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor on Friday. He announced the second impeachment trial of former President Trump would begin next week. But that is not the case. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked earlier if Biden had any comment on the ongoing violence seen this week in the streets of Portland and Seattle. Despite fears of conservative mobs following the riot at the Capitol, it has actually been left-wing protesters who have clashed with police in the days before and after Biden's inauguration. On the day Biden was inaugurated this week, demonstrators carrying anti-Biden and anti-police signs marched in Portland and smashed the windows of the Democratic Party of Oregon. Psaki told reporters: ""Certainly we had our team on the ground, our national security team, even before 12:01, early in the morning on Inauguration Day because we wanted to be able to monitor events happening across the country and any unrest that was resulting from the last couple of weeks."" ""I haven't spoke with him specifically about those events but it is something our national security team... is closely monitoring of course, but if we have an additional update I'm happy to provide it to you."" Conservative news outlets criticised Psaki for not taking the opportunity to condemn radical left-wing groups, such as antifa. Protests continued on Thursday, the first full day of the Biden presidency. Demonstrations, and sometimes rioting, have recurred in Seattle and Portland in the months since the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May. The Biden administration is causing confusion over whether it believes China has engaged in the genocide of its minority Uighur population White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not commit to calling alleged rights abuses by the Chinese government against the minority Uighur population a genocide during the briefing earlier. ""The president has spoken before to the horrific treatment of Uighurs but I don't have anything more for you on it,"" she told reporters. ""I can check with our national security team and see if we have a more up-to-date statement."" The response prompted questions as earlier this week, Biden's Secretary of State nominee Anthony Blinken confirmed that he agreed with the Trump administration assessment that China had engaged in genocide. And, during the election last year, the Biden campaign also called the situation ""unspeakable oppression"" and ""genocide"". Need a bit more context? China has faced global criticism over its alleged persecution of the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group living mostly in the north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang. It is believed that the Chinese government has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as ""re-education camps"". The government has also been accused of forcibly sterilising Uighur women, which it denies. After initially denying the existence of these camps, China now says they were a necessary measure against separatist violence in Xinjiang. Read more about China and the Uighurs here. The president said the US death toll from the coronavirus could shoot up by another 200,000 with or without action from the government. ""A lot of America is hurting,"" said Biden. ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" According to the Johns Hopkins University, 412,239 American lives have now been lost to the virus. Making his case in the White House before he signed two executive orders to provide pandemic relief, Biden  said: ""We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act."" In his final hours in office, Donald Trump issued dozens of pardons. Several of those charged in the Capitol riots hoped they would receive pardons, but none came. A lawyer for the so-called QAnon Shaman - the Viking-like invader whose image ricocheted around the world - is speaking out now about the snub. In what appears to be some kind of media offensive, attorney Al Watkins has told various local media outlets that his client Jake Angeli was âdupedâ by the words and actions of President Trump. âMr. Chansley, along with many others who were similarly situated, are now compelled to reconcile a betrayal by a man whose back they felt they had for years,â said Watkins. Chansley, 33, called the FBI the day after the riot to say he had been there âat the request of the president that all âpatriotsâ come to DC on January 6, 2021.â He has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct. The president has apologised that some members of the National Guard drafted to protect the capital from violence were forced to sleep in a garage this week. He also called on the National Guard Bureau chief to say sorry to the soldiers, who had been asked to leave the Congressional buildings. Pictures of the troops sleeping in the unheated car park provoked outrage on Thursday, with some state governors calling their soldiers home. On Friday Biden's wife First Lady Jill Biden visited some of the National Guard to thank them for their work and hand out cookies. Around 7,000 soldiers are expected to remain in Washington until mid-March, with the other 18,000 leaving in the coming weeks. They were posted to the city after violent pro-Trump supporters stormed Congress on 6 January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reacting to today's news, that the House will send Trump's impeachment article to the Senate on Monday, setting up his trial to begin Tuesday, Biden had this to say: ""I havenât heard the detail of it,"" he says. ""The more time we have to get up and running to meet these crises, the better."" His answer seemed to hint that he preferred the Republican timeline offer, which would have seen the trial pushed back until early February to give both sides to prepare. The now-viral photo of Bernie Sanders at Joe Biden's inauguration There's little sign that the Bernie Sanders meme from Biden's inauguration is going away. You'd be forgiven for thinking that the 79-year-old Senator was the star of the show on Wednesday after pictures of him wrapped up in a practical coat and woollen mittens went viral. Now Sanders' team have announced you can buy a jumper showing the meme to raise money for charity. TheChairman Sanders Crewneck is on sale for $45,external(Â£33), with all proceeds going to Meals on Wheels in Vermont, where Sanders lives. ""Due to overwhelming demand for this item, it will be 3-6 weeks until you receive your sweatshirt,"" the website warns. About the viral photo, Sanders said on Thursday, âI was just sitting there, trying to keep warm, trying to pay attention to what was going on.â Sanders has been appointed chairman of the powerful Senate Budget Committee. President Biden says, if the US government does not act ""decisively and boldly"" now, it will cause a lot of pain. ""We're in a national emergency,"" said Biden. ""We need to act like we're in a national emergency."" The executive orders that the president is signing today aim to expand access to food aid for low-income families and protect federal workers. He reiterated the sentiments previously expressed by other members of the administration, noting that more needs to be done because ""a lot of America is hurting"". He urged action from Congress on his $1.9tn Covid rescue package, warning that that there was no time to waste. ""I don't believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs. I believe Americans are going hungry and losing jobs."" The president says the first part of his plan is to ""get direct financial relief"" to those who need it most. ""With our American rescue plan, the economy would return to full employment a year sooner,"" Biden says. He adds that the administration is going to ""finish the job"" of getting a total of $2,000 (Â£1,450) in economic payments out to the people. ""If we fail to act, there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures,"" he adds. ""because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months."" ""This would overwhelm emergency shelters,"" he says, adding that displaced Americans will be at a higher risk of catching coronavirus if they are forced to live in places where they are unable to social distance. Biden is now speaking from the White House about his plans to take the US out of the economic recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. ""If we don't act - the rest of the world is not standing still,"" Biden says, warning: ""We need more action and we need to move fast.""  Earlier, we reported that former President Trump's impeachment trial is poised to begin next week, as the House submits the charge against him to the Senate. Watch the moment Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer announced the news of Trump's upcoming ""full and fair trial"" - and see Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell's response - below. This video can not be played Schumer: Trump will have a 'full and fair trial' It's day two of the Biden administration and the new president is already facing some pushback. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit over a decision to halt most deportations from the US for 100 days, saying the administration is in violation of an agreement with the state signed under President Trump. That agreement from 31 December says that the federal government must discuss immigration matters with the state and provide six months' notice before enacting policy changes. Ending it requires 180 days' notice. Paxton argued the state would face ""irreparable harm"" if the moratorium went through, Reuters news agency reported. The White House has declined to comment on the matter. The White House has just put out a statement marking the 48th anniversary of Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court decision that essentially legalised the right to abortion. ""In the past four years, reproductive health, including the right to choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack,""the statement from Biden and Harris begins,external. They go on to say they are committed to ""codifying"" the judgement, which means pass legislation through Congress that enshrines abortion access into law. They will also appoint judges who will support abortion access, they say. Trump, during his time in office, was able to give the Supreme Court a conservative majority, making anti-abortion activists hopeful that Roe v Wade could eventually be overturned. Biden was the only candidate during the primary to say he endorsed the so-called Hyde Amendment, which says that no federal funds can go towards abortions. After nearly all 22 other candidates came out against the Hyde Amendment, he reversed his stance. Although abortion is technically legal across the US, multiple states have instituted laws that make it nearly impossible in practice. Abortion activists hope that a law would make it more difficult for local governments to restrict access. President Biden will make a call to another foreign leader later today: Mexican president AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. The call was first announced on Twitter by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard ""The bilateral relationship moves forward with communication and understanding,"" said Ebrard. It will be Biden's second foreign call of the day. He will also speak to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The White House says it will provide readouts of the two calls later in the day. The BBC's North America Editor Jon Sopel asks about the prospects for a free trade deal between the US and UK. Is it months or years away? Just yesterday, Janet Yellen - the former head of the US central bank who's now in line to be treasury secretary - said Biden would not be signing any new deals because his priority right now is on domestic economy and infrastructure. ""I can't give you any timeline,"" press secretary Jen Psaki begins. She goes on to say that trade agreements that benefit American families are ""certainly"" being considered. ""At this point in time we're working to get the pandemic under control [and] provide economic relief to the American public,"" she says. Joe Biden's administration is making it a priority to address domestic extremism, press secretary Jen Psaki announced a few minutes ago. It comes after the violent attack on the Capitol on 6 January in which hundreds of pro-Trump Americans stormed Congress. Many are believed to have subscribed to extremist views after viewing radical material online. On Friday, the White House requested a ""comprehensive threat assessment about domestic violent extremism"" from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. The Capitol riot underscored ""what we have long known - the rise of domestic extremism is a serious and growing national security threat"", Psaki said. She underlined that the president aims to increase communication and the sharing of information between the agencies tracking the threat. Read about the Capitol arrests. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Police break up '400-person' wedding partyThe chief rabbi has described the event, which was held at a school, as a ""shameful desecration"".","Guests fled when officers arrived at the Stamford Hill school, where the windows had been covered Police broke up a wedding party in north London, where they now say about 150 people had gathered. Officers found the windows at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School, in Stamford Hill, had been covered when they arrived at 21:15 GMT on Thursday. Guests fled from the strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school when the police arrived. The organisers face a Â£10,000 fine for breaking lockdown rules. The Met originally claimed that about 400 guests were at the gathering. In a statement, the school said its hall had been leased out. A spokesman for the school, whose principal Rabbi Avrahom Pinter died in April after contracting coronavirus, said ""we had no knowledge that the wedding was taking place"". He added: ""We are absolutely horrified about last night's event and condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" Boris Johnson supports the police for ""taking action against people who flagrantly and selfishly ignore the rules"", according to the prime minister's official spokesman. The spokesman said: ""Large gatherings such as that pose a health risk, not just to those who attend but those who they live with or others who they may come into contact with.""

Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, meanwhile, said the ""overwhelming majority"" of the Jewish community would be appalled at the event. Rabbi Mirvis, who serves as the head of the UK's orthodox Jewish community but is not the leader of the Charedi group, called the wedding party ""a most shameful desecration of all that we hold dear"". Five guests were issued with Â£200 fixed penalty notices, according to police, who said their inquiries had established those present at the school had gathered for a wedding.

They are then seen arriving at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School. Det Ch Sup Marcus Barnett of the Met Police said: ""This was a completely unacceptable breach of the law. ""People across the country are making sacrifices by cancelling or postponing weddings and other celebrations and there is no excuse for this type of behaviour. ""My officers are working tirelessly with the community and we will not hesitate to take enforcement action if that is required to keep people safe."" On Friday morning, a security guard at the school told the BBC there were more like 100 guests at the party than the much higher number given out by police. The Met later said in a statement: ""Although initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" Stamford Hill is part of the borough of Hackney, which has a Covid-19 infection rate of 625.43 cases per 100,000 people. The England average rate is 471.31 per 100,000 people. The mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that the wedding party had taken place, despite ""the number of lives that have already been lost in the Charedi community and across the borough"". He added: ""Unfortunately, similar events have taken place even at this venue before and we need to be really clear how unacceptable it is.

'No plans' for universal self-isolation payment,"There are no plans to pay everyone in England who tests positive for Covid Â£500 to self-isolate, No 10 has said. The PM's official spokesman said there was already a Â£500 payment available for those on low incomes who could not work from home and had to isolate. A universal Â£500 payment was among suggestions in a leaked Department of Health document. There are fears the current financial support is not working because low paid workers cannot afford to self-isolate. But a senior government source said the idea of extending the Â£500 payments to everyone who tests positive had been drawn up by officials and had not been considered by the prime minister. 'Too early' to say if lockdown will end in spring Three-quarters 'rejected for self-isolation grant' Who has to self-isolate and for how long? BBC Newsnight's Katie Razzall said ministers were aware self-isolation was crucial for stopping the spread of coronavirus and the ""options paper"" had been drawn up by civil servants at the Department of Health. She said it would be discussed soon by the Covid operations committee chaired by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, adding the move suggested there was an admission in government that too many people were not staying at home and a decision needed to be made quickly. The story was firstreported by the Guardian,externalwhich said the options paper suggested the proposal could cost up to Â£453m per week - 12 times the cost of the current payouts. Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC he had not seen the leaked document but said the issue of financial support for people self-isolating was ""always kept under review"". ""We've got to consider all sorts of policies in order to make sure that people abide by the rules, are able to abide by the rules and we get the infection rate down,"" he said. But the prime minister's official spokesman denied the government was planning to introduce the new payment, telling reporters: ""We've given local authorities Â£70m for the scheme and they are able to provide extra payments on top of those Â£500 if they think it necessary. ""That Â£500 is on top of any other benefits and statutory sick pay that people are eligible for."" Asked about document, the spokesman said he would not comment on a leaked paper. By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check It's impossible to say exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being in contact with someone who has tested positive, however some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from September 2020 suggests thatjust 10.9% of people remained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report when arguing that people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do ""to go to work"". Most people reported going out for things like shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they needed to quarantine as they didn't develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has alsohighlighted research that shows that most people don't completely follow the rules,external. This research also suggests that those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate than those better off. BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there was concern in government about the huge cost of the proposal for the Treasury. However, he said the issue of financial incentives and trying to get people to self-isolate was clearly a live discussion within government. It became a legal requirement last September for anyone in England testing positive for coronavirus to self-isolate. TheÂ£500 grant already available in England is funded by the government but administered by local authorities.,external The same level of payment is available in Scotland and Wales with similar conditions attached. Northern Ireland offers a discretionary self-isolation grant that covers expenses, such as the cost of groceries. There is a list of specific criteria applicants must meet for the grant, but those who do not qualify for this payment and who are on a low income or may face financial hardship as a result of self-isolating can apply for a discretionary payment. However, there have been high rejection rates for this discretionary grant in England,figures obtained by Labour and reported by the BBC this week suggest. Between October and December last year, three-quarters of the 49,877 applications were rejected, the data showed. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish government would welcome the introduction of a Â£500 payment, as the additional funds it would generate for Scotland could allow for a similar scheme to be set up. Speaking at her regular coronavirus briefing, she said: ""We will see whether that transpires or not, but any extra resources for self-isolation we would use to support self-isolation.""

She said financial support currently offered to people having to self-isolate was a ""key weakness"" of the government's pandemic strategy. Sharon, a cleaner from Kent, told the BBC if no money were to come in for two weeks she would not be able to afford to self-isolate. ""I have a mortgage to pay,"" she said.

"Shoppers stuck at home shun new clothes in 2020Clothing was the hardest-hit sector last year, seeing a 25% drop in sales overall.","Shoppers bought far fewer clothes last year as lockdowns meant people had less opportunity to socialise and go out. Clothes sales slumped 25%, the biggest drop in 23 years when records began,official figures suggest.,external While shops have reported demand for certain clothing such as pyjamas and loungewear has risen, demand for going-out items has fallen sharply. And despite a pick-up in December, clothing sales remain lower than before the pandemic struck. ""With few opportunities to socialise during lockdown and many people working from home, the clothing sector has been one of the ""worst-affected by restrictions"", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Earlier this month, Marks & Spencer said sales of sleepwear had soared Growing numbers of High Street shops have faced financial difficulties due to the temporary store closures imposed during lockdowns. Topshop-owner Arcadia and competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed last March. The inability to try clothes on in bricks-and-mortar shops, as well as restrictions on eating out meaning consumers are going out less, have all affected sales, the ONS suggested. And the slump in demand for fashion meant that British retail sales saw their largest annual fall on record in 2020. Sales fell by 1.9% last year, when compared with 2019, the largest year-on-year fall since records began in 1997. Retail sales, including fuel, did see a small increase last month, growing by 0.3% when compared with November. It came following the end of England's national lockdown on 2 December.Sales had slumped by 4.1% in Novemberduring a month-long shutdown. But ""this was very clearly not a Merry Christmas for most of the High Street"", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""For most retailers it's the most crucial month of the year to get profit back on track but the large upswing in sales after the pain of the November lockdowns didn't materialise,"" she said. ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said that some sectors, however, had been ""able to buck the trend"" last year. Lockdown fashion: 'People are back in pyjamas' High Street crisis: 'Regular customers are keeping us going' Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years' Pre-Christmas lockdown restrictions hit retail sales ""The increased popularity of click-and-collect and people buying more items from home led to a strong year for overall internet sales, with record highs for food and household goods sales online."" In a sign of the way the pandemic has changed shopping habits, the value of online retail sales jumped by 46.1% in 2020 when compared with 2019 - the highest annual growth reported since 2008. Online trade now accounts for more than one-third of all retail sales. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, explained that the rise of online had ""polarised industry performance"". ""The gap widened between those retailers with the most sophisticated online propositions from those with legacy store-dependent business models,"" he said. Online-only retailers such as Boohoo and Asos, for example, have reported strong sales figures in 2020. Supermarkets in particular have embraced the shift to digital, with online food store sales up 79.3% last year. There was also better news from the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, on Friday. It said that it would return a Â£300m emergency coronavirus loan to the government as trading went ""better than anticipated"" over Christmas. Today's figures show just how badly the clothing sector has been affected these last 12 months. Fashion is the big retail loser from this pandemic. Who needs to splash out on the latest trends when we're working from home and not going out? And even when clothing shops are open, chances are you can't try things on. With all of the Covid-19 measures in place, the fun has been sucked out of shopping. We haven't stopped spending, but most of it is going online. Boohoo and Asos have seen very strong sales growth, for instance. The going's far harder for retailers with large numbers of physical stores. The pressures have already taken their toll on the likes of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group and Debenhams. And things may well get worse on the high street before they better. Many retailers are worried about the end of the business rates holiday and of the temporary ban on eviction for non payment of rent in April. These will result in a big increase in costs when sales have yet to fully recover. But Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, called for more help for non-essential shops and High Street retailers who continue to be affected by lockdown restrictions. ""With no end in sight for retailers closed in lockdown, many will struggle to survive under a mounting rent burden, and a return to full business rates in April,"" she said. She called on government to offer ""targeted"" business rates relief to businesses worst-affected by the pandemic. ""Decisive action is needed to save jobs, shops and local communities, with town and city centres looking to be particularly hard hit unless the government acts now."" Earlier in January, a report from the Centre for Retail Research said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, because of the acceleration towards online shopping. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, it said.

Russia detains Navalny aides as protests go viral,"Police warned that unsanctioned protests would be ""immediately suppressed"" Russian police have detained close aides of the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny, as a string of nationwide protests gets under way. Police have broken up demonstrations in the eastern Khabarovsk region, amid stern warnings for people to stay home. Mr Navalny's supporters flooded social media with calls to rally at protests expected in dozens of cities later. He is Russian leader Vladimir Putin's most high-profile critic. He was arrested last Sunday after he flew back to Moscow from Berlin, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal nerve agent attack in Russia last August. On his return, he was immediately taken into custody and found guilty of violating parole conditions. He says it is a trumped-up case designed to silence him. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities More than 60m people have watched his new video about President Vladimir Putin's alleged luxury Black Sea palace. The Kremlin denies the property belongs to the president. Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' film Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Among those detained in Moscow on Thursday were his spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, and one of his lawyers, Lyubov Sobol. They face fines or short jail terms. Ms Sobol, who has a young child, was later released. But Ms Yarmysh has now been jailed for nine days. Prominent Navalny activists are also being held in the cities of Vladivostok, Novosibirsk and Krasnodar. Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh is accused of violating protest laws Unauthorised rallies are being planned in more than 60 cities across Russia for Saturday. Moscow police say any unauthorised demonstrations and provocations will be ""immediately suppressed"". A thousand people were reported to have come onto the streets in the Khabarovsk region, with some of them already detained. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia, who travelled back to Russia with him from Germany, said she would demonstrate in Moscow ""for myself, for him, for our children, for the values and the ideals that we share"". Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) has drawn millions of followers on social media, through slickly produced videos alleging large-scale official corruption. He has long denounced Mr Putin's administration as ""feudal"" and full of ""crooks and thieves"". For a long time the Russian authorities made out that Alexei Navalny was irrelevant. Just a blogger. With a tiny following. No threat whatsoever. Recent events suggest the opposite. First Mr Navalny was targeted with a nerve agent, allegedly by a secret group of FSB state security hitmen. Instead of investigating the poisoning, Russia is investigating him: on his return from Germany the Kremlin critic was arrested. Having put Mr Navalny behind bars, the authorities are putting pressure on his supporters. The Kremlin's greatest fear is of a Ukraine-style revolution in Russia that would sweep away those in power. There's no indication that such a scenario is imminent. But with economic problems growing, the Kremlin will worry that Mr Navalny could act as a lightning rod for protest sentiment. That explains the police crackdown on Navalny allies ahead of Saturday's potential protests. Plus, this is getting personal. Mr Navalny's video about ""Putin's Palace"" on the Black Sea was designed to cause maximum embarrassment to the Russian president. In the""Putin's palace"" video,externalMr Navalny alleges that rich businessmen close to Mr Putin paid for a sumptuous 17,691sq m (190,424sq ft) palace for him at Gelendzhik, by the Black Sea. It is alleged to have a casino, a theatre and many other comforts, including a vineyard and tea house in the sprawling grounds. The Kremlin dismissed the YouTube video as a ""pseudo-investigation"" aimed at earning money for Mr Navalny. Prosecutors have warned people against protesting in support of Mr Navalny on Saturday. Russia's education ministry has told parents not to allow their children to attend. Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' film Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Some Russian celebrities in the arts and sports have pledged support for Mr Navalny. They include ice hockey star Artemi Panarin. Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov - now a leading anti-Putin activist based in the US - tweeted that pro-Navalny posts were being widely blocked in Russia. Allow Twitter content?

In a phone call to President Putin on Friday, EU Council President Charles Michel voiced ""grave concern"" about the jailing of Mr Navalny. Mr Michel said the EU was ""united in its call on Russia to swiftly release Mr Navalny and proceed with the investigation into the assassination attempt on him, in full transparency and without further delay"". In October, the EU imposed sanctions on six top Russian officials and a Russian chemical weapons research centre over the Novichok poisoning of Mr Navalny. The Kremlin retaliated with tit-for-tat sanctions, denying any role in the attack and rejecting the expert finding that the Russian nerve agent had been used. The Black Sea palace allegedly features a casino, an ice rink and a vineyard The social media app TikTok has a flood of videos from Russians promoting the protests planned for Saturday. The messages about Mr Navalny have been going viral for several days. A well-known Russian TikTok user, Slava Varfolomeyev, told BBC Russian: ""I go on TikTok and find that every third video is about 'Putin's palace', the detention of Navalny and the 23 January rally!"" He said that on Thursday ""this swelled to a maximum: practically seven out of every 10 videos were on that topic [Navalny]"". TikTok's popularity is based on short-form videos. On Wednesday Russia's official media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, demanded that TikTok take down any information ""encouraging minors to act illegally"", threatening large fines.

LiveLivePM to lead briefing as R number falls in UK2 minutes ago,"There is some evidence the new UK variant may be linked to a higher degree of mortality, PM tells press conference The chance of dying from it could be 30-40% higher than the old variant but data is uncertain There are more than 38,000 people in hospital, 78% more than at peak of the first wave, Boris Johnson adds The number of people catching the virus is âturning the cornerâ but from an exceptionally high level, chief medical officer Chris Whitty says A further 1,401 people have died in the UK with coronavirus within 28 days of a positive test UK R rate estimated to be between 0.8 and 1 - meaning the outbreak could now be shrinking Edited by Martha Buckley We're closing our live coverage of the pandemic for today. Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates throughout the day. Our coverage was brought to you by: James Clarke, Martha Buckley, Becky Morton, George Bowden, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Katie Wright, Gavin Stamp, Lucy Webster and Francesca Gillett. It's been another fairly busy day for coronavirus news, with Boris Johnson giving a press conference earlier. Here's a recap of the top headlines: People who drove 20 miles and then queued for two hours to get fresh milk from a farm's vending machine have been fined for breaching lockdown rules. The farmers who own the vending machine, Einion and Elliw Jones, in Trelogan near Holywell, say they feel North Wales Police have got ""it in for us"". They said even people living nearby were facing being fined, despite the force accepting milk was ""an essential item"". In Wales Covid  rules tell people to ""stay at home"" except for essential reasons, which include buying food. Welsh government guidance on the rules says there are no limits on how far people can travel to shop for essential items, but urge people to stay as ""local to your home as possible"". Ms Jones said some customers from ""just down the road"" in Trelawnyd and Mostyn had even been told they shouldn't be there. The police said the farm was working with the local council to ensure it was ""Covid-compliant surrounding queuing, social distancing etc"". There's more on this story here. New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. There is some evidence that the one that has become dominant in the UK may be associated with a higher degree of mortality, says PM Boris Johnson. Scientists are urgently studying these mutated versions to understand what threat they pose. So how worrying are the new UK, South Africa and Brazil coronavirus variants? The BBC's Michelle Roberts has a look at the evidencehere. Former tennis world number oneAndy Murray will miss the Australian Open having failed to find a ""workable quarantine""as he recovers from coronavirus. The 33-year-old Briton was set to fly out to Melbourne last week, but was not allowed to travel on a charter flight after being found to have Covid-19. The Victorian state government has put in place strict measures to allow players to fly into the country for the tournament, which starts on 8 February. Murray says: ""Gutted to share that I won't be flying out to Australia to compete at the Australian Open. ""We've been in constant dialogue with Tennis Australia to try and find a solution which would allow some form of workable quarantine, but we couldn't make it work. The famous Rovers Return pub on the set of Coronation Street ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are both seeing their filming schedules hit by the pandemic. An ITV spokeswoman confirms Emmerdale stopped filming last week after some members of the team tested positive for Covid-19. She adds they will return to filming on Monday. Meanwhile, Coronation Street will pause filming for two weeks on Monday ""to undertake some rewriting of stories and scripts as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic"". However, the break will not affect its TV schedule and the show will still be on six times a week, a statement adds. The news that the new variant of coronavirus may be more deadly is ""deeply alarming,"" said the shadow health secretary, ""not least
because Boris Johnson assured the nation back in December there was no evidence
the variant was more dangerous."" Jonathan Ashworth said: âWe urge
ministers to go further and faster on vaccination rollout now to save lives,
and introduce proper financial support for those needing to isolate to help
breaks chains of transmission.â  This video can not be played Covid: Wedding party in Stamford Hill broken up by police One of today's top stories about coronavirus in the UK has been police discovering people gathered at a wedding party in north London last night. Originally the police said 400 people had attended - but they have now revised that number down to 150. In a statement, the Met Police said: ""Although
initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now
believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" The organisers of the wedding party - which was held at a strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school in Stamford Hill - face fines. The Met said one organiser would be reported for consideration of a Â£10,000 fine while five other attendees were issued with Â£200 fixed penalty notices. ""This afternoon, an investigation has been launched to identify those others responsible for organising and who attended the wedding,"" the Met added. Read the full story here. There is still âa lot of uncertaintyâ about just how severe
the new UK variant is, according to another of the government's scientific advisers. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government's Scientific
Advisory Group on Emergencies, said the figures given during the Downing Street briefing suggested an increase of something like
30 to 40% in terms of mortality which âreally ties in with what weâre seeing in
the hospitalsâ. Speaking to Radio 4âs PM programme, he said: âIt is
obviously a blow. We were rather hoping that this virus was going to be quite
genetically stable. âThe realisation that this virus is capable of relatively
fast mutation and development of new variantsâ¦ has been a bit of a setback for
us.â Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent With new variants emerging in
different parts of the world, itâs worth highlighting Boris Johnsonâs comments
about borders. It seems pretty clear ministers are considering more
restrictions on people coming into the UK â to stop those variants coming into
the UK if possible. In the PMâs words, the UK may have to further to âprotect
our bordersâ. Reality Check Itâs impossible to say
exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being
in contact with someone who has tested positive, however
some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from
September suggests just 10.9% of peopleremained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report
when arguing people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it
suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do âto go to workâ. Most people reported going out for
things such as shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they
needed to quarantine as they didnât develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done
before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of
just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies (Sage) has also highlighted research that shows most peopleappear to be following the rules,external. This research also suggests those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate
than those better off. - By Ben Butcher Friday's coronavirus briefing was led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was joined by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser. Here's what they told us: Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether delaying the second vaccine dose risks creating more resistant variants of the virus. Patrick Vallance says the riskiest thing in terms of new mutations is high prevalence in the community. He says the mutations currently circulating came about naturally due to transmission - but adds there is always ""some risk"" when there is partial immunity. But he says that partial immunity also provides benefits in terms of protection for the most vulnerable. Chris Whitty says, ""Our overall view was that the balance of risks was in favour of having many more people in the UK vaccinated."" On support for businesses and jobs, the PM says the government will ""do what it takes"" to support livelihoods. And with that, he ends today's No 10 briefing. Asked whether the British public are
ready for lockdown to stay in place for a long time, the prime minister says we will have
to live with coronavirus for âa long while to comeâ but it is an open question ""when and in what way"" we can start to relax restrictions. He says it depends on the vaccine rollout going well, getting
case numbers down and whether there are discoveries of any more variants. That doesnât mean that ""Iâm not optimistic"" about the rollout of the vaccine, he says, âbut at this stage you
really have to be very cautious indeedâ. He adds that the first thing that the government wants to open is
schools, which is a priority. Patrick Vallance says he expects the virus âto be around, probably, forever"" but it is going to be controlled. However, he says it is a very different outlook with
increasing numbers of treatments and vaccines, but the key is ânot getting too
hooked up on specific datesâ. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The new variant has been causing
concern in government for a number of weeks. Now the scientists believe there
is some early evidence it could be causing slightly higher mortality â when you
look at everyone testing positive. The overall message from the prime minister
is pretty bleak, Iâm afraid; that the terrible death figures weâve seen in
recent days will continue for a while. We donât seem to heading for a tighter
lockdown in England because the PM believes the current measures are the right
ones if people follow them. But there was a clear message there that we canât
start unlocking society until the rates come down significantly â weâre in this
for a while. The Daily Telegraph's Gordon Raynor raises a video he says has been posted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock aimed at travel agents, suggesting the South African variant is 50% less susceptible to vaccines than the original strain of the virus. He asks whether this is correct and, if so, whether it will affect the government's approach to whether to tighten UK border controls. The PM runs through the measures that the UK has in place, including the ban on direct flights from South Africa and ""rigorous"" obligations for people entering the UK in terms of quarantine and tests. But he suggests ""we may need to go further to protect our borders"", saying the massive progress the UK is making in terms of vaccinations cannot be undermined.  Sky News's Sam Coates asks whether, if the new variant is more dangerous, it is right that more people are ""out and about"" during the current lockdown than the first one last year. The PM says that ""we are enforcing the law very strictly with increasing toughness"", meaning increased fines to dissuade risky behaviour. ""It depends on everybody doing the right thing and avoiding transmission,"" he says, adding that is  what will be more effective than police action. On why the new variant may be transmitting more readily, Sir Patrick Vallance says it is not believed the new variant has a higher viral load, meaning people ""shed more virus"". He suggests it may be other factors that make it more transmissible. On the current infection rate, Chris Whitty says that while infections are slowly going down ""it is at a very, very high level"". He says that among some age groups - including those 20 to 30 - infections may still be increasing. And on hospitalisations, he says that they are ""broadly flat"" for the UK as a whole, but there are variations between regions. ""That peak is not yet definitely going down yet,"" he says. Deaths will be delayed further with the peak expected in the future, he adds. This video can not be played Infection level 'very, very high' and 'extremely precarious' - Prof Whitty The next question asks about whether the UK variant means
lockdown restrictions will last longer. The prime minister says he thinks the country has âthe right package of
measuresâ to deal with the new variant and people need to comply with them. He says there are signs in the data that infections are
flattening, although the rates are still âvery highâ so the government âcanât begin
to consider unlockingâ. The vaccination programme could change this, he says, but the
UK is in a position where cases are so high that unlocking could lead to âa big
reboundâ. Asked whether the South African variant is in the UK, Patrick
Vallance says some cases have been detected but he says the key thing is to try to contain it. He adds that âthere is no evidenceâ that the South African or
Brazilian variants have transmission advantages over the variants already in
the UK and so having cases here doesnât mean âthey will take offâ. Now we move on to questions from journalists, the first of which is from the BBC's health editor, Hugh Pym. In light of the information about the danger posed by the new variant, he asks the PM whether he expects the current death trends to rise more steeply and then fall more slowly. In response, the PM says there was a big surge in deaths over the Christmas period which is continuing and he sadly believes this will continue to be so ""for a while to come"". Prof Whitty says the ""shape of the curve"" is driven by the rate of infections, which has been going up and is now coming down. Sir Patrick says the death numbers are ""awful"" and are likely to continue at current levels for some while, saying this is what was predicted for some time. In response to a separate question about evidence emerging from Israel that the Pfizer-BioTech vaccine might not be as effective as first thought, Sir Patrick says there needs to be further research but overall the efficacy of the approved vaccines is proven. The second question from a member of the public comes from Sally, from Oxfordshire, who asks whether those who have been vaccinated are allowed to mix together with others who have had a jab. Chris Whitty says that - even with the very effective vaccines - there is a period of time straight after a jab ""where there is no effect"". He says people won't see protection for around two to three weeks following their vaccination - and even then ""that protection will not be complete"". He says a large proportion of people in the community have currently got the virus - ""so the risk is if you have the vaccine you still have some residual risk"". Whitty adds that the lockdown is helping to get the rates of infection right down - to allow those who have been vaccinated more protection. ""Over time, the answer will be yes - but at this point in time the answer will be no,"" he says. Sir Patrick Vallance adds there is uncertainty around the vaccine's role in preventing transmission of the virus. Â© 2025 BBC.

The farmers who own the vending machine, Einion and Elliw Jones, in Trelogan near Holywell, say they feel North Wales Police have got ""it in for us"". They said even people living nearby were facing being fined, despite the force accepting milk was ""an essential item"". In Wales Covid  rules tell people to ""stay at home"" except for essential reasons, which include buying food. Welsh government guidance on the rules says there are no limits on how far people can travel to shop for essential items, but urge people to stay as ""local to your home as possible"". Ms Jones said some customers from ""just down the road"" in Trelawnyd and Mostyn had even been told they shouldn't be there. The police said the farm was working with the local council to ensure it was ""Covid-compliant surrounding queuing, social distancing etc"". There's more on this story here. New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. There is some evidence that the one that has become dominant in the UK may be associated with a higher degree of mortality, says PM Boris Johnson. Scientists are urgently studying these mutated versions to understand what threat they pose. So how worrying are the new UK, South Africa and Brazil coronavirus variants? The BBC's Michelle Roberts has a look at the evidencehere. Former tennis world number oneAndy Murray will miss the Australian Open having failed to find a ""workable quarantine""as he recovers from coronavirus. The 33-year-old Briton was set to fly out to Melbourne last week, but was not allowed to travel on a charter flight after being found to have Covid-19. The Victorian state government has put in place strict measures to allow players to fly into the country for the tournament, which starts on 8 February. Murray says: ""Gutted to share that I won't be flying out to Australia to compete at the Australian Open. ""We've been in constant dialogue with Tennis Australia to try and find a solution which would allow some form of workable quarantine, but we couldn't make it work. The famous Rovers Return pub on the set of Coronation Street ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are both seeing their filming schedules hit by the pandemic. An ITV spokeswoman confirms Emmerdale stopped filming last week after some members of the team tested positive for Covid-19. She adds they will return to filming on Monday. Meanwhile, Coronation Street will pause filming for two weeks on Monday ""to undertake some rewriting of stories and scripts as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic"". However, the break will not affect its TV schedule and the show will still be on six times a week, a statement adds. The news that the new variant of coronavirus may be more deadly is ""deeply alarming,"" said the shadow health secretary, ""not least
because Boris Johnson assured the nation back in December there was no evidence
the variant was more dangerous."" Jonathan Ashworth said: âWe urge
ministers to go further and faster on vaccination rollout now to save lives,
and introduce proper financial support for those needing to isolate to help
breaks chains of transmission.â  This video can not be played Covid: Wedding party in Stamford Hill broken up by police One of today's top stories about coronavirus in the UK has been police discovering people gathered at a wedding party in north London last night. Originally the police said 400 people had attended - but they have now revised that number down to 150. In a statement, the Met Police said: ""Although
initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now
believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" The organisers of the wedding party - which was held at a strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school in Stamford Hill - face fines. The Met said one organiser would be reported for consideration of a Â£10,000 fine while five other attendees were issued with Â£200 fixed penalty notices. ""This afternoon, an investigation has been launched to identify those others responsible for organising and who attended the wedding,"" the Met added. Read the full story here. There is still âa lot of uncertaintyâ about just how severe
the new UK variant is, according to another of the government's scientific advisers. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government's Scientific
Advisory Group on Emergencies, said the figures given during the Downing Street briefing suggested an increase of something like
30 to 40% in terms of mortality which âreally ties in with what weâre seeing in
the hospitalsâ. Speaking to Radio 4âs PM programme, he said: âIt is
obviously a blow. We were rather hoping that this virus was going to be quite
genetically stable. âThe realisation that this virus is capable of relatively
fast mutation and development of new variantsâ¦ has been a bit of a setback for
us.â Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent With new variants emerging in
different parts of the world, itâs worth highlighting Boris Johnsonâs comments
about borders. It seems pretty clear ministers are considering more
restrictions on people coming into the UK â to stop those variants coming into
the UK if possible. In the PMâs words, the UK may have to further to âprotect
our bordersâ. Reality Check Itâs impossible to say
exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being
in contact with someone who has tested positive, however
some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from
September suggests just 10.9% of peopleremained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report
when arguing people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it
suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do âto go to workâ. Most people reported going out for
things such as shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they
needed to quarantine as they didnât develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done
before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of
just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies (Sage) has also highlighted research that shows most peopleappear to be following the rules,external. This research also suggests those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate
than those better off. - By Ben Butcher Friday's coronavirus briefing was led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was joined by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser. Here's what they told us: Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether delaying the second vaccine dose risks creating more resistant variants of the virus. Patrick Vallance says the riskiest thing in terms of new mutations is high prevalence in the community. He says the mutations currently circulating came about naturally due to transmission - but adds there is always ""some risk"" when there is partial immunity. But he says that partial immunity also provides benefits in terms of protection for the most vulnerable. Chris Whitty says, ""Our overall view was that the balance of risks was in favour of having many more people in the UK vaccinated."" On support for businesses and jobs, the PM says the government will ""do what it takes"" to support livelihoods. And with that, he ends today's No 10 briefing. Asked whether the British public are
ready for lockdown to stay in place for a long time, the prime minister says we will have
to live with coronavirus for âa long while to comeâ but it is an open question ""when and in what way"" we can start to relax restrictions. He says it depends on the vaccine rollout going well, getting
case numbers down and whether there are discoveries of any more variants. That doesnât mean that ""Iâm not optimistic"" about the rollout of the vaccine, he says, âbut at this stage you
really have to be very cautious indeedâ. He adds that the first thing that the government wants to open is
schools, which is a priority. Patrick Vallance says he expects the virus âto be around, probably, forever"" but it is going to be controlled. However, he says it is a very different outlook with
increasing numbers of treatments and vaccines, but the key is ânot getting too
hooked up on specific datesâ. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The new variant has been causing
concern in government for a number of weeks. Now the scientists believe there
is some early evidence it could be causing slightly higher mortality â when you
look at everyone testing positive. The overall message from the prime minister
is pretty bleak, Iâm afraid; that the terrible death figures weâve seen in
recent days will continue for a while. We donât seem to heading for a tighter
lockdown in England because the PM believes the current measures are the right
ones if people follow them. But there was a clear message there that we canât
start unlocking society until the rates come down significantly â weâre in this
for a while. The Daily Telegraph's Gordon Raynor raises a video he says has been posted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock aimed at travel agents, suggesting the South African variant is 50% less susceptible to vaccines than the original strain of the virus. He asks whether this is correct and, if so, whether it will affect the government's approach to whether to tighten UK border controls. The PM runs through the measures that the UK has in place, including the ban on direct flights from South Africa and ""rigorous"" obligations for people entering the UK in terms of quarantine and tests. But he suggests ""we may need to go further to protect our borders"", saying the massive progress the UK is making in terms of vaccinations cannot be undermined.  Sky News's Sam Coates asks whether, if the new variant is more dangerous, it is right that more people are ""out and about"" during the current lockdown than the first one last year. The PM says that ""we are enforcing the law very strictly with increasing toughness"", meaning increased fines to dissuade risky behaviour. ""It depends on everybody doing the right thing and avoiding transmission,"" he says, adding that is  what will be more effective than police action. On why the new variant may be transmitting more readily, Sir Patrick Vallance says it is not believed the new variant has a higher viral load, meaning people ""shed more virus"". He suggests it may be other factors that make it more transmissible. On the current infection rate, Chris Whitty says that while infections are slowly going down ""it is at a very, very high level"". He says that among some age groups - including those 20 to 30 - infections may still be increasing. And on hospitalisations, he says that they are ""broadly flat"" for the UK as a whole, but there are variations between regions. ""That peak is not yet definitely going down yet,"" he says. Deaths will be delayed further with the peak expected in the future, he adds. This video can not be played Infection level 'very, very high' and 'extremely precarious' - Prof Whitty The next question asks about whether the UK variant means
lockdown restrictions will last longer. The prime minister says he thinks the country has âthe right package of
measuresâ to deal with the new variant and people need to comply with them. He says there are signs in the data that infections are
flattening, although the rates are still âvery highâ so the government âcanât begin
to consider unlockingâ. The vaccination programme could change this, he says, but the
UK is in a position where cases are so high that unlocking could lead to âa big
reboundâ. Asked whether the South African variant is in the UK, Patrick
Vallance says some cases have been detected but he says the key thing is to try to contain it. He adds that âthere is no evidenceâ that the South African or
Brazilian variants have transmission advantages over the variants already in
the UK and so having cases here doesnât mean âthey will take offâ. Now we move on to questions from journalists, the first of which is from the BBC's health editor, Hugh Pym. In light of the information about the danger posed by the new variant, he asks the PM whether he expects the current death trends to rise more steeply and then fall more slowly. In response, the PM says there was a big surge in deaths over the Christmas period which is continuing and he sadly believes this will continue to be so ""for a while to come"". Prof Whitty says the ""shape of the curve"" is driven by the rate of infections, which has been going up and is now coming down. Sir Patrick says the death numbers are ""awful"" and are likely to continue at current levels for some while, saying this is what was predicted for some time. In response to a separate question about evidence emerging from Israel that the Pfizer-BioTech vaccine might not be as effective as first thought, Sir Patrick says there needs to be further research but overall the efficacy of the approved vaccines is proven. The second question from a member of the public comes from Sally, from Oxfordshire, who asks whether those who have been vaccinated are allowed to mix together with others who have had a jab. Chris Whitty says that - even with the very effective vaccines - there is a period of time straight after a jab ""where there is no effect"". He says people won't see protection for around two to three weeks following their vaccination - and even then ""that protection will not be complete"". He says a large proportion of people in the community have currently got the virus - ""so the risk is if you have the vaccine you still have some residual risk"". Whitty adds that the lockdown is helping to get the rates of infection right down - to allow those who have been vaccinated more protection. ""Over time, the answer will be yes - but at this point in time the answer will be no,"" he says. Sir Patrick Vallance adds there is uncertainty around the vaccine's role in preventing transmission of the virus. Â© 2025 BBC.

Shoppers stuck at home shun new clothes in 2020,"Shoppers bought far fewer clothes last year as lockdowns meant people had less opportunity to socialise and go out. Clothes sales slumped 25%, the biggest drop in 23 years when records began,official figures suggest.,external While shops have reported demand for certain clothing such as pyjamas and loungewear has risen, demand for going-out items has fallen sharply. And despite a pick-up in December, clothing sales remain lower than before the pandemic struck. ""With few opportunities to socialise during lockdown and many people working from home, the clothing sector has been one of the ""worst-affected by restrictions"", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Earlier this month, Marks & Spencer said sales of sleepwear had soared Growing numbers of High Street shops have faced financial difficulties due to the temporary store closures imposed during lockdowns. Topshop-owner Arcadia and competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed last March. The inability to try clothes on in bricks-and-mortar shops, as well as restrictions on eating out meaning consumers are going out less, have all affected sales, the ONS suggested. And the slump in demand for fashion meant that British retail sales saw their largest annual fall on record in 2020. Sales fell by 1.9% last year, when compared with 2019, the largest year-on-year fall since records began in 1997. Retail sales, including fuel, did see a small increase last month, growing by 0.3% when compared with November. It came following the end of England's national lockdown on 2 December.Sales had slumped by 4.1% in Novemberduring a month-long shutdown. But ""this was very clearly not a Merry Christmas for most of the High Street"", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""For most retailers it's the most crucial month of the year to get profit back on track but the large upswing in sales after the pain of the November lockdowns didn't materialise,"" she said. ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said that some sectors, however, had been ""able to buck the trend"" last year. Lockdown fashion: 'People are back in pyjamas' High Street crisis: 'Regular customers are keeping us going' Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years' Pre-Christmas lockdown restrictions hit retail sales ""The increased popularity of click-and-collect and people buying more items from home led to a strong year for overall internet sales, with record highs for food and household goods sales online."" In a sign of the way the pandemic has changed shopping habits, the value of online retail sales jumped by 46.1% in 2020 when compared with 2019 - the highest annual growth reported since 2008. Online trade now accounts for more than one-third of all retail sales. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, explained that the rise of online had ""polarised industry performance"". ""The gap widened between those retailers with the most sophisticated online propositions from those with legacy store-dependent business models,"" he said. Online-only retailers such as Boohoo and Asos, for example, have reported strong sales figures in 2020. Supermarkets in particular have embraced the shift to digital, with online food store sales up 79.3% last year. There was also better news from the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, on Friday. It said that it would return a Â£300m emergency coronavirus loan to the government as trading went ""better than anticipated"" over Christmas. Today's figures show just how badly the clothing sector has been affected these last 12 months. Fashion is the big retail loser from this pandemic. Who needs to splash out on the latest trends when we're working from home and not going out? And even when clothing shops are open, chances are you can't try things on. With all of the Covid-19 measures in place, the fun has been sucked out of shopping. We haven't stopped spending, but most of it is going online. Boohoo and Asos have seen very strong sales growth, for instance. The going's far harder for retailers with large numbers of physical stores. The pressures have already taken their toll on the likes of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group and Debenhams. And things may well get worse on the high street before they better. Many retailers are worried about the end of the business rates holiday and of the temporary ban on eviction for non payment of rent in April. These will result in a big increase in costs when sales have yet to fully recover. But Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, called for more help for non-essential shops and High Street retailers who continue to be affected by lockdown restrictions. ""With no end in sight for retailers closed in lockdown, many will struggle to survive under a mounting rent burden, and a return to full business rates in April,"" she said. She called on government to offer ""targeted"" business rates relief to businesses worst-affected by the pandemic. ""Decisive action is needed to save jobs, shops and local communities, with town and city centres looking to be particularly hard hit unless the government acts now."" Earlier in January, a report from the Centre for Retail Research said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, because of the acceleration towards online shopping. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, it said.

LiveLiveBiden to boost food aid to reduce US Covid toll3 minutes ago,"The new administration in the US is undertaking a ""comprehensive threat assessment on domestic extremism"" It follows the deadly storming of the Congress building by pro-Trump rioters on 6 January The attack led to the second impeachment of President Trump. His trial in the Senate is due to start next week President Joe Biden signs orders to expand federal food aid for millions of Americans The damage to the US economy from the coronavirus pandemic has left many families poorer and going hungry Edited by Jude Sheerin Biden's wife First Lady Jill Biden handed out biscuits to National Guard troops on Friday We're pausing our live coverage. It was a busy Friday as the new president spent his second full day in the top job:  Thanks for reading our live coverage. It was brought to you by Sam Cabral, Penny Spiller, Max Matza, Georgina Rannard, Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady and Alix Kroeger. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The future for Trump - and the political movement he rode to victory in 2016 - is murky. Over his career, he has been declared dead more times than Freddy Krueger and has always managed to wriggle free. Until now. In the days following the US Capitol riot, Trump's overall public approval rating precipitously dropped to the mid-30s - some of the lowest of his entire presidency. At first blush, the numbers would indicate that his political prospects have been mortally wounded. A deeper dive, however, paints a less dire picture for the ex-president. While Democrats, independents and some moderate Republicans are against him, his Republican base appears to be intact. Read Anthony's analysis of what Trump's future looks like. After the riot at the US Capitol, videos of Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman luring the mob away from the Senate chambers - and possibly saving lawmakers' lives - went viral. Several members of Congress have since credited his quick thinking for distracting the rioters, and called him a hero. Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House introduced a bill to award Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal. Today, another bipartisan group - in the Senate - is proposing identical legislation. The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded to Americans who have made ""distinguished achievements and contributions"" to their country. Lawmakers are showing their gratitude on social media, sharing pictures with Goodman. On Wednesday, he escorted Vice-President Kamala Harris to her inauguration ceremony. Allow Twitter content?

Here's why so many people think Goodman may have saved lives. Twice as many Americans have searched on Google for information about the impeachment of Joe Biden, compared to Donald Trump, in the last 24 hours. Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory,filed articles of impeachment against the new president yesterday,external. Greene accuses Biden of bribery and other abuses of power, citing unproven claims that the president used his official capacity to help his son's business dealings in Ukraine. She announced this on Twitter in a short video which now has nearly 10 million views. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Greene has been widely condemned, and even banned temporarily from Twitter, for spreading false information about the US election results. Filing articles of impeachment does not indicate action on behalf of Congress. Any representative can file articles of impeachment. In fact, Texas Democrat Al Green tried and failed three times against Donald Trump. However, as indicated by Google Trends, her efforts have clearly gained the attention of many Americans. One might think that more would be searching for news on ""Trump impeachment"" after the announcement by Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor on Friday. He announced the second impeachment trial of former President Trump would begin next week. But that is not the case. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked earlier if Biden had any comment on the ongoing violence seen this week in the streets of Portland and Seattle. Despite fears of conservative mobs following the riot at the Capitol, it has actually been left-wing protesters who have clashed with police in the days before and after Biden's inauguration. On the day Biden was inaugurated this week, demonstrators carrying anti-Biden and anti-police signs marched in Portland and smashed the windows of the Democratic Party of Oregon. Psaki told reporters: ""Certainly we had our team on the ground, our national security team, even before 12:01, early in the morning on Inauguration Day because we wanted to be able to monitor events happening across the country and any unrest that was resulting from the last couple of weeks."" ""I haven't spoke with him specifically about those events but it is something our national security team... is closely monitoring of course, but if we have an additional update I'm happy to provide it to you."" Conservative news outlets criticised Psaki for not taking the opportunity to condemn radical left-wing groups, such as antifa. Protests continued on Thursday, the first full day of the Biden presidency. Demonstrations, and sometimes rioting, have recurred in Seattle and Portland in the months since the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May. The Biden administration is causing confusion over whether it believes China has engaged in the genocide of its minority Uighur population White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not commit to calling alleged rights abuses by the Chinese government against the minority Uighur population a genocide during the briefing earlier. ""The president has spoken before to the horrific treatment of Uighurs but I don't have anything more for you on it,"" she told reporters. ""I can check with our national security team and see if we have a more up-to-date statement."" The response prompted questions as earlier this week, Biden's Secretary of State nominee Anthony Blinken confirmed that he agreed with the Trump administration assessment that China had engaged in genocide. And, during the election last year, the Biden campaign also called the situation ""unspeakable oppression"" and ""genocide"". Need a bit more context? China has faced global criticism over its alleged persecution of the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group living mostly in the north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang. It is believed that the Chinese government has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as ""re-education camps"". The government has also been accused of forcibly sterilising Uighur women, which it denies. After initially denying the existence of these camps, China now says they were a necessary measure against separatist violence in Xinjiang. Read more about China and the Uighurs here. The president said the US death toll from the coronavirus could shoot up by another 200,000 with or without action from the government. ""A lot of America is hurting,"" said Biden. ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" According to the Johns Hopkins University, 412,239 American lives have now been lost to the virus. Making his case in the White House before he signed two executive orders to provide pandemic relief, Biden  said: ""We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act."" In his final hours in office, Donald Trump issued dozens of pardons. Several of those charged in the Capitol riots hoped they would receive pardons, but none came. A lawyer for the so-called QAnon Shaman - the Viking-like invader whose image ricocheted around the world - is speaking out now about the snub. In what appears to be some kind of media offensive, attorney Al Watkins has told various local media outlets that his client Jake Angeli was âdupedâ by the words and actions of President Trump. âMr. Chansley, along with many others who were similarly situated, are now compelled to reconcile a betrayal by a man whose back they felt they had for years,â said Watkins. Chansley, 33, called the FBI the day after the riot to say he had been there âat the request of the president that all âpatriotsâ come to DC on January 6, 2021.â He has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct. The president has apologised that some members of the National Guard drafted to protect the capital from violence were forced to sleep in a garage this week. He also called on the National Guard Bureau chief to say sorry to the soldiers, who had been asked to leave the Congressional buildings. Pictures of the troops sleeping in the unheated car park provoked outrage on Thursday, with some state governors calling their soldiers home. On Friday Biden's wife First Lady Jill Biden visited some of the National Guard to thank them for their work and hand out cookies. Around 7,000 soldiers are expected to remain in Washington until mid-March, with the other 18,000 leaving in the coming weeks. They were posted to the city after violent pro-Trump supporters stormed Congress on 6 January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reacting to today's news, that the House will send Trump's impeachment article to the Senate on Monday, setting up his trial to begin Tuesday, Biden had this to say: ""I havenât heard the detail of it,"" he says. ""The more time we have to get up and running to meet these crises, the better."" His answer seemed to hint that he preferred the Republican timeline offer, which would have seen the trial pushed back until early February to give both sides to prepare. The now-viral photo of Bernie Sanders at Joe Biden's inauguration There's little sign that the Bernie Sanders meme from Biden's inauguration is going away. You'd be forgiven for thinking that the 79-year-old Senator was the star of the show on Wednesday after pictures of him wrapped up in a practical coat and woollen mittens went viral. Now Sanders' team have announced you can buy a jumper showing the meme to raise money for charity. TheChairman Sanders Crewneck is on sale for $45,external(Â£33), with all proceeds going to Meals on Wheels in Vermont, where Sanders lives. ""Due to overwhelming demand for this item, it will be 3-6 weeks until you receive your sweatshirt,"" the website warns. About the viral photo, Sanders said on Thursday, âI was just sitting there, trying to keep warm, trying to pay attention to what was going on.â Sanders has been appointed chairman of the powerful Senate Budget Committee. President Biden says, if the US government does not act ""decisively and boldly"" now, it will cause a lot of pain. ""We're in a national emergency,"" said Biden. ""We need to act like we're in a national emergency."" The executive orders that the president is signing today aim to expand access to food aid for low-income families and protect federal workers. He reiterated the sentiments previously expressed by other members of the administration, noting that more needs to be done because ""a lot of America is hurting"". He urged action from Congress on his $1.9tn Covid rescue package, warning that that there was no time to waste. ""I don't believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs. I believe Americans are going hungry and losing jobs."" The president says the first part of his plan is to ""get direct financial relief"" to those who need it most. ""With our American rescue plan, the economy would return to full employment a year sooner,"" Biden says. He adds that the administration is going to ""finish the job"" of getting a total of $2,000 (Â£1,450) in economic payments out to the people. ""If we fail to act, there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures,"" he adds. ""because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months."" ""This would overwhelm emergency shelters,"" he says, adding that displaced Americans will be at a higher risk of catching coronavirus if they are forced to live in places where they are unable to social distance. Biden is now speaking from the White House about his plans to take the US out of the economic recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. ""If we don't act - the rest of the world is not standing still,"" Biden says, warning: ""We need more action and we need to move fast.""  Earlier, we reported that former President Trump's impeachment trial is poised to begin next week, as the House submits the charge against him to the Senate. Watch the moment Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer announced the news of Trump's upcoming ""full and fair trial"" - and see Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell's response - below. This video can not be played Schumer: Trump will have a 'full and fair trial' It's day two of the Biden administration and the new president is already facing some pushback. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit over a decision to halt most deportations from the US for 100 days, saying the administration is in violation of an agreement with the state signed under President Trump. That agreement from 31 December says that the federal government must discuss immigration matters with the state and provide six months' notice before enacting policy changes. Ending it requires 180 days' notice. Paxton argued the state would face ""irreparable harm"" if the moratorium went through, Reuters news agency reported. The White House has declined to comment on the matter. The White House has just put out a statement marking the 48th anniversary of Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court decision that essentially legalised the right to abortion. ""In the past four years, reproductive health, including the right to choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack,""the statement from Biden and Harris begins,external. They go on to say they are committed to ""codifying"" the judgement, which means pass legislation through Congress that enshrines abortion access into law. They will also appoint judges who will support abortion access, they say. Trump, during his time in office, was able to give the Supreme Court a conservative majority, making anti-abortion activists hopeful that Roe v Wade could eventually be overturned. Biden was the only candidate during the primary to say he endorsed the so-called Hyde Amendment, which says that no federal funds can go towards abortions. After nearly all 22 other candidates came out against the Hyde Amendment, he reversed his stance. Although abortion is technically legal across the US, multiple states have instituted laws that make it nearly impossible in practice. Abortion activists hope that a law would make it more difficult for local governments to restrict access. President Biden will make a call to another foreign leader later today: Mexican president AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. The call was first announced on Twitter by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard ""The bilateral relationship moves forward with communication and understanding,"" said Ebrard. It will be Biden's second foreign call of the day. He will also speak to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The White House says it will provide readouts of the two calls later in the day. The BBC's North America Editor Jon Sopel asks about the prospects for a free trade deal between the US and UK. Is it months or years away? Just yesterday, Janet Yellen - the former head of the US central bank who's now in line to be treasury secretary - said Biden would not be signing any new deals because his priority right now is on domestic economy and infrastructure. ""I can't give you any timeline,"" press secretary Jen Psaki begins. She goes on to say that trade agreements that benefit American families are ""certainly"" being considered. ""At this point in time we're working to get the pandemic under control [and] provide economic relief to the American public,"" she says. Joe Biden's administration is making it a priority to address domestic extremism, press secretary Jen Psaki announced a few minutes ago. It comes after the violent attack on the Capitol on 6 January in which hundreds of pro-Trump Americans stormed Congress. Many are believed to have subscribed to extremist views after viewing radical material online. On Friday, the White House requested a ""comprehensive threat assessment about domestic violent extremism"" from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. The Capitol riot underscored ""what we have long known - the rise of domestic extremism is a serious and growing national security threat"", Psaki said. She underlined that the president aims to increase communication and the sharing of information between the agencies tracking the threat. Read about the Capitol arrests. Â© 2025 BBC.

His trial in the Senate is due to start next week President Joe Biden signs orders to expand federal food aid for millions of Americans The damage to the US economy from the coronavirus pandemic has left many families poorer and going hungry Edited by Jude Sheerin Biden's wife First Lady Jill Biden handed out biscuits to National Guard troops on Friday We're pausing our live coverage. It was a busy Friday as the new president spent his second full day in the top job:  Thanks for reading our live coverage. It was brought to you by Sam Cabral, Penny Spiller, Max Matza, Georgina Rannard, Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady and Alix Kroeger. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The future for Trump - and the political movement he rode to victory in 2016 - is murky. Over his career, he has been declared dead more times than Freddy Krueger and has always managed to wriggle free. Until now. In the days following the US Capitol riot, Trump's overall public approval rating precipitously dropped to the mid-30s - some of the lowest of his entire presidency. At first blush, the numbers would indicate that his political prospects have been mortally wounded. A deeper dive, however, paints a less dire picture for the ex-president. While Democrats, independents and some moderate Republicans are against him, his Republican base appears to be intact. Read Anthony's analysis of what Trump's future looks like. After the riot at the US Capitol, videos of Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman luring the mob away from the Senate chambers - and possibly saving lawmakers' lives - went viral. Several members of Congress have since credited his quick thinking for distracting the rioters, and called him a hero. Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House introduced a bill to award Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal. Today, another bipartisan group - in the Senate - is proposing identical legislation. The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded to Americans who have made ""distinguished achievements and contributions"" to their country. Lawmakers are showing their gratitude on social media, sharing pictures with Goodman. On Wednesday, he escorted Vice-President Kamala Harris to her inauguration ceremony. Allow Twitter content?

Here's why so many people think Goodman may have saved lives. Twice as many Americans have searched on Google for information about the impeachment of Joe Biden, compared to Donald Trump, in the last 24 hours. Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory,filed articles of impeachment against the new president yesterday,external. Greene accuses Biden of bribery and other abuses of power, citing unproven claims that the president used his official capacity to help his son's business dealings in Ukraine. She announced this on Twitter in a short video which now has nearly 10 million views. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Greene has been widely condemned, and even banned temporarily from Twitter, for spreading false information about the US election results. Filing articles of impeachment does not indicate action on behalf of Congress. Any representative can file articles of impeachment. In fact, Texas Democrat Al Green tried and failed three times against Donald Trump. However, as indicated by Google Trends, her efforts have clearly gained the attention of many Americans. One might think that more would be searching for news on ""Trump impeachment"" after the announcement by Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor on Friday. He announced the second impeachment trial of former President Trump would begin next week. But that is not the case. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked earlier if Biden had any comment on the ongoing violence seen this week in the streets of Portland and Seattle. Despite fears of conservative mobs following the riot at the Capitol, it has actually been left-wing protesters who have clashed with police in the days before and after Biden's inauguration. On the day Biden was inaugurated this week, demonstrators carrying anti-Biden and anti-police signs marched in Portland and smashed the windows of the Democratic Party of Oregon. Psaki told reporters: ""Certainly we had our team on the ground, our national security team, even before 12:01, early in the morning on Inauguration Day because we wanted to be able to monitor events happening across the country and any unrest that was resulting from the last couple of weeks."" ""I haven't spoke with him specifically about those events but it is something our national security team... is closely monitoring of course, but if we have an additional update I'm happy to provide it to you."" Conservative news outlets criticised Psaki for not taking the opportunity to condemn radical left-wing groups, such as antifa. Protests continued on Thursday, the first full day of the Biden presidency. Demonstrations, and sometimes rioting, have recurred in Seattle and Portland in the months since the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May. The Biden administration is causing confusion over whether it believes China has engaged in the genocide of its minority Uighur population White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not commit to calling alleged rights abuses by the Chinese government against the minority Uighur population a genocide during the briefing earlier. ""The president has spoken before to the horrific treatment of Uighurs but I don't have anything more for you on it,"" she told reporters. ""I can check with our national security team and see if we have a more up-to-date statement."" The response prompted questions as earlier this week, Biden's Secretary of State nominee Anthony Blinken confirmed that he agreed with the Trump administration assessment that China had engaged in genocide. And, during the election last year, the Biden campaign also called the situation ""unspeakable oppression"" and ""genocide"". Need a bit more context? China has faced global criticism over its alleged persecution of the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group living mostly in the north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang. It is believed that the Chinese government has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as ""re-education camps"". The government has also been accused of forcibly sterilising Uighur women, which it denies. After initially denying the existence of these camps, China now says they were a necessary measure against separatist violence in Xinjiang. Read more about China and the Uighurs here. The president said the US death toll from the coronavirus could shoot up by another 200,000 with or without action from the government. ""A lot of America is hurting,"" said Biden. ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" According to the Johns Hopkins University, 412,239 American lives have now been lost to the virus. Making his case in the White House before he signed two executive orders to provide pandemic relief, Biden  said: ""We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act."" In his final hours in office, Donald Trump issued dozens of pardons. Several of those charged in the Capitol riots hoped they would receive pardons, but none came. A lawyer for the so-called QAnon Shaman - the Viking-like invader whose image ricocheted around the world - is speaking out now about the snub.

"Bond film release delayed for third timeThe premiere of No Time To Die, Daniel Craig's final 007 outing, is pushed back again due to Covid.Entertainment & ArtsComments","Daniel Craig with director Cary Joji Fukunaga on the No Time To Die set in 2019 The release of the next James Bond film has been delayed for a third time because of the coronavirus pandemic. No Time To Die had already been pushed back twice, and will now debut globally on 8 October,an announcement on the film's website,externalsaid. It had originally been due to hit screens in April 2020. The film is the 25th instalment in the Bond franchise, and marks Daniel Craig's final appearance as British secret service agent 007. It also features Lea Seydoux and Rami Malek. The delay will come as a further blow to cinemas that have been forced to shut for months at a time because of lockdowns. Earlier this week, leading film-makers including Danny Boyle and Sir Steve McQueen wrote to the UK Government, calling for financial support for cinema chains because ""UK cinema stands on the edge of an abyss"". Directors ask government to support cinema chains Film-going could 'become extinct' warns director Cineworld said in October, when No Time To Die was pushed back for the second time, thatdelays to big budget releases meant the industry was ""unviable"". Bond's latest move sparked a flurry of other delays to major releases. Sony has pushed back Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Peter Rabbit 2, Jared Leto's Morbius, Tom Holland's Uncharted and Cinderella, which will star singer Camila Cabello; while Universal has moved Tom Hanks' Bios from April to November.

The UK Cinema Association said the decision to postpone No Time To Die again, ""while clearly disappointing, is at the same time not surprising given the current situation around Covid-19 in the UK as well as the US and other major film territories"". The postponement of Daniel Craig's swansong and other films ""underlines the need for ongoing support for the UK cinema sector"", the trade body's chief executive Phil Clapp said. The association is calling on the government to provide ""direct funding"" to chains, which represent 80% of ticket sales. One of the major chains, Vue, said the delay was ""understandable"", and that the continuing attempts to release the film in cinemas ""is further testament to our shared belief in a bright future for the big screen"". However, the latest postponement could stoke speculation that the film may ultimately skip cinemas and be released on a streaming platform. Major Disney titles like Pixar's Soul and its live-action remake of Mulan bypassed cinemas, premiering instead on the Disney+ streaming service. Wonder Woman 1984, meanwhile, was made available in the US on the HBO Max streaming service on the same day it received a limited cinema release. Last year, Warner Bros announced its 2021 titles - including sci-fi epic Dune and The Matrix 4 - would all adopt a similar dual release pattern, escalating tensions between Hollywood and US movie theatres. Rami Malek plays the villainous Safin in the thrice-delayed film The Dig, a new historical drama starring Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, was due to be released in selected UK cinemas this month. Now, the film will only be available on Netflix from 29 January. Asked whether No Time To Die might go down the same route, Fiennes - who will reprise his role as M in the film - recently told BBC News: ""That's a good question and I'm not really in a position to answer it. ""I would love the idea that people could go to the cinema and have the full effect of the big-screen energy behind the Bond, but I'm sure it's something the people who make these executive decisions are probably considering. ""I really hope we come through this so people can go to the cinema. Maybe they just have to hold their nerve. But of course we don't know, and there may be financial reasons or imperatives that [mean] they have to put it on a streaming system."" If No Time To Die is indeed released in cinemas in October, it will arrive a full six years on from the release of its 2015 predecessor Spectre. That won't be far behind the six years and four months that separated the release of Licence to Kill in summer 1989 and GoldenEye in late 1995 - the biggest gap between two Bond films. The last Bond film, 2015's Spectre, took almost $900m (Â£690m) at worldwide box offices. Other blockbusters to have been delayed by the pandemic include action sequel Top Gun: Maverick and Marvel's Black Widow. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Police break up 400-person wedding party,"Guests fled when officers arrived at the Stamford Hill school, where the windows had been covered Police broke up a wedding party in north London, where they now say about 150 people had gathered. Officers found the windows at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School, in Stamford Hill, had been covered when they arrived at 21:15 GMT on Thursday. Guests fled from the strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school when the police arrived. The organisers face a Â£10,000 fine for breaking lockdown rules. The Met originally claimed that about 400 guests were at the gathering. In a statement, the school said its hall had been leased out. A spokesman for the school, whose principal Rabbi Avrahom Pinter died in April after contracting coronavirus, said ""we had no knowledge that the wedding was taking place"". He added: ""We are absolutely horrified about last night's event and condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" Boris Johnson supports the police for ""taking action against people who flagrantly and selfishly ignore the rules"", according to the prime minister's official spokesman. The spokesman said: ""Large gatherings such as that pose a health risk, not just to those who attend but those who they live with or others who they may come into contact with.""

Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, meanwhile, said the ""overwhelming majority"" of the Jewish community would be appalled at the event. Rabbi Mirvis, who serves as the head of the UK's orthodox Jewish community but is not the leader of the Charedi group, called the wedding party ""a most shameful desecration of all that we hold dear"".

They are then seen arriving at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School. Det Ch Sup Marcus Barnett of the Met Police said: ""This was a completely unacceptable breach of the law. ""People across the country are making sacrifices by cancelling or postponing weddings and other celebrations and there is no excuse for this type of behaviour. ""My officers are working tirelessly with the community and we will not hesitate to take enforcement action if that is required to keep people safe."" On Friday morning, a security guard at the school told the BBC there were more like 100 guests at the party than the much higher number given out by police. The Met later said in a statement: ""Although initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" Stamford Hill is part of the borough of Hackney, which has a Covid-19 infection rate of 625.43 cases per 100,000 people. The England average rate is 471.31 per 100,000 people. The mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that the wedding party had taken place, despite ""the number of lives that have already been lost in the Charedi community and across the borough"". He added: ""Unfortunately, similar events have taken place even at this venue before and we need to be really clear how unacceptable it is.

Nissan commits to keep making cars in Sunderland,"Nissan's car plant in Sunderland is the UK's biggest and employs 6,000 people directly Japanese car maker Nissan has told the BBC its Sunderland plant is secure for the long term as a result of the trade deal reached between the UK and the EU. It said it will move additional battery production close to the plant where it has 6,000 direct employees and supports nearly 70,000 jobs in the supply chain. Currently, the batteries in its Leaf electric cars are imported from Japan. Nissan would not confirm if this would mean additional jobs at Sunderland, which is the UK's largest car plant. Manufacturing the more powerful batteries in the UK will ensure its cars comply with trade rules agreed with the EU requiring at least 55% of the car's value to be derived from either the UK or the EU to qualify for zero tariffs when exported to the EU. Some 70% of the cars made in Sunderland are exported and the vast majority of them are sold in the EU. Nissan warns on its UK future without a Brexit deal Scrapped 4x4 plant plans 'not down to Brexit' Nissan had issued stark warnings last year that if the UK left the EU without a trade deal, the resulting tariffs on cars and components would make the Sunderland plant ""unsustainable"". Nissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta told the BBC: ""The Brexit deal is positive for Nissan. Being the largest automaker in the UK we are taking this opportunity to redefine auto-making in the UK. Nissan's Ashwani Gupta said the Brexit deal had created a 'competitive environment' ""It has created a competitive environment for Sunderland, not just inside the UK but outside as well. ""We've decided to localise the manufacture of the 62kWh battery in Sunderland so that all our products qualify [for tariff-free export to the EU]. We are committed to Sunderland for the long term under the business conditions that have been agreed."" It came as Nissanpaused one of its two production lines in Sunderland on Fridayas disruption at ports caused by the pandemic affected its supply chain. The company said the move would affect the line which produces the Qashqai and Leaf, but work would resume next week. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed the firm's endorsement of Sunderland as a manufacturing base. ""Nissan's decision represents a genuine belief in Britain and a huge vote of confidence in our economy thanks to the certainty our trade deal with the EU delivers,"" he said. ""For the dedicated and highly-skilled workforce in Sunderland, it means the city will be home to Nissan's latest models for years to come and positions the company to capitalise on the wealth of benefits that will flow from electric vehicle production."" It's particularly welcome after the more guarded comments from the boss of Vauxhall's parent company last week. Speaking as the tie-up between Fiat Chrsyler and Peugeot Citroen was christened with new umbrella name Stellantis, boss Carlos Tavares said that the future of its Ellesmere Port plant depended on the support the UK government was prepared to offer after its decision to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars after 2030. ""If you change, brutally, the rules and if you restrict the rules for business then there is at one point in time a problem,"" he said. Looking forward, he said it would make more sense to locate an electric vehicle factory closer to the larger EU market. Industry voices welcomed the news from Nissan but reinforced the message from Vauxhall's owners that the government needs to do more to secure the future of the car industry as it electrifies. ""This is obviously good news and will help the Nissan Leaf avoid any future tariffs, but we are going to need to see a lot more investment in battery production in the UK if we are to preserve the UK as a car manufacturer and exporter,"" said Professor David Bailey of Warwick University. The head of trade body the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders agreed. ""The battery plant in Sunderland may be enough for Nissan's near-term plans to build tens of thousands of electric cars but the UK made 1.5 million cars last year and all will be partly electric by 2030,"" Mike Hawes said. Andy Palmer, former boss of Aston Martin and current chairman of electric bus maker Switch Mobility, has gone further. He says that 800,000 jobs are at risk if the UK government doesn't act now to foster battery investment. ""Without electric vehicle batteries made in the UK, the country's auto industry risks becoming an antiquated relic and overtaken by China, Japan, America and Europe."" He urged the UK government to use every lever at its disposal to make the UK attractive. UK car investment has fallen sharply since the UK voted to leave the EU. In the five years to 2016 it averaged Â£3.5bn per year. In the four years since it has averaged around Â£1bn - a fall of 71% at a time when the technology and map of car production are going through their biggest revolution since the car was invented. The Nissan decision is therefore a very welcome boost to the UK which is in an international scramble for the investment of the future which is happening right now.

Men jailed over deaths of 39 migrants in lorry,"The 39 people who died in the back of a trailer as it crossed the North Sea between Zeebrugge and the UK Four men have been jailed for the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese migrants found dead in a lorry trailer in Essex. The migrants died ""excruciatingly painful"" deaths, having suffocated in the container en route from Belgium to Purfleet in October 2019, a judge said. Ronan Hughes, 41, and Gheorghe Nica, 43, played ""leading roles"" in the smuggling conspiracy and were jailed for 20 and 27 years respectively. At the Old Bailey, two lorry drivers were also jailed for manslaughter. [Left to right] Eamonn Harrison, Ronan Hughes, Gheorghe Nica and Maurice Robinson were all jailed for manslaughter Eamonn Harrison, 24, who towed the trailer to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge before their journey to the UK, was sentenced to 18 years. Maurice Robinson, 26, was given 13 years and four months, having collected the trailer and opened it in an industrial estate to find the migrants dead. The supposed 'VIP' journey that killed 39 people Three others members of the people-smuggling gang were also sentenced for conspiracy to facilitate unlawful immigration. Christopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, was jailed for seven years; Valentin Calota, 38, of Birmingham, for four-and-a-half years; and Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, was given a three-year sentence. [Left to right] Valentin Calota, Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga and Christopher Kennedy were also sentenced on Friday Sentencing,external, Mr Justice Sweeney said: ""I have no doubt that the conspiracy was a sophisticated, long-running and profitable one to smuggle mainly Vietnamese people across the channel."" He said on the fatal trip the temperature had been rising along with the carbon dioxide levels throughout, hitting 40C (104F) while the container was at sea on 22 October 2019. ""There were desperate attempts to contact the outside world by phone and to break through the roof of the container,"" the judge said. ""All were to no avail and, before the ship reached Purfleet, [the victims] all died in what must have been an excruciatingly painful death."" This video can not be played Video evidence showed how the trainer containing 39 Vietnamese migrants made its way to the UK The victims had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof but only managed to dent the interior. The court heard some of their final desperate phone messages, including one where a man spoke with ragged breaths as he apologised to his family. ""I can't breathe,"" he said. ""I want to come back to my family. Have a good life."" Justice Sweeney added: ""The willingness of the victims to try and enter the country illegally provides no excuse for what happened to them."" The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October 2019 During the trial, jurors were given a snapshot of the victims - who included a bricklayer, a university graduate and a nail bar technician - and their dreams of a better life. Many of their families borrowed heavily to fund their passage, relying on their potential future earnings once they got into the UK. The father of Nguyen Huy Tung, one of two 15-year-olds in the container, laterlearned of his son's death via social media. Harrison, of Newry, County Down, claimed he did not know there were people in the trailer when he towed it to the Belgian port, and that he watched ""a wee bit of Netflix"" in bed as they were loaded on. After receiving this message from his boss, Robinson got out of his cab, opened the trailer door and discovered the bodies Robinson, from County Armagh, collected the trailer when it arrived on UK shores just after midnight on 23 October. His boss, Hughes, had messaged him: ""Give them air quickly don't let them out."" Robinson gave a thumbs-up in reply. When Robinson stopped on a nearby industrial estate, he found that the migrants were all dead. His barrister said Robinson, who admitted manslaughter, being part of the trafficking plot and money laundering, was ""horrified by what he saw"". The moment lorry driver Maurice Robinson opened the trailer door and discovered the bodies inside was captured on CCTV The trial examined three smuggling attempts by the gang - two that were successful on 11 and 18 October, and the final trip on 23 October. On all three runs, Nica, of Basildon, Essex, had arranged cars and a van to transport the migrants at the UK end. When Robinson discovered the bodies, there was a series of telephone conversations between him and Nica and Hughes, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, before the driver eventually dialled 999. In his evidence, Nica said Robinson told him: ""I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Ronan Hughes (left) met Gheorghe Nica at a budget hotel in Thurrock, Essex While Hughes admitted manslaughter, both Nica and Harrison were convicted by a jury. Mr Justice Sweeney said that in the conspiracy ""two played leading roles, namely - in order of importance - Hughes and Nica"". He accepted Hughes was ""not at the very top of the conspiracy"" but said his role was ""pivotal... in that he ran a haulage business and supplied the trailers and drivers used to transport the migrants"". The judge said Nica ""recruited and paid the drivers whose job it was to collect the migrants when they reached the drop-off site in this country and to drive them to the safe house(s) where they were to be held until payment"". He added at the top of the conspiracy was a Vietnamese man called ""Fong"", who was based in London. Mr Justice Sweeney told the defendants jailed for manslaughter they would serve two-thirds of the term in custody, instead of the usual half. Earlier this month, Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Barclay Road, Tottenham, north London, was sentenced, havingadmitted his limited role in the people-smuggling operation. It was accepted he was not a member of the organised crime group behind the smuggling operation. Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten said: ""May this serve as a warning to those who think it's OK to prey on the vulnerabilities of migrants and their families, transporting them in a way worse than we would transport animals. ""My message to you is that we will find you and we will stop you."" He said the victims died in an ""unimaginable way, because of the utter greed of these criminals"".

Â£500 Covid self-isolation payment idea downplayed,"There are no plans to pay everyone in England who tests positive for Covid Â£500 to self-isolate, No 10 has said. The PM's official spokesman said there was already a Â£500 payment available for those on low incomes who could not work from home and had to isolate. A universal Â£500 payment was among suggestions in a leaked Department of Health document. There are fears the current financial support is not working because low paid workers cannot afford to self-isolate. But a senior government source said the idea of extending the Â£500 payments to everyone who tests positive had been drawn up by officials and had not been considered by the prime minister. 'Too early' to say if lockdown will end in spring Three-quarters 'rejected for self-isolation grant' Who has to self-isolate and for how long? BBC Newsnight's Katie Razzall said ministers were aware self-isolation was crucial for stopping the spread of coronavirus and the ""options paper"" had been drawn up by civil servants at the Department of Health. She said it would be discussed soon by the Covid operations committee chaired by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, adding the move suggested there was an admission in government that too many people were not staying at home and a decision needed to be made quickly. The story was firstreported by the Guardian,externalwhich said the options paper suggested the proposal could cost up to Â£453m per week - 12 times the cost of the current payouts. Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC he had not seen the leaked document but said the issue of financial support for people self-isolating was ""always kept under review"". ""We've got to consider all sorts of policies in order to make sure that people abide by the rules, are able to abide by the rules and we get the infection rate down,"" he said. But the prime minister's official spokesman denied the government was planning to introduce the new payment, telling reporters: ""We've given local authorities Â£70m for the scheme and they are able to provide extra payments on top of those Â£500 if they think it necessary. ""That Â£500 is on top of any other benefits and statutory sick pay that people are eligible for."" Asked about document, the spokesman said he would not comment on a leaked paper. By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check It's impossible to say exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being in contact with someone who has tested positive, however some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from September 2020 suggests thatjust 10.9% of people remained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report when arguing that people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do ""to go to work"". Most people reported going out for things like shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they needed to quarantine as they didn't develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has alsohighlighted research that shows that most people don't completely follow the rules,external. This research also suggests that those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate than those better off. BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there was concern in government about the huge cost of the proposal for the Treasury. However, he said the issue of financial incentives and trying to get people to self-isolate was clearly a live discussion within government. It became a legal requirement last September for anyone in England testing positive for coronavirus to self-isolate. TheÂ£500 grant already available in England is funded by the government but administered by local authorities.,external The same level of payment is available in Scotland and Wales with similar conditions attached. Northern Ireland offers a discretionary self-isolation grant that covers expenses, such as the cost of groceries. There is a list of specific criteria applicants must meet for the grant, but those who do not qualify for this payment and who are on a low income or may face financial hardship as a result of self-isolating can apply for a discretionary payment. However, there have been high rejection rates for this discretionary grant in England,figures obtained by Labour and reported by the BBC this week suggest. Between October and December last year, three-quarters of the 49,877 applications were rejected, the data showed. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish government would welcome the introduction of a Â£500 payment, as the additional funds it would generate for Scotland could allow for a similar scheme to be set up. Speaking at her regular coronavirus briefing, she said: ""We will see whether that transpires or not, but any extra resources for self-isolation we would use to support self-isolation."" In other developments: The UK's R number - a measure of whether the epidemic is growing or shrinking - isat or below one for the first time since early December The prime minister is to lead a Downing Street coronavirus briefing at 17:00 British retail sales saw their largest annual fall in history last yearas the impact of the pandemic took its toll UK government borrowinghit Â£34.1bn last month, the highest December figure on record, as the cost of pandemic support weighed on the economy Almost five million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine Northern Ireland's health minister has said it isunrealistic to expect all lockdown restrictions to be lifted on 5 March Compliance with most measures to stop the spread of Covid remains high,according to the latest ONS data,external, with 96% using a face covering and 93% avoiding physical contact when outside their home The proportion of adults only leaving home for work, exercise, essential shopping or medical needs is at its highest level since May 2020 (65%), and proportion of adults working from home at its highest level since June 2020 (45%) Prof Susan Michie, an adviser on the government's Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme just 18% of people with symptoms were self-isolating for the full 10 days they were meant to. She said financial support currently offered to people having to self-isolate was a ""key weakness"" of the government's pandemic strategy. Sharon, a cleaner from Kent, told the BBC if no money were to come in for two weeks she would not be able to afford to self-isolate. ""I have a mortgage to pay,"" she said. ""I can't even afford to heat my property at the moment because my wages were cut and that Â£500 payment would make all the difference. I would be able to self-isolate. ""It wouldn't be enough money, but it would help."" PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The DoH said it would not comment on a leaked paper but stressed it was incumbent on everyone to help protect the NHS by staying at home and following the rules at ""one of the toughest moments of this pandemic"". A spokesman said Â£50m was invested at the time the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme launched and it was providing a further Â£20m to help support people on low incomes who need to self-isolate. People who have tested positive for coronavirus and those considered at risk of having been exposed to it must self-isolate. Other legal obligations to self-isolate in the UK include: If you have Covid symptoms If you live with someone who has tested positive for Covid If you live with someone who has Covid symptoms (unless they have a negative test) If you arrive in the UK from a country other than the Republic of Ireland If you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace to say you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Resources and programmes on BBC iPlayer to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown BBC BITESIZE:Dr Radha shares 5 tips for coping when youâre overwhelmed Would Â£500 be enough to help you to self-isolate?

"Shoppers stuck at home shun new clothes in 2020Clothing was the hardest-hit sector last year, seeing a 25% drop in sales overall.BusinessComments","Shoppers bought far fewer clothes last year as lockdowns meant people had less opportunity to socialise and go out. Clothes sales slumped 25%, the biggest drop in 23 years when records began,official figures suggest.,external While shops have reported demand for certain clothing such as pyjamas and loungewear has risen, demand for going-out items has fallen sharply. And despite a pick-up in December, clothing sales remain lower than before the pandemic struck. ""With few opportunities to socialise during lockdown and many people working from home, the clothing sector has been one of the ""worst-affected by restrictions"", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Earlier this month, Marks & Spencer said sales of sleepwear had soared Growing numbers of High Street shops have faced financial difficulties due to the temporary store closures imposed during lockdowns. Topshop-owner Arcadia and competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed last March. The inability to try clothes on in bricks-and-mortar shops, as well as restrictions on eating out meaning consumers are going out less, have all affected sales, the ONS suggested. And the slump in demand for fashion meant that British retail sales saw their largest annual fall on record in 2020. Sales fell by 1.9% last year, when compared with 2019, the largest year-on-year fall since records began in 1997. Retail sales, including fuel, did see a small increase last month, growing by 0.3% when compared with November. It came following the end of England's national lockdown on 2 December.Sales had slumped by 4.1% in Novemberduring a month-long shutdown. But ""this was very clearly not a Merry Christmas for most of the High Street"", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""For most retailers it's the most crucial month of the year to get profit back on track but the large upswing in sales after the pain of the November lockdowns didn't materialise,"" she said. ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said that some sectors, however, had been ""able to buck the trend"" last year. Lockdown fashion: 'People are back in pyjamas' High Street crisis: 'Regular customers are keeping us going' Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years' Pre-Christmas lockdown restrictions hit retail sales ""The increased popularity of click-and-collect and people buying more items from home led to a strong year for overall internet sales, with record highs for food and household goods sales online."" In a sign of the way the pandemic has changed shopping habits, the value of online retail sales jumped by 46.1% in 2020 when compared with 2019 - the highest annual growth reported since 2008. Online trade now accounts for more than one-third of all retail sales. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, explained that the rise of online had ""polarised industry performance"". ""The gap widened between those retailers with the most sophisticated online propositions from those with legacy store-dependent business models,"" he said. Online-only retailers such as Boohoo and Asos, for example, have reported strong sales figures in 2020. Supermarkets in particular have embraced the shift to digital, with online food store sales up 79.3% last year. There was also better news from the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, on Friday. It said that it would return a Â£300m emergency coronavirus loan to the government as trading went ""better than anticipated"" over Christmas. Today's figures show just how badly the clothing sector has been affected these last 12 months. Fashion is the big retail loser from this pandemic. Who needs to splash out on the latest trends when we're working from home and not going out? And even when clothing shops are open, chances are you can't try things on. With all of the Covid-19 measures in place, the fun has been sucked out of shopping. We haven't stopped spending, but most of it is going online. Boohoo and Asos have seen very strong sales growth, for instance. The going's far harder for retailers with large numbers of physical stores. The pressures have already taken their toll on the likes of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group and Debenhams. And things may well get worse on the high street before they better. Many retailers are worried about the end of the business rates holiday and of the temporary ban on eviction for non payment of rent in April. These will result in a big increase in costs when sales have yet to fully recover. But Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, called for more help for non-essential shops and High Street retailers who continue to be affected by lockdown restrictions. ""With no end in sight for retailers closed in lockdown, many will struggle to survive under a mounting rent burden, and a return to full business rates in April,"" she said. She called on government to offer ""targeted"" business rates relief to businesses worst-affected by the pandemic. ""Decisive action is needed to save jobs, shops and local communities, with town and city centres looking to be particularly hard hit unless the government acts now."" Earlier in January, a report from the Centre for Retail Research said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, because of the acceleration towards online shopping. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, it said.

Bond film release delayed for third time,"Daniel Craig with director Cary Joji Fukunaga on the No Time To Die set in 2019 The release of the next James Bond film has been delayed for a third time because of the coronavirus pandemic. No Time To Die had already been pushed back twice, and will now debut globally on 8 October,an announcement on the film's website,externalsaid. It had originally been due to hit screens in April 2020. The film is the 25th instalment in the Bond franchise, and marks Daniel Craig's final appearance as British secret service agent 007. It also features Lea Seydoux and Rami Malek. The delay will come as a further blow to cinemas that have been forced to shut for months at a time because of lockdowns. Earlier this week, leading film-makers including Danny Boyle and Sir Steve McQueen wrote to the UK Government, calling for financial support for cinema chains because ""UK cinema stands on the edge of an abyss"". Directors ask government to support cinema chains Film-going could 'become extinct' warns director Cineworld said in October, when No Time To Die was pushed back for the second time, thatdelays to big budget releases meant the industry was ""unviable"". Bond's latest move sparked a flurry of other delays to major releases. Sony has pushed back Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Peter Rabbit 2, Jared Leto's Morbius, Tom Holland's Uncharted and Cinderella, which will star singer Camila Cabello; while Universal has moved Tom Hanks' Bios from April to November.

The UK Cinema Association said the decision to postpone No Time To Die again, ""while clearly disappointing, is at the same time not surprising given the current situation around Covid-19 in the UK as well as the US and other major film territories"". The postponement of Daniel Craig's swansong and other films ""underlines the need for ongoing support for the UK cinema sector"", the trade body's chief executive Phil Clapp said. The association is calling on the government to provide ""direct funding"" to chains, which represent 80% of ticket sales. One of the major chains, Vue, said the delay was ""understandable"", and that the continuing attempts to release the film in cinemas ""is further testament to our shared belief in a bright future for the big screen"". However, the latest postponement could stoke speculation that the film may ultimately skip cinemas and be released on a streaming platform. Major Disney titles like Pixar's Soul and its live-action remake of Mulan bypassed cinemas, premiering instead on the Disney+ streaming service. Wonder Woman 1984, meanwhile, was made available in the US on the HBO Max streaming service on the same day it received a limited cinema release. Last year, Warner Bros announced its 2021 titles - including sci-fi epic Dune and The Matrix 4 - would all adopt a similar dual release pattern, escalating tensions between Hollywood and US movie theatres. Rami Malek plays the villainous Safin in the thrice-delayed film The Dig, a new historical drama starring Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, was due to be released in selected UK cinemas this month. Now, the film will only be available on Netflix from 29 January. Asked whether No Time To Die might go down the same route, Fiennes - who will reprise his role as M in the film - recently told BBC News: ""That's a good question and I'm not really in a position to answer it. ""I would love the idea that people could go to the cinema and have the full effect of the big-screen energy behind the Bond, but I'm sure it's something the people who make these executive decisions are probably considering. ""I really hope we come through this so people can go to the cinema. Maybe they just have to hold their nerve. But of course we don't know, and there may be financial reasons or imperatives that [mean] they have to put it on a streaming system."" If No Time To Die is indeed released in cinemas in October, it will arrive a full six years on from the release of its 2015 predecessor Spectre. That won't be far behind the six years and four months that separated the release of Licence to Kill in summer 1989 and GoldenEye in late 1995 - the biggest gap between two Bond films. The last Bond film, 2015's Spectre, took almost $900m (Â£690m) at worldwide box offices. Other blockbusters to have been delayed by the pandemic include action sequel Top Gun: Maverick and Marvel's Black Widow. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Nissan commits to keep making cars in SunderlandThe Japanese car maker has told the BBC its Sunderland plant is secure for the long term.BusinessComments,"Nissan's car plant in Sunderland is the UK's biggest and employs 6,000 people directly Japanese car maker Nissan has told the BBC its Sunderland plant is secure for the long term as a result of the trade deal reached between the UK and the EU. It said it will move additional battery production close to the plant where it has 6,000 direct employees and supports nearly 70,000 jobs in the supply chain. Currently, the batteries in its Leaf electric cars are imported from Japan. Nissan would not confirm if this would mean additional jobs at Sunderland, which is the UK's largest car plant. Manufacturing the more powerful batteries in the UK will ensure its cars comply with trade rules agreed with the EU requiring at least 55% of the car's value to be derived from either the UK or the EU to qualify for zero tariffs when exported to the EU. Some 70% of the cars made in Sunderland are exported and the vast majority of them are sold in the EU. Nissan warns on its UK future without a Brexit deal Scrapped 4x4 plant plans 'not down to Brexit' Nissan had issued stark warnings last year that if the UK left the EU without a trade deal, the resulting tariffs on cars and components would make the Sunderland plant ""unsustainable"". Nissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta told the BBC: ""The Brexit deal is positive for Nissan. Being the largest automaker in the UK we are taking this opportunity to redefine auto-making in the UK. Nissan's Ashwani Gupta said the Brexit deal had created a 'competitive environment' ""It has created a competitive environment for Sunderland, not just inside the UK but outside as well. ""We've decided to localise the manufacture of the 62kWh battery in Sunderland so that all our products qualify [for tariff-free export to the EU]. We are committed to Sunderland for the long term under the business conditions that have been agreed."" It came as Nissanpaused one of its two production lines in Sunderland on Fridayas disruption at ports caused by the pandemic affected its supply chain. The company said the move would affect the line which produces the Qashqai and Leaf, but work would resume next week. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed the firm's endorsement of Sunderland as a manufacturing base. ""Nissan's decision represents a genuine belief in Britain and a huge vote of confidence in our economy thanks to the certainty our trade deal with the EU delivers,"" he said. ""For the dedicated and highly-skilled workforce in Sunderland, it means the city will be home to Nissan's latest models for years to come and positions the company to capitalise on the wealth of benefits that will flow from electric vehicle production."" It's particularly welcome after the more guarded comments from the boss of Vauxhall's parent company last week. Speaking as the tie-up between Fiat Chrsyler and Peugeot Citroen was christened with new umbrella name Stellantis, boss Carlos Tavares said that the future of its Ellesmere Port plant depended on the support the UK government was prepared to offer after its decision to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars after 2030. ""If you change, brutally, the rules and if you restrict the rules for business then there is at one point in time a problem,"" he said. Looking forward, he said it would make more sense to locate an electric vehicle factory closer to the larger EU market. Industry voices welcomed the news from Nissan but reinforced the message from Vauxhall's owners that the government needs to do more to secure the future of the car industry as it electrifies. ""This is obviously good news and will help the Nissan Leaf avoid any future tariffs, but we are going to need to see a lot more investment in battery production in the UK if we are to preserve the UK as a car manufacturer and exporter,"" said Professor David Bailey of Warwick University. The head of trade body the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders agreed. ""The battery plant in Sunderland may be enough for Nissan's near-term plans to build tens of thousands of electric cars but the UK made 1.5 million cars last year and all will be partly electric by 2030,"" Mike Hawes said. Andy Palmer, former boss of Aston Martin and current chairman of electric bus maker Switch Mobility, has gone further. He says that 800,000 jobs are at risk if the UK government doesn't act now to foster battery investment. ""Without electric vehicle batteries made in the UK, the country's auto industry risks becoming an antiquated relic and overtaken by China, Japan, America and Europe."" He urged the UK government to use every lever at its disposal to make the UK attractive. UK car investment has fallen sharply since the UK voted to leave the EU. In the five years to 2016 it averaged Â£3.5bn per year. In the four years since it has averaged around Â£1bn - a fall of 71% at a time when the technology and map of car production are going through their biggest revolution since the car was invented. The Nissan decision is therefore a very welcome boost to the UK which is in an international scramble for the investment of the future which is happening right now.

Google threatens to pull search engine in Australia,"Google says the new law will lead to it disabling its search tool for Australians Google has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia over the nation's attempt to make the tech giant share royalties with news publishers. Australia is introducing a world-first law to make Google, Facebook and potentially other tech companies pay media outlets for their news content. But the US firms have fought back, warning the law would make them withdraw some of their services. Australian PM Scott Morrison said lawmakers would not yield to ""threats"". Australia is far from Google's largest market, but the proposed news code is seen as a possible global test case for how governments could seek to regulate big tech firms. Tech firms have faced increasing pressure to pay for news content in other countries, including France, where Google struck a landmark deal with media outlets on Thursday. In Australia, the proposed news code would tie Google and Facebook to mediated negotiations with publishers over the value of news content, if no agreement could be reached first. Google Australia managing director Mel Silva told a Senate hearing on Friday that the laws were ""unworkable"". ""If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,"" she said. Could Google really leave Australia? Australia rebukes Google for blocking local search results Google accused of misinformation in Australia row But lawmakers challenged this, accusing Google of ""blackmail"" and bullying Australia for raising the reform. Mr Morrison said his government remained committed to progressing the laws through parliament this year. ""Let me be clear: Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That's done in our parliament,"" he told reporters on Friday. Google is the dominant search engine in Australia and has been described by the government as a near-essential utility, with little market competition. The government has argued that because the tech platforms gain customers from people who want to read the news, the tech giants should pay newsrooms a ""fair"" amount for their journalism. In addition, it has argued that the financial support is needed for Australia's embattled news industry because a strong media is vital to democracy. Media companies, including News Corp Australia, a unit of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, have lobbied hard for the government to force tech firms to the negotiating table amid a long-term decline in advertising revenue. Meanwhile, Google's revenues have increased markedly in the same period, amounting to more than $160bn (Â£117bn) globally in 2019. In the same year, Google was reported to have made $3.7bn in gross revenue in Australia. Of that revenue, $7.7m was generated from news content, Google said in a blog last year. Google's threat to remove its entire search product is its most severe yet. News accounts for just 12.5% of Google searches in Australia, according to lawmakers. This video can not be played WATCH: Who are the 'big four' and just how much power do they have? If the law is passed, the news code would initially apply only to Facebook and Google, the government says. If Google withdrew its search engine, Australian internet users would be forced to use alternatives such as Microsoft's Bing, DuckDuckGo and Yahoo! This is a highly unusual threat. Google dominates the search engine market with a nearly 90% market share. Almost all its revenue is from ads. For Google to threaten to pull out of an entire country suggests the company is worried. Australia is nowhere near its biggest market. But Google execs are fearful about the precedent these new laws could set. Google has had a very profitable pandemic so far, while many local newspapers have struggled. That doesn't look good - Australian politicians aren't the first, and won't be the last, to point that out. Google says it wants to help fund original, local journalism. But clearly it believes that what is being proposed in Australia could fundamentally hurt its business model if replicated elsewhere. Ms Silva said the laws would set ""an untenable precedent for our businesses and the digital economy"" if Google had to pay for link and search results. This was not compatible with the free-flowing share of information online or ""how the internet works"", she argued. Google has run ads in its browsers in Australia advocating its case ""We do not see a way, with the financial and operational risks, that we could continue to offer a service in Australia,"" she said. Last week, Google confirmed it was blocking Australian news sites from its search results for about 1% of local users. It said it was an experiment to test the value of Australian news services. Facebook last year also threatened to stop Australian users from sharing news stories on the platform if the law went ahead. The social media giant repeated that position on Friday, with executive Simon Milner telling the Senate hearing it was ""a potential worse-case consequence"". He said Facebook derived almost no commercial benefit from having news content on its platform. Both firms have argued that news organisations already get the benefit of platforms driving readers to their websites. Google has also cited its Google News partnership as evidence it supports journalism. By Katie Silver, business reporter Australia's news industry is struggling. Of every A$100 (Â£56; $77) spent on digital advertising, A$81 goes to Google and Facebook. And Covid-19 has only made this worse. With companies reducing their digital advertising spend, a number of outlets in Australia have been forced to close. Google, by contrast, has been performing well. Last year the social media giant made almost $4bn from Australia, while paying $45m in tax. Meanwhile, Australia's competition watchdog has accused both Facebook and Google of misleading Australian consumers about how their data is used, launching inquiries into digital advertising and the app stores market. Australians have expressed confusion and anger online at both sides. Some have debated whether they could get by using other search engines. Others have questioned if the removal of the search engine would also remove Gmail, Google Maps and Google Home services - something the company has not made clear. Earlier this week, US trade representatives urged Australia to drop the laws which they said attempted regulation ""to the clear detriment of two US firms"". Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, said Australia's plan would make the web ""unworkable around the world"".

Festival season is 'still possible' in 2021,"Because of its scale, work on Glastonbury's site must begin earlier than most festivals Music festivals are ""still possible"" this summer, despite the cancellation of Glastonbury, says the head of the Association of Independent Festivals. Paul Reed said Glastonbury ""is a different beast to most festivals and most likely ran out of time due to the size and complexity of the event"". Smaller events could still happen if the government ensures organisers can access cancellation insurance, he said. ""For most festivals, the cut-off point is more likely the end of March."" On Thursday, Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis called off their festival for the second year in a row because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""In spite of our efforts to move Heaven & Earth, it has become clear that we simply will not be able to make the festival happen,"" they said in a joint statement. ""We are so sorry to let you all down."" Glastonbury Festival 2021 axed 'with great regret' MPs urge chancellor to save summer music festivals Tickets for the festival, which normally attracts 200,000 people and was due to take place in June, will roll over to 2022. Glastonbury is the UK's biggest music festival, but it was not the only event to cancel its plans on Thursday. The Country To Country festival, which was due to take place in March, also said its 2021 edition would not happen. The three-day event, which attracts some of country music's biggest names to indoor venues in London, Dublin and Glasgow, said it had pulled the plug due to the ""current restrictions on mass gatherings and international travel"". The announcements came as coronavirus deaths soared in England, with more than 8,500 deaths recorded in the past week. On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""too early"" to say whether England's Covid restrictions would be lifted by the spring. Stormzy has already been announced as a headliner for August's Reading and Leeds festivals Glastonbury's cancellation has raised fears for other music festivals this summer. However, the organisers of Glasgow's TRNSMT said there was ""reason to be optimistic"" that it could go ahead in July, with headliners Lewis Capaldi, Liam Gallagher and the Courteeners. ""Glastonbury is the biggest festival in the world and it's sad to see that, due to its enormous scale and taking several months to get the city-sized festival site ready, it's unable to go ahead this year,""boss Geoff Ellis told Scotland's Daily Record,external. ""By comparison, TRNSMT is a much smaller city centre event with no camping. As such it takes us days rather than months to build TRNSMT. Therefore, we will continue to listen to and follow the advice from the government and remain positive about events later in the summer."" His comments were echoed by Bestival co-founder Rob Da Bank, who tweeted that ""festival season will happen in the UK this summer,external"", adding: ""Sadly Glasto is such a mammoth beast to plan it ran outta time."" Sacha Lord, co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, added that Glastonbury's cancellation was ""yet another blow,external"" to freelancers who work in the live music sector. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Friday, Mr Reed said the UK was at a ""serious point in the pandemic and festivals only want to return when it is safe to do so"". He added that festivals were currently struggling to get insurance for coronavirus-related cancellations. Last week, MPs from the House of Commons culture select committee wrote to the chancellor,urging him to launch a Covid-19 insurance schemeto protect live music. The appeal was backed by more than 100 industry figures, including organisers of the TRNSMT and Parklife festivals. ""We do need government to intervene in this issue,"" said Mr Reed. In a tweet on Thursday,Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden expressed his regret,externalat Glastonbury's cancellation and said the government was ""looking at problems around getting insurance"". A government spokeswoman said on Friday they are in ""regular dialogue"" with public health experts to ""agree a realistic return date for festivals and other large events"". They added they were still helping festivals with the Â£1.5bn Culture Recovery Fund, ""with many already receiving this support"". Latitude Festival has been held at Henham Park, near Southwold, since 2006 Other European countries, including Austria and Germany, have launched schemes to cover events that cannot be rescheduled, including music festivals. At present, England has a scheme protecting film and TV shoots, but not music. However, some festivals have been given support by the government's Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund, including Womad, End of the Road and Nozstock. Melvin Benn, whose company Festival Republic organises the Latitude, Download and the Reading & Leeds festivals, said that without an insurance scheme, other events would be left ""staring into the same barrel that Glastonbury stared into"". ""People can't afford to take that financial risk,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The government is holding ""early stage talks"" with insurers, confirmed Tim Thornhill of Tyser's Insurance, which counts Glastonbury amongst its clients. ""We have helped to put in place the film and TV restart scheme, which the chancellor explained saved 14,000 jobs,"" he said. ""So if we can do something for events, that would be welcome across the industry"". While there is ""no guarantee"" that insurance could be provided, he said there was ""significant urgency"" to finding a solution ""within the next few months"". ""It's really important that the government supports the industry,"" added Radiohead's Colin Greenwood. ""And they need to start thinking about that now, and not when we reach that point - say in October this year - when there are enough people vaccinated for [live music] to become safe. ""Nobody wants to go to anything, or take part in anything, that's going to turn into a super-spreader event,"" he said. ""But obviously there has to be a way out of this, through vaccination. And I think we need to make sure that systems are in place so we can get back into doing what we love."" Julian Knight MP, chair of the culture select committee, said the government was working on insurance plans, because of the importance of festivals to British culture and the economy. ""I've been in to see the chancellor,"" he told BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""Finally I think there is some movement. I understand that they are dropping some of the objections that they may have had, and that we may end up with an insurance scheme. ""However, there's a danger that it's too little too late.""

Google threatens to pull search engine in AustraliaThe tech giant says it will remove its main search function from Australia if it passes a new law.Australia,"Google says the new law will lead to it disabling its search tool for Australians Google has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia over the nation's attempt to make the tech giant share royalties with news publishers. Australia is introducing a world-first law to make Google, Facebook and potentially other tech companies pay media outlets for their news content. But the US firms have fought back, warning the law would make them withdraw some of their services. Australian PM Scott Morrison said lawmakers would not yield to ""threats"". Australia is far from Google's largest market, but the proposed news code is seen as a possible global test case for how governments could seek to regulate big tech firms. Tech firms have faced increasing pressure to pay for news content in other countries, including France, where Google struck a landmark deal with media outlets on Thursday. In Australia, the proposed news code would tie Google and Facebook to mediated negotiations with publishers over the value of news content, if no agreement could be reached first. Google Australia managing director Mel Silva told a Senate hearing on Friday that the laws were ""unworkable"". ""If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,"" she said. Could Google really leave Australia? Australia rebukes Google for blocking local search results Google accused of misinformation in Australia row But lawmakers challenged this, accusing Google of ""blackmail"" and bullying Australia for raising the reform. Mr Morrison said his government remained committed to progressing the laws through parliament this year. ""Let me be clear: Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That's done in our parliament,"" he told reporters on Friday. Google is the dominant search engine in Australia and has been described by the government as a near-essential utility, with little market competition. The government has argued that because the tech platforms gain customers from people who want to read the news, the tech giants should pay newsrooms a ""fair"" amount for their journalism. In addition, it has argued that the financial support is needed for Australia's embattled news industry because a strong media is vital to democracy. Media companies, including News Corp Australia, a unit of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, have lobbied hard for the government to force tech firms to the negotiating table amid a long-term decline in advertising revenue. Meanwhile, Google's revenues have increased markedly in the same period, amounting to more than $160bn (Â£117bn) globally in 2019. In the same year, Google was reported to have made $3.7bn in gross revenue in Australia. Of that revenue, $7.7m was generated from news content, Google said in a blog last year. Google's threat to remove its entire search product is its most severe yet. News accounts for just 12.5% of Google searches in Australia, according to lawmakers. This video can not be played WATCH: Who are the 'big four' and just how much power do they have? If the law is passed, the news code would initially apply only to Facebook and Google, the government says. If Google withdrew its search engine, Australian internet users would be forced to use alternatives such as Microsoft's Bing, DuckDuckGo and Yahoo! This is a highly unusual threat. Google dominates the search engine market with a nearly 90% market share. Almost all its revenue is from ads. For Google to threaten to pull out of an entire country suggests the company is worried. Australia is nowhere near its biggest market. But Google execs are fearful about the precedent these new laws could set. Google has had a very profitable pandemic so far, while many local newspapers have struggled. That doesn't look good - Australian politicians aren't the first, and won't be the last, to point that out. Google says it wants to help fund original, local journalism. But clearly it believes that what is being proposed in Australia could fundamentally hurt its business model if replicated elsewhere. Ms Silva said the laws would set ""an untenable precedent for our businesses and the digital economy"" if Google had to pay for link and search results. This was not compatible with the free-flowing share of information online or ""how the internet works"", she argued. Google has run ads in its browsers in Australia advocating its case ""We do not see a way, with the financial and operational risks, that we could continue to offer a service in Australia,"" she said. Last week, Google confirmed it was blocking Australian news sites from its search results for about 1% of local users. It said it was an experiment to test the value of Australian news services. Facebook last year also threatened to stop Australian users from sharing news stories on the platform if the law went ahead. The social media giant repeated that position on Friday, with executive Simon Milner telling the Senate hearing it was ""a potential worse-case consequence"". He said Facebook derived almost no commercial benefit from having news content on its platform. Both firms have argued that news organisations already get the benefit of platforms driving readers to their websites. Google has also cited its Google News partnership as evidence it supports journalism. By Katie Silver, business reporter Australia's news industry is struggling. Of every A$100 (Â£56; $77) spent on digital advertising, A$81 goes to Google and Facebook. And Covid-19 has only made this worse. With companies reducing their digital advertising spend, a number of outlets in Australia have been forced to close. Google, by contrast, has been performing well. Last year the social media giant made almost $4bn from Australia, while paying $45m in tax. Meanwhile, Australia's competition watchdog has accused both Facebook and Google of misleading Australian consumers about how their data is used, launching inquiries into digital advertising and the app stores market. Australians have expressed confusion and anger online at both sides. Some have debated whether they could get by using other search engines. Others have questioned if the removal of the search engine would also remove Gmail, Google Maps and Google Home services - something the company has not made clear. Earlier this week, US trade representatives urged Australia to drop the laws which they said attempted regulation ""to the clear detriment of two US firms"". Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, said Australia's plan would make the web ""unworkable around the world"".

Nissan commits to keep making cars in SunderlandThe Japanese car maker has told the BBC its Sunderland plant is secure for the long term.,"Nissan's car plant in Sunderland is the UK's biggest and employs 6,000 people directly Japanese car maker Nissan has told the BBC its Sunderland plant is secure for the long term as a result of the trade deal reached between the UK and the EU. It said it will move additional battery production close to the plant where it has 6,000 direct employees and supports nearly 70,000 jobs in the supply chain. Currently, the batteries in its Leaf electric cars are imported from Japan. Nissan would not confirm if this would mean additional jobs at Sunderland, which is the UK's largest car plant. Manufacturing the more powerful batteries in the UK will ensure its cars comply with trade rules agreed with the EU requiring at least 55% of the car's value to be derived from either the UK or the EU to qualify for zero tariffs when exported to the EU. Some 70% of the cars made in Sunderland are exported and the vast majority of them are sold in the EU. Nissan warns on its UK future without a Brexit deal Scrapped 4x4 plant plans 'not down to Brexit' Nissan had issued stark warnings last year that if the UK left the EU without a trade deal, the resulting tariffs on cars and components would make the Sunderland plant ""unsustainable"". Nissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta told the BBC: ""The Brexit deal is positive for Nissan. Being the largest automaker in the UK we are taking this opportunity to redefine auto-making in the UK. Nissan's Ashwani Gupta said the Brexit deal had created a 'competitive environment' ""It has created a competitive environment for Sunderland, not just inside the UK but outside as well. ""We've decided to localise the manufacture of the 62kWh battery in Sunderland so that all our products qualify [for tariff-free export to the EU]. We are committed to Sunderland for the long term under the business conditions that have been agreed."" It came as Nissanpaused one of its two production lines in Sunderland on Fridayas disruption at ports caused by the pandemic affected its supply chain. The company said the move would affect the line which produces the Qashqai and Leaf, but work would resume next week. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed the firm's endorsement of Sunderland as a manufacturing base. ""Nissan's decision represents a genuine belief in Britain and a huge vote of confidence in our economy thanks to the certainty our trade deal with the EU delivers,"" he said. ""For the dedicated and highly-skilled workforce in Sunderland, it means the city will be home to Nissan's latest models for years to come and positions the company to capitalise on the wealth of benefits that will flow from electric vehicle production."" It's particularly welcome after the more guarded comments from the boss of Vauxhall's parent company last week. Speaking as the tie-up between Fiat Chrsyler and Peugeot Citroen was christened with new umbrella name Stellantis, boss Carlos Tavares said that the future of its Ellesmere Port plant depended on the support the UK government was prepared to offer after its decision to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars after 2030. ""If you change, brutally, the rules and if you restrict the rules for business then there is at one point in time a problem,"" he said. Looking forward, he said it would make more sense to locate an electric vehicle factory closer to the larger EU market. Industry voices welcomed the news from Nissan but reinforced the message from Vauxhall's owners that the government needs to do more to secure the future of the car industry as it electrifies. ""This is obviously good news and will help the Nissan Leaf avoid any future tariffs, but we are going to need to see a lot more investment in battery production in the UK if we are to preserve the UK as a car manufacturer and exporter,"" said Professor David Bailey of Warwick University. The head of trade body the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders agreed. ""The battery plant in Sunderland may be enough for Nissan's near-term plans to build tens of thousands of electric cars but the UK made 1.5 million cars last year and all will be partly electric by 2030,"" Mike Hawes said. Andy Palmer, former boss of Aston Martin and current chairman of electric bus maker Switch Mobility, has gone further. He says that 800,000 jobs are at risk if the UK government doesn't act now to foster battery investment. ""Without electric vehicle batteries made in the UK, the country's auto industry risks becoming an antiquated relic and overtaken by China, Japan, America and Europe."" He urged the UK government to use every lever at its disposal to make the UK attractive. UK car investment has fallen sharply since the UK voted to leave the EU. In the five years to 2016 it averaged Â£3.5bn per year. In the four years since it has averaged around Â£1bn - a fall of 71% at a time when the technology and map of car production are going through their biggest revolution since the car was invented. The Nissan decision is therefore a very welcome boost to the UK which is in an international scramble for the investment of the future which is happening right now.

What help is there for workers?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring?

LiveLiveSupport for self-isolating people debated2 minutes ago,"There is some evidence the new UK variant may be linked to a higher degree of mortality, PM tells press conference The chance of dying from it could be 30-40% higher than the old variant but data is uncertain There are more than 38,000 people in hospital, 78% more than at peak of the first wave, Boris Johnson adds The number of people catching the virus is âturning the cornerâ but from an exceptionally high level, chief medical officer Chris Whitty says A further 1,401 people have died in the UK with coronavirus within 28 days of a positive test UK R rate estimated to be between 0.8 and 1 - meaning the outbreak could now be shrinking Edited by Martha Buckley We're closing our live coverage of the pandemic for today. Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates throughout the day. Our coverage was brought to you by: James Clarke, Martha Buckley, Becky Morton, George Bowden, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Katie Wright, Gavin Stamp, Lucy Webster and Francesca Gillett. It's been another fairly busy day for coronavirus news, with Boris Johnson giving a press conference earlier. Here's a recap of the top headlines: People who drove 20 miles and then queued for two hours to get fresh milk from a farm's vending machine have been fined for breaching lockdown rules. The farmers who own the vending machine, Einion and Elliw Jones, in Trelogan near Holywell, say they feel North Wales Police have got ""it in for us"". They said even people living nearby were facing being fined, despite the force accepting milk was ""an essential item"". In Wales Covid  rules tell people to ""stay at home"" except for essential reasons, which include buying food. Welsh government guidance on the rules says there are no limits on how far people can travel to shop for essential items, but urge people to stay as ""local to your home as possible"". Ms Jones said some customers from ""just down the road"" in Trelawnyd and Mostyn had even been told they shouldn't be there. The police said the farm was working with the local council to ensure it was ""Covid-compliant surrounding queuing, social distancing etc"". There's more on this story here. New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. There is some evidence that the one that has become dominant in the UK may be associated with a higher degree of mortality, says PM Boris Johnson. Scientists are urgently studying these mutated versions to understand what threat they pose. So how worrying are the new UK, South Africa and Brazil coronavirus variants? The BBC's Michelle Roberts has a look at the evidencehere. Former tennis world number oneAndy Murray will miss the Australian Open having failed to find a ""workable quarantine""as he recovers from coronavirus. The 33-year-old Briton was set to fly out to Melbourne last week, but was not allowed to travel on a charter flight after being found to have Covid-19. The Victorian state government has put in place strict measures to allow players to fly into the country for the tournament, which starts on 8 February. Murray says: ""Gutted to share that I won't be flying out to Australia to compete at the Australian Open. ""We've been in constant dialogue with Tennis Australia to try and find a solution which would allow some form of workable quarantine, but we couldn't make it work. The famous Rovers Return pub on the set of Coronation Street ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are both seeing their filming schedules hit by the pandemic. An ITV spokeswoman confirms Emmerdale stopped filming last week after some members of the team tested positive for Covid-19. She adds they will return to filming on Monday. Meanwhile, Coronation Street will pause filming for two weeks on Monday ""to undertake some rewriting of stories and scripts as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic"". However, the break will not affect its TV schedule and the show will still be on six times a week, a statement adds. The news that the new variant of coronavirus may be more deadly is ""deeply alarming,"" said the shadow health secretary, ""not least
because Boris Johnson assured the nation back in December there was no evidence
the variant was more dangerous."" Jonathan Ashworth said: âWe urge
ministers to go further and faster on vaccination rollout now to save lives,
and introduce proper financial support for those needing to isolate to help
breaks chains of transmission.â  This video can not be played Covid: Wedding party in Stamford Hill broken up by police One of today's top stories about coronavirus in the UK has been police discovering people gathered at a wedding party in north London last night. Originally the police said 400 people had attended - but they have now revised that number down to 150. In a statement, the Met Police said: ""Although
initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now
believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" The organisers of the wedding party - which was held at a strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school in Stamford Hill - face fines. The Met said one organiser would be reported for consideration of a Â£10,000 fine while five other attendees were issued with Â£200 fixed penalty notices. ""This afternoon, an investigation has been launched to identify those others responsible for organising and who attended the wedding,"" the Met added. Read the full story here. There is still âa lot of uncertaintyâ about just how severe
the new UK variant is, according to another of the government's scientific advisers. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government's Scientific
Advisory Group on Emergencies, said the figures given during the Downing Street briefing suggested an increase of something like
30 to 40% in terms of mortality which âreally ties in with what weâre seeing in
the hospitalsâ. Speaking to Radio 4âs PM programme, he said: âIt is
obviously a blow. We were rather hoping that this virus was going to be quite
genetically stable. âThe realisation that this virus is capable of relatively
fast mutation and development of new variantsâ¦ has been a bit of a setback for
us.â Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent With new variants emerging in
different parts of the world, itâs worth highlighting Boris Johnsonâs comments
about borders. It seems pretty clear ministers are considering more
restrictions on people coming into the UK â to stop those variants coming into
the UK if possible. In the PMâs words, the UK may have to further to âprotect
our bordersâ. Reality Check Itâs impossible to say
exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being
in contact with someone who has tested positive, however
some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from
September suggests just 10.9% of peopleremained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report
when arguing people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it
suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do âto go to workâ. Most people reported going out for
things such as shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they
needed to quarantine as they didnât develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done
before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of
just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies (Sage) has also highlighted research that shows most peopleappear to be following the rules,external. This research also suggests those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate
than those better off. - By Ben Butcher Friday's coronavirus briefing was led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was joined by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser. Here's what they told us: Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether delaying the second vaccine dose risks creating more resistant variants of the virus. Patrick Vallance says the riskiest thing in terms of new mutations is high prevalence in the community. He says the mutations currently circulating came about naturally due to transmission - but adds there is always ""some risk"" when there is partial immunity. But he says that partial immunity also provides benefits in terms of protection for the most vulnerable. Chris Whitty says, ""Our overall view was that the balance of risks was in favour of having many more people in the UK vaccinated."" On support for businesses and jobs, the PM says the government will ""do what it takes"" to support livelihoods. And with that, he ends today's No 10 briefing. Asked whether the British public are
ready for lockdown to stay in place for a long time, the prime minister says we will have
to live with coronavirus for âa long while to comeâ but it is an open question ""when and in what way"" we can start to relax restrictions. He says it depends on the vaccine rollout going well, getting
case numbers down and whether there are discoveries of any more variants. That doesnât mean that ""Iâm not optimistic"" about the rollout of the vaccine, he says, âbut at this stage you
really have to be very cautious indeedâ. He adds that the first thing that the government wants to open is
schools, which is a priority. Patrick Vallance says he expects the virus âto be around, probably, forever"" but it is going to be controlled. However, he says it is a very different outlook with
increasing numbers of treatments and vaccines, but the key is ânot getting too
hooked up on specific datesâ. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The new variant has been causing
concern in government for a number of weeks. Now the scientists believe there
is some early evidence it could be causing slightly higher mortality â when you
look at everyone testing positive. The overall message from the prime minister
is pretty bleak, Iâm afraid; that the terrible death figures weâve seen in
recent days will continue for a while. We donât seem to heading for a tighter
lockdown in England because the PM believes the current measures are the right
ones if people follow them. But there was a clear message there that we canât
start unlocking society until the rates come down significantly â weâre in this
for a while. The Daily Telegraph's Gordon Raynor raises a video he says has been posted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock aimed at travel agents, suggesting the South African variant is 50% less susceptible to vaccines than the original strain of the virus. He asks whether this is correct and, if so, whether it will affect the government's approach to whether to tighten UK border controls. The PM runs through the measures that the UK has in place, including the ban on direct flights from South Africa and ""rigorous"" obligations for people entering the UK in terms of quarantine and tests. But he suggests ""we may need to go further to protect our borders"", saying the massive progress the UK is making in terms of vaccinations cannot be undermined.  Sky News's Sam Coates asks whether, if the new variant is more dangerous, it is right that more people are ""out and about"" during the current lockdown than the first one last year. The PM says that ""we are enforcing the law very strictly with increasing toughness"", meaning increased fines to dissuade risky behaviour. ""It depends on everybody doing the right thing and avoiding transmission,"" he says, adding that is  what will be more effective than police action. On why the new variant may be transmitting more readily, Sir Patrick Vallance says it is not believed the new variant has a higher viral load, meaning people ""shed more virus"". He suggests it may be other factors that make it more transmissible. On the current infection rate, Chris Whitty says that while infections are slowly going down ""it is at a very, very high level"". He says that among some age groups - including those 20 to 30 - infections may still be increasing. And on hospitalisations, he says that they are ""broadly flat"" for the UK as a whole, but there are variations between regions. ""That peak is not yet definitely going down yet,"" he says. Deaths will be delayed further with the peak expected in the future, he adds. This video can not be played Infection level 'very, very high' and 'extremely precarious' - Prof Whitty The next question asks about whether the UK variant means
lockdown restrictions will last longer. The prime minister says he thinks the country has âthe right package of
measuresâ to deal with the new variant and people need to comply with them. He says there are signs in the data that infections are
flattening, although the rates are still âvery highâ so the government âcanât begin
to consider unlockingâ. The vaccination programme could change this, he says, but the
UK is in a position where cases are so high that unlocking could lead to âa big
reboundâ. Asked whether the South African variant is in the UK, Patrick
Vallance says some cases have been detected but he says the key thing is to try to contain it. He adds that âthere is no evidenceâ that the South African or
Brazilian variants have transmission advantages over the variants already in
the UK and so having cases here doesnât mean âthey will take offâ. Now we move on to questions from journalists, the first of which is from the BBC's health editor, Hugh Pym. In light of the information about the danger posed by the new variant, he asks the PM whether he expects the current death trends to rise more steeply and then fall more slowly. In response, the PM says there was a big surge in deaths over the Christmas period which is continuing and he sadly believes this will continue to be so ""for a while to come"". Prof Whitty says the ""shape of the curve"" is driven by the rate of infections, which has been going up and is now coming down. Sir Patrick says the death numbers are ""awful"" and are likely to continue at current levels for some while, saying this is what was predicted for some time. In response to a separate question about evidence emerging from Israel that the Pfizer-BioTech vaccine might not be as effective as first thought, Sir Patrick says there needs to be further research but overall the efficacy of the approved vaccines is proven. The second question from a member of the public comes from Sally, from Oxfordshire, who asks whether those who have been vaccinated are allowed to mix together with others who have had a jab. Chris Whitty says that - even with the very effective vaccines - there is a period of time straight after a jab ""where there is no effect"". He says people won't see protection for around two to three weeks following their vaccination - and even then ""that protection will not be complete"". He says a large proportion of people in the community have currently got the virus - ""so the risk is if you have the vaccine you still have some residual risk"". Whitty adds that the lockdown is helping to get the rates of infection right down - to allow those who have been vaccinated more protection. ""Over time, the answer will be yes - but at this point in time the answer will be no,"" he says. Sir Patrick Vallance adds there is uncertainty around the vaccine's role in preventing transmission of the virus. Â© 2025 BBC.

Â£500 Covid self-isolation payment idea downplayedA senior government source says the idea was drawn up by officials and has not been considered by the PM.,"There are no plans to pay everyone in England who tests positive for Covid Â£500 to self-isolate, No 10 has said. The PM's official spokesman said there was already a Â£500 payment available for those on low incomes who could not work from home and had to isolate. A universal Â£500 payment was among suggestions in a leaked Department of Health document. There are fears the current financial support is not working because low paid workers cannot afford to self-isolate. But a senior government source said the idea of extending the Â£500 payments to everyone who tests positive had been drawn up by officials and had not been considered by the prime minister. 'Too early' to say if lockdown will end in spring Three-quarters 'rejected for self-isolation grant' Who has to self-isolate and for how long? BBC Newsnight's Katie Razzall said ministers were aware self-isolation was crucial for stopping the spread of coronavirus and the ""options paper"" had been drawn up by civil servants at the Department of Health. She said it would be discussed soon by the Covid operations committee chaired by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, adding the move suggested there was an admission in government that too many people were not staying at home and a decision needed to be made quickly. The story was firstreported by the Guardian,externalwhich said the options paper suggested the proposal could cost up to Â£453m per week - 12 times the cost of the current payouts. Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC he had not seen the leaked document but said the issue of financial support for people self-isolating was ""always kept under review"". ""We've got to consider all sorts of policies in order to make sure that people abide by the rules, are able to abide by the rules and we get the infection rate down,"" he said. But the prime minister's official spokesman denied the government was planning to introduce the new payment, telling reporters: ""We've given local authorities Â£70m for the scheme and they are able to provide extra payments on top of those Â£500 if they think it necessary. ""That Â£500 is on top of any other benefits and statutory sick pay that people are eligible for."" Asked about document, the spokesman said he would not comment on a leaked paper.

This research also suggests that those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate than those better off. BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there was concern in government about the huge cost of the proposal for the Treasury. However, he said the issue of financial incentives and trying to get people to self-isolate was clearly a live discussion within government. It became a legal requirement last September for anyone in England testing positive for coronavirus to self-isolate. TheÂ£500 grant already available in England is funded by the government but administered by local authorities.,external The same level of payment is available in Scotland and Wales with similar conditions attached. Northern Ireland offers a discretionary self-isolation grant that covers expenses, such as the cost of groceries. There is a list of specific criteria applicants must meet for the grant, but those who do not qualify for this payment and who are on a low income or may face financial hardship as a result of self-isolating can apply for a discretionary payment. However, there have been high rejection rates for this discretionary grant in England,figures obtained by Labour and reported by the BBC this week suggest. Between October and December last year, three-quarters of the 49,877 applications were rejected, the data showed. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish government would welcome the introduction of a Â£500 payment, as the additional funds it would generate for Scotland could allow for a similar scheme to be set up. Speaking at her regular coronavirus briefing, she said: ""We will see whether that transpires or not, but any extra resources for self-isolation we would use to support self-isolation.""

"Festival season is 'still possible' in 2021Despite Glastonbury's cancellation, smaller festivals could still go ahead, experts say.","Because of its scale, work on Glastonbury's site must begin earlier than most festivals Music festivals are ""still possible"" this summer, despite the cancellation of Glastonbury, says the head of the Association of Independent Festivals. Paul Reed said Glastonbury ""is a different beast to most festivals and most likely ran out of time due to the size and complexity of the event"". Smaller events could still happen if the government ensures organisers can access cancellation insurance, he said. ""For most festivals, the cut-off point is more likely the end of March."" On Thursday, Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis called off their festival for the second year in a row because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""In spite of our efforts to move Heaven & Earth, it has become clear that we simply will not be able to make the festival happen,"" they said in a joint statement. ""We are so sorry to let you all down."" Glastonbury Festival 2021 axed 'with great regret' MPs urge chancellor to save summer music festivals Tickets for the festival, which normally attracts 200,000 people and was due to take place in June, will roll over to 2022. Glastonbury is the UK's biggest music festival, but it was not the only event to cancel its plans on Thursday. The Country To Country festival, which was due to take place in March, also said its 2021 edition would not happen. The three-day event, which attracts some of country music's biggest names to indoor venues in London, Dublin and Glasgow, said it had pulled the plug due to the ""current restrictions on mass gatherings and international travel"". The announcements came as coronavirus deaths soared in England, with more than 8,500 deaths recorded in the past week. On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""too early"" to say whether England's Covid restrictions would be lifted by the spring. Stormzy has already been announced as a headliner for August's Reading and Leeds festivals Glastonbury's cancellation has raised fears for other music festivals this summer. However, the organisers of Glasgow's TRNSMT said there was ""reason to be optimistic"" that it could go ahead in July, with headliners Lewis Capaldi, Liam Gallagher and the Courteeners. ""Glastonbury is the biggest festival in the world and it's sad to see that, due to its enormous scale and taking several months to get the city-sized festival site ready, it's unable to go ahead this year,""boss Geoff Ellis told Scotland's Daily Record,external. ""By comparison, TRNSMT is a much smaller city centre event with no camping. As such it takes us days rather than months to build TRNSMT. Therefore, we will continue to listen to and follow the advice from the government and remain positive about events later in the summer."" His comments were echoed by Bestival co-founder Rob Da Bank, who tweeted that ""festival season will happen in the UK this summer,external"", adding: ""Sadly Glasto is such a mammoth beast to plan it ran outta time."" Sacha Lord, co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, added that Glastonbury's cancellation was ""yet another blow,external"" to freelancers who work in the live music sector. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Friday, Mr Reed said the UK was at a ""serious point in the pandemic and festivals only want to return when it is safe to do so"". He added that festivals were currently struggling to get insurance for coronavirus-related cancellations. Last week, MPs from the House of Commons culture select committee wrote to the chancellor,urging him to launch a Covid-19 insurance schemeto protect live music. The appeal was backed by more than 100 industry figures, including organisers of the TRNSMT and Parklife festivals. ""We do need government to intervene in this issue,"" said Mr Reed. In a tweet on Thursday,Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden expressed his regret,externalat Glastonbury's cancellation and said the government was ""looking at problems around getting insurance"". A government spokeswoman said on Friday they are in ""regular dialogue"" with public health experts to ""agree a realistic return date for festivals and other large events"". They added they were still helping festivals with the Â£1.5bn Culture Recovery Fund, ""with many already receiving this support"". Latitude Festival has been held at Henham Park, near Southwold, since 2006 Other European countries, including Austria and Germany, have launched schemes to cover events that cannot be rescheduled, including music festivals. At present, England has a scheme protecting film and TV shoots, but not music. However, some festivals have been given support by the government's Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund, including Womad, End of the Road and Nozstock. Melvin Benn, whose company Festival Republic organises the Latitude, Download and the Reading & Leeds festivals, said that without an insurance scheme, other events would be left ""staring into the same barrel that Glastonbury stared into"". ""People can't afford to take that financial risk,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The government is holding ""early stage talks"" with insurers, confirmed Tim Thornhill of Tyser's Insurance, which counts Glastonbury amongst its clients. ""We have helped to put in place the film and TV restart scheme, which the chancellor explained saved 14,000 jobs,"" he said. ""So if we can do something for events, that would be welcome across the industry"". While there is ""no guarantee"" that insurance could be provided, he said there was ""significant urgency"" to finding a solution ""within the next few months"". ""It's really important that the government supports the industry,"" added Radiohead's Colin Greenwood. ""And they need to start thinking about that now, and not when we reach that point - say in October this year - when there are enough people vaccinated for [live music] to become safe. ""Nobody wants to go to anything, or take part in anything, that's going to turn into a super-spreader event,"" he said. ""But obviously there has to be a way out of this, through vaccination. And I think we need to make sure that systems are in place so we can get back into doing what we love."" Julian Knight MP, chair of the culture select committee, said the government was working on insurance plans, because of the importance of festivals to British culture and the economy. ""I've been in to see the chancellor,"" he told BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""Finally I think there is some movement. I understand that they are dropping some of the objections that they may have had, and that we may end up with an insurance scheme. ""However, there's a danger that it's too little too late.""

Beckhams take home Â£21m despite business losses,"David and Victoria Beckham have paid themselves Â£21m from their sports and media business since 2019, according to the their latest accounts. This is despite continued heavy losses at Ms Beckham's fashion business, where trade has worsened during the pandemic. Profit at David Beckham Ventures Limited (DBVL), the brand management firm owned by the former footballer and his wife, fell Â£3.5m to Â£11.3m in 2019. This was in part due to money spent on expansion and charitable donations. However, the celebrity couple still paid themselves a Â£14.5m dividend at the end of 2019, accounts show, and took a further Â£7.1m in 2020. 'Bloody-mindedness' drove Beckham dream Victoria Beckham fashion label makes another loss A spokesman attributed the payments to ""profitable performance"" at DBVL, which among other things manages Mr Beckham's strategic partnerships with Adidas and Haig Club whisky. He also noted that the company's revenue climbed by Â£600,000 in 2019 to Â£16.2m. However, Victoria Beckham Holdings (VBHL), which manages the former Spice Girl's fashion label, fared much worse during that time. Losses at the business - which is also backed by the Beckhams' former business partner Simon Fuller and private equity firm NEO investment Partners -  widened to Â£16.6m during the year, following a loss of Â£12.5m in 2018. It marked the seventh year the brand has been in the red since it was founded in 2008. VBHL blamed costs associated with the launch of the Victoria Beckham Beauty business, a new cosmetics range in which the group has an 85% shareholding. It also noted that total sales across the whole business were up by 7% in 2019. Nevertheless, auditors BDO, who signed off on the accounts, warned that the business was now reliant on shareholder support to keep going which could ""cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern"". As the pandemic hammered the business last April, VBHL had to borrow Â£9.2m from its shareholders to repay an outstanding bank loan to HSBC after breaking its debt covenants. VBHL said it was doing all it could to ""navigate"" the coronavirus crisis, including taking ""all actions possible to conserve cash"". ""All non-essential expenditure is being deferred and hiring freezes have been implemented for open positions.to enable the company to navigate through this pandemic,"" it said.

Three quarters 'rejected for grant',"Three quarters of applications for a Â£500 discretionary grant, which aims to help those on low incomes self-isolate, have been rejected, figures suggest. Employed or self-employed people in England who do not qualify for the Test and Trace Support Payment because they do not receive benefits can apply. Data obtained by Labour and shared with BBC Newsnight suggests just 12,069 of 49,877 applications were successful. The government said it was assessing how the scheme is supporting people. The cumulative figures obtained by Labour suggest that between October and December last year, 35,252 applications to local authorities in Englandfor the discretionary part of the test and trace support payment scheme,externalwere rejected, while 12,069 were granted. Self-isolation without grant 'a kick in the teeth' Call to expand Â£500 grant for Covid self-isolators NHS Covid-19 app adds self-isolation payments Covid-19 app users can't get isolation payment The government introducedthe Test and Trace Support payment in late September,externalas a way of topping up any benefits or Statutory Sick Pay a person receives. The Department of Health and Social Care says it is a targeted scheme designed to help people on low incomes. There is a list of specific criteria applicants must meet for the grant, but those who do not qualify for this payment and who are on a low income or may face financial hardship as a result of self-isolating, can apply for a discretionary payment. Local authorities in England oversee the entire support scheme, with the qualifying criteria set by the government. They blame overly strict criteria and inadequate government guidance for people being rejected who feel they should qualify for a grant. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England as well as the London boroughs, said some councils were having to turn down applications for the discretionary support because ""people are ineligible or have failed to provide the evidence needed"". Last month, the self-isolation period for contacts of people withconfirmed coronavirus was shortened from 14 to 10 daysafter the time of exposure. People who are contacted by NHS Test and Trace and told to self-isolate, face fines of up to Â£10,000 if they fail to comply. Those who don't self-isolate risk spreading the virus to others. This video can not be played Dr Nishant Joshi: Coronavirus self-isolation a 'Sophie's Choice' Dr Nishant Joshi, a GP trainee working at a practice in Luton, says he meets, on a daily basis, people who are faced with what he calls a ""Sophie's choice"". He says: ""People come to me with essentially a Sophie's choice situation - I know I have to isolate but also I don't have enough money to put food on my table. ""If I say to somebody who comes to me with a health problem, you need to take a couple of weeks off work, I've had patients who have come to me and they're in tears."" Rachel, a shop worker from East London with a disabled son, tested positive in early January and was left in a desperate situation after having to self-isolate. She says: ""I didn't have a hot meal for 10 days. I had two bowls of cornflakes and a hot dog. I was hungry. I was petrified"". She adds: ""It's been probably the worst two weeks of my life. On a personal level I knew I had no choice but to isolate to keep my son safe. ""Had I not been in that position I can't guarantee that I would have done the whole self isolation thing because you get desperate."" Her local councillor eventually dropped off a hot meal. Rachel was fortunate and received a Â£500 grant at the end of her isolation. Josie Tothill said missing two weeks of work ""could be the difference between feeding your kids or not, or paying rent or not"" Josie Tothill from Manchester didn't qualify for the scheme, even though her job, as a personal assistant to a woman who needs mental health support, means she is on a low income. She had to self-isolate in October after her sister tested positive.  But she did not receive a call from Test and Trace despite being a contact. Only people with a Test and Trace number are eligible. Josie says: ""It was difficult, but I got by. But for a lot of people, especially if you work in care, you are already on poverty wages, so to miss two weeks of work - that could be the difference between feeding your kids or not, or paying rent or not. ""So you can see, for some people, it's impossible to do that isolation, so it's much harder to control the virus."" The Labour Party, which obtained the figures from local authorities under the Freedom of Information Act, says the government must make sure everyone can afford to self isolate. Shadow communities secretary Steve Reed said it was vital that people who self-isolated were not ""punished for doing the right thing"". He told the BBC: ""The problem is the government established a fixed pot of money and, in some cases, councils have eked it out so much that many people applying for the funding haven't received it. ""In other cases councils have used up all the money because they have more people applying than were expected. ""So, we end up with a postcode lottery, if you live in one area you might get the funding, if you live in another area you might not."" Analysis of the figures by the BBC shows that of the applications to the discretionary scheme: Labour-run Blackburn rejected 80%, as did Coventry Manchester and Exeter rejected 83% and 69% respectively Lib-Dem run St Albans turned down 96% of applications, while Conservative-run Stoke-on-Trent rejected 75% Northumberland rejected 84%, while Derbyshire Dales rejected 99% (Only one candidate of the 100 that applied in that area had their application granted) While most of councils that responded rejected the majority of applications to the discretionary scheme, a smaller number bucked the trend. Lambeth granted 77% of applications, Haringey and Wakefield 75%, and Solihull 64%. While it's impossible to rule out that applications may be coming from people who are taking a chance, it's also clear that some councils are apparently more flexible about the criteria used on the discretionary scheme. The government is putting Â£70 million into funding the scheme. It said: ""Local authorities are responsible for decisions when it comes to making additional discretionary payments to people who fall outside the scope of the main scheme and are facing financial hardship as a result of having to self-isolate. ""We continue to work closely with the 314 local authorities in England to assess how the scheme is supporting people experiencing financial difficulties."" The Local Government Association said the government ""needs to ensure its Â£500 self-isolation payment support scheme is available to those in need of financial support"". It says it is ""good"" that councils will receive extra government funding ""to support people on low incomes who do not meet the strict criteria for this main scheme, but who may face financial hardship because of the requirement to self-isolate"".

Â£500 Covid payment 'could boost self-isolation',"There are no plans to pay everyone in England who tests positive for Covid Â£500 to self-isolate, No 10 has said. The PM's official spokesman said there was already a Â£500 payment available for those on low incomes who could not work from home and had to isolate. A universal Â£500 payment was among suggestions in a leaked Department of Health document. There are fears the current financial support is not working because low paid workers cannot afford to self-isolate. But a senior government source said the idea of extending the Â£500 payments to everyone who tests positive had been drawn up by officials and had not been considered by the prime minister. 'Too early' to say if lockdown will end in spring Three-quarters 'rejected for self-isolation grant' Who has to self-isolate and for how long? BBC Newsnight's Katie Razzall said ministers were aware self-isolation was crucial for stopping the spread of coronavirus and the ""options paper"" had been drawn up by civil servants at the Department of Health. She said it would be discussed soon by the Covid operations committee chaired by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, adding the move suggested there was an admission in government that too many people were not staying at home and a decision needed to be made quickly. The story was firstreported by the Guardian,externalwhich said the options paper suggested the proposal could cost up to Â£453m per week - 12 times the cost of the current payouts. Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC he had not seen the leaked document but said the issue of financial support for people self-isolating was ""always kept under review"". ""We've got to consider all sorts of policies in order to make sure that people abide by the rules, are able to abide by the rules and we get the infection rate down,"" he said. But the prime minister's official spokesman denied the government was planning to introduce the new payment, telling reporters: ""We've given local authorities Â£70m for the scheme and they are able to provide extra payments on top of those Â£500 if they think it necessary. ""That Â£500 is on top of any other benefits and statutory sick pay that people are eligible for."" Asked about document, the spokesman said he would not comment on a leaked paper. By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check It's impossible to say exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being in contact with someone who has tested positive, however some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from September 2020 suggests thatjust 10.9% of people remained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report when arguing that people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do ""to go to work"". Most people reported going out for things like shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they needed to quarantine as they didn't develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has alsohighlighted research that shows that most people don't completely follow the rules,external. This research also suggests that those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate than those better off. BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there was concern in government about the huge cost of the proposal for the Treasury. However, he said the issue of financial incentives and trying to get people to self-isolate was clearly a live discussion within government. It became a legal requirement last September for anyone in England testing positive for coronavirus to self-isolate. TheÂ£500 grant already available in England is funded by the government but administered by local authorities.,external The same level of payment is available in Scotland and Wales with similar conditions attached. Northern Ireland offers a discretionary self-isolation grant that covers expenses, such as the cost of groceries. There is a list of specific criteria applicants must meet for the grant, but those who do not qualify for this payment and who are on a low income or may face financial hardship as a result of self-isolating can apply for a discretionary payment. However, there have been high rejection rates for this discretionary grant in England,figures obtained by Labour and reported by the BBC this week suggest. Between October and December last year, three-quarters of the 49,877 applications were rejected, the data showed. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish government would welcome the introduction of a Â£500 payment, as the additional funds it would generate for Scotland could allow for a similar scheme to be set up. Speaking at her regular coronavirus briefing, she said: ""We will see whether that transpires or not, but any extra resources for self-isolation we would use to support self-isolation."" In other developments: The UK's R number - a measure of whether the epidemic is growing or shrinking - isat or below one for the first time since early December The prime minister is to lead a Downing Street coronavirus briefing at 17:00 British retail sales saw their largest annual fall in history last yearas the impact of the pandemic took its toll UK government borrowinghit Â£34.1bn last month, the highest December figure on record, as the cost of pandemic support weighed on the economy Almost five million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine Northern Ireland's health minister has said it isunrealistic to expect all lockdown restrictions to be lifted on 5 March Compliance with most measures to stop the spread of Covid remains high,according to the latest ONS data,external, with 96% using a face covering and 93% avoiding physical contact when outside their home The proportion of adults only leaving home for work, exercise, essential shopping or medical needs is at its highest level since May 2020 (65%), and proportion of adults working from home at its highest level since June 2020 (45%) Prof Susan Michie, an adviser on the government's Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme just 18% of people with symptoms were self-isolating for the full 10 days they were meant to. She said financial support currently offered to people having to self-isolate was a ""key weakness"" of the government's pandemic strategy. Sharon, a cleaner from Kent, told the BBC if no money were to come in for two weeks she would not be able to afford to self-isolate. ""I have a mortgage to pay,"" she said. ""I can't even afford to heat my property at the moment because my wages were cut and that Â£500 payment would make all the difference. I would be able to self-isolate. ""It wouldn't be enough money, but it would help."" PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The DoH said it would not comment on a leaked paper but stressed it was incumbent on everyone to help protect the NHS by staying at home and following the rules at ""one of the toughest moments of this pandemic"". A spokesman said Â£50m was invested at the time the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme launched and it was providing a further Â£20m to help support people on low incomes who need to self-isolate. People who have tested positive for coronavirus and those considered at risk of having been exposed to it must self-isolate. Other legal obligations to self-isolate in the UK include: If you have Covid symptoms If you live with someone who has tested positive for Covid If you live with someone who has Covid symptoms (unless they have a negative test) If you arrive in the UK from a country other than the Republic of Ireland If you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace to say you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Resources and programmes on BBC iPlayer to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown BBC BITESIZE:Dr Radha shares 5 tips for coping when youâre overwhelmed Would Â£500 be enough to help you to self-isolate?

'Too early' to say if lockdown will end in spring Three-quarters 'rejected for self-isolation grant' Who has to self-isolate and for how long? BBC Newsnight's Katie Razzall said ministers were aware self-isolation was crucial for stopping the spread of coronavirus and the ""options paper"" had been drawn up by civil servants at the Department of Health. She said it would be discussed soon by the Covid operations committee chaired by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, adding the move suggested there was an admission in government that too many people were not staying at home and a decision needed to be made quickly. The story was firstreported by the Guardian,externalwhich said the options paper suggested the proposal could cost up to Â£453m per week - 12 times the cost of the current payouts. Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC he had not seen the leaked document but said the issue of financial support for people self-isolating was ""always kept under review"". ""We've got to consider all sorts of policies in order to make sure that people abide by the rules, are able to abide by the rules and we get the infection rate down,"" he said. But the prime minister's official spokesman denied the government was planning to introduce the new payment, telling reporters: ""We've given local authorities Â£70m for the scheme and they are able to provide extra payments on top of those Â£500 if they think it necessary. ""That Â£500 is on top of any other benefits and statutory sick pay that people are eligible for."" Asked about document, the spokesman said he would not comment on a leaked paper. By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check It's impossible to say exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being in contact with someone who has tested positive, however some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from September 2020 suggests thatjust 10.9% of people remained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report when arguing that people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do ""to go to work"". Most people reported going out for things like shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they needed to quarantine as they didn't develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has alsohighlighted research that shows that most people don't completely follow the rules,external. This research also suggests that those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate than those better off. BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there was concern in government about the huge cost of the proposal for the Treasury. However, he said the issue of financial incentives and trying to get people to self-isolate was clearly a live discussion within government. It became a legal requirement last September for anyone in England testing positive for coronavirus to self-isolate. TheÂ£500 grant already available in England is funded by the government but administered by local authorities.,external The same level of payment is available in Scotland and Wales with similar conditions attached. Northern Ireland offers a discretionary self-isolation grant that covers expenses, such as the cost of groceries. There is a list of specific criteria applicants must meet for the grant, but those who do not qualify for this payment and who are on a low income or may face financial hardship as a result of self-isolating can apply for a discretionary payment. However, there have been high rejection rates for this discretionary grant in England,figures obtained by Labour and reported by the BBC this week suggest. Between October and December last year, three-quarters of the 49,877 applications were rejected, the data showed. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish government would welcome the introduction of a Â£500 payment, as the additional funds it would generate for Scotland could allow for a similar scheme to be set up. Speaking at her regular coronavirus briefing, she said: ""We will see whether that transpires or not, but any extra resources for self-isolation we would use to support self-isolation."" In other developments: The UK's R number - a measure of whether the epidemic is growing or shrinking - isat or below one for the first time since early December The prime minister is to lead a Downing Street coronavirus briefing at 17:00 British retail sales saw their largest annual fall in history last yearas the impact of the pandemic took its toll UK government borrowinghit Â£34.1bn last month, the highest December figure on record, as the cost of pandemic support weighed on the economy Almost five million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine Northern Ireland's health minister has said it isunrealistic to expect all lockdown restrictions to be lifted on 5 March Compliance with most measures to stop the spread of Covid remains high,according to the latest ONS data,external, with 96% using a face covering and 93% avoiding physical contact when outside their home The proportion of adults only leaving home for work, exercise, essential shopping or medical needs is at its highest level since May 2020 (65%), and proportion of adults working from home at its highest level since June 2020 (45%) Prof Susan Michie, an adviser on the government's Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme just 18% of people with symptoms were self-isolating for the full 10 days they were meant to. She said financial support currently offered to people having to self-isolate was a ""key weakness"" of the government's pandemic strategy. Sharon, a cleaner from Kent, told the BBC if no money were to come in for two weeks she would not be able to afford to self-isolate. ""I have a mortgage to pay,"" she said. ""I can't even afford to heat my property at the moment because my wages were cut and that Â£500 payment would make all the difference. I would be able to self-isolate. ""It wouldn't be enough money, but it would help."" PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages?

The DoH said it would not comment on a leaked paper but stressed it was incumbent on everyone to help protect the NHS by staying at home and following the rules at ""one of the toughest moments of this pandemic"". A spokesman said Â£50m was invested at the time the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme launched and it was providing a further Â£20m to help support people on low incomes who need to self-isolate. People who have tested positive for coronavirus and those considered at risk of having been exposed to it must self-isolate. Other legal obligations to self-isolate in the UK include: If you have Covid symptoms If you live with someone who has tested positive for Covid If you live with someone who has Covid symptoms (unless they have a negative test) If you arrive in the UK from a country other than the Republic of Ireland If you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace to say you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Resources and programmes on BBC iPlayer to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown BBC BITESIZE:Dr Radha shares 5 tips for coping when youâre overwhelmed Would Â£500 be enough to help you to self-isolate?

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates throughout the day. Our coverage was brought to you by: James Clarke, Martha Buckley, Becky Morton, George Bowden, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Katie Wright, Gavin Stamp, Lucy Webster and Francesca Gillett. It's been another fairly busy day for coronavirus news, with Boris Johnson giving a press conference earlier. Here's a recap of the top headlines: People who drove 20 miles and then queued for two hours to get fresh milk from a farm's vending machine have been fined for breaching lockdown rules. The farmers who own the vending machine, Einion and Elliw Jones, in Trelogan near Holywell, say they feel North Wales Police have got ""it in for us"". They said even people living nearby were facing being fined, despite the force accepting milk was ""an essential item"". In Wales Covid  rules tell people to ""stay at home"" except for essential reasons, which include buying food. Welsh government guidance on the rules says there are no limits on how far people can travel to shop for essential items, but urge people to stay as ""local to your home as possible"". Ms Jones said some customers from ""just down the road"" in Trelawnyd and Mostyn had even been told they shouldn't be there. The police said the farm was working with the local council to ensure it was ""Covid-compliant surrounding queuing, social distancing etc"". There's more on this story here. New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. There is some evidence that the one that has become dominant in the UK may be associated with a higher degree of mortality, says PM Boris Johnson. Scientists are urgently studying these mutated versions to understand what threat they pose. So how worrying are the new UK, South Africa and Brazil coronavirus variants? The BBC's Michelle Roberts has a look at the evidencehere. Former tennis world number oneAndy Murray will miss the Australian Open having failed to find a ""workable quarantine""as he recovers from coronavirus. The 33-year-old Briton was set to fly out to Melbourne last week, but was not allowed to travel on a charter flight after being found to have Covid-19. The Victorian state government has put in place strict measures to allow players to fly into the country for the tournament, which starts on 8 February. Murray says: ""Gutted to share that I won't be flying out to Australia to compete at the Australian Open. ""We've been in constant dialogue with Tennis Australia to try and find a solution which would allow some form of workable quarantine, but we couldn't make it work. The famous Rovers Return pub on the set of Coronation Street ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are both seeing their filming schedules hit by the pandemic. An ITV spokeswoman confirms Emmerdale stopped filming last week after some members of the team tested positive for Covid-19. She adds they will return to filming on Monday. Meanwhile, Coronation Street will pause filming for two weeks on Monday ""to undertake some rewriting of stories and scripts as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic"". However, the break will not affect its TV schedule and the show will still be on six times a week, a statement adds. The news that the new variant of coronavirus may be more deadly is ""deeply alarming,"" said the shadow health secretary, ""not least
because Boris Johnson assured the nation back in December there was no evidence
the variant was more dangerous."" Jonathan Ashworth said: âWe urge
ministers to go further and faster on vaccination rollout now to save lives,
and introduce proper financial support for those needing to isolate to help
breaks chains of transmission.â  This video can not be played Covid: Wedding party in Stamford Hill broken up by police One of today's top stories about coronavirus in the UK has been police discovering people gathered at a wedding party in north London last night. Originally the police said 400 people had attended - but they have now revised that number down to 150. In a statement, the Met Police said: ""Although
initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now
believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" The organisers of the wedding party - which was held at a strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school in Stamford Hill - face fines. The Met said one organiser would be reported for consideration of a Â£10,000 fine while five other attendees were issued with Â£200 fixed penalty notices. ""This afternoon, an investigation has been launched to identify those others responsible for organising and who attended the wedding,"" the Met added. Read the full story here. There is still âa lot of uncertaintyâ about just how severe
the new UK variant is, according to another of the government's scientific advisers. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government's Scientific
Advisory Group on Emergencies, said the figures given during the Downing Street briefing suggested an increase of something like
30 to 40% in terms of mortality which âreally ties in with what weâre seeing in
the hospitalsâ. Speaking to Radio 4âs PM programme, he said: âIt is
obviously a blow. We were rather hoping that this virus was going to be quite
genetically stable. âThe realisation that this virus is capable of relatively
fast mutation and development of new variantsâ¦ has been a bit of a setback for
us.â Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent With new variants emerging in
different parts of the world, itâs worth highlighting Boris Johnsonâs comments
about borders. It seems pretty clear ministers are considering more
restrictions on people coming into the UK â to stop those variants coming into
the UK if possible. In the PMâs words, the UK may have to further to âprotect
our bordersâ. Reality Check Itâs impossible to say
exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being
in contact with someone who has tested positive, however
some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from
September suggests just 10.9% of peopleremained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report
when arguing people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it
suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do âto go to workâ. Most people reported going out for
things such as shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they
needed to quarantine as they didnât develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done
before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of
just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies (Sage) has also highlighted research that shows most peopleappear to be following the rules,external. This research also suggests those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate
than those better off. - By Ben Butcher Friday's coronavirus briefing was led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was joined by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser. Here's what they told us: Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether delaying the second vaccine dose risks creating more resistant variants of the virus. Patrick Vallance says the riskiest thing in terms of new mutations is high prevalence in the community. He says the mutations currently circulating came about naturally due to transmission - but adds there is always ""some risk"" when there is partial immunity. But he says that partial immunity also provides benefits in terms of protection for the most vulnerable. Chris Whitty says, ""Our overall view was that the balance of risks was in favour of having many more people in the UK vaccinated."" On support for businesses and jobs, the PM says the government will ""do what it takes"" to support livelihoods. And with that, he ends today's No 10 briefing. Asked whether the British public are
ready for lockdown to stay in place for a long time, the prime minister says we will have
to live with coronavirus for âa long while to comeâ but it is an open question ""when and in what way"" we can start to relax restrictions. He says it depends on the vaccine rollout going well, getting
case numbers down and whether there are discoveries of any more variants. That doesnât mean that ""Iâm not optimistic"" about the rollout of the vaccine, he says, âbut at this stage you
really have to be very cautious indeedâ. He adds that the first thing that the government wants to open is
schools, which is a priority. Patrick Vallance says he expects the virus âto be around, probably, forever"" but it is going to be controlled. However, he says it is a very different outlook with
increasing numbers of treatments and vaccines, but the key is ânot getting too
hooked up on specific datesâ. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The new variant has been causing
concern in government for a number of weeks. Now the scientists believe there
is some early evidence it could be causing slightly higher mortality â when you
look at everyone testing positive. The overall message from the prime minister
is pretty bleak, Iâm afraid; that the terrible death figures weâve seen in
recent days will continue for a while. We donât seem to heading for a tighter
lockdown in England because the PM believes the current measures are the right
ones if people follow them. But there was a clear message there that we canât
start unlocking society until the rates come down significantly â weâre in this
for a while. The Daily Telegraph's Gordon Raynor raises a video he says has been posted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock aimed at travel agents, suggesting the South African variant is 50% less susceptible to vaccines than the original strain of the virus. He asks whether this is correct and, if so, whether it will affect the government's approach to whether to tighten UK border controls. The PM runs through the measures that the UK has in place, including the ban on direct flights from South Africa and ""rigorous"" obligations for people entering the UK in terms of quarantine and tests. But he suggests ""we may need to go further to protect our borders"", saying the massive progress the UK is making in terms of vaccinations cannot be undermined.  Sky News's Sam Coates asks whether, if the new variant is more dangerous, it is right that more people are ""out and about"" during the current lockdown than the first one last year. The PM says that ""we are enforcing the law very strictly with increasing toughness"", meaning increased fines to dissuade risky behaviour. ""It depends on everybody doing the right thing and avoiding transmission,"" he says, adding that is  what will be more effective than police action. On why the new variant may be transmitting more readily, Sir Patrick Vallance says it is not believed the new variant has a higher viral load, meaning people ""shed more virus"". He suggests it may be other factors that make it more transmissible. On the current infection rate, Chris Whitty says that while infections are slowly going down ""it is at a very, very high level"". He says that among some age groups - including those 20 to 30 - infections may still be increasing. And on hospitalisations, he says that they are ""broadly flat"" for the UK as a whole, but there are variations between regions. ""That peak is not yet definitely going down yet,"" he says. Deaths will be delayed further with the peak expected in the future, he adds. This video can not be played Infection level 'very, very high' and 'extremely precarious' - Prof Whitty The next question asks about whether the UK variant means
lockdown restrictions will last longer. The prime minister says he thinks the country has âthe right package of
measuresâ to deal with the new variant and people need to comply with them. He says there are signs in the data that infections are
flattening, although the rates are still âvery highâ so the government âcanât begin
to consider unlockingâ. The vaccination programme could change this, he says, but the
UK is in a position where cases are so high that unlocking could lead to âa big
reboundâ. Asked whether the South African variant is in the UK, Patrick
Vallance says some cases have been detected but he says the key thing is to try to contain it. He adds that âthere is no evidenceâ that the South African or
Brazilian variants have transmission advantages over the variants already in
the UK and so having cases here doesnât mean âthey will take offâ. Now we move on to questions from journalists, the first of which is from the BBC's health editor, Hugh Pym. In light of the information about the danger posed by the new variant, he asks the PM whether he expects the current death trends to rise more steeply and then fall more slowly. In response, the PM says there was a big surge in deaths over the Christmas period which is continuing and he sadly believes this will continue to be so ""for a while to come"". Prof Whitty says the ""shape of the curve"" is driven by the rate of infections, which has been going up and is now coming down. Sir Patrick says the death numbers are ""awful"" and are likely to continue at current levels for some while, saying this is what was predicted for some time. In response to a separate question about evidence emerging from Israel that the Pfizer-BioTech vaccine might not be as effective as first thought, Sir Patrick says there needs to be further research but overall the efficacy of the approved vaccines is proven. The second question from a member of the public comes from Sally, from Oxfordshire, who asks whether those who have been vaccinated are allowed to mix together with others who have had a jab. Chris Whitty says that - even with the very effective vaccines - there is a period of time straight after a jab ""where there is no effect"". He says people won't see protection for around two to three weeks following their vaccination - and even then ""that protection will not be complete"". He says a large proportion of people in the community have currently got the virus - ""so the risk is if you have the vaccine you still have some residual risk"". Whitty adds that the lockdown is helping to get the rates of infection right down - to allow those who have been vaccinated more protection. ""Over time, the answer will be yes - but at this point in time the answer will be no,"" he says. Sir Patrick Vallance adds there is uncertainty around the vaccine's role in preventing transmission of the virus. Â© 2025 BBC.

The famous Rovers Return pub on the set of Coronation Street ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are both seeing their filming schedules hit by the pandemic. An ITV spokeswoman confirms Emmerdale stopped filming last week after some members of the team tested positive for Covid-19. She adds they will return to filming on Monday. Meanwhile, Coronation Street will pause filming for two weeks on Monday ""to undertake some rewriting of stories and scripts as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic"". However, the break will not affect its TV schedule and the show will still be on six times a week, a statement adds. The news that the new variant of coronavirus may be more deadly is ""deeply alarming,"" said the shadow health secretary, ""not least
because Boris Johnson assured the nation back in December there was no evidence
the variant was more dangerous."" Jonathan Ashworth said: âWe urge
ministers to go further and faster on vaccination rollout now to save lives,
and introduce proper financial support for those needing to isolate to help
breaks chains of transmission.â  This video can not be played Covid: Wedding party in Stamford Hill broken up by police One of today's top stories about coronavirus in the UK has been police discovering people gathered at a wedding party in north London last night. Originally the police said 400 people had attended - but they have now revised that number down to 150. In a statement, the Met Police said: ""Although
initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now
believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance."" The organisers of the wedding party - which was held at a strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school in Stamford Hill - face fines. The Met said one organiser would be reported for consideration of a Â£10,000 fine while five other attendees were issued with Â£200 fixed penalty notices. ""This afternoon, an investigation has been launched to identify those others responsible for organising and who attended the wedding,"" the Met added. Read the full story here. There is still âa lot of uncertaintyâ about just how severe
the new UK variant is, according to another of the government's scientific advisers. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government's Scientific
Advisory Group on Emergencies, said the figures given during the Downing Street briefing suggested an increase of something like
30 to 40% in terms of mortality which âreally ties in with what weâre seeing in
the hospitalsâ. Speaking to Radio 4âs PM programme, he said: âIt is
obviously a blow. We were rather hoping that this virus was going to be quite
genetically stable. âThe realisation that this virus is capable of relatively
fast mutation and development of new variantsâ¦ has been a bit of a setback for
us.â Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent With new variants emerging in
different parts of the world, itâs worth highlighting Boris Johnsonâs comments
about borders. It seems pretty clear ministers are considering more
restrictions on people coming into the UK â to stop those variants coming into
the UK if possible. In the PMâs words, the UK may have to further to âprotect
our bordersâ. Reality Check Itâs impossible to say
exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being
in contact with someone who has tested positive, however
some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from
September suggests just 10.9% of peopleremained indoors for the full time,external. Labour has often cited this report
when arguing people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it
suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do âto go to workâ. Most people reported going out for
things such as shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they
needed to quarantine as they didnât develop symptoms. This research is quite old (done
before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of
just 400 people. However, the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies (Sage) has also highlighted research that shows most peopleappear to be following the rules,external. This research also suggests those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate
than those better off. - By Ben Butcher Friday's coronavirus briefing was led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was joined by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser. Here's what they told us: Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether delaying the second vaccine dose risks creating more resistant variants of the virus. Patrick Vallance says the riskiest thing in terms of new mutations is high prevalence in the community. He says the mutations currently circulating came about naturally due to transmission - but adds there is always ""some risk"" when there is partial immunity. But he says that partial immunity also provides benefits in terms of protection for the most vulnerable. Chris Whitty says, ""Our overall view was that the balance of risks was in favour of having many more people in the UK vaccinated."" On support for businesses and jobs, the PM says the government will ""do what it takes"" to support livelihoods. And with that, he ends today's No 10 briefing. Asked whether the British public are
ready for lockdown to stay in place for a long time, the prime minister says we will have
to live with coronavirus for âa long while to comeâ but it is an open question ""when and in what way"" we can start to relax restrictions. He says it depends on the vaccine rollout going well, getting
case numbers down and whether there are discoveries of any more variants. That doesnât mean that ""Iâm not optimistic"" about the rollout of the vaccine, he says, âbut at this stage you
really have to be very cautious indeedâ. He adds that the first thing that the government wants to open is
schools, which is a priority. Patrick Vallance says he expects the virus âto be around, probably, forever"" but it is going to be controlled. However, he says it is a very different outlook with
increasing numbers of treatments and vaccines, but the key is ânot getting too
hooked up on specific datesâ. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The new variant has been causing
concern in government for a number of weeks. Now the scientists believe there
is some early evidence it could be causing slightly higher mortality â when you
look at everyone testing positive. The overall message from the prime minister
is pretty bleak, Iâm afraid; that the terrible death figures weâve seen in
recent days will continue for a while. We donât seem to heading for a tighter
lockdown in England because the PM believes the current measures are the right
ones if people follow them. But there was a clear message there that we canât
start unlocking society until the rates come down significantly â weâre in this
for a while. The Daily Telegraph's Gordon Raynor raises a video he says has been posted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock aimed at travel agents, suggesting the South African variant is 50% less susceptible to vaccines than the original strain of the virus. He asks whether this is correct and, if so, whether it will affect the government's approach to whether to tighten UK border controls. The PM runs through the measures that the UK has in place, including the ban on direct flights from South Africa and ""rigorous"" obligations for people entering the UK in terms of quarantine and tests. But he suggests ""we may need to go further to protect our borders"", saying the massive progress the UK is making in terms of vaccinations cannot be undermined.  Sky News's Sam Coates asks whether, if the new variant is more dangerous, it is right that more people are ""out and about"" during the current lockdown than the first one last year. The PM says that ""we are enforcing the law very strictly with increasing toughness"", meaning increased fines to dissuade risky behaviour. ""It depends on everybody doing the right thing and avoiding transmission,"" he says, adding that is  what will be more effective than police action. On why the new variant may be transmitting more readily, Sir Patrick Vallance says it is not believed the new variant has a higher viral load, meaning people ""shed more virus"". He suggests it may be other factors that make it more transmissible. On the current infection rate, Chris Whitty says that while infections are slowly going down ""it is at a very, very high level"". He says that among some age groups - including those 20 to 30 - infections may still be increasing. And on hospitalisations, he says that they are ""broadly flat"" for the UK as a whole, but there are variations between regions. ""That peak is not yet definitely going down yet,"" he says. Deaths will be delayed further with the peak expected in the future, he adds. This video can not be played Infection level 'very, very high' and 'extremely precarious' - Prof Whitty The next question asks about whether the UK variant means
lockdown restrictions will last longer. The prime minister says he thinks the country has âthe right package of
measuresâ to deal with the new variant and people need to comply with them. He says there are signs in the data that infections are
flattening, although the rates are still âvery highâ so the government âcanât begin
to consider unlockingâ. The vaccination programme could change this, he says, but the
UK is in a position where cases are so high that unlocking could lead to âa big
reboundâ. Asked whether the South African variant is in the UK, Patrick
Vallance says some cases have been detected but he says the key thing is to try to contain it. He adds that âthere is no evidenceâ that the South African or
Brazilian variants have transmission advantages over the variants already in
the UK and so having cases here doesnât mean âthey will take offâ. Now we move on to questions from journalists, the first of which is from the BBC's health editor, Hugh Pym. In light of the information about the danger posed by the new variant, he asks the PM whether he expects the current death trends to rise more steeply and then fall more slowly. In response, the PM says there was a big surge in deaths over the Christmas period which is continuing and he sadly believes this will continue to be so ""for a while to come"". Prof Whitty says the ""shape of the curve"" is driven by the rate of infections, which has been going up and is now coming down. Sir Patrick says the death numbers are ""awful"" and are likely to continue at current levels for some while, saying this is what was predicted for some time. In response to a separate question about evidence emerging from Israel that the Pfizer-BioTech vaccine might not be as effective as first thought, Sir Patrick says there needs to be further research but overall the efficacy of the approved vaccines is proven. The second question from a member of the public comes from Sally, from Oxfordshire, who asks whether those who have been vaccinated are allowed to mix together with others who have had a jab. Chris Whitty says that - even with the very effective vaccines - there is a period of time straight after a jab ""where there is no effect"". He says people won't see protection for around two to three weeks following their vaccination - and even then ""that protection will not be complete"". He says a large proportion of people in the community have currently got the virus - ""so the risk is if you have the vaccine you still have some residual risk"". Whitty adds that the lockdown is helping to get the rates of infection right down - to allow those who have been vaccinated more protection. ""Over time, the answer will be yes - but at this point in time the answer will be no,"" he says. Sir Patrick Vallance adds there is uncertainty around the vaccine's role in preventing transmission of the virus. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Clothes sales slump in worst year ever for shopsClothing sales were hit hardest, with the sector seeing a 25% drop in sales last year.","Shoppers bought far fewer clothes last year as lockdowns meant people had less opportunity to socialise and go out. Clothes sales slumped 25%, the biggest drop in 23 years when records began,official figures suggest.,external While shops have reported demand for certain clothing such as pyjamas and loungewear has risen, demand for going-out items has fallen sharply. And despite a pick-up in December, clothing sales remain lower than before the pandemic struck. ""With few opportunities to socialise during lockdown and many people working from home, the clothing sector has been one of the ""worst-affected by restrictions"", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Earlier this month, Marks & Spencer said sales of sleepwear had soared Growing numbers of High Street shops have faced financial difficulties due to the temporary store closures imposed during lockdowns. Topshop-owner Arcadia and competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed last March. The inability to try clothes on in bricks-and-mortar shops, as well as restrictions on eating out meaning consumers are going out less, have all affected sales, the ONS suggested. And the slump in demand for fashion meant that British retail sales saw their largest annual fall on record in 2020. Sales fell by 1.9% last year, when compared with 2019, the largest year-on-year fall since records began in 1997. Retail sales, including fuel, did see a small increase last month, growing by 0.3% when compared with November. It came following the end of England's national lockdown on 2 December.Sales had slumped by 4.1% in Novemberduring a month-long shutdown. But ""this was very clearly not a Merry Christmas for most of the High Street"", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""For most retailers it's the most crucial month of the year to get profit back on track but the large upswing in sales after the pain of the November lockdowns didn't materialise,"" she said.

""The gap widened between those retailers with the most sophisticated online propositions from those with legacy store-dependent business models,"" he said. Online-only retailers such as Boohoo and Asos, for example, have reported strong sales figures in 2020.

There was also better news from the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, on Friday. It said that it would return a Â£300m emergency coronavirus loan to the government as trading went ""better than anticipated"" over Christmas. Today's figures show just how badly the clothing sector has been affected these last 12 months. Fashion is the big retail loser from this pandemic. Who needs to splash out on the latest trends when we're working from home and not going out? And even when clothing shops are open, chances are you can't try things on. With all of the Covid-19 measures in place, the fun has been sucked out of shopping. We haven't stopped spending, but most of it is going online.

The pressures have already taken their toll on the likes of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group and Debenhams. And things may well get worse on the high street before they better. Many retailers are worried about the end of the business rates holiday and of the temporary ban on eviction for non payment of rent in April. These will result in a big increase in costs when sales have yet to fully recover. But Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, called for more help for non-essential shops and High Street retailers who continue to be affected by lockdown restrictions.

"UK borrowing hits highest December level on recordGovernment borrowing hit Â£34.1bn last month, as the cost of pandemic support measures weighed on the economy.Business","UK government borrowing hit Â£34.1bn last month, the highest December figure on record, as the cost of pandemic support weighed on the economy. It was also the third-highest borrowing figure in any month since records began in 1993,the Office for National Statistics said.,external The figures underline Chancellor Rishi Sunak's problems as he prepares his March Budget. Separately, a survey suggested activity at UK firms fell sharply this month. The closely-watchedPurchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from IHS Markit/CIPS,externalfound a ""steep slump in business activity"" during in January as lockdown measures continued, and warned that ""a double-dip recession is on the cards"". Government borrowing for this financial year has now reached Â£270.8bn, which is Â£212.7bn more than a year ago, the ONS said. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated that borrowing could reach Â£393.5bn by the end of the financial year in March. A Budget had been expected to take place in autumn last year, but it was delayed because of the pandemic and will now take place on 3 March. Mr Sunak has already imposed a pay freeze on at least 1.3 million public sector workers as part of efforts to contain government spending. Where does the government borrow billions from? Retail sales see biggest fall since records began Cost of living jumps despite Covid Christmas curbs The increase in borrowing has led to a steep increase in the national debt, which now stands at Â£2.13 trillion. The UK's overall debt has now reached 99.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. Borrowing so far this financial year is at its highest level since monthly records began in 1993. The overall government deficit is still heading to its highest in peacetime. Having started to recover in late summer, the renewed shutdowns have again hit the numbers. The actual amount of borrowing in December, at Â£34.1bn, was five times last year's amount and exceeded in only two previous months at the start of the pandemic lockdowns. Spending on jobs support, including the furlough scheme, was Â£10bn in the month alone. Purchases of vaccines, testing equipment and PPE also pushed up borrowing by Â£9bn. Receipts of income tax, VAT and business rates were all around Â£1bn less than last December. Despite the national debt now rising to just under 100% - the highest since the early 1960s - the interest paid on that debt was just Â£100m up on last December. The chancellor said the figures showed it had been fiscally responsible to inject massive sums to support lives and livelihoods, but reiterated a message that he would look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing when the recovery returns. The Budget in March will mark only a tentative start to this process. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest borrowing figures, coupled withweak retail sales data, meant that the economy still needed the government's financial support. ""The chancellor should ensure that is the main focus of his Budget on 3 March and not a desire to reduce the budget deficit by raising taxes,"" he added. In his reaction to the figures, Mr Sunak appeared to acknowledge that now was not the time for tax increases. ""Since the start of the pandemic we've invested over Â£280bn to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK and support our economy and public services,"" he said. ""This has clearly been the fiscally responsible thing to do. But as I've said before, once our economy begins to recover, we should look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing."" This video can not be played What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy? Nonetheless, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, pointed out that the Treasury would not tolerate a 10% deficit indefinitely. ""The timing of the next general election in 2024 suggests that Mr Sunak will not wait until the economy has fully recovered before actively tightening fiscal policy,"" he said. ""Accordingly, we expect taxes to rise sharply in 2022, in order to attempt to stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio, while at the same time funding big demography-linked increases in health and pensions spending."" The government borrows in the financial markets, by selling bonds. A bond is a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates. There is a large payment on the final date - in effect, the repayment. The buyers of these bonds, or ""gilts"", are mainly financial institutions, like pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. Private savers also buy some.

A figure below 50 implies a decline in activity. ""A steep slump in business activity in January puts the locked down UK economy on course to contract sharply in the first quarter of 2021, meaning a double-dip recession is on the cards,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""Services have once again been especially hard hit, but manufacturing has seen growth almost stall, blamed on a cocktail of Covid-19 and Brexit, which has led to increasingly widespread supply delays, rising costs and falling exports.""

Mr Sunak has already imposed a pay freeze on at least 1.3 million public sector workers as part of efforts to contain government spending. Where does the government borrow billions from? Retail sales see biggest fall since records began Cost of living jumps despite Covid Christmas curbs The increase in borrowing has led to a steep increase in the national debt, which now stands at Â£2.13 trillion. The UK's overall debt has now reached 99.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. Borrowing so far this financial year is at its highest level since monthly records began in 1993. The overall government deficit is still heading to its highest in peacetime. Having started to recover in late summer, the renewed shutdowns have again hit the numbers. The actual amount of borrowing in December, at Â£34.1bn, was five times last year's amount and exceeded in only two previous months at the start of the pandemic lockdowns. Spending on jobs support, including the furlough scheme, was Â£10bn in the month alone. Purchases of vaccines, testing equipment and PPE also pushed up borrowing by Â£9bn. Receipts of income tax, VAT and business rates were all around Â£1bn less than last December. Despite the national debt now rising to just under 100% - the highest since the early 1960s - the interest paid on that debt was just Â£100m up on last December. The chancellor said the figures showed it had been fiscally responsible to inject massive sums to support lives and livelihoods, but reiterated a message that he would look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing when the recovery returns. The Budget in March will mark only a tentative start to this process. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest borrowing figures, coupled withweak retail sales data, meant that the economy still needed the government's financial support. ""The chancellor should ensure that is the main focus of his Budget on 3 March and not a desire to reduce the budget deficit by raising taxes,"" he added. In his reaction to the figures, Mr Sunak appeared to acknowledge that now was not the time for tax increases. ""Since the start of the pandemic we've invested over Â£280bn to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK and support our economy and public services,"" he said. ""This has clearly been the fiscally responsible thing to do. But as I've said before, once our economy begins to recover, we should look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing."" This video can not be played What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy? Nonetheless, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, pointed out that the Treasury would not tolerate a 10% deficit indefinitely. ""The timing of the next general election in 2024 suggests that Mr Sunak will not wait until the economy has fully recovered before actively tightening fiscal policy,"" he said. ""Accordingly, we expect taxes to rise sharply in 2022, in order to attempt to stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio, while at the same time funding big demography-linked increases in health and pensions spending."" The government borrows in the financial markets, by selling bonds. A bond is a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates. There is a large payment on the final date - in effect, the repayment. The buyers of these bonds, or ""gilts"", are mainly financial institutions, like pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. Private savers also buy some.

A figure below 50 implies a decline in activity. ""A steep slump in business activity in January puts the locked down UK economy on course to contract sharply in the first quarter of 2021, meaning a double-dip recession is on the cards,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""Services have once again been especially hard hit, but manufacturing has seen growth almost stall, blamed on a cocktail of Covid-19 and Brexit, which has led to increasingly widespread supply delays, rising costs and falling exports."" Despite this, the survey also found companies were upbeat about longer-term prospects, thanks to progress being made with the vaccine rollout this year. How does the government borrow money?

Firefighters return to flood-hit village with pumps,"This video can not be played Teresa Dalling says a river of orange water rushed through the village on Thursday Serious flooding which forced villagers from their homes was potentially caused by a mine shaft ""blow out"" during Storm Christoph, authorities have said. About80 people were evacuatedas water rushed through Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, on Thursday. Residents have been told they will not be able to return home this weekend or ""possibly longer"". The Coal Authority said initial checks suggested water had built up in the shaft and flooded the village. Carl Banton, from the Coal Authority, said there had been a ""tremendous amount"" of rain recently and potentially a blockage in the drainage system could have caused the mine shaft to ""blow out"". Mr Banton reassured people that officers had visually checked other mine shafts in the area and were ""not concerned"" any would collapse. ""The mine shaft in question is the one that was on actually on the water level, it has found its point of weakness,"" he said. Carl Banton said that while investigations were ongoing heavy rain may have overwhelmed the mine shaft A major incident was declared as water rushed into the village on Thursday, leaving eight streets underwater as Storm Christoph caused widespread flooding across Wales. On Friday, as firefighters continued to pump water out of the village, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) confirmed the Tennant Canal had been polluted ""from mine water"". Late on Friday evening, Neath Port Talbot council said, for safety reasons, people forced to leave their homes would ""not be able to return home this weekend, and the wait could possibly longer"". A support centre will open at Abbey Primary School from Saturday, with council officers on site to help people access emergency support. This video can not be played Parts of village underwater after flooding The Coal Authority, which manages the effects of historical coal mining, are investigating the cause of the flooding. Mr Banton said initial findings showed there may have been a build-up of water on the hillside which had ""found its way out"" through the mine shaft, flooding the village. ""The flow appears to be subsiding... but what we are unsure of is if there is a feed of additional water into the mine workings, from the extensive mine workings on the hillside,"" he added. At least 80 people have had to leave their homes in the village after flooding Mr Banton said officers would drill down into the shaft and investigate on Saturday, in the hope that people could soon be allowed back into their homes. ""A lot of the mining in this area is very old... some of it dates back to the early 1800s... we have no details of how the shaft in question here was originally filled or capped,"" he said. ""We will ensure the mine shaft is properly capped and sorted out."" Martyn Evans, of NRW, said officers were looking at how to minimise the risk of pollution to nearby rivers, and investigating any impacts on the River Neath. ""We have also carried out tests on other watercourses in the vicinity of the incident. Results indicate there has been no significant impact on those at present,"" he said. On Thursday night a further 20 homes were evacuated by emergency services as the water continued to rush through the village. First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed on Friday financial support would be made available to people affected by the recent floods, up to Â£1,000 per household. ""This is the same level of support available a year ago when storms Ciara and Dennis hit Wales, just before the pandemic,"" he said. The water is warmer than the air and is creating a mist along Dynevor Road Skewen resident John Thomas said he returned home from a funeral with wife Lynne on Thursday to find their house had turned into ""a lake"", he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. He said: ""The water was around the level of the bottom of the doors so we couldn't go in, so we just had to stand there and watch this orange-coloured water just piling up and up and up."" Mr Thomas said that with water up to his waist, he was unable to get in to rescue possessions. Financial help offered to flood victims Storm Christoph: Flood warnings and homes evacuated Storm Christoph in pictures Storm Christoph floods tracked by satellite radar He added: ""We're in a bit of a dip on the road, so you could see it gradually coming up, they were worried it might have been a sinkhole because of the coal mines. ""It's definitely mine workings, just by looking at the colour of the water, it's an orange colour. ""Other people who were evacuated had the chance to move things upstairs, I didn't have a chance to do that because I couldn't get in to it."" The couple are now staying with their daughter, with everyone else who was evacuated from their homes finding accommodation and told to avoid the area. More than 30 residents of Cwrt-Clwydi-Gwyn care home were among those moved as a precaution. It was a sleepless night for Skewen resident Teresa Dalling Teresa Dalling, who lives in Dynevor Road, said she had spent the night fearing for her safety. ""I haven't slept. I was up the back door every two hours checking the water level,"" she said. ""I didn't know we lived near old mines and if there's been a collapse, my fear is more could follow and that's terrifying."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As well as properties, vehicles were submerged in water Up to 45 firefighters were involved at the scene at the height of the flooding. In a joint statement, the police, fire service and Neath Port Talbot Council urged people not to return to their homes until it was safe. Ch Supt Trudi Meyrick said: ""We appreciate people are eager to get back to their homes and we are working with partners to allow this to happen as soon as it is safe to do so. ""In the meantime we ask people to please be patient as their safety is our top priority."" In one home, floodwater can be seen filling the living room Firefighters are continuing to pump water out of the village where people were forced to leave their homes Deputy Chief Fire Officer Roger Thomas, of Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said firefighters remained in the village, pumping out water. He said: ""We will continue to monitor the situation and support our partner agencies and those affected over the next few days."" Homes were evacuated at Goshen Park, in Skewen Neath Port Talbot council said a local rest centre was available, and measures had been put in place to protect against Covid-19. Chief executive Karen Jones said they would continue to support residents who had to leave their homes and they would ensure others had a safe place to go if further evacuations were necessary. Network Rail said engineers had checked for any potential damage to the railway line, but had found no ""cause for concern"". The water has rushed through the streets of the town A severe flood warning remains in force for the Lower Dee Valley, from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadows. Three flood warnings are in place for the River Wye at Monmouth, River Ritec at Tenby, and Bangor-on-Dee, where people were forced to leave their homes on Thursday as flooding saw a major incident declared. Eleven flood alerts are also in place. Snow and ice could also exacerbate issues for emergency services and those forced to leave their homes,with temperatures forecast to plummet in coming days.

Retail sales see biggest fall since records began,"Shoppers bought far fewer clothes last year as lockdowns meant people had less opportunity to socialise and go out. Clothes sales slumped 25%, the biggest drop in 23 years when records began,official figures suggest.,external While shops have reported demand for certain clothing such as pyjamas and loungewear has risen, demand for going-out items has fallen sharply. And despite a pick-up in December, clothing sales remain lower than before the pandemic struck. ""With few opportunities to socialise during lockdown and many people working from home, the clothing sector has been one of the ""worst-affected by restrictions"", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Earlier this month, Marks & Spencer said sales of sleepwear had soared Growing numbers of High Street shops have faced financial difficulties due to the temporary store closures imposed during lockdowns. Topshop-owner Arcadia and competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed last March. The inability to try clothes on in bricks-and-mortar shops, as well as restrictions on eating out meaning consumers are going out less, have all affected sales, the ONS suggested. And the slump in demand for fashion meant that British retail sales saw their largest annual fall on record in 2020. Sales fell by 1.9% last year, when compared with 2019, the largest year-on-year fall since records began in 1997. Retail sales, including fuel, did see a small increase last month, growing by 0.3% when compared with November. It came following the end of England's national lockdown on 2 December.Sales had slumped by 4.1% in Novemberduring a month-long shutdown. But ""this was very clearly not a Merry Christmas for most of the High Street"", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""For most retailers it's the most crucial month of the year to get profit back on track but the large upswing in sales after the pain of the November lockdowns didn't materialise,"" she said. ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said that some sectors, however, had been ""able to buck the trend"" last year. Lockdown fashion: 'People are back in pyjamas' High Street crisis: 'Regular customers are keeping us going' Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years' Pre-Christmas lockdown restrictions hit retail sales ""The increased popularity of click-and-collect and people buying more items from home led to a strong year for overall internet sales, with record highs for food and household goods sales online."" In a sign of the way the pandemic has changed shopping habits, the value of online retail sales jumped by 46.1% in 2020 when compared with 2019 - the highest annual growth reported since 2008. Online trade now accounts for more than one-third of all retail sales. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, explained that the rise of online had ""polarised industry performance"". ""The gap widened between those retailers with the most sophisticated online propositions from those with legacy store-dependent business models,"" he said. Online-only retailers such as Boohoo and Asos, for example, have reported strong sales figures in 2020. Supermarkets in particular have embraced the shift to digital, with online food store sales up 79.3% last year. There was also better news from the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, on Friday. It said that it would return a Â£300m emergency coronavirus loan to the government as trading went ""better than anticipated"" over Christmas. Today's figures show just how badly the clothing sector has been affected these last 12 months. Fashion is the big retail loser from this pandemic. Who needs to splash out on the latest trends when we're working from home and not going out? And even when clothing shops are open, chances are you can't try things on. With all of the Covid-19 measures in place, the fun has been sucked out of shopping. We haven't stopped spending, but most of it is going online. Boohoo and Asos have seen very strong sales growth, for instance. The going's far harder for retailers with large numbers of physical stores. The pressures have already taken their toll on the likes of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group and Debenhams. And things may well get worse on the high street before they better. Many retailers are worried about the end of the business rates holiday and of the temporary ban on eviction for non payment of rent in April. These will result in a big increase in costs when sales have yet to fully recover. But Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, called for more help for non-essential shops and High Street retailers who continue to be affected by lockdown restrictions. ""With no end in sight for retailers closed in lockdown, many will struggle to survive under a mounting rent burden, and a return to full business rates in April,"" she said. She called on government to offer ""targeted"" business rates relief to businesses worst-affected by the pandemic. ""Decisive action is needed to save jobs, shops and local communities, with town and city centres looking to be particularly hard hit unless the government acts now."" Earlier in January, a report from the Centre for Retail Research said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, because of the acceleration towards online shopping. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, it said.

Brexit: Retailers could burn goods stuck in EU,"UK retailers could abandon goods EU customers want to return, with some even thinking of burning them because it is cheaper than bringing them home. They say the new EU trade deal has put costly duties on returns at a time when firms are already struggling. The BBC has been told UK High Street and luxury brands have a mounting volume of goods stuck with courier services on the continent. None of the retailers would comment on the problem. Adam Mansell, boss of the UK Fashion & Textile Association (UKFT), said it's ""cheaper for retailers to write off the cost of the goods than dealing with it all, either abandoning or potentially burning them."" Since 1 January, lots of European customers have been presented with an unexpected customs invoice when signing for goods they've ordered from the UK. These new customs charges are a result of the new EU trade deal with the UK. ""It's part of the ongoing small print of the deal,"" said Mr Mansell. ""If you're in Germany and buying goods from the UK, you as the German customer are the importer bringing goods into the EU. ""You then have a courier company knocking on the door giving you a customs clearance invoice that you need to pay to receive your goods."" Adam Mansell, boss of the UK Fashion & Textile Association Many customers automatically reject the goods, refusing to pay the additional surcharges, leaving couriers to take them away. About 30% of items bought online are returned, according to figures from Statista. That has meant large volumes of goods are heading back to the UK. When goods arrive back at depots on the Continent, there is new customs paperwork to complete. ""Export clearance charge, import charge arrival, import VAT charge and depending on the goods a rules of origin document as well,"" said Mr Mansell. ""Lots of large businesses don't have a handle on it, never mind smaller ones."" The BBC has seen a document that states four major UK High Street fashion retailers are stockpiling returns in Belgium, Ireland and Germany. One brand will incur charges of almost Â£20,000 to get the returns back. 'I was asked to pay an extra Â£82 for my Â£200 coat' EU firms stop UK deliveries over Brexit tax change Couriers and freight businesses that ship from the UK to Europe are also experiencing delays getting goods to the Continent because of the new customs clearances. ""It's a bigger change than we thought possible,"" explained Shona Brown from Speedy Freight, a courier service. ""Before, we'd get the order to Germany and off the driver would go. ""Now we've got to do export entry detailing where was it made, the driver needs to go to the customs office at Dover, then customs in Germany on arrival and then sort out the VAT. There are so many hoops to jump through, it's so laborious."" ""You've got to have manpower to figure out what to do. And with people working from home it's difficult. For small businesses, it is a huge thing for people to do,"" she added. Ulla Vitting Richards Ulla Vitting Richards runs her sustainable fashion brand VILDNIS from the UK. She has stopped exporting to her fastest growing market, the EU, because of the new customs processes. ""I've been involved in logistics before. I expected it to be bad and I am used to shipping to the USA which is difficult. But this is just mind-blowing,"" she said. ""Every day there is another layer. In the first two weeks we couldn't get answers. For two years we were told to get ready for Brexit. But for these we couldn't prepare."" She added: ""I don't think we can increase prices but we might just have to say that we can't make the business with the EU work. It is a real shame. There is a huge interest in sustainable fashion in Europe and we might have to walk away from it."" Ulla did speak with the Department for International Trade for help and advice. She was told that setting up a subsidiary distribution hub in Europe might be a good idea: ""He told me we'd be best off moving stock to a warehouse in Germany and get them to handle it."" Retailers in the UK and Europe that trade across the new customs border are all still adapting to the rules. Hauliers and customs agents are facing a steep learning curve too. The government said: ""Now the UK has left the EU customs union and Single Market, there are new rules and processes businesses will need to follow. ""We have encouraged companies new to dealing with customs declarations to appoint a specialist to deal with import and export declarations on their behalf - and we made more than Â£80m available to expand the capacity of the customs agents market."" It added: ""Most businesses use a specialist such as a customs broker, freight forwarder or fast parcel operator to deal with this. ""The government will continue to work closely with businesses to ensure they are able to trade effectively under the new rules.""

Covid: Half of early-years staff âdonât feel safeâ,"Early years educational providers in England have been told to remain open Many staff at nurseries, pre-schools and childminders ""don't feel safe at work"", says the Early Years Alliance. The group, representing early years providers, wants staff in this sector to be a higher priority for Covid testing and vaccinations. Nurseries and settings for young children in England have been told to remain open during lockdown. The government said the under-fives were ""unlikely to be playing a driving role in transmission"". The Early Years Alliance received more than 3,500 responses in a survey of staff in nurseries or childcare settings and said these suggested widespread concerns - with half of those who replied saying they did not feel safe at work. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the group, said the safety worries were ""a cause for serious concern"". He called on the government to implement rapid coronavirus testing among early years staff ""as a matter of urgency"", adding they should be ""given priority access to vaccinations in phase two of the rollout"". There are currently no confirmed plans for lateral-flow testing in nurseries and pre-schools. But theJoint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is looking at whether some high-risk professions should be prioritisedfor vaccination. And Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the BBC's Breakfast programme he would ""very much like to see it"" once the most vulnerable groups had received their jabs. Nurseries 'teetering on the edge' during pandemic Early years staff 'should have vaccine priority' Nursery staff 'torn between duty and fear' A Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said: ""Keeping nurseries and childminders open will support parents and deliver the crucial care and education for our youngest children. ""Current evidence suggests that pre-school children are less susceptible to infection and are unlikely to be playing a driving role in transmission."" The Early Years Alliance survey also found concerns that staff shortages would make it difficult for some nurseries and pre-school settings to stay open. Dr Amelia Massoura, who runs Stepping Stone pre-school, in Sittingbourne, Kent, said: ""Out of six members of staff, four have contracted Covid-19. ""Fortunately, all have recovered well."" Vanessa Linehan, manager of Sandbrook Community Playgroup in Hackney in London, said: ""We are happy to stay open to support our families. ""But we want our staff to have testing and vaccinations as a priority. ""We encourage local authorities to prioritise appropriate testing for early-years staff through their community testing programmes,"" said the Department for Education spokesman. The Department for Education says the under-fives are ""unlikely"" to drive up coronavirus transmission However, Labour's shadow education minister Tulip Siddiq accused the government of ""incompetence and neglect"", saying early-years staff ""deserve... proper access to testing"". She questioned why ""the government has refused to publish the scientific basis for keeping early-years settings open in lockdown"" and called on it to ""urgently pull back from the brink of funding changes that could lead to viable early-years providers going bust"". The government changed the funding formula for the early years sector in December, basing it on current attendance rather than pre-pandemic levels. According to the DfE, early years attendance is at 54% of the usual daily level, as of 14 January, leading to a shortfall in revenues. In primary and secondary schools, which are open to vulnerable children and children of key workers only,average attendance levels have fallen to just 14%. Roughly half of nurseries and pre-schools and a third of childminders expect to be operating at a loss by the end of the spring term, based on current levels of government support, according to the survey. ""Early years providers are the only part of the education sector that the government has asked to remain open to all families,"" said Mr Leitch ""It is surely not too much to ask for the protection - both practical and financial - needed to ensure that we can continue to do so.""

Nissan commits to keep manufacturing in Sunderland,"Nissan's car plant in Sunderland is the UK's biggest and employs 6,000 people directly Japanese car maker Nissan has told the BBC its Sunderland plant is secure for the long term as a result of the trade deal reached between the UK and the EU. It said it will move additional battery production close to the plant where it has 6,000 direct employees and supports nearly 70,000 jobs in the supply chain. Currently, the batteries in its Leaf electric cars are imported from Japan. Nissan would not confirm if this would mean additional jobs at Sunderland, which is the UK's largest car plant. Manufacturing the more powerful batteries in the UK will ensure its cars comply with trade rules agreed with the EU requiring at least 55% of the car's value to be derived from either the UK or the EU to qualify for zero tariffs when exported to the EU. Some 70% of the cars made in Sunderland are exported and the vast majority of them are sold in the EU. Nissan warns on its UK future without a Brexit deal Scrapped 4x4 plant plans 'not down to Brexit' Nissan had issued stark warnings last year that if the UK left the EU without a trade deal, the resulting tariffs on cars and components would make the Sunderland plant ""unsustainable"". Nissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta told the BBC: ""The Brexit deal is positive for Nissan. Being the largest automaker in the UK we are taking this opportunity to redefine auto-making in the UK. Nissan's Ashwani Gupta said the Brexit deal had created a 'competitive environment' ""It has created a competitive environment for Sunderland, not just inside the UK but outside as well. ""We've decided to localise the manufacture of the 62kWh battery in Sunderland so that all our products qualify [for tariff-free export to the EU]. We are committed to Sunderland for the long term under the business conditions that have been agreed."" It came as Nissanpaused one of its two production lines in Sunderland on Fridayas disruption at ports caused by the pandemic affected its supply chain. The company said the move would affect the line which produces the Qashqai and Leaf, but work would resume next week. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed the firm's endorsement of Sunderland as a manufacturing base. ""Nissan's decision represents a genuine belief in Britain and a huge vote of confidence in our economy thanks to the certainty our trade deal with the EU delivers,"" he said. ""For the dedicated and highly-skilled workforce in Sunderland, it means the city will be home to Nissan's latest models for years to come and positions the company to capitalise on the wealth of benefits that will flow from electric vehicle production."" It's particularly welcome after the more guarded comments from the boss of Vauxhall's parent company last week. Speaking as the tie-up between Fiat Chrsyler and Peugeot Citroen was christened with new umbrella name Stellantis, boss Carlos Tavares said that the future of its Ellesmere Port plant depended on the support the UK government was prepared to offer after its decision to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars after 2030. ""If you change, brutally, the rules and if you restrict the rules for business then there is at one point in time a problem,"" he said. Looking forward, he said it would make more sense to locate an electric vehicle factory closer to the larger EU market. Industry voices welcomed the news from Nissan but reinforced the message from Vauxhall's owners that the government needs to do more to secure the future of the car industry as it electrifies. ""This is obviously good news and will help the Nissan Leaf avoid any future tariffs, but we are going to need to see a lot more investment in battery production in the UK if we are to preserve the UK as a car manufacturer and exporter,"" said Professor David Bailey of Warwick University. The head of trade body the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders agreed. ""The battery plant in Sunderland may be enough for Nissan's near-term plans to build tens of thousands of electric cars but the UK made 1.5 million cars last year and all will be partly electric by 2030,"" Mike Hawes said. Andy Palmer, former boss of Aston Martin and current chairman of electric bus maker Switch Mobility, has gone further. He says that 800,000 jobs are at risk if the UK government doesn't act now to foster battery investment. ""Without electric vehicle batteries made in the UK, the country's auto industry risks becoming an antiquated relic and overtaken by China, Japan, America and Europe."" He urged the UK government to use every lever at its disposal to make the UK attractive. UK car investment has fallen sharply since the UK voted to leave the EU. In the five years to 2016 it averaged Â£3.5bn per year. In the four years since it has averaged around Â£1bn - a fall of 71% at a time when the technology and map of car production are going through their biggest revolution since the car was invented. The Nissan decision is therefore a very welcome boost to the UK which is in an international scramble for the investment of the future which is happening right now.

Police arrest 320 dangerous UK child sex offenders,"Some 320 of the UK's most dangerous child sex offenders have been arrested since the first coronavirus lockdown, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. Investigators have been focusing on tracking down offenders who operate online. The operation led to a total of 4,760 arrests and 6,500 children safeguarded between April and September last year. Meanwhile, the Home Office has launched a strategy to collect detailed data about child grooming gangs. The Tackling Child Sexual Abuse Strategy aims to identify and convict offenders who operate in groups by gathering more information about their characteristics, including ethnicity. It also involves investing in the national child abuse image database to identify offenders more quickly, protecting police from frequently being exposed to indecent images, and enabling parents to ask officers if someone with access to their child is known to them for cases of abuse. Children 'at risk' from encrypted message apps School children 'still at risk of online grooming' Record number of online child abuse crimes reported Home Secretary Priti Patel said some who had suffered child sexual abuse had told her they felt ""let down by the state"", and insisted she was ""determined to put this right"". Rob Jones, an NCA director, welcomed the initiative ""at a time when the threat to children is more severe than it has ever been"", highlighting that last year there were at least 300,000 people posing a sexual threat to children in the UK. He said the NCA was focusing on the most dangerous offenders ""as part of the whole system approach"". ""Many feel they can operate with impunity online - using anonymisation techniques, secure accounts and the dark web - but as we have shown with this operation they are wrong and we have the capabilities to track them down,"" he said. Mr Jones added: ""These are not just images or videos being viewed online. ""What we are uncovering here is evidence of the horrific, real-world sexual abuse of children."" Out of the 320 arrested as part of the NCA's operation targeting the UK's most dangerous child sex offenders, 122 were targeted by NCA officers. Seventeen were in positions of trust, including a volunteer with the Scouts, church youth group leaders, a social worker, primary school and college teachers, a hospital care assistant, a police officer, and a civil servant. In the year ending March 2020 the NCA and UK policing made 7,212 arrests and safeguarded and protected 8,329 children. This was a 50% increase in arrests and a 10% increase in safeguards compared with the year ending March 2019. Ms Patel said that the national strategy would tackle and respond to ""all forms of child sexual abuse, relentlessly going after abusers, whilst better protecting victims and survivors"". She added: ""Crucially, it contains a commitment to collect higher quality data on the characteristics of offenders, so that the government can build a fuller picture of perpetrators, and tackle the abuse that has blighted many towns and cities across our country."" The government has pledged to support local authorities' responses to exploitation through funding for The Children's Society's Prevention Programme initiative, which has so far trained 13,363 professionals to spot signs of child abuse. Through the Online Safety Bill, the Home Office has also said it will ensure technology companies are held to account for harmful content on their sites. The Children's Society's chief executive, Mark Russell, has described the strategy as a ""golden opportunity to improve support for child victims of horrific crimes and send a clear signal that child sexual abuse and exploitation are crimes that will not be tolerated"". The scheme was also welcomed by GCHQ and charity NSPCC, which said it has received more than 40 calls a day about child sexual abuse since the pandemic began. GCHQ's director of serious and organised crime said: ""Our work to tackle systemic internet problems, the insight we provide into offender behaviour and our efforts alongside law enforcement to identify and pursue the worst offenders will help to ensure there is no safe space online for these people to operate."" NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless said it ""rightly puts the emphasis on early intervention and action across government but added it ""must be backed up with serious investment in support for victims"" - and that children were still being exposed to abuse from teachers and social workers. Sir Peter said: ""It's crucial that no young person is left unprotected which is why it's disappointing the government has not committed to closing the legal loophole that enables some adults to abuse their position of power to have sexual contact with 16 and 17-year-olds in their care.""
