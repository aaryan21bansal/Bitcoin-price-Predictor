Scotland 29-13 Wales,"Six Nations: Scotland v Wales Scotland (9) 29 Tries:Seymour, VisserCons:Russell 2Pens:Russell 5 Wales (13) 13 Try:WilliamsCon:HalfpennyPens:Halfpenny 2 A spirited second-half performance at Murrayfield earned Scotland their first Six Nations win over Wales since 2007. For all their superior physicality in the first half, Wales led by only 13-9 at the interval, Liam Williams rounding off a slick move for their sole try. Scotland were dominant thereafter, with Tommy Seymour and Tim Visser crossing the line and stand-off Finn Russell earning 19 points with his kicking. The Scots' success ended Wales' run of four consecutive wins in Edinburgh. The result put Vern Cotter's team top of the championship table beforeIreland's 19-9 win over Francesaw the Scots drop back to second. For Wales, though, it was a second loss in three matches in this year's campaign. It was compelling from the first whistle, a fire-cracker of a Test match, ferocious, error-strewn at times, but utterly fascinating all the way through. Russell and Halfpenny had traded penalties in the opening quarter before Wales made the first significant move. A free-kick at a scrum was tapped by the wonderful Rhys Webb, a whirling dervish at nine for the visitors. Wales' eye for the chance was quick and their execution was a delight. They came screaming across the field, Halfpenny putting Williams over in the left corner. Halfpenny then converted to put Wales precisely where they wanted to be - in the lead on the front foot. Scotland then suffered another blow a minute later when John Hardie went off injured. Another injured body piled on top of the other injured bodies - Alasdair Dickinson and WP Nel, Sean Maitland and Duncan Taylor, Greig Laidlaw, their captain, and Josh Strauss, their principal back-row ball-carrier. Harlequins wing Tim Visser scored Scotland's second try and produced a dramatic try-saving tackle Their resilience, though, is astonishing. On came Hamish Watson, who was terrific as Scotland set sail. Russell made it 10-6 with the boot, before Halfpenny re-established the seven-point lead. It was the last time Wales troubled the scoreboard. Even before the break there were signs of the Scots stirring. Justin Tipuric had to pull off a fine tackle to keep Huw Jones out, but Russell at least gave them the consolation of three more points. A four-point game at the break. Scotland were a bit fortunate, but they kicked-on magnificently from there. Seymour's try electrified Murrayfield, Hogg's sweet delayed pass-and-give to Visser drew Halfpenny and created space for the Glasgow Warriors wing to go over. There was concern about obstruction earlier in the move but the try stood and so did the conversion after Russell's effort slapped off the inside of the post and obligingly fell over on the right side of the crossbar. Wales came again through Webb, but Ali Price, wonderful on his first start, pulled off a try-saving tackle. The visitors quickly became ragged. They ran into blue walls, each error, each big hit stripping them of their belief. Scotland skipper John Barclay believes the team are capable of beating England - but only if they are on their game Russell eased Scotland further clear just short of the hour; 19-13. Wales responded and once again they were repelled. It was Webb again, darting in at the corner only to be put in touch, just, by Visser, arguably playing the game of his life for Scotland. The Scots had more pressure to soak up, but soak it up they did. There was a desperate lack of invention in the Wales attacks, a predictability that Scotland absorbed before striking out themselves. And here, again, we saw the difference between the sides. Scotland had elan and skill and invention. Wales did not. Visser's score was a glorious illustration of it. Patience in the forwards through the phases and the ruthlessness when the chance arrived. Hogg's hands in delivering the try-scoring pass to the winger brought Murrayfield to its feet. Russell converted, then added another penalty and Scotland were home. Twenty unanswered points in the second half was a thunderous response from a Scottish team that can no longer be deemed improving or emerging. They've arrived. In the here and now, they are reborn.

Ireland 19-9 France,"Six Nations: Ireland v France Ireland (7) 19 Try:MurrayCon:SextonPens:Sexton 2, JacksonDrop-goal:Sexton France (6) 9 Pens:Lopez 3 Ireland kept their hopes of a third Six Nations title in four years alive by recovering from an early deficit to beat France in a bruising encounter. Two Camille Lopez penalties put France 6-0 up but Conor Murray's converted try edged Ireland into a one-point lead. Johnny Sexton added two penalties and a drop goal in a keenly contested second half, with Lopez and replacement Paddy Jackson trading late penalties. Sexton, back after injury, passed the 600-point mark in international rugby. Relive Ireland's win in Dublin Win keeps us in title hunt - Murray Ireland move a point ahead of Scotland at the top of the table, with England's game at home to Italy to come on Sunday. Joe Schmidt's men, beaten in their first match in Scotland, have 10 points from their three matches and now face Wales away and England at home. France left the Aviva Stadium empty-handed to remain on five points and they next host Italy before a final-day trip to Cardiff. Johnny Sexton celebrates his well-taken drop-goal with Rob Kearney during the second half Ireland remain unbeaten at home in the Six Nations during the tenure of coach Schmidt, a run stretching back to 2014, and they will go into their next game in Cardiff on 10 March with confidence. France displayed glimpses of their much-heralded revival under their coach Guy Noves but showed signs of tiredness throughout the second half and their hopes of a first championship success since 2010 are now surely over. Only once in the past 10 Six Nations meetings between these sides had the winning margin reached double digits, so Ireland will be happy to come away with a hard-fought win and deny their opponents a losing bonus point. Get all the latest Six Nations news by addingrugby union alertsin the BBC Sport app. France began in intense fashion as they sought to carry through the momentum gained from their narrow defeat by England and morale-boosting success over Scotland. Their enterprising start was epitomised by an outrageous dummy by scrum-half Baptiste Serin, which almost yielded a try, while centre Remi Lamerat was only denied a score by a knock-on by his midfield partner Gael Fickou after Lopez's audacious cross-field kick had set up the chance. In the event, the visitors only had two Lopez penalties to show for their early dominance and it was Ireland who assumed control for the remainder of the half. The hosts were rewarded for their superiority in territory and possession when Robbie Henshaw made ground after a five-metre scrum and passed to man-of-the-match Murray, who dived over from close range for the only try of the game. Ireland should have gone in at half-time further ahead, but turned down a couple of kickable penalties in favour of kicking for the corner, while the French defended stoutly to keep their half-time arrears to a single point. France looked a more confident, settled and better prepared side for periods in the first half, but despite their squad having enjoyed an unaccustomed break from Top 14 action last weekend, they were already showing signs of fatigue by the interval. Ireland remain unbeaten at home in the Six Nations under coach Joe Schmidt It was Ireland who showed the greater purpose and spirit after the break, with fly-half Sexton defying the fact that he had been out of action through injury for the past five weeks by pulling the strings and piling on the points. In the first half, the Leinster man converted Murray's try and almost created a try for Keith Earls when he kicked towards the corner after a fine Ireland wraparound move along the backs, only for wing Noa Nakaitaci to ground the ball first. The number 10's early second-half penalty was followed by an exquisite drop-goal, which brought the home supporters to their feet and the Aviva Stadium to life. A further penalty extended Ireland's advantage in a breathless second half and although the French put up some resistance, the hosts showed the greater resilience and, with the Ireland pack largely in control, the outcome never looked in doubt. After Sexton was withdrawn to a rapturous reception, Lopez pulled France back to bonus-point range with his third penalty, but Jackson's kick with four minutes remaining ensured the Noves' side went home empty-handed and broken-hearted. Ireland's experienced half-back partnership of Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton played a huge part in the victory and scrum-half Murray's try swung the man of the match award in his favour Ireland:Kearney, Earls, Ringrose, Henshaw, Zebo, Sexton, Murray, McGrath, Best, Furlong, D.

Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley,"Travis Kalanick has had tense meetings with his staff Uber's meteoric rise was dogged by incessant lawsuits, enraged protests and staggering losses. Or, as co-founder Travis Kalanick might consider it right now, the ""good old days"". He now faces tougher challenges. This week began with Uberopening an investigation into serious, systemic sexual harassment, and ended with being dramatically sued over claims its self-driving companystole technology from Google. Uber's long been a company synonymous with the worst traits of Silicon Valley. Hyper-aggressive business practices and a ruthless approach to competition have seen it constantly at war with governments, as well as the industries it has disrupted so devastatingly in what feels like the blink of an eye. The level of shock expressed last weekend, when former employee Susan Fowler detailed what she said was rampant discrimination at the firm, was perhaps matched in volume by those saying ""I told you so"". Much of the frustration directed at Uber has been because it took a barrage of negative press to kick the company into action over a culture most often described, by insiders and out, as ""toxic"". In an attempt to repair some of the damage, Mr Kalanick stood in front of his staff on Tuesday and offered - according to a person at the meeting - an emotional ""we must do better"". Later in the week, a group of around 100 female engineers had a further meeting with Mr Kalanick,audio from which was obtained by Buzzfeed,external. His staff told him no investigation was needed to expose problems at the company, he just had to start ""listening to your own people"". ""Fair enough,"" came the reply. What will have become clear to Mr Kalanick at that point is that for the first time in the company's history, ""more money"" is no longer his quick fix. This story has so far been focused on San Francisco, where Uber is headquartered, and the location where Ms Fowler worked. But shortly after the allegations came to light, several former Uber employees contacted the BBC with concerns about how the company was operating in its offices around the world. All requested to remain anonymous. In 2014, Uber - by this point five years old - began operating in Singapore, which became its hub for operations across Asia. ""It's definitely a much wider problem than just in the United States,"" one source, a former employee at the Singapore office, told me. He said problems began emerging as the company began to experience ""completely insane growth"". Uber has offices - and problems - across the world ""They grew so quickly they just weren't equipped. At the beginning there were just no formalised HR processes, nothing of the sort."" In Ms Fowler's blog post, she alleged her performance review scores were retrospectively lowered to make it look like she had been underperforming. This was a tactic familiar to many at the company. ""[I] had a written performance review,"" my source said. ""It had all been stellar, fantastic, and then randomly at some point, two weeks later when I get the ratings sent to me, it was just completely different."" Another former employee spoken to by the BBC worked for Uber in a major European city - though requested we did not cite the specific country as the team was small. She said instances of ""threatening behaviour"" between staff were reported, but ""no action was taken"". She added that there was a ""lack of support"" or ""any kind of empathy"" for employees that felt threatened. ""I hope [the] investigation will somehow help the employees but I highly doubt it,"" she said That investigation, announced last Sunday, is being led by Eric Holder, who formerly served under President Obama as attorney general - the highest-ranking law enforcement position in the US. Uber has not said when Mr Holder will report back, but has pledged the investigation will swift and thorough. Uber has been accused of using tech stolen from Google When contacted by the BBC about the scope of the investigation, an Uber spokeswoman would not discuss whether it would be looking at potential issues outside of the US. Many have criticised Uber over the specifics of the probe. Mr Holder has worked for the company in the past - offering legal advice in the firm's battle to avoid having to gather fingerprints when vetting drivers. Also part of the investigation team is Arianna Huffington, best known as co-founder of the Huffington Post, and currently a member of Uber's board. Leading the frustration at Uber's response are Mitch and Freada Kapor from Kapor Capital, investors in Uber since 2010. ""We are disappointed to see that Uber has selected a team of insiders to investigate its destructive culture and make recommendations for change,"" the couple wrote. ""To us, this decision is yet another example of Uber's continued unwillingness to be open, transparent, and direct."" Another of Uber's investors has been lashing out in a very different way. Google Ventures may have led a $268m funding round for Uber in 2013, but that stake counted for little on Thursday. Waymo, a company spun out from Google's self-driving team, sued Uber-owned autonomous company Otto, alleging it stole its LiDAR technology - the system used by self-driving cars to ""see"". Waymo had been working on its LiDAR for several years, but Otto was created just last January. It was snapped up by Uber for $680m just a few months later. Thanks to a mistakenly sent email, Waymo said it got hold of technical drawings relating to Otto's LiDAR technology. They allege that Otto co-founder Anthony Levandovski downloaded around 14,000 confidential files just before he left Google. Uber has strongly denied the claims, calling them ""baseless"". But should it lose the case, the repercussions could be a costly and time-consuming dent in its self-driving ambitions. Not only could the damages reach into the many hundreds of millions of dollars, but Uber would also potentially need to look elsewhere for its LiDAR technology. While workplace culture and a legal battle over self-driving technology may not seem directly related, both represent new ground for Uber: they are problems that won't simply go away if Uber turns to its usual tactics of aggression or evasion. Both also represent a major thorn in the side for Uber's aspirations to be a publicly traded company. The sexism row was ""really starting to affect how we perceive the company and its public persona"" said Kate Mitchell, co-founder and partner at Scale Venture Partners, speaking to CNBC. Based on investments to date, Uber is currently valued at $68bn. Going public with its current problems could drag down its initial stock price. Investors may not be keen to get on board with a company facing one serious lawsuit over intellectual property, and the potential for financial fall-out due to its workplace culture. But Uber does still have one thing going for it - popularity of the product. Despite numerous calls for a boycott, and the anger of some drivers who feel they are being short-changed, the reality is that Uber has reinvented public transport in a manner which makes it almost impossible to turn back. Regular readers of this column may remember me considering whether Uber may even be too big to fail. Indeed, even the people I spoke to who were angry at Uber's culture expressed an admiration for what the company had achieved and that shows no sign of waning yet. ""It's a company I truly love,"" said a former employee. ""And I just hate to see where it's at."" Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,externalandon Facebook,external.

Rugby's Trimble on what inspires his love of the game,"They are some of the best-known lines from one of the nation's favourite poems, the mantra of numerous self-help manuals and an inspiration for a range of politicians from President Franklin D Roosevelt to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. ""If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster, and treat those two imposters just the same."" But while the words of Rudyard Kipling's poem are familiar, the application of them is altogether more challenging. How does one live without being lifted by success or dumped by failure? How can anyone maintain such detachment from the vicissitudes of life? After playing in 69 international rugby matches, Ireland's wing three-quarter Andrew Trimble knows the highs and lows of professional sport. Last year, the team achieved its best ever series of results, with victories over southern hemisphere giants Australia and South Africa and then, for the first time in 111 years, Ireland beat the reigning world champions, the New Zealand All Blacks. ""There's no bigger moment than beating the All Blacks,"" Trimble explains. ""After the game, we were walking around just shaking our heads and saying, 'What have we done? We've just beaten the All Blacks!' No Irish team has ever done this before."" Andrew Trimble says his spirituality enhances his love of rugby So was his life suddenly and completely fulfilled by winning these important matches? ""I love the game,"" he says. ""It's a driving force and a massive part of what I want to do. But it's important to be reminded that there's something else out there, there's something more important than rugby."" We're seated in the wooden pews of Ballyalbany Presbyterian Church in County Monaghan, about two miles from where the international team has just completed an open training session in preparation for Saturday's Six Nations match against France. Standing on the touchline throughout the session, it's hard to imagine how rugby union professionals can do anything other than submit themselves to the demands of the game. It's relentlessly fast, consistently ferocious. It is all-consuming. Off the field, Trimble is impeccably courteous to every autograph-hunter and maintains that having ""something more important than rugby"" actually enables him to cope better with the pressures of professional sport. Just 16 months ago, after two operations on the same foot injury were followed by a stress fracture, he began to believe that his career might be over. Trimble was dropped from Ireland's squad for World Cup 2015 and, aged 29, was faced with losing something that had dominated his life since the age of seven. ""If it's over, you have to draw on something else so rugby doesn't become the be-all-and-end-all. It doesn't define me, I'm defined by something more important. It's a different mindset and perspective."" So what is that perspective? ""There's an eternal perspective,"" he explains. ""Rugby lasts for 10, 15 years but the perspective of having a faith, and a sincere faith, is something that doesn't end and something that lasts forever."" Trimble believes that spirituality enhances his love for the sport. ""I'm far happier having that perspective and knowing that there is a bigger picture than putting all my trust in rugby, in a career that can be over in 10 years or a lot less than 10 years."" He says that his Christian faith has also enabled him to fight against the temptation to become entirely self-absorbed. Last year, he visited a camp in Tanzania. It's run by Oxfam and houses hundreds of refugees from Burundi. He was profoundly moved by the experience. ""Some of these people will live their entire lives in refugee camps. They had families, they had careers, they had hopes and dreams and they've been cut short."" Trimble laments his own ignorance of the issue and says if he hadn't been taken to Tanzania by Oxfam, he would never have known about the refugee crisis in Africa. And his motivation to do something is shaped by his theology. Andrew Trimble during his visit to Tanzania ""Pope Francis says they're all created in the image of God. They're just like you and me, they're no less special. It's a real shame that they're forgotten about because they're considered less important."" With that, our time together runs out and Trimble returns to the Ireland training camp - with the French in his sights. He certainly embodies Kipling's view that triumph and disaster should be treated ""just the same"". But in some ways, his approach is closer to that of 17th Century poet Richard Lovelace. In his poem, To Lucasta, Going to the Wars, Lovelace argues that his affections are only heightened by being answerable to a higher authority. ""I could not love thee, Dear, so much, Loved I not honour more."" According to Andrew Trimble, an eternal perspective does the same for him - win, lose or draw.

Did Trump win because his name was first in key states?,"One of the world's leading political scientists believes Donald Trump most likely won the US presidential election for a very simple reason, writes Hannah Sander - his name came first on the ballot in some critical swing states. Jon Krosnick has spent 30 years studying how voters choose one candidate rather than another, and says that ""at least two"" US presidents won their elections because their names were listed first on the ballot, in states where the margin of victory was narrow. At first sight Krosnick's idea might seem to make little sense. Are voters really so easily swayed? Most of them are not. ""Most of the people that voted Republican were always going to vote Republican and most of the people that voted Democrat were always going to vote Democrat,"" says James Tilley, professor of politics at the University of Oxford. But a minority are. ""There is a human tendency to lean towards the first name listed on the ballot,"" says Krosnick, a politics professor at Stanford University. ""And that has caused increases on average of about three percentage points for candidates, across lots of races and states and years."" Political scientists call this the primacy effect. It has the biggest impact on those who know the least about the election they are voting in. You are more likely to be affected, Krosnick says, ""if you are feeling uninformed and yet feel obligated to cast a vote - or if you are feeling deeply conflicted, say between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump."" When an election is very close the effect can be decisive, Krosnick says - and in some US states, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the 2016 election was very close. A ballot paper used in the 2016 presidential election in Wisconsin A 2016 ballot paper being recounted in Oakland Count, Michigan ""In the states where Trump won very narrowly, his name was also listed first on the ballot in most of those states,"" says Krosnick. Some always list parties in the same order. Some allow the state's officials to make a new choice each time. Some put the party that lost in the last election at the top of the ballot. Some list alphabetically. In 2002, a court overturned the result of the mayoral election in the Californian city of Compton, after hearing testimony about the name-order effect. The judge decided that in this instance, the decision to list one of the candidates first had been deliberate and unfair. ""Candidates whose last names begin with letters picked near the end of the lottery have it tough,"" Krosnick explained during the Compton court case. ""They will never get the advantage that comes from being listed first on the ballot."" There are numerous cases where the primacy effect is thought to have influenced the result of an vote. In January 2008, Hillary Clinton unexpectedly beat Barack Obama in the New Hampshire primary - part of the long battle to decide which of them would become the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. Professor Michael Traugott from the University of Michigan believes that name order enabled Clinton to pick up extra votes. Her name was at the top of a long list. Obama's was near the end. Listen to part one ofAnalysis: How Voters Decideon the BBC iPlayer Part two can be heard on Radio 4 at 20:30 on Monday 27 February The primacy effect can also affect polling. The exit poll from the 2004 US presidential election led pundits on the night to believe that Democratic Party candidate John Kerry would win, when in fact he went on to lose to incumbent president George W Bush. The poll had listed Democrat candidate Kerry before Republican candidate Bush. What can be done to prevent the primacy effect? One option is to randomise the ballot papers. The states of California and Ohio have both adopted this system. An equal number of ballot papers is issued with a different candidate at the top of the list. This spreads the benefit of the name-order effect across the candidates. In 1996, Bill Clinton received 4% more votes in the regions of California that listed him first in the ballot papers than in those where he featured lower down the list. Research by Robert Darcy of Oklahoma State University shows that, given the choice, most election officials tend to list their own party's candidates first. In one famous example of this, Florida's rules meant that Republican governor Jeb Bush's brother George W Bush was placed at the top of the list of candidates in his state, in the 2000 presidential election. Bush went on to win Florida - which turned out to be a decisive state - by a very narrow margin. George Bush was listed first in Florida in 2000 - the ""butterfly ballot"" used in Palm Beach (pictured) also led to arguments in court ""Because of the fact that different states in the US order candidate names differently and idiosyncratically, and almost none of the states do what Ohio and California do which is to rotate candidate name order across ballots to be fair, we have unfortunately had at least two recent election outcomes that are the result of bias in the name ordering,"" says Krosnick. ""If all of those states had rotated name order fairly, most likely George W Bush would not have been elected president in 2000, nor would Donald Trump have been elected president in 2016.""

The unravelling of Kim Jong-nam's death,"It's got all the markings of a John Le Carre novel: the killing of the North Korean leader's brother with one of the deadliest chemical weapons created by man. But who by? And why? Many questions remain unanswered. Here's a look back at how the killing unfolded, the details that emerged, and the subsequent accusations and diplomatic row. He was waiting at a budget departure hall inside Kuala Lumpur international airport when the attack happened. Leaked CCTV footagewould later showthe 45-year-old man loitering in the budget terminal, a rucksack slung over his shoulder, ahead of his return flight to the Chinese territory of Macau at 10:00. Suddenly a woman in a long-sleeve white top approaches him from behind. Her hands grab his face, before she walks away. It's not clear if she uses a cloth or her bare hands to touch his face. The attack is over in a matter of seconds. CCTV footage appears to show a woman accosting Mr Kim in the airport The man reportedly told airport staff that ""someone had grabbed him from behind and splashed a liquid on his face"". He sought medical help at the airport, but later died en route to hospital. A day later, he was confirmed to be Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Who was Kim Jong-nam? Reports on the attackfirst start to emergein South Korean media, who name the man as Kim Jong-nam - it's not until two days later that Malaysia confirms his identity. To complicate matters, he was travelling on a passport under the name Kim Chol. It was not the first time Mr Kim had travelled under an assumed identity: he was caught trying to enter Japan using a false passport in 2001. He told officials he had been planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland. Many believe it was this incident that led to his father's decision to pass him over for leadership,forcing him to live a life in exile. During a time of estrangement from his family, Mr Kim became one of the regime's highest-profile critics. Theories abound that North Korea might have been involved in his murder - what some are already calling an assassination - despite a lack of proof. South Korea was one of the first to point the finger at its northern neighbour. North Korea's history of foreign assassinations Malaysian authorities begin the autopsy, ignoring demands from North Korea to send the body back for investigation. Meanwhile, the first person suspected of involvement in the attack is arrested: a 28-year-old Vietnamese woman named Doan Thi Huong. Police say she was identified from CCTV footage taken at the airport, where she was seen wearing a white top emblazoned with the letters ""LOL"". This CCTV image has been broadcast by South Korean and Malaysian media Four days after the airport attack, Malaysia's deputy prime minister officially confirms the dead man is Kim Jong-nam. Another female suspect, Siti Aisyah, a 25-year-old Indonesian, is named and arrested. Her Malaysian boyfriend, Muhammad Farid Jalaluddin, is briefly questioned by police. Main players in mysterious killing Events take a bizarre turn when Siti Aisyah tells policeshe thought she was taking part in a bizarre TV prankwith Mr Kim. Indonesia's most senior policeman, Tito Karnavian, said Ms Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong had performed the prank on other men - persuading them to close their eyes before spraying them with water. Siti Aisyah was the second suspect to be named ""She was not aware that it was an assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents,"" Mr Karnavian told reporters. Tensions between Malaysia and North Korea also start to simmer after North Korea's ambassador to the country says Pyongyang will reject the results of the autopsy - he does not trust the inquiry, he says. Malaysia also refuses to hand over the body until it receives a DNA sample from Mr Kim's next-of-kin. Malaysian policearrest the first North Korean personover Mr Kim's death - a 46-year-old man called Ri Jong Chol. A day later, Malaysian police widen their search to include four more suspects, all men from North Korea. They are named as: Ri Ji Hyon, 33; Hong Song Hac, 34; O Jong Gil, 55, and Ri Jae Nam, 57. Two of the suspects wanted by Malaysian police: Hong Song Hac, 34, and Ri Ji Hyon, 33 The deputy police chief said the men had left Malaysia on 13 February, the day Mr Kim was killed, after arriving on different days within the previous fortnight. International police agency Interpol are later requested to issue an alert for the suspects. At the same time, South Korea explicitly states it believes its northern neighbourwas behind the killingof Kim Jong-nam. Tensions between North Korea and Malaysia threaten to turn into a full-blown diplomatic row as the latterrecalls its ambassador from the North Korean capital Pyongyangand summons the North Korean ambassador ""to seek an explanation"". Fuji TV airs grainy CCTV footage of the attack for the first time. The lady with the white top emblazoned with the letters ""LOL"" is seen lunging at Kim Jong-nam. Malaysian authorities say theyare unable to formally identify the bodybecause no family member has come forward. Security is high at the Kuala Lumpur mortuary, amid widespread speculation Mr Kim's son, Kim Han-sol, might travel to Malaysia. Malaysia and North Korea continue to trade harsh words as the situation escalates. A senior North Korean embassy official is named as one of two men wanted in connection with the killing as the investigation widens. Passport photos of Kim Uk II (left) and Hyon Kwang Song The men are Hyon Kwang Song, 44, the second secretary of the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur and Kim Uk II, 37, who works for North Korean airliner Air Koryo. Malaysian police also confirm Mr Kim died after two women wiped a toxin on his face while he was waiting for his flight to Macau. North Korea appears to blame Kim Jong-nam's death on Malaysia, without actually naming him. The state news agency KCNA said only that ""a citizen of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea]"" travelling on a diplomatic passport had died due to ""a heart stroke"". Reports of poisoning were false,it said, slamming Malaysia for holding an autopsy without North Korea's permission. It is the first timeNorth Korean state media have referred to Mr Kim's killing. One of the deadliest chemical weapons created by man is confirmed by Malaysia to have been the nerve agent that killed Kim Jong-nam. Justa small drop of VX, which is classified as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations, can kill a person within minutes. One of the woman who attacked Mr Kim suffered symptoms of vomiting, which Malaysian officials say was probably due to exposure to the agent. Weapons expert Bruce Bennett says a small quantity of VX  was likely to have been put on cloths used by the attackers to touch his face, with a separate spray possibly used as a diversion. Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar previously said the fact the woman who accosted Mr Kim immediately went to wash her hands showed she was ""very aware"" that she had been handling a toxin. How deadly VX could have killed Kim Jong-nam It would have begun affecting his nervous system immediately, causing first shaking and then death within minutes. VX is not available commercially, which experts say points to some kind of government involvement. There are a number of North Korean organisations capable of directing such an attack, includingthe exclusive Guard Command. Who in North Korea could organise a VX murder? Who could be responsible?

Going local: Is community-led social care the way forward?,"A few years ago Jessy would have been stuck in hospital because there was no provision of social care in her area With health and social care budgets feeling the squeeze, the need to find ways to care for people that are both affordable and effective is one of the country's biggest challenges. Around the UK many attempts are being made to deliver care in different ways and here are three different approaches to community-based care. Kathryn Humpston, a local area co-ordinator for Derby City Council, says: ""I try to help people help themselves."" One of the people she visits is John, an alcoholic who was in and out of hospital because of his condition. He often spent all his money on alcohol rather than food and Kathryn has to check what is in his larder. As he only has two tins of beans and some powdered soup in stock, she tops up his supplies, gathered by an informal community food bank operating in the Boulton area of Derby. Local area co-ordinators were introduced into Derby five years ago, copied from an existing scheme in Western Australia. The idea is that vulnerable older people could find a lot of the support they need from within their own communities, rather than from council services, their GPs or from hospitals. Just over half the Â£500,000 annual costs of the scheme are paid for by the NHS to reduce demand on those services, The co-ordinators tap into an often hidden network of support from neighbours, friends, family, voluntary groups and churches, who all seem willing to help improve the communities they live in by looking out for people who need help. ""All this costs nothing,"" says Kathryn. The 10 co-ordinators working in Derby's inner city have helped about 700 people, all of whom have very complex needs. Only 17 of them have actually gone on to need a taxpayer-funded package of support from social services. ""If those 700 people had just one episode of social care fewer in their lifetime that would be a system saving of some Â£600,000,"" explains Mick Burrows of the NHS Southern Derbyshire Clinical Commissioning Group. Jessy has nothing but praise for her carer after coming home from hospital following a hip replacement operation. ""I wouldn't be here at all if it wasn't for her. I'd probably be still in hospital waiting to get home,"" she says. A few years ago she would have been stuck in hospital because there was no provision of social care in the rural area she lives in, south of Loch Ness. Boleskine Community Care was set up by the local community, who recognised that their older people were having to move away to get help if family members could not help. In the Scottish Highlands the NHS, not local councils, is responsible for providing home care It is run by local women who work for Highland Home Carers, an employee-owned company in Inverness. The carers manage themselves and do their own assessments of old people's needs. In the Scottish Highlands, spending on health and social care is fully integrated, meaning the NHS, rather than local councils, is responsible for providing care at home. ""The way we're funded helps us to give you what you want and gives you more choices,"" explains carer Julie Russell. ""You can choose how you use your hours."" This is because of the Scottish system of Self Directed Support, or personal budgets. Once a person's needs are assessed, they can decide how their care budget is spent. It can lead to some surprising choices. ""We've cleared snow, chopped firewood, helped in the garden, as well as taken people to the GP and all the usual personal care,"" says Julie. Angela is very clear about why she agreed to live with Gill. ""When I first saw her I thought she was very nice and I liked even more because she had a horse,"" Angela explains. Gill, and her partner Pete, became Shared Lives carers for Angela about six years ago. It is a much greater commitment than the usual caring duties. Gill and Pete share their home with her and also with Adrian, who moved in with them 14 years ago. Both Adrian and Angela have learning disabilities. Angela and Adrian now live with Gill and her husband as an extended family ""At first I was a bit scared,"" says Angela. ""But I thought I'll meet her and get to know her. I think it's a great idea. It's nice for families to take people like us in."" Angela and Adrian are among almost 400 people, most of them with learning disabilities, who live with their Shared Lives carers across Lancashire. ""It's the best thing I've ever done,"" says Gill. ""We get more out of it than Adrian and Angela probably."" Carers are paid about Â£400 a week for each person they look after, which is a saving for the local authority compared to the alternative. For people with learning disabilities who are unable to look after themselves, the alternative would be supported living or a residential care home. Shared Lives Plus, which oversees the Shared Lives schemes around the country, estimates it saves about Â£25,000 per person per year. The NHS is currently establishing five Shared Lives schemes to cater for people leaving hospital. It estimates savings of Â£130m over the next five years by speeding up hospital discharges using the service.

Trimble on what inspires his love of the game,"They are some of the best-known lines from one of the nation's favourite poems, the mantra of numerous self-help manuals and an inspiration for a range of politicians from President Franklin D Roosevelt to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. ""If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster, and treat those two imposters just the same."" But while the words of Rudyard Kipling's poem are familiar, the application of them is altogether more challenging. How does one live without being lifted by success or dumped by failure? How can anyone maintain such detachment from the vicissitudes of life? After playing in 69 international rugby matches, Ireland's wing three-quarter Andrew Trimble knows the highs and lows of professional sport. Last year, the team achieved its best ever series of results, with victories over southern hemisphere giants Australia and South Africa and then, for the first time in 111 years, Ireland beat the reigning world champions, the New Zealand All Blacks. ""There's no bigger moment than beating the All Blacks,"" Trimble explains. ""After the game, we were walking around just shaking our heads and saying, 'What have we done? We've just beaten the All Blacks!' No Irish team has ever done this before."" Andrew Trimble says his spirituality enhances his love of rugby So was his life suddenly and completely fulfilled by winning these important matches? ""I love the game,"" he says. ""It's a driving force and a massive part of what I want to do. But it's important to be reminded that there's something else out there, there's something more important than rugby."" We're seated in the wooden pews of Ballyalbany Presbyterian Church in County Monaghan, about two miles from where the international team has just completed an open training session in preparation for Saturday's Six Nations match against France. Standing on the touchline throughout the session, it's hard to imagine how rugby union professionals can do anything other than submit themselves to the demands of the game. It's relentlessly fast, consistently ferocious. It is all-consuming. Off the field, Trimble is impeccably courteous to every autograph-hunter and maintains that having ""something more important than rugby"" actually enables him to cope better with the pressures of professional sport. Just 16 months ago, after two operations on the same foot injury were followed by a stress fracture, he began to believe that his career might be over. Trimble was dropped from Ireland's squad for World Cup 2015 and, aged 29, was faced with losing something that had dominated his life since the age of seven. ""If it's over, you have to draw on something else so rugby doesn't become the be-all-and-end-all. It doesn't define me, I'm defined by something more important. It's a different mindset and perspective."" So what is that perspective? ""There's an eternal perspective,"" he explains. ""Rugby lasts for 10, 15 years but the perspective of having a faith, and a sincere faith, is something that doesn't end and something that lasts forever."" Trimble believes that spirituality enhances his love for the sport. ""I'm far happier having that perspective and knowing that there is a bigger picture than putting all my trust in rugby, in a career that can be over in 10 years or a lot less than 10 years."" He says that his Christian faith has also enabled him to fight against the temptation to become entirely self-absorbed. Last year, he visited a camp in Tanzania. It's run by Oxfam and houses hundreds of refugees from Burundi. He was profoundly moved by the experience. ""Some of these people will live their entire lives in refugee camps. They had families, they had careers, they had hopes and dreams and they've been cut short."" Trimble laments his own ignorance of the issue and says if he hadn't been taken to Tanzania by Oxfam, he would never have known about the refugee crisis in Africa. And his motivation to do something is shaped by his theology. Andrew Trimble during his visit to Tanzania ""Pope Francis says they're all created in the image of God. They're just like you and me, they're no less special. It's a real shame that they're forgotten about because they're considered less important."" With that, our time together runs out and Trimble returns to the Ireland training camp - with the French in his sights. He certainly embodies Kipling's view that triumph and disaster should be treated ""just the same"". But in some ways, his approach is closer to that of 17th Century poet Richard Lovelace. In his poem, To Lucasta, Going to the Wars, Lovelace argues that his affections are only heightened by being answerable to a higher authority. ""I could not love thee, Dear, so much, Loved I not honour more."" According to Andrew Trimble, an eternal perspective does the same for him - win, lose or draw.

With that, our time together runs out and Trimble returns to the Ireland training camp - with the French in his sights. He certainly embodies Kipling's view that triumph and disaster should be treated ""just the same"". But in some ways, his approach is closer to that of 17th Century poet Richard Lovelace. In his poem, To Lucasta, Going to the Wars, Lovelace argues that his affections are only heightened by being answerable to a higher authority. ""I could not love thee, Dear, so much, Loved I not honour more."" According to Andrew Trimble, an eternal perspective does the same for him - win, lose or draw.

Is the reporter an endangered species?,"Last of the line? I have a theory that every US election since the turn of the millennium is driven by a new form of digital media. Moreover, the evolution of this media indicates a growing threat to the traditional role of reporters and editors. I should say at the outset that this theory, which grew out of conversations I had in Chicago when Barack Obama was elected in 2008, is certainly not mine alone. I've discussed it with many students and hacks, and the likes of Jim Rutenberg, author of the excellent Mediator column for the New York Times, haveadvanced similar positions,external- albeit with crucial differences. In 2000, the internet itself was still relatively fresh to many of us, and perhaps the defining tool of that period, search engines aside, was email. Email radically sped up the process by which politicians could directly reach millions of people, spreading campaign messages at virtually no cost, and keeping both allies and enemies abreast of their latest thinking. The advent of email reduced the need to communicate to a mass market through the prism of journalistic scrutiny. In 2004, weblogs, or blogs, initiated the fall of the opinion class. Of course, 13 years later, some columnists still get paid vast amounts to give us the benefit of their views. But with blogs, a thousand opinionated flowers could bloom. This gave more hard-line writers, who were further from the mainstream and therefore couldn't always be guaranteed a slot in conventional media, the chance to build their own fan bases. It also gave blogging politicians the chance to do the same. In 2008, when I was in the Grant Park press pen as Mr Obama gave his victory speech, there was a unanimous feeling that his had been the most brilliant digital campaign in history. Barack Obama's 2008 campaign was hailed for innovative use of social media Led by David Plouffe and Jim Messina, Mr Obama's team harnessed the network effects of Facebook to reach tens of millions of supporters. They drove donations using the power of peer to peer recommendation on social media. In 2012, another social media phenomenon drove the news agenda: Twitter. Adored by journalists, not least because it is essentially a personalised news feed, Twitter radically sped up the news cycle, making it not so much ""rolling"" as relentless. With instant rebuttals now open to politicians, and yet more opportunity to build a following and communicate directly to voters, Twitter became a key feature of President Obama's re-election. Many people, Rutenberg included, wondered aloud whether or not Snapchat would be the new media of last year's election. The stunning growth of this social media company, currently embarked on its initial public offering, suggested a new portal for engaging with hundreds of millions of young people. Snapchat's user base skews strongly toward the young. However, the digital media that defined last year's election wasn't Snapchat, perhaps because young people don't vote in anything like the numbers that old people do, and partly because - save for a few social media superstars such as Michelle Obama - the political class hasn't really cottoned on to Snapchat yet. In fact, the digital media that has suddenly come to the fore in US politics isfake news: the capacity of lies to go viral, spread maliciously by those with either a political or (much more common) financial motive. Facebook has woken up to the threat from fake news, as I have noted on thisblog. Donald Trump has spoken out against fake news I reported last week on how Germany is leading the fight back against fake news, but there is no question that the phenomenon really came to prominence during Donald Trump's campaign against Hillary Clinton. Spread out as they are over a decade and a half, these digital media aren't of course the result of US politics; but in each case they have had an impact on the result of US elections. And if you put them next to each other - email; blogs; Facebook; Twitter; fake news - you begin to detect some patterns. These patterns don't bode well for the news industry. You could argue that these media demand progressively shorter attention spans, but I think that's too crude. A more relevant pattern is the ever expanding number of people that can be reached, and the new ways to reach them. Facebook has nearly two billion users; Twitter over 300 million. The world is becoming a giant, super-connected network. Politicians have more and more ways of touching the lives of voters. The third (and to my mind most alarming) trend is that as digital media evolve, the role of journalists seems to diminish. To the political campaigner, these digital media offer the chance to reach literally billions of people and encourage them to influence their peers and family - all without having to go through a pesky hack. Moreover, with fake news, the traditional role of the journalist, to verify truth and separate it from falsehood, is completely traduced in favour of sensationalism and viral energy. George Orwell said the journalist's first task was to get a hearing Of course digital media offer journalists amazing opportunities. ""My initial concern"", wrote George Orwell in Why I Write, ""is to get a hearing."" These days journalists can get a hearing as never before. That's one reason why we are living in a new golden age of journalism. Nevertheless, the reality we are confronting is that politicians are using digital tools to circumvent journalists, and reaching vast audiences without necessarily making the same demands on their attention and time that journalists of yore did. Perhaps 2020 will be the Snapchat election - a form of social media even more transitory than Twitter (it's full of videos, or ""snaps"", that quickly disappear). In the era of fake news that is going to be our bridge to that election, redundancy will be a fact of life for some journalists: not just those who lose their job, but many of those who used to make a living out of being the intermediary between politics and the public. In my view that just shows we need proper journalism more than ever. But then I'm biased.
