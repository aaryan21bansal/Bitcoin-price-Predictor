All UK adults to be offered vaccine by 31 July - PM,"All adults in the UK will be offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July, the prime minister has pledged. More than 17 million people have been given a jab since the UK's Covid vaccine rollout began in December 2020. But Boris Johnson said he now wants the programme to ""go further and faster"". He said the July target would allow vulnerable people to be protected ""sooner"" and would help to further ease lockdown rules across the country. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said there were ""early signs"" the vaccine rollout was contributing to a fall in hospital admissions. The PM is due to hold a final meeting with senior ministers about how to ease England's lockdown later, before he sets out the full ""road map"" on Monday. When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? How many people have been vaccinated so far? What are the UK's lockdown rules and when will they end? A speedy rollout of the vaccine to all vulnerable people is seen as critical to reducing the pandemic's death toll and relieving pressure on the NHS. The government's previous target was to offer all adults the first dose by September. The new plan means that by 15 April, all adults aged 50 and over, as well as younger people with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk, should have been offered a jab. However, the order of priority for under-50s has yet to be outlined bythe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI),external. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, said he expected that a public announcement would be made on vaccine priorities at some point in the next week. He told BBC Breakfast: ""The strategy from JCVI that's being provided as advice to the government is just being finalised at the moment, and then government will make their decision as to how to do this during the coming days, so I think there'll be some kind of public announcement around that in the next week or so."" The speedier rollout of the vaccine is likely to raise expectations - and pressure - for a swifter unlocking in England, but the government is still talking the language of caution. Senior ministers will finalise the plan today before it's presented to the wider Cabinet for approval tomorrow. It's unlikely that any restrictions will change before 8 March, when the government hopes to get all children back into schools. The prime minister has long said that is his top priority. But it is likely that a small tweak will be made from that date to allow people to meet one other person outdoors for social purposes rather than just for exercise. A Downing Street source said this would be the beginning of allowing people to meet each other for socialising once again as the government recognised the impact of not seeing loved ones. It's understood various options - which could include reintroducing the rule of six - are being considered for the weeks beyond. Labour, meanwhile, welcomed the vaccine targets being moved forward, but called on the government to prioritise people based on their job. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""It's perfectly reasonable for teachers, police officers and other key workers who haven't been able to stay at home in the lockdown to ask when their turn will be. ""If government aren't going to prioritise by occupation in the next phase, they need to set out why."" Mr Ashworth also said the vaccination programme needed to be supported by stronger measures to break the chain of infection, such as ""decent financial support"" for people who have to self-isolate, updated guidance on face coverings and better ventilation standards in workplaces. Labour stands by teacher vaccinations policy Send vaccines to poorer nations now, WTO tells UK Some 17.2 million people in the UK have received their first dose of a vaccine at one of the 1,500 vaccination sites across the country, and almost 600,000 have received their second dose. NHS England said that more than two-thirds of those aged between 65 and 69 have had their first dose of a vaccine - just one week after invitations went out. Next, about 460,000 people aged 64 will be invited to get their jab. NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said: ""Over 14.5 million of the most vulnerable people in England have already safely had their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and with people aged between 65 and 69 now eligible too, we want everyone else in this age group to consider making this week your week to get a jab."" The government previously met its pledge of offering a vaccine to everyone in the top four priority groups - including those aged 70 and over, care home residents, healthcare workers and people required to shield - by 15 February. Mr Johnson said: ""Hitting 15 million vaccinationswas a significant milestone - but there will be no let up, and I want to see the rollout go further and faster in the coming weeks. ""We will now aim to offer a jab to every adult by the end of July, helping us protect the most vulnerable sooner, and take further steps to ease some of the restrictions in place."" He added, however, that the ""route out of lockdown"" would be ""cautious and phased"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Reuniting families and allowing people to have more social contact will be an ""absolute priority"" in easing measures once schools have reopened,No 10 said on Saturday. One of the first steps towards this is that care home residents in Englandwill each be allowed one regular visitorfrom 8 March. Those nominated visitors will be able to meet indoors and hold hands with their loved one, but must wear personal protective equipment and be tested beforehand. In Scotland, care home residents will be allowed up totwo designated visitors once a week, under guidelines due to be published on Wednesday. The Scottish government hopes to publish a route out of lockdown next week, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged people not to book Easter holidays. Wales has already announced some relaxation of its lockdown rules, but Northern Ireland has extended its stay-at-home order until April.

Can you catch Covid outside?,"This video can not be played Lockdown easing: The BBCâs science editor David Shukman explains the risks and what to watch for in different locations. More of us are now able to meet up outside with friends and family. ""The evidence is very clear that outdoor spaces are safer than indoors,"" Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical officer, has said. Researchers say infections can happen outdoors, but thechances are massively reduced.,external Fresh air disperses and dilutes the virus. It also helps to evaporate the liquid droplets in which it is carried. On top of that, ultraviolet light from the Sunshould kill any virus that's out in the open.,external Lockdown rules are changing again - what's happening? Even so, there are a handful of cases where it's believed that infections did happen outside. One study found that two men in China talking face-to-face for at least 15 minuteswas enough to spread the virus.,external If someone's infected - maybe without realising it because they have no symptoms - they'll be releasing the virus as they breathe, especially if they cough. Some of that will be carried in droplets, most of which will quickly fall to the ground but could reach your eyes, nose or mouth if you're within 2m (6ft) of them. So the advice is to avoid being face-to-face if you're that close. The infected person will also release smaller particles called aerosols. Indoors, these can accumulate in the air and be a hazard. Outside they should rapidly disperse. Walking past someone in the street or having a jogger run by you, means you're close together for a few seconds at most. Fleeting encounters are highly unlikely to be long enough for enough virus to reach you. Prof Cath Noakes, an airborne infection expert from the University of Leeds, says someone would have to cough right at you, at the moment you're inhaling, for an infection to happen. But she also warns of friends spending a long time together outdoors and assuming they're completely safe. Going for a run with someone and following close behind them for 20 minutes or more, breathing in their slipstream, might be a problem, she says. ""The sad fact is that your greatest risk is from the people you know."" What are the rules for meeting up with friends? What are the rules for pubs and restaurants? Scientists have found that the risks arelow in fully open spaces.,external But they worry about areas that are not just crowded but also partly enclosed, such as market stalls or bus shelters. Whenever the air is still, it can become stagnant and contaminated. It's in environments like narrow pathways or busy queues that government advisers say face coverings may be needed. If an infected person coughs into their hand and then wipes it on a surface, the virus may survive there for hours. Researchers in the US found virus on the handles of rubbish bins and the buttons at pedestrian crossings. They reckon this may have led to infections in the area, though at a relatively low level compared with other ways of spreading the virus. In colder weather, the virus may last longer in the open - it thrives in low temperatures. Added to that, your nose runs in the cold, and a common reaction is to wipe it with your hand. That might raise the chances of surfaces becoming contaminated. However, many scientists now think that the amount of virus likely to be left on a surface in this way would be minimal, and would disperse within an hour or two. ""The chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small,"" saysProf Emmanuel Goldman of Rutgers University.,external All the evidence points to the vast majority of Covid infections happening indoors. The virus is transmitted through human interaction, especially when people are together for a long period of time. That means the virus can spread in several different ways. Either infected droplets can land on people close by, or contaminate surfaces that others touch. And if rooms are stuffy, tiny virus particles can accumulate in the air and get inhaled. It's in householdswhere all of this is most likely to happen.,external Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean? What are the social distancing rules?

Leon boss warns longer lockdown 'will cost lives',"Extending lockdowns even by a matter of weeks will ""cost lives"", the co-founder of fast-food chain Leon has said. John Vincent said businesses were ""at the heart of a functioning and healthy society"" and were losing money that should be going to their employees and the government through taxes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has saidpeople should be ""optimistic but patient""about national lockdowns. He will set out a road map for lifting England's restrictions on Monday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Vincent said it was ""quite possible"" that Leon could fold ""if weeks and months drag on"", as it was losing around Â£200,000 a week. That figure was more like Â£800,000 when ""what we would have been making"" is taken into account, he said. ""That's money that isn't going into the economy, it's not going into the wallets of the people who work for Leon, and it's not going to pay the taxes that we need to pay,"" he said. ""No one's asked us for these numbers, so how does the government know what's going on in the economy?"" He said there had been a ""pantomime of scientists against business"" during the pandemic - ""as if there isn't one giant shared agenda"" - and the latter were ""positioned as the uncompassionate ones"". John Vincent has been chief executive of the business since 2014 But the length of lockdowns ""matters hugely"", he said, adding that the government had not produced a ""holistic cost-benefit analysis"". ""Therefore, how can we be making this decision about the impacts on the young today and for their futures? How can we make (decisions about) the impacts of the huge economic destruction which is costing lives? When we lose our economy we lose lives,"" he said. ""How can we be saying, glibly, 'it doesn't matter if lockdown carries on for a few weeks or months longer than necessary' without the analysis? I wouldn't launch a chicken wrap without analysis."" A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the prime minister would lay out a plan for ""gradually reopening our economy and society in a sustainable way"" on Monday. ""We understand that this is an extremely tough time for UK restaurants, but we are supporting business with one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth over Â£280 billion,"" he said. ""As we navigate our way out of lockdown, we will continue to work closely with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic."" Mr Johnson said during a coronavirus briefing this week thatsteps taken to ease lockdown should be ""cautious but irreversible"". He hailed the success of the vaccine rollout, but warned the threat from the virus remained ""very real"" and now was not the time to ""relax"". More than 16 million people have been given a first dose of the vaccine, according to government figures released on Friday. A further 533 people died within 28 days of a positive test, and another 12,027 cases of the virus were confirmed. Mr Johnson's comments came after63 Tory MPs called for easing to begin in Marchand for analysis to be released justifying any measures staying in place. Earlier, it was announced thatcare home residents in England would be allowed to pick one personto visit them regularly from 8 March -  the first confirmed easing of lockdown since its reintroduction last month. Suppliers of pubs, restaurants and cafÃ©s have asked for at least two weeks' notice of any re-opening to ensure their supply chains are ready. Wholesalers say they will need time to stock up on fresh produce. Kate Bruns, who runs a pub in Hartlepool, told the BBC the past year had been extremely difficult. ""I'd like to get open and I would like a little bit more guidance on how or what is expected from our side, really,"" she said. ""The thing about drinking outside - as much as I would love that to happen - that it is slightly harder to control. When we had it inside it was very controlled and everyone felt safe. ""Customers felt safe - safer than if they were going to a supermarket. But outside is slightly different and harder to man."" VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Scientistshave called for a data-led approach to lifting measures. Prof Dame Angela McLean, deputy chief scientific adviser, told the Commons Science and Technology Committee earlier this week that each step of easing measures should be ""irrevocable"", adding ""that means we have to be extremely careful before we add another unlocking"". ""We want to understand the impact on each step before taking the next steps,"" she said, adding that this would require a ""large gap"" after children go back to school. Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the first English lockdown, told the BBC on Friday that two key bits of data - the infection rate and the effectiveness of vaccines - were ""looking promising"", but it would take ""quite a long time"" to assess the situation fully. He said the UK could be ""a very different country"" by the end of May. ""We will still have rules in place butâ¦ I think society will be a lot more normal,"" he said.

Two killed as Myanmar police disperse protesters,"Protesters have been taking to the streets even since the coup at the start of the month At least two people have been killed in protests in Myanmar against a military coup, the worst violence yet in more than two weeks of demonstrations. Police used live ammunition to disperse demonstrators in Mandalay, reports from the ground said. At least 20 people were injured. Hundreds had gathered for the rally at a shipyard in Myanmar's second largest city. The coup saw the overthrow of Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? The shooting of a young protester Protesters are demanding that she be released, along with other members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. She is under house arrest, accused of possessing illegal walkie-talkies and violating the country's Natural Disaster Law. The military allege the NLD's landslide election win last year was fraudulent but have not provided proof. This video can not be played From blindfolded protests to dressing like Aung San Suu Kyi, why creatives are concerning Myanmar's army Clashes broke out in Mandalay when police confronted protesters and striking shipyard workers. Reports say some protesters flung projectiles at police, who responded with live fire and tear gas. Images show protesters holding up what appear to be bullet cartridges. Relatives of one of those killed told Reuters news agency he was a carpenter, aged 36, who was shot in the chest. The other fatality - reports say a boy under 18 - was shot in the head. The EU said it strongly condemned the violence and the US embassy in Myanmar said it was ""deeply troubled"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted: ""The shooting of peaceful protesters in Myanmar is beyond the pale. ""We will consider further action, with our international partners, against those crushing democracy and choking dissent."" Singapore, a big investor in Myanmar, warned of ""serious adverse consequences for Myanmar and the region"" if the situation continued to escalate. On Friday a young woman became the first confirmed death from the protests. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was shot in the head on 9 February at a rally in the capital Nay Pyi Taw. Rights groups said her injuries were consistent with the use of live ammunition. Police denied using lethal force. The military authorities say a policeman has been killed since the protests began after the 1 February coup. Further demonstrations took place on Saturday in several cities, including Yangon, where residents banged pots and a candle-light vigil was held outside the US embassy. The security forces mostly left the protesters alone. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was long considered a pariah state while under the rule of an oppressive military junta from 1962 to 2011 A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government led by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year In 2017, Myanmar's army responded to attacks on police by Rohingya militants with a deadly crackdown, driving more than half a million Rohingya Muslims across the border into Bangladesh in what the UN later called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" Aung San Suu Kyi and her government were overthrown in an army coup on 1 February Who are the rulers who executed Myanmar activists?

GP call-answering target 'unachievable' amid Covid,"GP surgeries can get a financial reward for achieving targets such as answering 90% of calls within two minutes GP surgeries face losing out on thousands of pounds because the Welsh Government will not relax an ""unachievable"" target, a doctor says. The GP, who wants to remain anonymous, told BBC Wales an aim set before the Covid pandemic to answer 90% of calls within two minutes should be relaxed. BMA Cymru has also ""petitioned strongly"" for the target's suspension. But the Welsh Government said Covid only made it ""more important"" that calls were answered in a timely manner. In a review of the policy published in January, the Welsh Government said it had ""reworded"" the target but not scrapped it. The GP said surgery staff already had ""immense workloads"" from the Covid vaccine rollout and did not have time to hit other goals. They said their surgery faced losing out on about Â£9,000 of extra cash because it will not hit the target by the 31 March deadline. Party plea as hospital Covid cases hit new levels Year-long routine surgery waits 'worst since 2008' Hospital waiting list eight times pre-Covid levels ""Understandably there's disgust at this approach by GPs throughout Wales,"" they said. ""It's as if we're not actually in a pandemic. At the same time secondary care are rightly not penalised for not providing a normal service. ""It's a push normally [to achieve it] but we work hard to achieve it. Not because it's [Wales' Health Minister] Vaughan Gething's wish but because it's what we want to do. ""Last summer we only just managed it and that was when the background patient-contact numbers were probably 60% of current ones. ""And we're now delivering a major part of the immunisation scheme which involves our staff on the phone all day contacting patients. ""We're pretty much expected to pick up most routine services, large additional Covid workloads, and the vaccination work. And then get penalised financially."" The targets were brought in under the Welsh Quality Assurance and Improvement Framework's Access to In-Hours GMS Services Standards. The report identified issues that many patients had getting access to their GP across Wales and set targets for surgeries to improve. Among the goals published in March last year was that ""90% of calls are answered within two minutes of the recorded message ending"". The report had eight standards spread across two categories. Reaching all eight would give a surgery 100 points plus 25 bonus points - earning it a financial reward from the Welsh Government. But failure to achieve one would see the bonus lost and the total drop considerably. The doctor said an average-sized GP surgery would lose more than Â£8,000 by not hitting the two-minute target. Dr Phil White, chairman of BMA Cymru Welsh GPs' Committee, said it had ""petitioned strongly"" that the target should be ""suspended, referencing the increasing telephone traffic in and out of practices due to the Covid pandemic workload, the practice administration of the Covid vaccination programme and the reintroduction of shielding. ""Unfortunately, Welsh Government are wedded to the standard and despite our persuasive argument have rejected our request to suspend this indicator,"" he added. A Welsh Government spokesperson said it had responded to BMA Cymru on 21 January. The response said it did not ""believe this is appropriate, telephone access and the time taken for calls to be answered continue to be important during the current period, ensuring patients have timely access to urgent primary medical advice, this measure will therefore remain in place for achievement at 31 March 2021"". The spokesperson added: ""We provided Â£3.7m in 2019/20 to GP practices in Wales to invest in new digital telephony systems to improve services for their patients. A further Â£7.5m of funding was allocated in June 2020 for practices achieving the In Hours Access Standards. ""This investment has been crucial during the pandemic to help practices provide services over the telephone and on video platforms. ""Due to coronavirus, it is now more important than ever that patients calling their GP practice have their calls answered in a timely manner to receive urgent care and advice. Practices achieving the In Hours Access Standards by 31 March 2021 could receive a share of an additional investment of up to Â£9.2m. ""The funding available for achievement of the standards is on top of the Â£420m of funding that is already paid directly to GP practices across Wales throughout the year.""

Chef who 'lost everything' sees a positive future,"James Sommerin and his daughter Despite losing his eponymous Michelin-starred restaurant during the Covid crisis and lockdown pausing his latest venture after just 29 days, chef James Sommerin is feeling positive. ""It's been a tragic year in as far as the restaurant is concerned but it's also been an amazing year,"" he said. Wales' lockdownhas seen restaurants closed since just before Christmas. First Minister Mark Drakeford has suggested it isunlikely restaurants will openat the start of April. James Sommerin says he struggled to console himself after closing his Penarth restaurant in July But Sommerin is hoping for ""a little bit of back to normal"". What are Wales' lockdown rules? What are the rules for pubs and restaurants across the UK? Restaurants call for more help as jobs 'at risk' ""Once everybody's had their vaccine, or the majority have, I think it will be a really good year,"" he said. ""You've always got to have the glass half-full, never half-empty."" But he admitted after closing Restaurant James Sommerin in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, it had taken him some time to reach this outlook. ""When we lost the restaurant we didn't just lose a salary, we lost everything,"" he said. James Sommerin opened his new restaurant The Shed in Barry during the Covid crisis ""[Closing the restaurant was] the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. ""If somebody had spoken to me eight months ago after we lost the restaurant I would have been in a very different place. ""I was at the point where I didn't really know what to do with myself, I had to struggle to console myself with the loss and the problems that we went through, and I hate to say it - through no fault of our own."" He said the ""sheer levels of rent"" and not being eligible for support because they were above the rateable value ofÂ£51,000 threshold,externalmeant they could not continue. ""We didn't have any support, hence we lost the restaurant,"" he said. ""But I have to be positive, you know, things happen for a reason in life. You know, we just have to adapt and overcome."" He said providing meals for NHS workers through the Feed the Heath initiative had been a highlight:  ""Those guys are really doing the hard work on the front line."" James Sommerin has been selling take-out restaurant food to be heated at home Another highlight has been opening new restaurant The Shed in Barry, but these experiences have given him a new perspective. ""I think it's made everybody realise that you have to prioritise things, what's important to you,"" he added. ""Being with Lou [his wife] and the kids, and and having a little bit more family time is great... we've loved it. ""But at the end of the day, I thrive on an 18-hour shift, putting my heart and soul into food and putting that on the plate... I love the industry, I absolutely adore it."" James Sommerin took part in an initiative to cook restaurant meals for NHS staff working through the Covid crisis He thinks business could be better than ever once restaurants reopen: ""Everybody's desperate to get out - we need that sort of normality in our lives... we're all dying to get out to have a little bit of pampering."" But he cautioned against moving too soon: ""I am very mindful of us opening too quickly. ""I don't want us to be put back in this predicament again in two or three months down the line... seeing everybody go back into lockdown. ""Having lost one restaurant, I certainly don't want to lose any more. Better to be safe than sorry and have a slower, gradual route to bringing everybody out of lockdown."" He said being given adequate notice, being able to serve indoors and not having restrictions on selling alcohol could give the hospitality sector the best chance of bouncing back. Natalie Isaac says the shared adversity of the pandemic has brought together a new camaraderie between restauranteurs It has been a tough year for Natalie Isaac, director of Bar 44. On Friday the group announced it was ""devastated"" to be closing its Cowbridge restaurant after 20 years in the town. With remaining restaurants in Cardiff, Penarth and Clifton in Bristol, she is eager to reopen to customers but does not want to see the same restrictions the industry faced in December. ""If we are allowed to open it has to be in a viable way,"" she said. ""There are lots of rumours going around at the moment, like outdoors only or the no-alcohol rule coming back again - that's not viable, we can't open and even cover our costs if that is to happen."" She said any information on what to expect would be useful: ""We [the hospitality industry] are in dire straits - a lot of people are on their last pennies, or are using the end of their bounce-back loans and we need to be able to plan. ""Even if we knew what order things were going to be happening in - so if it was retail first, then self-catering, then restaurants and food, then wet-led businesses - give us an order."" Barr 44 opened opposite Cardiff's Principality Stadium in 2015 Despite the challenges of the past year, Ms Isaac is also excited for the future: ""We've had so many letters and cards and emails from customers to say how much they've enjoyed [our takeaways] and they can't wait to come back so, in that sense, it's just been brilliant."" She said shared adversity had brought together a new community of restauranteurs: ""People are helping each other... questions of 'how would you deal with this?' or 'how would you negotiate with staff? What's your take on this?' ""You'd like to think that, when all this is over, we'll all also frequent each other's businesses, give it back to each other."" Stephen Terry at The Hardwick Stephen Terry, chef and owner of The Hardwick in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, is also reflecting on the upside. ""There's a lot of lessons to be learned from this. There have been some really great things that have happened in the past year,"" he said. ""Like theWelsh Independent Restaurant Collective... lots of people in Wales have really raised the bar and stepped up doing incredible things."" James Sommerin and Stephen Terry appeared on The Great British Menu together in 2009 He said he would not like to see restaurants allowed to open outdoors only and restrictions on selling alcohol, adding: ""I know it's going to be a long road ahead - I totally accept that and I'm absolutely up for that, we will do exactly as we are asked. ""The most important thing is the socialising - socialising between friends and family. That is really the key issue here and I miss it."" Stephen Terry is the chef-owner of The Hardwick in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire He said his restaurant was ready to spring into action: ""A week's notice would be nice, any more than that would be a luxury. ""At the end of the day all we've done is shut the doors and cleared the shelves and got rid of all the stock and turned everything off - we've just got to turn it on, make some phone calls to get the orders in, call the staff - they're all chomping at the bit to get back.""

Wall Street Charging Bull sculptor 'dies aged 80',"Arturo Di Modica originally installed the bull in New York in 1989 The sculptor behind Wall Street's famous Charging Bull statue has died aged 80, reports say. Friends of Arturo Di Modica told Italian media that the sculptor died in his home town of Vittoria, Sicily. He had been fighting cancer for many years, La Repubblica reported. The bull was originally installed in New York in 1989 without permission. It was designed to represent the ""strength and power of the American people"" after the 1987 market crash. Police seized the 7,100 pound (3,200 kg) bronze statue from its position outside the New York Stock Exchange. But following a public outcry, city officials allowed it to be reinstalled days later in the heart of Manhattan's financial district. It has gone on to become one of the most recognisable images of New York, and a major tourist attraction. In recent years, Di Modica opposed the temporary installation of another now famous statue, called Fearless Girl, opposite the bull. Di Modica complained at the time that his bull was meant to embody ""strength, power and love"", and that having Fearless Girl - designed to call attention to gender inequality and the pay gap in the corporate world - face off against it turned its message into something negative. This video can not be played The statue, by artist Kristen Visbal, is called Fearless Girl Other notable works by Di Modica include marble pieces exhibited at the Rockefeller Center, works in bronze at Castle Clinton National Monument, and a bronze horse exhibited in the Lincoln Center, his biography on chargingbull.com says.

Have a good evening. We're going to be finishing our rolling updates soon, but before we go here's the latest coronavirus news from the UK:  And from around the world:  Les and Audrey have been married for 66 years Relatives with loved ones in care homes have been reacting to news that they will be able to makevisits from early March. In England, one designated visitor will be allowed, while in Scotlandtwo will be permitted. Les Wood's wife Audrey, who has vascular dementia, has been in a care home for 14 months. ""We havenât so much as touched fingertips in a year,"" he tells the BBC. He says the care home where his wife lives has been ""very strict right from the start, putting the safety of the residents first"". ""Their rules have normally been more restrictive than the government guidelines for which I have been grateful,"" says Wood, who lives in Deal in Kent. But he's hoping he will be able to visit her next month under the new rules. ""I hope that Audreyâs care home will be able to follow the new guidelines from next month,"" he says. ""If they donât, I will be very disappointed but also supportive. ""Itâs horrendous for me. I feel totally cut off. I barely exist.â Fifty people have been fined for attendingan illegal party in a soundproof room, police say. Class A drugs, birthday cake, beer, a DJ and disco lights were found by officers in a venue in Birmingham on Thursday. West Midlands Police say a member of the public had noticed taxis bringing guests. The suspected organiser was arrested after refusing to give their details to officers and could face a fine of Â£10,000 under coronavirus legislation, police say. This video can not be played Essex lockdown one-man choir of nine singers A musician has used technology to get creative in lockdown and become a one-man, nine-strong choir. Bobby Goulder, 26, from Essex, was commissioned to record The Lord Bless You And Keep You for somebody's memorial and used a self-cloning technique for the video. With social distancing making it difficult for groups to get together, rather than bring a choir together remotely, the baritone decided to sing the piece himself - nine times. Standing in slightly different locations at St Mary's Church in Saffron Walden, he performed a different part in his own arrangement adapted from a composition by John Rutter, before editing the versions together. Posting the final work on social media, Gouldler, a former chorister at the church, said: ""It's still strange seeing nine of myself. I've had lots of lovely messages and a really positive response."" Dr Fauci received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of last year The US top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has explained in an interview why he thinks Israel has been so successful in its vaccination drive. Its unique national circumstances set it up for success, he says. ""I can say without false flattery
that Israel really did it right, but it also had the right sort of ingredients
in its favour: the right size, the right healthcare system - everything was
geared to be successful for what they did, and they did it really very well,""he told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,external. ""To have over 80 in 100 people to receive a shot - the United
States is somewhere around 18, just look at the difference there. Israelâs
health system is quite uniform as a nation - perhaps due to size, location and
history,"" he said. Israel has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million- and about one million people have received two doses. ""The United States - a country that I love - has a different
system,â he added. ""Itâs good in some respects, but when youâre dealing with a
common enemy, you can have multiple ways of doing things and thatâs one of the
reasons we have not been as successful as we could have been thus far."" A mum and daughter have created a free online video series to help children with disabilities ""find a space of calm"" during the lockdowns. Founder of the disability dance charity Flamingo Chicks Katie Sparkes, 40, designed the relaxation videos with her 14-year-old daughter Poppy who has cerebral palsy. Sparkes, from Bristol, said the videos are needed as families don't have access to the special services that they need due to the pandemic. ""At moments of crisis it's a great tool to find those moments of calm,"" she says. The online videos use Makaton so that everyone can join in. Makaton uses signs and symbols to help people who find speaking difficult. This video can not be played Makaton relaxation videos 'a great tool to use' Boris Johnson is expected to announce a ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions in England on Monday. But what's happening in the rest of the UK? The PM saysthe priority is to get pupils back to schoolfrom 8 March. After schools reopen, No 10 says reuniting families and allowing people to have more social contact will be an ""absolute priority"". There is also pressure to reopen pubs, restaurants, shops and the tourism industry, but the government says it will be""led by data, not dates"". The devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds to ease lockdown: Need more information?Here's a full guide to lockdown rules where you live. Fights, Covid-19 outbreaks and alleged abuse have been reported at four west London hotels housing asylum seekers. Asylum seekers were moved to hotels - in Chiswick, Twickenham and Fulham -in response to the coronavirus pandemic. One woman, who spoke to the BBC under the condition of anonymity, said a resident at her hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. She said: ""She caught the virus and she been in hospital for three months and might not survive. ""We haven't been tested regularly in the hotel. The children play with each other. Maybe it can spread. ""We feel it is dangerous. When I hear my family cough, I just pray it's not coronavirus."" Police have not been able to find all the incidents described on their records and the Home Office has refused comment, saying it is not responsible. It directed the BBC to Clearspring, a company that is used by the government to house asylum seekers. Anti-vaccination protesters have gathered across Australia If you're just joining us, here are some of the latest coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world: We also have an update on the UK's vaccination programme.

The Mona Lisa usually has crowds around it You may be wondering what's been happening inside museums all over the world during the pandemic while lockdowns have been in place. At the Louvre Museum in Paris, which has been closed to visitors for nearly four months, officials have taken the opportunity to carry out long-overdue refurbishments which would not normally have been possible. Some 10 million people come to what is thought to be the world's most visited museum each year, the majority from abroad. But the crowds are now gone and it instead looks like this... An empty Grande Galerie in the Louvre During this quiet time, curators, restorers and workers have been busy cleaning up sculptures, reordering artefacts, checking inventories, reorganising access and carrying out restorations. ""Weâre taking advantage of the museumâs closure to carry out a number of major works, speed up maintenance operations and start repair works that are difficult to schedule when the museum is operating normally,"" Laurent Le GuÃ©dart, the museum's architectural heritage and gardens director, toldthe Associated Press news agency,external. Around four million people in the UK suffer from diabetes - including around a million who have not been diagnosed, according to the charity Diabetes UK. And while it's already known that diabetics are more at risk of suffering severe cases of Covid - new evidence suggests the virus could actually be triggering the condition in some patients. Jordan Charles went months with undiagnosed diabetes after contracting Covid-19. Here's his story: This video can not be played Paul KirbyBBC News While the streets and tourist sites of Rome and Barcelona came to a standstill under lockdown, a curfew triggered riots in Dutch cities From the first case diagnosed a year ago at a hospital in northern Italy to the empty shops, restaurants and stadiums of Europe's cities, coronavirus has changed the lives of Europeans. Curbs on movement have forced every country and society to adapt its rules and rethink its culture. Italians were initially frightened into uncharacteristic obedience, says BBC Rome correspondent Mark Lowen. They were the first to be crushed by the virus, the first to see intensive care units close to collapse, and friends and family dying. Very widespread respect for restrictions began to change with the second wave, with some protests against renewed lockdowns, given the fear and fatigue. Read about the hard truths and unexpected innovations in a year that changed Europe. Earlier we heard from the co-founder of fast food chain Leon, who warned against extending lockdown. John Vincent says the length of restrictions ""matters hugely"" and ""could cost lives"". Responding to his comments, a government spokesperson said they understood that this is an ""extremely tough time for UK restaurants"". ""We are supporting business with one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth over Â£280bn,"" the spokesperson said. ""As we navigate our way out of lockdown, we will continue to work closely with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic."" The prime minister will set out the roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions on Monday.We've got more on this story here. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The political reality is that Boris Johnson had to offer up
a date for when heâd explain the path out of lockdown in England. There are those on the
Tory backbenches who would not have accepted an open-ended timeline. But the
government would argue that naming 22 February wasnât some
arbitrary effort to buy time, rather a logical choice - one thatâs linked to the
aim of reopening schools two weeks later, while allowing both the lockdown
and vaccine programme to take effect. Regardless of considerations in play, the
long-awaited roadmap does now loom on the very near horizon. Government sources
insist that the details are, even now, still being finalised but with two days
to go a broad plan must now be in place. The government can try to stress
caution or talk about caveats but all the build-up has led to a growing sense
of anticipation. And, for many, that anticipation is linked to a hope that our
daily lives may soon be less limited. Union leaders will present a formal paper to the government as part of their campaign to get support for Eurostar services after the company admitted it is ""fighting for survival"". It comes after officials from the train drivers' union Aslef held a meeting at the Treasury on Friday to argue for jobs and services to be protected as the cross-Channel operator suffers from a fall in passengers because of the coronavirus crisis. Union leaders have beenurging the government to offer its support since last summerwhen The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union called on the transport secretary to intervene as a matter of urgency to prevent job cuts. Eurostar said at the time it was looking at ways to protect itself for the long term by reducing costs across the business, including ""a considered approach to reducing our payroll costs"". Today, Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: ""We are calling on the UK government to intervene to prevent Eurostar going to the wall. ""Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, and Grant Shapps must act now to save this service - for passengers, for the men and women who work on Eurostar, and for Britain and our connection with the continent."" He said train drivers and all the staff who keep our railways running have been instrumental in moving passengers and freight around this country during the pandemic ""So the government must not turn its back on them now,"" he added. Russia says it now has three vaccines against Covid-19 - Sputnik V (pictured), EpiVacCorona and now CoviVac Russia has registered its third Covid-19 vaccine, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has announced. The new vaccine, CoviVac, has been produced by the state-run Chumakov Centre in Moscow, and is due to be introduced in the country by March, though large-scale clinical trials are not yet under way. ""Today, Russia is the only country to have already three vaccines for preventing the coronavirus infection,"" Mishustin said. It's said to use a different method of development from Russia's other vaccines, Sputnik V and EpiVacCorona, using an inactive virus. Russia was the first country to register a vaccine against Covid-19 in Augustlast year. Despite early scepticism over Russia's testing strategy,the effectiveness of Sputnik was later confirmedby the Lancet medical journal, and it has been authorised by more than 20 countries.  Cathie Russell has window visits with her mum, Rose Hamilton In Scotland, the news families will be able to make regular indoor visits to older loved ones in care homes from early March has also been welcomed. The Scottish government has confirmedresidents will be allowed two designated visitors. Donald MacAskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said despite the many challenges presented by the pandemic, ""undoubtedly the hardest has been keeping residents apart from family and friends"". He said: ""We commit to working together to overcome any challenges and difficulties we might face and to support those who may still be anxious and fearful, so that together we can ensure that a painful period of separation can be replaced by greater togetherness."" Scottish Conservatives shadow health secretary Donald Cameron called on ministers to ensure the guidance is ""clear and practical"" so the return of visitors can ""operate as smoothly and safely as possible"". Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour's shadow health secretary, said the isolation of residents who were in some cases at the end of their lives was a ""human rights scandal"". She said: ""This is a welcome step in the right direction. Guidance, however, has fallen short before. Too many care providers and public health directors have brushed it aside. This can't happen again."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Two killed as Myanmar police disperse protestersReports from the scene say police used live ammunition at the rally in the city of Mandalay.,"Protesters have been taking to the streets even since the coup at the start of the month At least two people have been killed in protests in Myanmar against a military coup, the worst violence yet in more than two weeks of demonstrations. Police used live ammunition to disperse demonstrators in Mandalay, reports from the ground said. At least 20 people were injured. Hundreds had gathered for the rally at a shipyard in Myanmar's second largest city. The coup saw the overthrow of Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? The shooting of a young protester Protesters are demanding that she be released, along with other members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. She is under house arrest, accused of possessing illegal walkie-talkies and violating the country's Natural Disaster Law. The military allege the NLD's landslide election win last year was fraudulent but have not provided proof. This video can not be played From blindfolded protests to dressing like Aung San Suu Kyi, why creatives are concerning Myanmar's army Clashes broke out in Mandalay when police confronted protesters and striking shipyard workers. Reports say some protesters flung projectiles at police, who responded with live fire and tear gas. Images show protesters holding up what appear to be bullet cartridges. Relatives of one of those killed told Reuters news agency he was a carpenter, aged 36, who was shot in the chest. The other fatality - reports say a boy under 18 - was shot in the head. The EU said it strongly condemned the violence and the US embassy in Myanmar said it was ""deeply troubled"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted: ""The shooting of peaceful protesters in Myanmar is beyond the pale. ""We will consider further action, with our international partners, against those crushing democracy and choking dissent."" Singapore, a big investor in Myanmar, warned of ""serious adverse consequences for Myanmar and the region"" if the situation continued to escalate. On Friday a young woman became the first confirmed death from the protests. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was shot in the head on 9 February at a rally in the capital Nay Pyi Taw. Rights groups said her injuries were consistent with the use of live ammunition. Police denied using lethal force. The military authorities say a policeman has been killed since the protests began after the 1 February coup. Further demonstrations took place on Saturday in several cities, including Yangon, where residents banged pots and a candle-light vigil was held outside the US embassy. The security forces mostly left the protesters alone. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was long considered a pariah state while under the rule of an oppressive military junta from 1962 to 2011 A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government led by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year In 2017, Myanmar's army responded to attacks on police by Rohingya militants with a deadly crackdown, driving more than half a million Rohingya Muslims across the border into Bangladesh in what the UN later called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" Aung San Suu Kyi and her government were overthrown in an army coup on 1 February Who are the rulers who executed Myanmar activists?

Have a good evening. We're going to be finishing our rolling updates soon, but before we go here's the latest coronavirus news from the UK:  And from around the world:  Les and Audrey have been married for 66 years Relatives with loved ones in care homes have been reacting to news that they will be able to makevisits from early March. In England, one designated visitor will be allowed, while in Scotlandtwo will be permitted. Les Wood's wife Audrey, who has vascular dementia, has been in a care home for 14 months. ""We havenât so much as touched fingertips in a year,"" he tells the BBC. He says the care home where his wife lives has been ""very strict right from the start, putting the safety of the residents first"". ""Their rules have normally been more restrictive than the government guidelines for which I have been grateful,"" says Wood, who lives in Deal in Kent. But he's hoping he will be able to visit her next month under the new rules. ""I hope that Audreyâs care home will be able to follow the new guidelines from next month,"" he says. ""If they donât, I will be very disappointed but also supportive. ""Itâs horrendous for me. I feel totally cut off. I barely exist.â Fifty people have been fined for attendingan illegal party in a soundproof room, police say. Class A drugs, birthday cake, beer, a DJ and disco lights were found by officers in a venue in Birmingham on Thursday. West Midlands Police say a member of the public had noticed taxis bringing guests. The suspected organiser was arrested after refusing to give their details to officers and could face a fine of Â£10,000 under coronavirus legislation, police say. This video can not be played Essex lockdown one-man choir of nine singers A musician has used technology to get creative in lockdown and become a one-man, nine-strong choir. Bobby Goulder, 26, from Essex, was commissioned to record The Lord Bless You And Keep You for somebody's memorial and used a self-cloning technique for the video. With social distancing making it difficult for groups to get together, rather than bring a choir together remotely, the baritone decided to sing the piece himself - nine times. Standing in slightly different locations at St Mary's Church in Saffron Walden, he performed a different part in his own arrangement adapted from a composition by John Rutter, before editing the versions together. Posting the final work on social media, Gouldler, a former chorister at the church, said: ""It's still strange seeing nine of myself. I've had lots of lovely messages and a really positive response."" Dr Fauci received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of last year The US top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has explained in an interview why he thinks Israel has been so successful in its vaccination drive. Its unique national circumstances set it up for success, he says. ""I can say without false flattery
that Israel really did it right, but it also had the right sort of ingredients
in its favour: the right size, the right healthcare system - everything was
geared to be successful for what they did, and they did it really very well,""he told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,external. ""To have over 80 in 100 people to receive a shot - the United
States is somewhere around 18, just look at the difference there. Israelâs
health system is quite uniform as a nation - perhaps due to size, location and
history,"" he said. Israel has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million- and about one million people have received two doses. ""The United States - a country that I love - has a different
system,â he added. ""Itâs good in some respects, but when youâre dealing with a
common enemy, you can have multiple ways of doing things and thatâs one of the
reasons we have not been as successful as we could have been thus far."" A mum and daughter have created a free online video series to help children with disabilities ""find a space of calm"" during the lockdowns. Founder of the disability dance charity Flamingo Chicks Katie Sparkes, 40, designed the relaxation videos with her 14-year-old daughter Poppy who has cerebral palsy. Sparkes, from Bristol, said the videos are needed as families don't have access to the special services that they need due to the pandemic. ""At moments of crisis it's a great tool to find those moments of calm,"" she says. The online videos use Makaton so that everyone can join in.

Fights, Covid-19 outbreaks and alleged abuse have been reported at four west London hotels housing asylum seekers. Asylum seekers were moved to hotels - in Chiswick, Twickenham and Fulham -in response to the coronavirus pandemic. One woman, who spoke to the BBC under the condition of anonymity, said a resident at her hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. She said: ""She caught the virus and she been in hospital for three months and might not survive. ""We haven't been tested regularly in the hotel. The children play with each other. Maybe it can spread. ""We feel it is dangerous. When I hear my family cough, I just pray it's not coronavirus."" Police have not been able to find all the incidents described on their records and the Home Office has refused comment, saying it is not responsible. It directed the BBC to Clearspring, a company that is used by the government to house asylum seekers.

Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The political reality is that Boris Johnson had to offer up
a date for when heâd explain the path out of lockdown in England. There are those on the
Tory backbenches who would not have accepted an open-ended timeline. But the
government would argue that naming 22 February wasnât some
arbitrary effort to buy time, rather a logical choice - one thatâs linked to the
aim of reopening schools two weeks later, while allowing both the lockdown
and vaccine programme to take effect. Regardless of considerations in play, the
long-awaited roadmap does now loom on the very near horizon. Government sources
insist that the details are, even now, still being finalised but with two days
to go a broad plan must now be in place. The government can try to stress
caution or talk about caveats but all the build-up has led to a growing sense
of anticipation. And, for many, that anticipation is linked to a hope that our
daily lives may soon be less limited. Union leaders will present a formal paper to the government as part of their campaign to get support for Eurostar services after the company admitted it is ""fighting for survival"".

Union leaders have beenurging the government to offer its support since last summerwhen The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union called on the transport secretary to intervene as a matter of urgency to prevent job cuts. Eurostar said at the time it was looking at ways to protect itself for the long term by reducing costs across the business, including ""a considered approach to reducing our payroll costs"". Today, Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: ""We are calling on the UK government to intervene to prevent Eurostar going to the wall. ""Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, and Grant Shapps must act now to save this service - for passengers, for the men and women who work on Eurostar, and for Britain and our connection with the continent.""

Russia says it now has three vaccines against Covid-19 - Sputnik V (pictured), EpiVacCorona and now CoviVac Russia has registered its third Covid-19 vaccine, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has announced. The new vaccine, CoviVac, has been produced by the state-run Chumakov Centre in Moscow, and is due to be introduced in the country by March, though large-scale clinical trials are not yet under way.

Osaka beats Brady to win Australian Open,"This video can not be played Australian Open: Best shots as Osaka beats Brady in final Japan's Naomi Osaka cemented her place as the outstanding star of the women's game by beating American Jennifer Brady in the Australian Open final to win her fourth Grand Slam title. Osaka, 23, is unbeaten in major finals after a 6-4 6-3 win in Melbourne. Osaka edged the first set when Brady, in her first Grand Slam final, paid for some glaring errors in the final game. The third seed seized control from that point, racing 4-0 ahead in the second set before sealing a deserved victory. Osaka has now won two Australian Open titles after also triumphing at Melbourne Park in 2019, with her other Grand Slam successes coming at the US Open in 2018 and 2020. She has not suffered a defeat since February 2020 after extending her winning run to 21 matches. Osaka's face lit up with a wide grin, raising her racquet above her head, when she clinched the title on her first match point after Brady looped a return long. Around 7,500 fans were allowed to watch the final on Rod Laver Arena and Osaka lapped up the acclaim after her US Open victory came behind closed doors. ""It feels incredible to have fans, I played the last Grand Slam without fans, to have this energy means a lot,"" said Osaka as she clutched the Daphne Akhurst Trophy. 'Osaka now sets the standards on women's tour' Relive how Osaka won the 2021 Australian Open final 'Chess player' Medvedev aiming to end Djokovic dominance Osaka is the first women's player to win her first four Grand Slam finals since Monica Seles in 1991. And asked if she could reach double figures in slam titles, Osaka replied: ""I'm taking it in sections. Right now, I'm trying to go for five. After five I would think about maybe dividing the 10, so maybe seven or eight. ""I like to take things not big picture. I know that the people that I'm playing against are the best players in the world and, if my time comes to win another Grand Slam, it will come."" Naomi Osaka will rise to second in the world rankings after winning the Australian Open Softly-spoken Osaka has emerged as the sport's biggest star in recent times and illustrated that yet again with another Grand Slam victory. On the court, her clean hitting and clear thinking has proved too much for her opponents to handle. Off the court, she has grown into one of the world's most marketable athletes and found her voice to become a prominent social activist. ""I feel like the biggest thing that I want to achieve is playing long enough to play a girl that said that I was once her favourite player,"" said Osaka. ""I think that's the coolest thing that could ever happen to me. I just think that that's how the sport moves forward."" In her runners-up speech, Brady said Osaka was ""an inspiration to us all"". ""What she is doing for the game is amazing. I hope young girls are watching and inspired by what she is doing,"" Brady said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Osaka struggled to land first serves and made 24 unforced errors, but won four of her five break points and saved two of Brady's four chances Osaka was the clear favourite in the final at Melbourne Park, although a relatively serene path to the final also featured moments where she showed her fight and spirit. In the fourth round against 2020 runner-up Garbine Muguruza, Osaka had to see off two match points before going on to win, as well as coming through some tricky moments against 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams in the semi-finals. While her level against Brady was not always at its highest, she still had enough quality in the key moments. That was most evident at 5-4 in the first set when her relentless pressure forced Brady into the errors which proved pivotal. And more brilliance enabled Osaka to make a fast start in the second set from which Brady could not recover. A sweet cross-court backhand winner brought up more break points for a 2-0 lead, taking the first opportunity when another deep return bamboozled Brady into some clumsy footwork. From that point, Osaka's confidence further grew and she quickly went a double break up. While Brady did claw one back, Osaka never looked like relinquishing another and served out the Championship to love. The next question for Osaka will be whether she can transfer this hard-court dominance onto the clay and grass surfaces. Success has not yet arrived at the French Open and Wimbledon, but her next ambition - once she has celebrated this success - will be trying to change that in the next few months and over the coming years."" ""I feel like I have to get comfortable on those surfaces,"" Osaka said. ""I didn't play juniors, so I didn't grow up playing on grass at all. ""I honestly think I'd have better luck on clay, because I think last year I didn't play bad at all. It's just something that I have to get more used to."" Allow Twitter content?

While it was not the outcome Brady wanted, the 25-year-old American has plenty of positives to build on after reaching her first Grand Slam final. It was quite remarkable the 22nd seed even made the second week in Melbourne, having been the only singles player forced into a 'hard' quarantine on arrival in Australia to do so. Stuck in her room for 14 days without leaving, the former college player had to hit balls against a mattress propped up against the wall, come up with inventive footwork drills and borrow an exercise bike and treadmill from Tennis Australia. She also admitted to stopping watching Netflix so she would not ""do anything other than lay in bed"". Solid serving is the bedrock of her game and that helped her work her way through a kind draw where she did not face anyone inside the top 20 until Osaka. Brady lost to Osaka when they met in a high-quality US Open semi-final last September and suffered the same fate as she struggled to impose her service game. The match swung away from Brady in that decisive 10th game of the opening set. After having regained her fluency following a scrappy start, a double fault at 40-30 gave Osaka hope and Brady then got caught out by a return hitting the baseline to give Osaka a set point out of nowhere. Brady planted an easy forehand into the net and, ultimately, that sloppy game cost her the match. Groans from the crowd as Brady grimaced and shook her head reinforced the point. ""It wasn't meant to be, but hopefully there's many more,"" said Brady, who will rise to 15th in the world after being outside the top 50 a year ago. Allow Twitter content?

Have a good evening. We're going to be finishing our rolling updates soon, but before we go here's the latest coronavirus news from the UK:  And from around the world:  Les and Audrey have been married for 66 years Relatives with loved ones in care homes have been reacting to news that they will be able to makevisits from early March. In England, one designated visitor will be allowed, while in Scotlandtwo will be permitted. Les Wood's wife Audrey, who has vascular dementia, has been in a care home for 14 months. ""We havenât so much as touched fingertips in a year,"" he tells the BBC. He says the care home where his wife lives has been ""very strict right from the start, putting the safety of the residents first"". ""Their rules have normally been more restrictive than the government guidelines for which I have been grateful,"" says Wood, who lives in Deal in Kent. But he's hoping he will be able to visit her next month under the new rules. ""I hope that Audreyâs care home will be able to follow the new guidelines from next month,"" he says. ""If they donât, I will be very disappointed but also supportive. ""Itâs horrendous for me. I feel totally cut off. I barely exist.â Fifty people have been fined for attendingan illegal party in a soundproof room, police say. Class A drugs, birthday cake, beer, a DJ and disco lights were found by officers in a venue in Birmingham on Thursday. West Midlands Police say a member of the public had noticed taxis bringing guests. The suspected organiser was arrested after refusing to give their details to officers and could face a fine of Â£10,000 under coronavirus legislation, police say. This video can not be played Essex lockdown one-man choir of nine singers A musician has used technology to get creative in lockdown and become a one-man, nine-strong choir. Bobby Goulder, 26, from Essex, was commissioned to record The Lord Bless You And Keep You for somebody's memorial and used a self-cloning technique for the video. With social distancing making it difficult for groups to get together, rather than bring a choir together remotely, the baritone decided to sing the piece himself - nine times. Standing in slightly different locations at St Mary's Church in Saffron Walden, he performed a different part in his own arrangement adapted from a composition by John Rutter, before editing the versions together. Posting the final work on social media, Gouldler, a former chorister at the church, said: ""It's still strange seeing nine of myself. I've had lots of lovely messages and a really positive response."" Dr Fauci received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of last year The US top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has explained in an interview why he thinks Israel has been so successful in its vaccination drive. Its unique national circumstances set it up for success, he says. ""I can say without false flattery
that Israel really did it right, but it also had the right sort of ingredients
in its favour: the right size, the right healthcare system - everything was
geared to be successful for what they did, and they did it really very well,""he told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,external. ""To have over 80 in 100 people to receive a shot - the United
States is somewhere around 18, just look at the difference there. Israelâs
health system is quite uniform as a nation - perhaps due to size, location and
history,"" he said. Israel has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million- and about one million people have received two doses. ""The United States - a country that I love - has a different
system,â he added. ""Itâs good in some respects, but when youâre dealing with a
common enemy, you can have multiple ways of doing things and thatâs one of the
reasons we have not been as successful as we could have been thus far."" A mum and daughter have created a free online video series to help children with disabilities ""find a space of calm"" during the lockdowns. Founder of the disability dance charity Flamingo Chicks Katie Sparkes, 40, designed the relaxation videos with her 14-year-old daughter Poppy who has cerebral palsy. Sparkes, from Bristol, said the videos are needed as families don't have access to the special services that they need due to the pandemic. ""At moments of crisis it's a great tool to find those moments of calm,"" she says. The online videos use Makaton so that everyone can join in. Makaton uses signs and symbols to help people who find speaking difficult. This video can not be played Makaton relaxation videos 'a great tool to use' Boris Johnson is expected to announce a ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions in England on Monday. But what's happening in the rest of the UK? The PM saysthe priority is to get pupils back to schoolfrom 8 March. After schools reopen, No 10 says reuniting families and allowing people to have more social contact will be an ""absolute priority"".

Fights, Covid-19 outbreaks and alleged abuse have been reported at four west London hotels housing asylum seekers. Asylum seekers were moved to hotels - in Chiswick, Twickenham and Fulham -in response to the coronavirus pandemic. One woman, who spoke to the BBC under the condition of anonymity, said a resident at her hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. She said: ""She caught the virus and she been in hospital for three months and might not survive. ""We haven't been tested regularly in the hotel. The children play with each other. Maybe it can spread. ""We feel it is dangerous. When I hear my family cough, I just pray it's not coronavirus.""

"Leon boss warns longer lockdown 'will cost lives'John Vincent says extending lockdowns, even by a number of weeks, ""matters hugely"".","Extending lockdowns even by a matter of weeks will ""cost lives"", the co-founder of fast-food chain Leon has said. John Vincent said businesses were ""at the heart of a functioning and healthy society"" and were losing money that should be going to their employees and the government through taxes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has saidpeople should be ""optimistic but patient""about national lockdowns. He will set out a road map for lifting England's restrictions on Monday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Vincent said it was ""quite possible"" that Leon could fold ""if weeks and months drag on"", as it was losing around Â£200,000 a week. That figure was more like Â£800,000 when ""what we would have been making"" is taken into account, he said.

John Vincent has been chief executive of the business since 2014 But the length of lockdowns ""matters hugely"", he said, adding that the government had not produced a ""holistic cost-benefit analysis"". ""Therefore, how can we be making this decision about the impacts on the young today and for their futures? How can we make (decisions about) the impacts of the huge economic destruction which is costing lives? When we lose our economy we lose lives,"" he said.

A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the prime minister would lay out a plan for ""gradually reopening our economy and society in a sustainable way"" on Monday. ""We understand that this is an extremely tough time for UK restaurants, but we are supporting business with one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth over Â£280 billion,"" he said. ""As we navigate our way out of lockdown, we will continue to work closely with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic."" Mr Johnson said during a coronavirus briefing this week thatsteps taken to ease lockdown should be ""cautious but irreversible"". He hailed the success of the vaccine rollout, but warned the threat from the virus remained ""very real"" and now was not the time to ""relax"". More than 16 million people have been given a first dose of the vaccine, according to government figures released on Friday. A further 533 people died within 28 days of a positive test, and another 12,027 cases of the virus were confirmed. Mr Johnson's comments came after63 Tory MPs called for easing to begin in Marchand for analysis to be released justifying any measures staying in place. Earlier, it was announced thatcare home residents in England would be allowed to pick one personto visit them regularly from 8 March -  the first confirmed easing of lockdown since its reintroduction last month. Suppliers of pubs, restaurants and cafÃ©s have asked for at least two weeks' notice of any re-opening to ensure their supply chains are ready. Wholesalers say they will need time to stock up on fresh produce. Kate Bruns, who runs a pub in Hartlepool, told the BBC the past year had been extremely difficult. ""I'd like to get open and I would like a little bit more guidance on how or what is expected from our side, really,"" she said. ""The thing about drinking outside - as much as I would love that to happen - that it is slightly harder to control. When we had it inside it was very controlled and everyone felt safe. ""Customers felt safe - safer than if they were going to a supermarket. But outside is slightly different and harder to man."" VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Scientistshave called for a data-led approach to lifting measures. Prof Dame Angela McLean, deputy chief scientific adviser, told the Commons Science and Technology Committee earlier this week that each step of easing measures should be ""irrevocable"", adding ""that means we have to be extremely careful before we add another unlocking"". ""We want to understand the impact on each step before taking the next steps,"" she said, adding that this would require a ""large gap"" after children go back to school. Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the first English lockdown, told the BBC on Friday that two key bits of data - the infection rate and the effectiveness of vaccines - were ""looking promising"", but it would take ""quite a long time"" to assess the situation fully. He said the UK could be ""a very different country"" by the end of May. ""We will still have rules in place butâ¦ I think society will be a lot more normal,"" he said.

Have a good evening. We're going to be finishing our rolling updates soon, but before we go here's the latest coronavirus news from the UK:  And from around the world:  Les and Audrey have been married for 66 years Relatives with loved ones in care homes have been reacting to news that they will be able to makevisits from early March. In England, one designated visitor will be allowed, while in Scotlandtwo will be permitted. Les Wood's wife Audrey, who has vascular dementia, has been in a care home for 14 months. ""We havenât so much as touched fingertips in a year,"" he tells the BBC. He says the care home where his wife lives has been ""very strict right from the start, putting the safety of the residents first"". ""Their rules have normally been more restrictive than the government guidelines for which I have been grateful,"" says Wood, who lives in Deal in Kent. But he's hoping he will be able to visit her next month under the new rules. ""I hope that Audreyâs care home will be able to follow the new guidelines from next month,"" he says. ""If they donât, I will be very disappointed but also supportive. ""Itâs horrendous for me. I feel totally cut off. I barely exist.â Fifty people have been fined for attendingan illegal party in a soundproof room, police say. Class A drugs, birthday cake, beer, a DJ and disco lights were found by officers in a venue in Birmingham on Thursday. West Midlands Police say a member of the public had noticed taxis bringing guests. The suspected organiser was arrested after refusing to give their details to officers and could face a fine of Â£10,000 under coronavirus legislation, police say. This video can not be played Essex lockdown one-man choir of nine singers A musician has used technology to get creative in lockdown and become a one-man, nine-strong choir. Bobby Goulder, 26, from Essex, was commissioned to record The Lord Bless You And Keep You for somebody's memorial and used a self-cloning technique for the video. With social distancing making it difficult for groups to get together, rather than bring a choir together remotely, the baritone decided to sing the piece himself - nine times. Standing in slightly different locations at St Mary's Church in Saffron Walden, he performed a different part in his own arrangement adapted from a composition by John Rutter, before editing the versions together. Posting the final work on social media, Gouldler, a former chorister at the church, said: ""It's still strange seeing nine of myself. I've had lots of lovely messages and a really positive response."" Dr Fauci received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of last year The US top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has explained in an interview why he thinks Israel has been so successful in its vaccination drive. Its unique national circumstances set it up for success, he says. ""I can say without false flattery
that Israel really did it right, but it also had the right sort of ingredients
in its favour: the right size, the right healthcare system - everything was
geared to be successful for what they did, and they did it really very well,""he told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,external. ""To have over 80 in 100 people to receive a shot - the United
States is somewhere around 18, just look at the difference there. Israelâs
health system is quite uniform as a nation - perhaps due to size, location and
history,"" he said. Israel has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million- and about one million people have received two doses. ""The United States - a country that I love - has a different
system,â he added. ""Itâs good in some respects, but when youâre dealing with a
common enemy, you can have multiple ways of doing things and thatâs one of the
reasons we have not been as successful as we could have been thus far."" A mum and daughter have created a free online video series to help children with disabilities ""find a space of calm"" during the lockdowns. Founder of the disability dance charity Flamingo Chicks Katie Sparkes, 40, designed the relaxation videos with her 14-year-old daughter Poppy who has cerebral palsy. Sparkes, from Bristol, said the videos are needed as families don't have access to the special services that they need due to the pandemic. ""At moments of crisis it's a great tool to find those moments of calm,"" she says. The online videos use Makaton so that everyone can join in. Makaton uses signs and symbols to help people who find speaking difficult. This video can not be played Makaton relaxation videos 'a great tool to use' Boris Johnson is expected to announce a ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions in England on Monday. But what's happening in the rest of the UK? The PM saysthe priority is to get pupils back to schoolfrom 8 March. After schools reopen, No 10 says reuniting families and allowing people to have more social contact will be an ""absolute priority"". There is also pressure to reopen pubs, restaurants, shops and the tourism industry, but the government says it will be""led by data, not dates"". The devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds to ease lockdown: Need more information?Here's a full guide to lockdown rules where you live. Fights, Covid-19 outbreaks and alleged abuse have been reported at four west London hotels housing asylum seekers. Asylum seekers were moved to hotels - in Chiswick, Twickenham and Fulham -in response to the coronavirus pandemic. One woman, who spoke to the BBC under the condition of anonymity, said a resident at her hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. She said: ""She caught the virus and she been in hospital for three months and might not survive. ""We haven't been tested regularly in the hotel. The children play with each other. Maybe it can spread. ""We feel it is dangerous. When I hear my family cough, I just pray it's not coronavirus."" Police have not been able to find all the incidents described on their records and the Home Office has refused comment, saying it is not responsible. It directed the BBC to Clearspring, a company that is used by the government to house asylum seekers. Anti-vaccination protesters have gathered across Australia If you're just joining us, here are some of the latest coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world: We also have an update on the UK's vaccination programme. The number of people who have received their first coronavirus vaccine in the UK is 17,247,442. And 604,885 people have also received their second dose. A further 445 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,the government's daily figures show.,external This takes the total number of deaths, within 28 days of a positive Covid test, to 120,365. There were also 10,406 positive cases recorded in the UK in the last 24 hours. The Mona Lisa usually has crowds around it You may be wondering what's been happening inside museums all over the world during the pandemic while lockdowns have been in place. At the Louvre Museum in Paris, which has been closed to visitors for nearly four months, officials have taken the opportunity to carry out long-overdue refurbishments which would not normally have been possible. Some 10 million people come to what is thought to be the world's most visited museum each year, the majority from abroad. But the crowds are now gone and it instead looks like this... An empty Grande Galerie in the Louvre During this quiet time, curators, restorers and workers have been busy cleaning up sculptures, reordering artefacts, checking inventories, reorganising access and carrying out restorations. ""Weâre taking advantage of the museumâs closure to carry out a number of major works, speed up maintenance operations and start repair works that are difficult to schedule when the museum is operating normally,"" Laurent Le GuÃ©dart, the museum's architectural heritage and gardens director, toldthe Associated Press news agency,external. Around four million people in the UK suffer from diabetes - including around a million who have not been diagnosed, according to the charity Diabetes UK. And while it's already known that diabetics are more at risk of suffering severe cases of Covid - new evidence suggests the virus could actually be triggering the condition in some patients. Jordan Charles went months with undiagnosed diabetes after contracting Covid-19. Here's his story: This video can not be played Paul KirbyBBC News While the streets and tourist sites of Rome and Barcelona came to a standstill under lockdown, a curfew triggered riots in Dutch cities From the first case diagnosed a year ago at a hospital in northern Italy to the empty shops, restaurants and stadiums of Europe's cities, coronavirus has changed the lives of Europeans. Curbs on movement have forced every country and society to adapt its rules and rethink its culture. Italians were initially frightened into uncharacteristic obedience, says BBC Rome correspondent Mark Lowen. They were the first to be crushed by the virus, the first to see intensive care units close to collapse, and friends and family dying. Very widespread respect for restrictions began to change with the second wave, with some protests against renewed lockdowns, given the fear and fatigue. Read about the hard truths and unexpected innovations in a year that changed Europe. Earlier we heard from the co-founder of fast food chain Leon, who warned against extending lockdown. John Vincent says the length of restrictions ""matters hugely"" and ""could cost lives"". Responding to his comments, a government spokesperson said they understood that this is an ""extremely tough time for UK restaurants"". ""We are supporting business with one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth over Â£280bn,"" the spokesperson said. ""As we navigate our way out of lockdown, we will continue to work closely with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic."" The prime minister will set out the roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions on Monday.We've got more on this story here. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The political reality is that Boris Johnson had to offer up
a date for when heâd explain the path out of lockdown in England. There are those on the
Tory backbenches who would not have accepted an open-ended timeline. But the
government would argue that naming 22 February wasnât some
arbitrary effort to buy time, rather a logical choice - one thatâs linked to the
aim of reopening schools two weeks later, while allowing both the lockdown
and vaccine programme to take effect. Regardless of considerations in play, the
long-awaited roadmap does now loom on the very near horizon. Government sources
insist that the details are, even now, still being finalised but with two days
to go a broad plan must now be in place. The government can try to stress
caution or talk about caveats but all the build-up has led to a growing sense
of anticipation. And, for many, that anticipation is linked to a hope that our
daily lives may soon be less limited. Union leaders will present a formal paper to the government as part of their campaign to get support for Eurostar services after the company admitted it is ""fighting for survival"". It comes after officials from the train drivers' union Aslef held a meeting at the Treasury on Friday to argue for jobs and services to be protected as the cross-Channel operator suffers from a fall in passengers because of the coronavirus crisis. Union leaders have beenurging the government to offer its support since last summerwhen The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union called on the transport secretary to intervene as a matter of urgency to prevent job cuts. Eurostar said at the time it was looking at ways to protect itself for the long term by reducing costs across the business, including ""a considered approach to reducing our payroll costs"". Today, Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: ""We are calling on the UK government to intervene to prevent Eurostar going to the wall. ""Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, and Grant Shapps must act now to save this service - for passengers, for the men and women who work on Eurostar, and for Britain and our connection with the continent."" He said train drivers and all the staff who keep our railways running have been instrumental in moving passengers and freight around this country during the pandemic ""So the government must not turn its back on them now,"" he added. Russia says it now has three vaccines against Covid-19 - Sputnik V (pictured), EpiVacCorona and now CoviVac Russia has registered its third Covid-19 vaccine, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has announced. The new vaccine, CoviVac, has been produced by the state-run Chumakov Centre in Moscow, and is due to be introduced in the country by March, though large-scale clinical trials are not yet under way. ""Today, Russia is the only country to have already three vaccines for preventing the coronavirus infection,"" Mishustin said. It's said to use a different method of development from Russia's other vaccines, Sputnik V and EpiVacCorona, using an inactive virus. Russia was the first country to register a vaccine against Covid-19 in Augustlast year. Despite early scepticism over Russia's testing strategy,the effectiveness of Sputnik was later confirmedby the Lancet medical journal, and it has been authorised by more than 20 countries.  Cathie Russell has window visits with her mum, Rose Hamilton In Scotland, the news families will be able to make regular indoor visits to older loved ones in care homes from early March has also been welcomed. The Scottish government has confirmedresidents will be allowed two designated visitors. Donald MacAskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said despite the many challenges presented by the pandemic, ""undoubtedly the hardest has been keeping residents apart from family and friends"". He said: ""We commit to working together to overcome any challenges and difficulties we might face and to support those who may still be anxious and fearful, so that together we can ensure that a painful period of separation can be replaced by greater togetherness."" Scottish Conservatives shadow health secretary Donald Cameron called on ministers to ensure the guidance is ""clear and practical"" so the return of visitors can ""operate as smoothly and safely as possible"". Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour's shadow health secretary, said the isolation of residents who were in some cases at the end of their lives was a ""human rights scandal"". She said: ""This is a welcome step in the right direction. Guidance, however, has fallen short before. Too many care providers and public health directors have brushed it aside. This can't happen again."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Wall Street Charging Bull sculptor 'dies aged 80'The bronze statue has become one of the most recognisable images of New York.Europe,"Arturo Di Modica originally installed the bull in New York in 1989 The sculptor behind Wall Street's famous Charging Bull statue has died aged 80, reports say. Friends of Arturo Di Modica told Italian media that the sculptor died in his home town of Vittoria, Sicily. He had been fighting cancer for many years, La Repubblica reported. The bull was originally installed in New York in 1989 without permission. It was designed to represent the ""strength and power of the American people"" after the 1987 market crash. Police seized the 7,100 pound (3,200 kg) bronze statue from its position outside the New York Stock Exchange. But following a public outcry, city officials allowed it to be reinstalled days later in the heart of Manhattan's financial district. It has gone on to become one of the most recognisable images of New York, and a major tourist attraction. In recent years, Di Modica opposed the temporary installation of another now famous statue, called Fearless Girl, opposite the bull. Di Modica complained at the time that his bull was meant to embody ""strength, power and love"", and that having Fearless Girl - designed to call attention to gender inequality and the pay gap in the corporate world - face off against it turned its message into something negative. This video can not be played The statue, by artist Kristen Visbal, is called Fearless Girl Other notable works by Di Modica include marble pieces exhibited at the Rockefeller Center, works in bronze at Castle Clinton National Monument, and a bronze horse exhibited in the Lincoln Center, his biography on chargingbull.com says.

Racing to screen the âfake heiressâ story,"Anna Sorokin's trial captured a lot of online attention It was an elaborate, truth-is-stranger-than-fiction scam that went on for years under the radar, but when word finally got out that a young woman had been conning people in New York by faking it as a millionaire heiress, social media went wild. Now that Anna Sorokin - aka Anna Delvey - has served her time in prison, here is the story of Netflix's race to tell the tale and her life on the other side. Back at the end of May 2018, 27-year-old Anna Sorokin awoke for another day inside New York City's notoriously rough Rikers Island jail. Having caused financial chaos amid a small circle of people and banks, she was awaiting trial on various theft charges. Until this point, she was largely unknown to the wider world. This was all about to change. It is not always easy to predict which stories will go viral. Everyone wants the secret formula, butthe first exposÃ© of the Anna Sorokin case in The Cut,externalwas the nearest you could get to having all the right ingredients: money, intrigue and a jaw-on-the-floor scam. According to industry tracker Chartbeat, it is believed to be the sixth most-read story of that year, worldwide. Anna Sorokin found guilty over NY scam My strange encounters with 'Anna Delvey' Listen to the BBC podcast series Fake Heiress In case you missed it: this was a story of a recent magazine intern who pretended to be the heir to a fortune and managed to con bankers, hoteliers and new-found friends out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. While on the surface she showed off designer clothes and a jetset life on Instagram, behind the scenes she was bouncing cheques and forging documents to secure loans. She went by the name of Anna Delvey, but, in reality, she was Anna Sorokin, from an average Russian family who lived in Germany. The police finally caught up with her while she was on the run in Malibu, California. The story, with all its audacious and cinematic twists, instantly captured imaginations. Less than two weeks after the magazine article came out, prisoner number 19G0366 signed a Netflix contract for film rights to her story. BBC News has obtained a copy of the contracts between Netflix and Sorokin, through a freedom of information request, as the paperwork was required to be lodged with state authorities after she was convicted. They show that the first fee of $30,000 (Â£20,000) was agreed on 8 June. It was the ""initial"" payment, as her lawyer, Todd Spodek, emphasised. Underneath her signature, two names were typed - ""Anna Delvey aka Anna Sorokin"" - just to be sure. Over time, payments from Netflix to Sorokin would rise to $320,000. And for the first time in almost 20 years, they triggered a controversial New York law, designed to stop convicted criminals from profiting from their crime. Netflix has abided by those US laws; there has been no legal wrongdoing, as we will explain below. But its quick action in securing the deal shows how important viral stories are to streaming services. In 2018, Netflix was in the market for big hits. It was churning out content to a massive subscriber base, but it was - and still is - hugely in debt. The pressure was on to produce original content, especially as other streaming services - from Disney, Apple and HBO - were known to be in the pipeline. Sorokin's story was appealing, not just because it was an astounding tale, but also because interest was already measurable. Her name had been a trending topic on social media; people had been wearing T-shirts with ""fake heiress"" slogans; Elle Magazine had offered a tutorial on how to get the""Anna Delvey eyeliner"" look.,external It was the dawn of what was becoming known as the ""summer of scam"" or ""grifter season"". This is how The New Yorker later described the media interest in such tales:,external""Grifter season comes irregularly, but it comes often in America, which is built around mythologies of profit and reinvention and spectacular ascent."" The magazine cited Sorokin's case - ""an instant-classic"" -  but also referenced Billy MacFarland and his disastrous Fyre Festival, and Elizabeth Holmes and her failed biotech company Theranos. Online, the public were eagerly consuming the related hot-takes and long reads, while the TV and film companies battled it out to produce the definitive on-screen versions. Bad Blood - the book on Ms Holmes' exploits - had already sparked a fierce bidding war for film rights, and two Fyre Festival documentaries were then in production - one by Netflix, one by a competitor, Hulu. Billy McFarland (right) was convicted of fraud and is serving a six-year sentence It is not unusual for an entertainment company to leap straight on a story to ""option it"". This is Hollywood speak for the first step - a relatively small holding fee, while a project's feasibility is considered. This can often lead to limbo for a year or more, and then the whole idea may be scrapped. However, in this particular case, the next move was made without delay. Netflix revealed their big-budget production on 8 June - the same day that Sorokin signed on the line for the first $30,000 payment, and just 11 days after the article about her story was published in The Cut. Entertainment site Variety announced the production, implying that it may have even happened sooner if it weren't for certain complications: ""One insider close to the situation has said the process has been difficult and that Delvey [Sorokin] has been making calls to various talent and producers regarding whom she would like to play her."" By now the story was much bigger than Sorokin herself. At the helm of the series was one of the biggest producers in the US. Shonda Rhimes - of Grey's Anatomy and Scandal - had signed a three-year deal with Netflix in the middle of 2017 for a jaw-dropping $100m. She and the company had been waiting for the right project to make an impact. A fictionalised drama based on Sorokin's story - later named Inventing Anna - was to be her first production under this deal. The hype was instant. Shonda Rhimes was an executive producer of Bridgerton but Inventing Anna will be the first show she creates for Netflix ""Expectations are sky high. This is her first time in the writers' room for Netflix,"" says Lacey Rose of The Hollywood Reporter. When Rose interviewed Rhimes,external, the producer said she had read the article on The Cut and expressed her interest straight away. Jessica Pressler, the article's author, was quickly contracted, too. Pressler also had a strong track record; one of her previous magazine articles had been turned into the acclaimed Jennifer Lopez movie Hustlers. ""This is the marketplace now,"" says Rose. ""Within hours of articles coming out, you see bidding wars. The space has blown up in recent years and I don't imagine it will slow down any time soon."" Netflix's deal with Sorokin later moved beyond the initial optioning deal and, after she was convicted, became a more pricey ""life rights"" contract. This is common practice in the US, less so in the UK. Among other things, it buys protection from lawsuits, allows you to use someone's image, and can sometimes even include the co-operation of the person as a consultant. The contract shows Sorokin gave the company exclusive rights and also agreed to potentially co-operate as a consultant. The terms for paid consultancy work include no participation in documentaries or unscripted shows while the series is in production. And no appearances on talk shows or posts on social media about experiences in the series, without the company's permission, for three years after the final episode first airs. She is permitted to write a book, but it cannot be released within a year of the show first airing. She can, however, speak about experiences outside the show's subject matter. In parenthesis, it says: ""So if she cures cancer in the future, we are not saying she can't consult on that."" Why are we fascinated by con artists? Inside the world's biggest festival flop Bad blood: The rise and fall of Theranos A ""life rights"" deal does not mean other people can't tell the story - which has multiple perspectives - but it gives the company free rein and ensures Sorokin cannot assist the competition. Actress Julia Garner - who has the lead role in Inventing Anna - visited Sorokin in prison ""If you can afford it, it's a smart deal,"" said one agent, who did not want to be named because they work with Netflix regularly. ""It used to happen even more in the day, when you had the big five studios. They were huge buyers of IP [intellectual property rights]. In this case, you are buying exclusivity and authenticity, and you can preemptively shut down the competition."" There have been multiple reports of a competing HBO project, led by screenwriter Lena Dunham (who wrote and starred in Girls) and positioning Sorokin's friend Rachel Deloache Williams as the central protagonist. There has also been speculation that this may either have been shelved or that it may go head-to-head with the Netflix version. ""Two duelling Anna Delvey series are poised to be the next Fyre Festival doc battle,"" read a headline on entertainment site The Decider. HBO told the BBC that project is still in the development stage. There is, however, a separate documentary in the works. When Netflix first got in contact with Sorokin, she had not been convicted, but once she was, there were rules that needed to be followed. New York's ""Son of Sam"" law kicked into play. The law's origins stem back to 1970s serial killer David Berkowitz, known by his pen-name ""Son of Sam"", amid concerns that he would profit from his notoriety by selling his story. In response, New York state passed a law to prevent profiting from such fame, and multiple states followed suit. However, publishers fought back. In the late 1980s, Simon & Schuster was working on a book in collaboration with ex-mobster Henry Hill, when the authorities came knocking over a $90,000 payment. The resulting dispute went as high as the Supreme Court, which ultimately struck the law down, saying it was in conflict with the right to free speech. The book, Wiseguy, went ahead, as did the royalty payments, and it inspired the Martin Scorsese film Goodfellas, from which Hill reportedly earnt a further $480,000. A reworked Son of Sam law was introduced in 2001. Today, a company is required to notify the Office of Victims Services (OVS) if they are paying a convicted felon more than $10,000. The office will not seize that money, but it will freeze the bank account and notify the victims of the crime, who then can file their own lawsuits to make claims. Laverne Cox plays Anna's personal trainer, Kacy Duke, in the Netflix production, which has been delayed by the pandemic This is what happened in Sorokin's case; the banks that she had conned stepped forward. ""OVS was notified by Netflix that it paid Ms Sorokin $320,000 and those funds were frozen,"" a OVS spokesperson, Janine Kava, told the BBC. ""City National Bank filed a suit and obtained $100,000 and CitiBank did the same, obtaining $70,000. The balance of the funds must pay her attorneys' fees; any funds remaining would go to Ms Sorokin."" Signature Bank - which Sorokin also defrauded with a cheque-bouncing ruse - declined to file action. And Sorokin's friend, Rachel Deloache Williams, was not eligible, because Sorokin was found not guilty on the related charge in court. Williams had infamously footed a $62,000 bill after Sorokin invited her to what she thought was an all-expenses-paid trip to a luxury resort in Morocco. Her money was eventually refunded by American Express and she wrote a book about the experience, My Friend Anna. According to the OVS, some of the other victims have been paid back in conjunction with other orders from the judge in Sorokin's case. Paris-based creative director Marc Kremers says he is still owed Â£16,800 for creating promotional material for the Anna Delvey Foundation - an arts project she was trying to fund via a $100m loan. He was not a direct part in the prosecution's case, so he will not be on the victims' list, but he says he is pursuing the matter separately. Anna in court with her lawyer, Todd Spodek The OVS says the Sorokin case was the first test of Son of Sam law since it was reintroduced in 2001. What is particularly interesting is that Netflix became involved in a pre-trial stage. ""In the UK, making payments to anyone pre-trial is quite problematic,"" says David Banks, a UK media law expert. Regulations say no payments, or promises of payments, can be made while proceedings are active. ""It would be hard to justify this kind of arrangement in the UK, but in the US it is very different. Look at OJ Simpson. Everyone became a celebrity in that trial, jurors wrote books,"" Mr Banks says. Indeed, the Sorokin trial became quite a spectacle. Netflix researchers sat alongside the press, and the defendant employed a stylist, via her lawyer. ""Anna's style was a driving force in her business, and life, and it is a part of who she is. I want the jury to see that side of her and enlisted a stylist to assist in slecting [sic] the appropriate outfits for trial,""her lawyer, Todd Spodek, told The Cut at the time,external. Judge Diane Kiesel also acknowledged her celebrity-like status and the buzz around the TV series. ""This sentence should be a message to the defendant and any of her fans out there,"" she said to the courtroom. Netflix declined to talk to the BBC about whether their payments may have affected the justice process. The OVS has clarified that Netflix came to them initially, it did not need to chase them, and all US rules were followed. The initial $30,000 was paid pre-trial without objection from authorities. The company also followed the New York court's orders and later payments were all directed to an OVS-monitored account, enabling distribution to victims. The pandemic delayed the filming of Inventing Anna last year and the series is now set to be released by the end of 2021. Anna Chlumsky (centre) is playing the role of the investigative journalist, while Alexis Floyd (right) will be hotel concierge Neff Davis Netflix's big spends across the board have kept it at the top. ""But one thing that's changed [since the Sorokin deal and since the pandemic] is that platforms can now create their own viral stories,"" says Tom Harrington, a media analyst at Enders Analysis. ""With so many people watching, they can take a piece of programming, put it at the top of their platform, and make it a hit. Look at Tiger King, that guy had talked to loads of people before, but Netflix made it international, so everyone was talking about it at the same time."" That said, the gold rush for ""hot ticket"" stories remains. Earlier this year, Netflix became one of many players looking to adaptthe GameStop saga- a David-versus-Goliath tale of bedroom stocks. There are currentlyseven projects in their initial stages,external. As for Sorokin, she was released from prison last week, having served three and half years of a four-to-12-year sentence. Her lawyer, Todd Spodek, says: ""Anna is currently working on her appeal. I anticipate that ultimately there will be deportation proceedings commenced based on her status."" In the meantime, she is back roaming around New York, documenting life on Twitter and Instagram, with her friend Neff Davis (the former concierge at the 11 Howard Hotel where Sorokin ran up a $31,000 bill). Sorokin posted this photograph on Instagram of her preparing for a magazine shoot this week Sorokin has also published some prison diary extracts online and is writing a memoir. Her lawyer confirmed that her Netflix contract does bring certain constraints. Sorokin declined to be interviewed for this story. ""Please talk to the global president of Anna Delvey TV,"" she said in an email. This turns out to be Doug Higginbotham, an Emmy-Award-winning filmmaker. He is a freelancer and says he does not condone her crimes. Sorokin contacted him last week, saying a TV crew were being too intrusive in following her around. ""She thought: why don't I just hire a crew myself, so I can control the narrative?"" he says. He has since been documenting her life, as she deals with the paparazzi, goes shopping and visits her parole officer. ""We don't know what we'll do with the footage yet, but she's getting a lot of major offers, so we didn't want to miss anything,"" he says. Allow Twitter content?

"Send vaccines to poorer nations now, WTO tells UK","The UK should donate vaccines to developing countries now rather than waiting until it has a surplus, the new head of the World Trade Organization has told the BBC. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said it was ""in the interest"" of wealthy countries that all nations access vaccines. It comes after PM Boris Johnsonsaid the UK would donate most of its surplus supplyto poorer nations. On Friday, G7 leaders pledged to intensify co-operation on Covid-19. They agreed to increase their contribution to the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative, which is aiming to get at least 1.3 billion doses to vulnerable populations worldwide in the coming months. Addressing the UK government's plans to donate its surplus vaccines to the developing world, Ms Okonjo-Iweala told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""welcome"" - but cautioned against delay. ""I don't think we should wait to get surplus when other people have been served,"" she said. ""I think that any donations that are coming must come now. ""The reason is very simple. It's in the interest of rich countries as well as poor countries to have equitable access."" G7 pledge billions for Covax vaccine scheme The scheme to share unused vaccines with other countries The new WTO chief cited a study by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), which outlined the economic case for global vaccinations. The ICC-commissioned research found that the world stood to lose as much as $9tn (Â£6.4tn) in GDP if, by the middle of the year, rich countries have vaccinated half their populations and poor countries have not vaccinated theirs, Ms Okonjo-Iweala said. ""Half of that cost will be borne by rich countries,"" she said. ""So we need to understand that it's in the self-interest of both rich and poor to have equitable access to vaccines otherwise all counties lose; all people lose."" Earlier this month, Ms Okonjo-Iweala was named as the WTO's first female and first African director-general G7 leaders said in a joint statement released after the virtual summit on Friday that they have raised their overall commitment to the Covax scheme to $7.5bn (Â£5.3bn). The leaders' commitments came just days after UN secretary general AntÃ³nio Guterres slated the distribution of vaccines so far as ""wildly uneven and unfair"". New WTO boss warns against vaccine nationalism How many Covid vaccines has my country given? Just 10 countries have administered 75% of all vaccinations worldwide, while 130 countries had not yet received a single dose, he said. Manufacturing is the biggest constraint in providing vaccines to people quickly, Ms Okonjo-Iweala said. She encouraged manufacturing companies to issue more licenses in developing countries, so a larger volume of doses could be produced across poorer regions. VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Osaka beats Brady to win Australian OpenShe cements her place as the outstanding star of the women's game by winning a fourth Grand Slam title.BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Australian Open: Best shots as Osaka beats Brady in final Japan's Naomi Osaka cemented her place as the outstanding star of the women's game by beating American Jennifer Brady in the Australian Open final to win her fourth Grand Slam title. Osaka, 23, is unbeaten in major finals after a 6-4 6-3 win in Melbourne. Osaka edged the first set when Brady, in her first Grand Slam final, paid for some glaring errors in the final game. The third seed seized control from that point, racing 4-0 ahead in the second set before sealing a deserved victory. Osaka has now won two Australian Open titles after also triumphing at Melbourne Park in 2019, with her other Grand Slam successes coming at the US Open in 2018 and 2020. She has not suffered a defeat since February 2020 after extending her winning run to 21 matches. Osaka's face lit up with a wide grin, raising her racquet above her head, when she clinched the title on her first match point after Brady looped a return long. Around 7,500 fans were allowed to watch the final on Rod Laver Arena and Osaka lapped up the acclaim after her US Open victory came behind closed doors. ""It feels incredible to have fans, I played the last Grand Slam without fans, to have this energy means a lot,"" said Osaka as she clutched the Daphne Akhurst Trophy. 'Osaka now sets the standards on women's tour' Relive how Osaka won the 2021 Australian Open final 'Chess player' Medvedev aiming to end Djokovic dominance Osaka is the first women's player to win her first four Grand Slam finals since Monica Seles in 1991. And asked if she could reach double figures in slam titles, Osaka replied: ""I'm taking it in sections. Right now, I'm trying to go for five. After five I would think about maybe dividing the 10, so maybe seven or eight. ""I like to take things not big picture. I know that the people that I'm playing against are the best players in the world and, if my time comes to win another Grand Slam, it will come."" Naomi Osaka will rise to second in the world rankings after winning the Australian Open Softly-spoken Osaka has emerged as the sport's biggest star in recent times and illustrated that yet again with another Grand Slam victory. On the court, her clean hitting and clear thinking has proved too much for her opponents to handle. Off the court, she has grown into one of the world's most marketable athletes and found her voice to become a prominent social activist. ""I feel like the biggest thing that I want to achieve is playing long enough to play a girl that said that I was once her favourite player,"" said Osaka. ""I think that's the coolest thing that could ever happen to me. I just think that that's how the sport moves forward."" In her runners-up speech, Brady said Osaka was ""an inspiration to us all"". ""What she is doing for the game is amazing. I hope young girls are watching and inspired by what she is doing,"" Brady said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Osaka struggled to land first serves and made 24 unforced errors, but won four of her five break points and saved two of Brady's four chances Osaka was the clear favourite in the final at Melbourne Park, although a relatively serene path to the final also featured moments where she showed her fight and spirit. In the fourth round against 2020 runner-up Garbine Muguruza, Osaka had to see off two match points before going on to win, as well as coming through some tricky moments against 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams in the semi-finals. While her level against Brady was not always at its highest, she still had enough quality in the key moments. That was most evident at 5-4 in the first set when her relentless pressure forced Brady into the errors which proved pivotal. And more brilliance enabled Osaka to make a fast start in the second set from which Brady could not recover. A sweet cross-court backhand winner brought up more break points for a 2-0 lead, taking the first opportunity when another deep return bamboozled Brady into some clumsy footwork. From that point, Osaka's confidence further grew and she quickly went a double break up. While Brady did claw one back, Osaka never looked like relinquishing another and served out the Championship to love. The next question for Osaka will be whether she can transfer this hard-court dominance onto the clay and grass surfaces. Success has not yet arrived at the French Open and Wimbledon, but her next ambition - once she has celebrated this success - will be trying to change that in the next few months and over the coming years."" ""I feel like I have to get comfortable on those surfaces,"" Osaka said. ""I didn't play juniors, so I didn't grow up playing on grass at all. ""I honestly think I'd have better luck on clay, because I think last year I didn't play bad at all. It's just something that I have to get more used to."" Allow Twitter content?

While it was not the outcome Brady wanted, the 25-year-old American has plenty of positives to build on after reaching her first Grand Slam final. It was quite remarkable the 22nd seed even made the second week in Melbourne, having been the only singles player forced into a 'hard' quarantine on arrival in Australia to do so. Stuck in her room for 14 days without leaving, the former college player had to hit balls against a mattress propped up against the wall, come up with inventive footwork drills and borrow an exercise bike and treadmill from Tennis Australia. She also admitted to stopping watching Netflix so she would not ""do anything other than lay in bed"". Solid serving is the bedrock of her game and that helped her work her way through a kind draw where she did not face anyone inside the top 20 until Osaka. Brady lost to Osaka when they met in a high-quality US Open semi-final last September and suffered the same fate as she struggled to impose her service game. The match swung away from Brady in that decisive 10th game of the opening set. After having regained her fluency following a scrappy start, a double fault at 40-30 gave Osaka hope and Brady then got caught out by a return hitting the baseline to give Osaka a set point out of nowhere. Brady planted an easy forehand into the net and, ultimately, that sloppy game cost her the match. Groans from the crowd as Brady grimaced and shook her head reinforced the point. ""It wasn't meant to be, but hopefully there's many more,"" said Brady, who will rise to 15th in the world after being outside the top 50 a year ago. Allow Twitter content?

Flood disruption amid 'persistent rain' warning,"The Quay Centre community hub sits on the bank of the River Towy in Carmarthen Roads have been flooded and homes evacuated as heavy rain swept across Wales. Some areas of south Wales have seen a month's worth of rain in 24 hours, according to the Met Office. Dyfed-Powys Police said several homes in Newcastle Emlyn were evacuated because of the flooding risk but many residents chose to stay. A landslide shut the B4459 at Capel Dewi, Ceredigion, and flooding blocked the A483 in Builth Wells, Powys.

Ambulance delays led to 'secondary Covid victims',"Ambulances waiting outside busy hospitals over Christmas led to ""secondary Covid victims"", the Royal College of Emergency Medicine has said. Information requests show that the number of hours ambulances spent waiting to offload patients rose by 63% in London and 48% in the West Midlands. BBC News has spoken to the widow of a man who died of a stroke, having waited three hours for an ambulance. The NHS said capacity had been freed up despite increasing Covid-19 infections. NHS England said the number of individual ambulances waiting more than 30 minutes across the whole of England from the end of December to the beginning of February, had fallen. A spokesperson said: ""Despite seeing a significant increase in the number of patients with coronavirus at the end of December, the NHS has worked together to free up capacity and enable quicker patient handovers."" Rose Rwagasore was working as a nurse treating coronavirus at North Middlesex Hospital in north London on New Year's Eve, when her teenage children called her late in the evening to say their father, Robert Wabwire, was unwell, with a sudden headache and vomiting. Despite calling 999, no ambulance had arrived. Increasingly concerned, Rose spoke to her husband on the phone and recognised his speech was slurred, a common warning sign of a stroke. Rose drove home but her husband deteriorated further, and she performed CPR. ""It is literally five minutes to the hospital"", she says. ""But because now he could not move, we couldn't get him in the car."" The first of three ambulances arrived more than three hours after the initial call. The family had rung 999 four times. The desired response time for patients with symptoms of a stroke is 18 minutes. Robert, 48 years old, had died by the time paramedics arrived. Rose says she feels his death could have been prevented. ""I can't really expect that an ambulance can take such a long time,"" she said. ""The children were alone in the house with their father who was unwell."" London 999 calls as high as Covid first wave peak Ambulance wait times in England 'off the scale' England care home residents to get one visitor each Ambulance Trusts record handover times if the wait outside hospital exceeds 30 minutes. BBC News has learned that ambulances outside Robert's local hospital, North Middlesex, spent, on average, double the time waiting during the week he died, compared with the equivalent week the year before. In the week Robert died the wait was 197.8 hours. For the corresponding week in 2019 it was 94.1 hours. In London overall, ambulances waited for 4,164 hours in the two weeks spanning Christmas and New Year - a 63% increase on the 2,550 hours for the same time period in 2019. In the West Midlands, there was a 48% increase on last year - 3,954 hours for the fortnight from 28 December 2020, compared to 2,673 hours for the same time period in 2019. In other parts of England, waiting times showed an improvement on the previous year. Richard Webber, from the College of Paramedics, said handover delays meant patients calling 999 may have to wait longer. BBC News has learned of other serious incidents in December and January: A patient with signs of sepsis and recent abdominal surgery waited for more than six hours A patient had a cardiac arrest and died following seven calls to 111 and 999 and having waited more than four hours for an ambulance A patient with heart palpitations faced a lengthy wait for paramedics and then suffered a heart attack Royal College of Emergency Medicine vice-president Adrian Boyle said:  ""All that's happened is Covid has taken a very fragile system and basically pushed it over the edge. ""The idea that there are patients who have called for help [and] a paramedic has made a judgement that this is a person who is seriously ill, and they get to the hospital and the whole system that's designed to help them is unable to help them...I think that's absolutely ghastly."" The London Ambulance Service said December 2020 was its busiest ever month, and it responded to more emergency calls than during the peak of the first pandemic wave. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it had ""substantially increased the number of staff available to respond to patients"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Covid-19 has put the NHS under acute pressure and our heroic paramedics, nurses and doctors have been doing everything possible to ensure hospitals continue to provide vital services and quality healthcare. ""We recognise the unique challenges facing the NHS and we continue to make sure our health service has the capacity and resources - both financial and practical - it needs to continue to weather the Covid storm.""

"Leon boss warns longer lockdown 'will cost lives'John Vincent says extending lockdowns, even by a number of weeks, ""matters hugely"".UK","Extending lockdowns even by a matter of weeks will ""cost lives"", the co-founder of fast-food chain Leon has said. John Vincent said businesses were ""at the heart of a functioning and healthy society"" and were losing money that should be going to their employees and the government through taxes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has saidpeople should be ""optimistic but patient""about national lockdowns. He will set out a road map for lifting England's restrictions on Monday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Vincent said it was ""quite possible"" that Leon could fold ""if weeks and months drag on"", as it was losing around Â£200,000 a week. That figure was more like Â£800,000 when ""what we would have been making"" is taken into account, he said. ""That's money that isn't going into the economy, it's not going into the wallets of the people who work for Leon, and it's not going to pay the taxes that we need to pay,"" he said. ""No one's asked us for these numbers, so how does the government know what's going on in the economy?"" He said there had been a ""pantomime of scientists against business"" during the pandemic - ""as if there isn't one giant shared agenda"" - and the latter were ""positioned as the uncompassionate ones"". John Vincent has been chief executive of the business since 2014 But the length of lockdowns ""matters hugely"", he said, adding that the government had not produced a ""holistic cost-benefit analysis"". ""Therefore, how can we be making this decision about the impacts on the young today and for their futures? How can we make (decisions about) the impacts of the huge economic destruction which is costing lives? When we lose our economy we lose lives,"" he said. ""How can we be saying, glibly, 'it doesn't matter if lockdown carries on for a few weeks or months longer than necessary' without the analysis? I wouldn't launch a chicken wrap without analysis."" A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the prime minister would lay out a plan for ""gradually reopening our economy and society in a sustainable way"" on Monday. ""We understand that this is an extremely tough time for UK restaurants, but we are supporting business with one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth over Â£280 billion,"" he said. ""As we navigate our way out of lockdown, we will continue to work closely with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic."" Mr Johnson said during a coronavirus briefing this week thatsteps taken to ease lockdown should be ""cautious but irreversible"". He hailed the success of the vaccine rollout, but warned the threat from the virus remained ""very real"" and now was not the time to ""relax"". More than 16 million people have been given a first dose of the vaccine, according to government figures released on Friday. A further 533 people died within 28 days of a positive test, and another 12,027 cases of the virus were confirmed. Mr Johnson's comments came after63 Tory MPs called for easing to begin in Marchand for analysis to be released justifying any measures staying in place. Earlier, it was announced thatcare home residents in England would be allowed to pick one personto visit them regularly from 8 March -  the first confirmed easing of lockdown since its reintroduction last month. Suppliers of pubs, restaurants and cafÃ©s have asked for at least two weeks' notice of any re-opening to ensure their supply chains are ready. Wholesalers say they will need time to stock up on fresh produce. Kate Bruns, who runs a pub in Hartlepool, told the BBC the past year had been extremely difficult. ""I'd like to get open and I would like a little bit more guidance on how or what is expected from our side, really,"" she said. ""The thing about drinking outside - as much as I would love that to happen - that it is slightly harder to control. When we had it inside it was very controlled and everyone felt safe. ""Customers felt safe - safer than if they were going to a supermarket. But outside is slightly different and harder to man."" VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Scientistshave called for a data-led approach to lifting measures. Prof Dame Angela McLean, deputy chief scientific adviser, told the Commons Science and Technology Committee earlier this week that each step of easing measures should be ""irrevocable"", adding ""that means we have to be extremely careful before we add another unlocking"". ""We want to understand the impact on each step before taking the next steps,"" she said, adding that this would require a ""large gap"" after children go back to school. Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the first English lockdown, told the BBC on Friday that two key bits of data - the infection rate and the effectiveness of vaccines - were ""looking promising"", but it would take ""quite a long time"" to assess the situation fully. He said the UK could be ""a very different country"" by the end of May. ""We will still have rules in place butâ¦ I think society will be a lot more normal,"" he said.

Racing to screen the âfake heiressâ storyHow Anna Sorokin's life rights became hot property.,"Anna Sorokin's trial captured a lot of online attention It was an elaborate, truth-is-stranger-than-fiction scam that went on for years under the radar, but when word finally got out that a young woman had been conning people in New York by faking it as a millionaire heiress, social media went wild. Now that Anna Sorokin - aka Anna Delvey - has served her time in prison, here is the story of Netflix's race to tell the tale and her life on the other side. Back at the end of May 2018, 27-year-old Anna Sorokin awoke for another day inside New York City's notoriously rough Rikers Island jail. Having caused financial chaos amid a small circle of people and banks, she was awaiting trial on various theft charges. Until this point, she was largely unknown to the wider world. This was all about to change. It is not always easy to predict which stories will go viral. Everyone wants the secret formula, butthe first exposÃ© of the Anna Sorokin case in The Cut,externalwas the nearest you could get to having all the right ingredients: money, intrigue and a jaw-on-the-floor scam. According to industry tracker Chartbeat, it is believed to be the sixth most-read story of that year, worldwide. Anna Sorokin found guilty over NY scam My strange encounters with 'Anna Delvey' Listen to the BBC podcast series Fake Heiress In case you missed it: this was a story of a recent magazine intern who pretended to be the heir to a fortune and managed to con bankers, hoteliers and new-found friends out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. While on the surface she showed off designer clothes and a jetset life on Instagram, behind the scenes she was bouncing cheques and forging documents to secure loans. She went by the name of Anna Delvey, but, in reality, she was Anna Sorokin, from an average Russian family who lived in Germany. The police finally caught up with her while she was on the run in Malibu, California. The story, with all its audacious and cinematic twists, instantly captured imaginations. Less than two weeks after the magazine article came out, prisoner number 19G0366 signed a Netflix contract for film rights to her story. BBC News has obtained a copy of the contracts between Netflix and Sorokin, through a freedom of information request, as the paperwork was required to be lodged with state authorities after she was convicted. They show that the first fee of $30,000 (Â£20,000) was agreed on 8 June. It was the ""initial"" payment, as her lawyer, Todd Spodek, emphasised. Underneath her signature, two names were typed - ""Anna Delvey aka Anna Sorokin"" - just to be sure. Over time, payments from Netflix to Sorokin would rise to $320,000. And for the first time in almost 20 years, they triggered a controversial New York law, designed to stop convicted criminals from profiting from their crime. Netflix has abided by those US laws; there has been no legal wrongdoing, as we will explain below. But its quick action in securing the deal shows how important viral stories are to streaming services. In 2018, Netflix was in the market for big hits. It was churning out content to a massive subscriber base, but it was - and still is - hugely in debt. The pressure was on to produce original content, especially as other streaming services - from Disney, Apple and HBO - were known to be in the pipeline. Sorokin's story was appealing, not just because it was an astounding tale, but also because interest was already measurable. Her name had been a trending topic on social media; people had been wearing T-shirts with ""fake heiress"" slogans; Elle Magazine had offered a tutorial on how to get the""Anna Delvey eyeliner"" look.,external It was the dawn of what was becoming known as the ""summer of scam"" or ""grifter season"". This is how The New Yorker later described the media interest in such tales:,external""Grifter season comes irregularly, but it comes often in America, which is built around mythologies of profit and reinvention and spectacular ascent."" The magazine cited Sorokin's case - ""an instant-classic"" -  but also referenced Billy MacFarland and his disastrous Fyre Festival, and Elizabeth Holmes and her failed biotech company Theranos. Online, the public were eagerly consuming the related hot-takes and long reads, while the TV and film companies battled it out to produce the definitive on-screen versions. Bad Blood - the book on Ms Holmes' exploits - had already sparked a fierce bidding war for film rights, and two Fyre Festival documentaries were then in production - one by Netflix, one by a competitor, Hulu. Billy McFarland (right) was convicted of fraud and is serving a six-year sentence It is not unusual for an entertainment company to leap straight on a story to ""option it"". This is Hollywood speak for the first step - a relatively small holding fee, while a project's feasibility is considered. This can often lead to limbo for a year or more, and then the whole idea may be scrapped. However, in this particular case, the next move was made without delay. Netflix revealed their big-budget production on 8 June - the same day that Sorokin signed on the line for the first $30,000 payment, and just 11 days after the article about her story was published in The Cut. Entertainment site Variety announced the production, implying that it may have even happened sooner if it weren't for certain complications: ""One insider close to the situation has said the process has been difficult and that Delvey [Sorokin] has been making calls to various talent and producers regarding whom she would like to play her."" By now the story was much bigger than Sorokin herself. At the helm of the series was one of the biggest producers in the US. Shonda Rhimes - of Grey's Anatomy and Scandal - had signed a three-year deal with Netflix in the middle of 2017 for a jaw-dropping $100m. She and the company had been waiting for the right project to make an impact. A fictionalised drama based on Sorokin's story - later named Inventing Anna - was to be her first production under this deal. The hype was instant. Shonda Rhimes was an executive producer of Bridgerton but Inventing Anna will be the first show she creates for Netflix ""Expectations are sky high. This is her first time in the writers' room for Netflix,"" says Lacey Rose of The Hollywood Reporter. When Rose interviewed Rhimes,external, the producer said she had read the article on The Cut and expressed her interest straight away. Jessica Pressler, the article's author, was quickly contracted, too. Pressler also had a strong track record; one of her previous magazine articles had been turned into the acclaimed Jennifer Lopez movie Hustlers. ""This is the marketplace now,"" says Rose. ""Within hours of articles coming out, you see bidding wars. The space has blown up in recent years and I don't imagine it will slow down any time soon."" Netflix's deal with Sorokin later moved beyond the initial optioning deal and, after she was convicted, became a more pricey ""life rights"" contract. This is common practice in the US, less so in the UK. Among other things, it buys protection from lawsuits, allows you to use someone's image, and can sometimes even include the co-operation of the person as a consultant. The contract shows Sorokin gave the company exclusive rights and also agreed to potentially co-operate as a consultant. The terms for paid consultancy work include no participation in documentaries or unscripted shows while the series is in production. And no appearances on talk shows or posts on social media about experiences in the series, without the company's permission, for three years after the final episode first airs. She is permitted to write a book, but it cannot be released within a year of the show first airing. She can, however, speak about experiences outside the show's subject matter. In parenthesis, it says: ""So if she cures cancer in the future, we are not saying she can't consult on that."" Why are we fascinated by con artists? Inside the world's biggest festival flop Bad blood: The rise and fall of Theranos A ""life rights"" deal does not mean other people can't tell the story - which has multiple perspectives - but it gives the company free rein and ensures Sorokin cannot assist the competition. Actress Julia Garner - who has the lead role in Inventing Anna - visited Sorokin in prison ""If you can afford it, it's a smart deal,"" said one agent, who did not want to be named because they work with Netflix regularly. ""It used to happen even more in the day, when you had the big five studios. They were huge buyers of IP [intellectual property rights]. In this case, you are buying exclusivity and authenticity, and you can preemptively shut down the competition."" There have been multiple reports of a competing HBO project, led by screenwriter Lena Dunham (who wrote and starred in Girls) and positioning Sorokin's friend Rachel Deloache Williams as the central protagonist. There has also been speculation that this may either have been shelved or that it may go head-to-head with the Netflix version. ""Two duelling Anna Delvey series are poised to be the next Fyre Festival doc battle,"" read a headline on entertainment site The Decider. HBO told the BBC that project is still in the development stage. There is, however, a separate documentary in the works. When Netflix first got in contact with Sorokin, she had not been convicted, but once she was, there were rules that needed to be followed. New York's ""Son of Sam"" law kicked into play. The law's origins stem back to 1970s serial killer David Berkowitz, known by his pen-name ""Son of Sam"", amid concerns that he would profit from his notoriety by selling his story. In response, New York state passed a law to prevent profiting from such fame, and multiple states followed suit. However, publishers fought back. In the late 1980s, Simon & Schuster was working on a book in collaboration with ex-mobster Henry Hill, when the authorities came knocking over a $90,000 payment. The resulting dispute went as high as the Supreme Court, which ultimately struck the law down, saying it was in conflict with the right to free speech. The book, Wiseguy, went ahead, as did the royalty payments, and it inspired the Martin Scorsese film Goodfellas, from which Hill reportedly earnt a further $480,000. A reworked Son of Sam law was introduced in 2001. Today, a company is required to notify the Office of Victims Services (OVS) if they are paying a convicted felon more than $10,000. The office will not seize that money, but it will freeze the bank account and notify the victims of the crime, who then can file their own lawsuits to make claims. Laverne Cox plays Anna's personal trainer, Kacy Duke, in the Netflix production, which has been delayed by the pandemic This is what happened in Sorokin's case; the banks that she had conned stepped forward. ""OVS was notified by Netflix that it paid Ms Sorokin $320,000 and those funds were frozen,"" a OVS spokesperson, Janine Kava, told the BBC. ""City National Bank filed a suit and obtained $100,000 and CitiBank did the same, obtaining $70,000. The balance of the funds must pay her attorneys' fees; any funds remaining would go to Ms Sorokin."" Signature Bank - which Sorokin also defrauded with a cheque-bouncing ruse - declined to file action. And Sorokin's friend, Rachel Deloache Williams, was not eligible, because Sorokin was found not guilty on the related charge in court. Williams had infamously footed a $62,000 bill after Sorokin invited her to what she thought was an all-expenses-paid trip to a luxury resort in Morocco. Her money was eventually refunded by American Express and she wrote a book about the experience, My Friend Anna. According to the OVS, some of the other victims have been paid back in conjunction with other orders from the judge in Sorokin's case. Paris-based creative director Marc Kremers says he is still owed Â£16,800 for creating promotional material for the Anna Delvey Foundation - an arts project she was trying to fund via a $100m loan. He was not a direct part in the prosecution's case, so he will not be on the victims' list, but he says he is pursuing the matter separately. Anna in court with her lawyer, Todd Spodek The OVS says the Sorokin case was the first test of Son of Sam law since it was reintroduced in 2001. What is particularly interesting is that Netflix became involved in a pre-trial stage. ""In the UK, making payments to anyone pre-trial is quite problematic,"" says David Banks, a UK media law expert. Regulations say no payments, or promises of payments, can be made while proceedings are active. ""It would be hard to justify this kind of arrangement in the UK, but in the US it is very different. Look at OJ Simpson. Everyone became a celebrity in that trial, jurors wrote books,"" Mr Banks says. Indeed, the Sorokin trial became quite a spectacle. Netflix researchers sat alongside the press, and the defendant employed a stylist, via her lawyer. ""Anna's style was a driving force in her business, and life, and it is a part of who she is. I want the jury to see that side of her and enlisted a stylist to assist in slecting [sic] the appropriate outfits for trial,""her lawyer, Todd Spodek, told The Cut at the time,external. Judge Diane Kiesel also acknowledged her celebrity-like status and the buzz around the TV series. ""This sentence should be a message to the defendant and any of her fans out there,"" she said to the courtroom. Netflix declined to talk to the BBC about whether their payments may have affected the justice process. The OVS has clarified that Netflix came to them initially, it did not need to chase them, and all US rules were followed. The initial $30,000 was paid pre-trial without objection from authorities. The company also followed the New York court's orders and later payments were all directed to an OVS-monitored account, enabling distribution to victims. The pandemic delayed the filming of Inventing Anna last year and the series is now set to be released by the end of 2021. Anna Chlumsky (centre) is playing the role of the investigative journalist, while Alexis Floyd (right) will be hotel concierge Neff Davis Netflix's big spends across the board have kept it at the top. ""But one thing that's changed [since the Sorokin deal and since the pandemic] is that platforms can now create their own viral stories,"" says Tom Harrington, a media analyst at Enders Analysis. ""With so many people watching, they can take a piece of programming, put it at the top of their platform, and make it a hit. Look at Tiger King, that guy had talked to loads of people before, but Netflix made it international, so everyone was talking about it at the same time."" That said, the gold rush for ""hot ticket"" stories remains. Earlier this year, Netflix became one of many players looking to adaptthe GameStop saga- a David-versus-Goliath tale of bedroom stocks. There are currentlyseven projects in their initial stages,external. As for Sorokin, she was released from prison last week, having served three and half years of a four-to-12-year sentence. Her lawyer, Todd Spodek, says: ""Anna is currently working on her appeal. I anticipate that ultimately there will be deportation proceedings commenced based on her status."" In the meantime, she is back roaming around New York, documenting life on Twitter and Instagram, with her friend Neff Davis (the former concierge at the 11 Howard Hotel where Sorokin ran up a $31,000 bill). Sorokin posted this photograph on Instagram of her preparing for a magazine shoot this week Sorokin has also published some prison diary extracts online and is writing a memoir. Her lawyer confirmed that her Netflix contract does bring certain constraints. Sorokin declined to be interviewed for this story. ""Please talk to the global president of Anna Delvey TV,"" she said in an email. This turns out to be Doug Higginbotham, an Emmy-Award-winning filmmaker. He is a freelancer and says he does not condone her crimes. Sorokin contacted him last week, saying a TV crew were being too intrusive in following her around. ""She thought: why don't I just hire a crew myself, so I can control the narrative?"" he says. He has since been documenting her life, as she deals with the paparazzi, goes shopping and visits her parole officer. ""We don't know what we'll do with the footage yet, but she's getting a lot of major offers, so we didn't want to miss anything,"" he says. Allow Twitter content?

Have a good evening. We're going to be finishing our rolling updates soon, but before we go here's the latest coronavirus news from the UK:  And from around the world:  Les and Audrey have been married for 66 years Relatives with loved ones in care homes have been reacting to news that they will be able to makevisits from early March. In England, one designated visitor will be allowed, while in Scotlandtwo will be permitted. Les Wood's wife Audrey, who has vascular dementia, has been in a care home for 14 months. ""We havenât so much as touched fingertips in a year,"" he tells the BBC. He says the care home where his wife lives has been ""very strict right from the start, putting the safety of the residents first"". ""Their rules have normally been more restrictive than the government guidelines for which I have been grateful,"" says Wood, who lives in Deal in Kent. But he's hoping he will be able to visit her next month under the new rules. ""I hope that Audreyâs care home will be able to follow the new guidelines from next month,"" he says. ""If they donât, I will be very disappointed but also supportive. ""Itâs horrendous for me. I feel totally cut off. I barely exist.â Fifty people have been fined for attendingan illegal party in a soundproof room, police say. Class A drugs, birthday cake, beer, a DJ and disco lights were found by officers in a venue in Birmingham on Thursday. West Midlands Police say a member of the public had noticed taxis bringing guests. The suspected organiser was arrested after refusing to give their details to officers and could face a fine of Â£10,000 under coronavirus legislation, police say. This video can not be played Essex lockdown one-man choir of nine singers A musician has used technology to get creative in lockdown and become a one-man, nine-strong choir. Bobby Goulder, 26, from Essex, was commissioned to record The Lord Bless You And Keep You for somebody's memorial and used a self-cloning technique for the video. With social distancing making it difficult for groups to get together, rather than bring a choir together remotely, the baritone decided to sing the piece himself - nine times. Standing in slightly different locations at St Mary's Church in Saffron Walden, he performed a different part in his own arrangement adapted from a composition by John Rutter, before editing the versions together. Posting the final work on social media, Gouldler, a former chorister at the church, said: ""It's still strange seeing nine of myself. I've had lots of lovely messages and a really positive response."" Dr Fauci received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of last year The US top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has explained in an interview why he thinks Israel has been so successful in its vaccination drive. Its unique national circumstances set it up for success, he says. ""I can say without false flattery
that Israel really did it right, but it also had the right sort of ingredients
in its favour: the right size, the right healthcare system - everything was
geared to be successful for what they did, and they did it really very well,""he told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,external. ""To have over 80 in 100 people to receive a shot - the United
States is somewhere around 18, just look at the difference there. Israelâs
health system is quite uniform as a nation - perhaps due to size, location and
history,"" he said. Israel has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million- and about one million people have received two doses. ""The United States - a country that I love - has a different
system,â he added. ""Itâs good in some respects, but when youâre dealing with a
common enemy, you can have multiple ways of doing things and thatâs one of the
reasons we have not been as successful as we could have been thus far."" A mum and daughter have created a free online video series to help children with disabilities ""find a space of calm"" during the lockdowns. Founder of the disability dance charity Flamingo Chicks Katie Sparkes, 40, designed the relaxation videos with her 14-year-old daughter Poppy who has cerebral palsy. Sparkes, from Bristol, said the videos are needed as families don't have access to the special services that they need due to the pandemic. ""At moments of crisis it's a great tool to find those moments of calm,"" she says. The online videos use Makaton so that everyone can join in. Makaton uses signs and symbols to help people who find speaking difficult. This video can not be played Makaton relaxation videos 'a great tool to use' Boris Johnson is expected to announce a ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions in England on Monday. But what's happening in the rest of the UK? The PM saysthe priority is to get pupils back to schoolfrom 8 March. After schools reopen, No 10 says reuniting families and allowing people to have more social contact will be an ""absolute priority"". There is also pressure to reopen pubs, restaurants, shops and the tourism industry, but the government says it will be""led by data, not dates"". The devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds to ease lockdown: Need more information?Here's a full guide to lockdown rules where you live. Fights, Covid-19 outbreaks and alleged abuse have been reported at four west London hotels housing asylum seekers. Asylum seekers were moved to hotels - in Chiswick, Twickenham and Fulham -in response to the coronavirus pandemic. One woman, who spoke to the BBC under the condition of anonymity, said a resident at her hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. She said: ""She caught the virus and she been in hospital for three months and might not survive. ""We haven't been tested regularly in the hotel. The children play with each other. Maybe it can spread. ""We feel it is dangerous. When I hear my family cough, I just pray it's not coronavirus."" Police have not been able to find all the incidents described on their records and the Home Office has refused comment, saying it is not responsible. It directed the BBC to Clearspring, a company that is used by the government to house asylum seekers. Anti-vaccination protesters have gathered across Australia If you're just joining us, here are some of the latest coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world: We also have an update on the UK's vaccination programme. The number of people who have received their first coronavirus vaccine in the UK is 17,247,442. And 604,885 people have also received their second dose. A further 445 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,the government's daily figures show.,external This takes the total number of deaths, within 28 days of a positive Covid test, to 120,365. There were also 10,406 positive cases recorded in the UK in the last 24 hours. The Mona Lisa usually has crowds around it You may be wondering what's been happening inside museums all over the world during the pandemic while lockdowns have been in place. At the Louvre Museum in Paris, which has been closed to visitors for nearly four months, officials have taken the opportunity to carry out long-overdue refurbishments which would not normally have been possible. Some 10 million people come to what is thought to be the world's most visited museum each year, the majority from abroad. But the crowds are now gone and it instead looks like this... An empty Grande Galerie in the Louvre During this quiet time, curators, restorers and workers have been busy cleaning up sculptures, reordering artefacts, checking inventories, reorganising access and carrying out restorations.

Around four million people in the UK suffer from diabetes - including around a million who have not been diagnosed, according to the charity Diabetes UK. And while it's already known that diabetics are more at risk of suffering severe cases of Covid - new evidence suggests the virus could actually be triggering the condition in some patients.

Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The political reality is that Boris Johnson had to offer up
a date for when heâd explain the path out of lockdown in England. There are those on the
Tory backbenches who would not have accepted an open-ended timeline. But the
government would argue that naming 22 February wasnât some
arbitrary effort to buy time, rather a logical choice - one thatâs linked to the
aim of reopening schools two weeks later, while allowing both the lockdown
and vaccine programme to take effect. Regardless of considerations in play, the
long-awaited roadmap does now loom on the very near horizon. Government sources
insist that the details are, even now, still being finalised but with two days
to go a broad plan must now be in place. The government can try to stress
caution or talk about caveats but all the build-up has led to a growing sense
of anticipation. And, for many, that anticipation is linked to a hope that our
daily lives may soon be less limited. Union leaders will present a formal paper to the government as part of their campaign to get support for Eurostar services after the company admitted it is ""fighting for survival"". It comes after officials from the train drivers' union Aslef held a meeting at the Treasury on Friday to argue for jobs and services to be protected as the cross-Channel operator suffers from a fall in passengers because of the coronavirus crisis. Union leaders have beenurging the government to offer its support since last summerwhen The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union called on the transport secretary to intervene as a matter of urgency to prevent job cuts. Eurostar said at the time it was looking at ways to protect itself for the long term by reducing costs across the business, including ""a considered approach to reducing our payroll costs"". Today, Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: ""We are calling on the UK government to intervene to prevent Eurostar going to the wall. ""Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, and Grant Shapps must act now to save this service - for passengers, for the men and women who work on Eurostar, and for Britain and our connection with the continent."" He said train drivers and all the staff who keep our railways running have been instrumental in moving passengers and freight around this country during the pandemic ""So the government must not turn its back on them now,"" he added. Russia says it now has three vaccines against Covid-19 - Sputnik V (pictured), EpiVacCorona and now CoviVac Russia has registered its third Covid-19 vaccine, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has announced. The new vaccine, CoviVac, has been produced by the state-run Chumakov Centre in Moscow, and is due to be introduced in the country by March, though large-scale clinical trials are not yet under way. ""Today, Russia is the only country to have already three vaccines for preventing the coronavirus infection,"" Mishustin said. It's said to use a different method of development from Russia's other vaccines, Sputnik V and EpiVacCorona, using an inactive virus. Russia was the first country to register a vaccine against Covid-19 in Augustlast year. Despite early scepticism over Russia's testing strategy,the effectiveness of Sputnik was later confirmedby the Lancet medical journal, and it has been authorised by more than 20 countries.

Scottish Conservatives shadow health secretary Donald Cameron called on ministers to ensure the guidance is ""clear and practical"" so the return of visitors can ""operate as smoothly and safely as possible"". Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour's shadow health secretary, said the isolation of residents who were in some cases at the end of their lives was a ""human rights scandal"".

Have a good evening. We're going to be finishing our rolling updates soon, but before we go here's the latest coronavirus news from the UK:  And from around the world:  Les and Audrey have been married for 66 years Relatives with loved ones in care homes have been reacting to news that they will be able to makevisits from early March. In England, one designated visitor will be allowed, while in Scotlandtwo will be permitted. Les Wood's wife Audrey, who has vascular dementia, has been in a care home for 14 months. ""We havenât so much as touched fingertips in a year,"" he tells the BBC. He says the care home where his wife lives has been ""very strict right from the start, putting the safety of the residents first"". ""Their rules have normally been more restrictive than the government guidelines for which I have been grateful,"" says Wood, who lives in Deal in Kent. But he's hoping he will be able to visit her next month under the new rules. ""I hope that Audreyâs care home will be able to follow the new guidelines from next month,"" he says. ""If they donât, I will be very disappointed but also supportive. ""Itâs horrendous for me. I feel totally cut off. I barely exist.â Fifty people have been fined for attendingan illegal party in a soundproof room, police say. Class A drugs, birthday cake, beer, a DJ and disco lights were found by officers in a venue in Birmingham on Thursday. West Midlands Police say a member of the public had noticed taxis bringing guests. The suspected organiser was arrested after refusing to give their details to officers and could face a fine of Â£10,000 under coronavirus legislation, police say. This video can not be played Essex lockdown one-man choir of nine singers A musician has used technology to get creative in lockdown and become a one-man, nine-strong choir. Bobby Goulder, 26, from Essex, was commissioned to record The Lord Bless You And Keep You for somebody's memorial and used a self-cloning technique for the video. With social distancing making it difficult for groups to get together, rather than bring a choir together remotely, the baritone decided to sing the piece himself - nine times. Standing in slightly different locations at St Mary's Church in Saffron Walden, he performed a different part in his own arrangement adapted from a composition by John Rutter, before editing the versions together. Posting the final work on social media, Gouldler, a former chorister at the church, said: ""It's still strange seeing nine of myself. I've had lots of lovely messages and a really positive response."" Dr Fauci received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of last year The US top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has explained in an interview why he thinks Israel has been so successful in its vaccination drive. Its unique national circumstances set it up for success, he says. ""I can say without false flattery
that Israel really did it right, but it also had the right sort of ingredients
in its favour: the right size, the right healthcare system - everything was
geared to be successful for what they did, and they did it really very well,""he told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,external. ""To have over 80 in 100 people to receive a shot - the United
States is somewhere around 18, just look at the difference there. Israelâs
health system is quite uniform as a nation - perhaps due to size, location and
history,"" he said. Israel has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million- and about one million people have received two doses. ""The United States - a country that I love - has a different
system,â he added. ""Itâs good in some respects, but when youâre dealing with a
common enemy, you can have multiple ways of doing things and thatâs one of the
reasons we have not been as successful as we could have been thus far."" A mum and daughter have created a free online video series to help children with disabilities ""find a space of calm"" during the lockdowns. Founder of the disability dance charity Flamingo Chicks Katie Sparkes, 40, designed the relaxation videos with her 14-year-old daughter Poppy who has cerebral palsy. Sparkes, from Bristol, said the videos are needed as families don't have access to the special services that they need due to the pandemic. ""At moments of crisis it's a great tool to find those moments of calm,"" she says. The online videos use Makaton so that everyone can join in. Makaton uses signs and symbols to help people who find speaking difficult. This video can not be played Makaton relaxation videos 'a great tool to use' Boris Johnson is expected to announce a ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions in England on Monday. But what's happening in the rest of the UK? The PM saysthe priority is to get pupils back to schoolfrom 8 March. After schools reopen, No 10 says reuniting families and allowing people to have more social contact will be an ""absolute priority"". There is also pressure to reopen pubs, restaurants, shops and the tourism industry, but the government says it will be""led by data, not dates"". The devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds to ease lockdown: Need more information?Here's a full guide to lockdown rules where you live. Fights, Covid-19 outbreaks and alleged abuse have been reported at four west London hotels housing asylum seekers. Asylum seekers were moved to hotels - in Chiswick, Twickenham and Fulham -in response to the coronavirus pandemic. One woman, who spoke to the BBC under the condition of anonymity, said a resident at her hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. She said: ""She caught the virus and she been in hospital for three months and might not survive. ""We haven't been tested regularly in the hotel. The children play with each other. Maybe it can spread. ""We feel it is dangerous. When I hear my family cough, I just pray it's not coronavirus."" Police have not been able to find all the incidents described on their records and the Home Office has refused comment, saying it is not responsible. It directed the BBC to Clearspring, a company that is used by the government to house asylum seekers. Anti-vaccination protesters have gathered across Australia If you're just joining us, here are some of the latest coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world: We also have an update on the UK's vaccination programme.

Union leaders have beenurging the government to offer its support since last summerwhen The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union called on the transport secretary to intervene as a matter of urgency to prevent job cuts. Eurostar said at the time it was looking at ways to protect itself for the long term by reducing costs across the business, including ""a considered approach to reducing our payroll costs"". Today, Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: ""We are calling on the UK government to intervene to prevent Eurostar going to the wall. ""Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, and Grant Shapps must act now to save this service - for passengers, for the men and women who work on Eurostar, and for Britain and our connection with the continent."" He said train drivers and all the staff who keep our railways running have been instrumental in moving passengers and freight around this country during the pandemic ""So the government must not turn its back on them now,"" he added. Russia says it now has three vaccines against Covid-19 - Sputnik V (pictured), EpiVacCorona and now CoviVac Russia has registered its third Covid-19 vaccine, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has announced. The new vaccine, CoviVac, has been produced by the state-run Chumakov Centre in Moscow, and is due to be introduced in the country by March, though large-scale clinical trials are not yet under way. ""Today, Russia is the only country to have already three vaccines for preventing the coronavirus infection,"" Mishustin said. It's said to use a different method of development from Russia's other vaccines, Sputnik V and EpiVacCorona, using an inactive virus. Russia was the first country to register a vaccine against Covid-19 in Augustlast year. Despite early scepticism over Russia's testing strategy,the effectiveness of Sputnik was later confirmedby the Lancet medical journal, and it has been authorised by more than 20 countries.  Cathie Russell has window visits with her mum, Rose Hamilton In Scotland, the news families will be able to make regular indoor visits to older loved ones in care homes from early March has also been welcomed. The Scottish government has confirmedresidents will be allowed two designated visitors. Donald MacAskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said despite the many challenges presented by the pandemic, ""undoubtedly the hardest has been keeping residents apart from family and friends"". He said: ""We commit to working together to overcome any challenges and difficulties we might face and to support those who may still be anxious and fearful, so that together we can ensure that a painful period of separation can be replaced by greater togetherness."" Scottish Conservatives shadow health secretary Donald Cameron called on ministers to ensure the guidance is ""clear and practical"" so the return of visitors can ""operate as smoothly and safely as possible"". Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour's shadow health secretary, said the isolation of residents who were in some cases at the end of their lives was a ""human rights scandal"". She said: ""This is a welcome step in the right direction. Guidance, however, has fallen short before. Too many care providers and public health directors have brushed it aside. This can't happen again."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Ambulance delays led to 'secondary Covid victims'Waiting times outside some hospitals increased over Christmas, with a knock-on effect for 999 call-outs","Ambulances waiting outside busy hospitals over Christmas led to ""secondary Covid victims"", the Royal College of Emergency Medicine has said. Information requests show that the number of hours ambulances spent waiting to offload patients rose by 63% in London and 48% in the West Midlands. BBC News has spoken to the widow of a man who died of a stroke, having waited three hours for an ambulance. The NHS said capacity had been freed up despite increasing Covid-19 infections. NHS England said the number of individual ambulances waiting more than 30 minutes across the whole of England from the end of December to the beginning of February, had fallen. A spokesperson said: ""Despite seeing a significant increase in the number of patients with coronavirus at the end of December, the NHS has worked together to free up capacity and enable quicker patient handovers."" Rose Rwagasore was working as a nurse treating coronavirus at North Middlesex Hospital in north London on New Year's Eve, when her teenage children called her late in the evening to say their father, Robert Wabwire, was unwell, with a sudden headache and vomiting. Despite calling 999, no ambulance had arrived. Increasingly concerned, Rose spoke to her husband on the phone and recognised his speech was slurred, a common warning sign of a stroke. Rose drove home but her husband deteriorated further, and she performed CPR. ""It is literally five minutes to the hospital"", she says. ""But because now he could not move, we couldn't get him in the car."" The first of three ambulances arrived more than three hours after the initial call. The family had rung 999 four times. The desired response time for patients with symptoms of a stroke is 18 minutes. Robert, 48 years old, had died by the time paramedics arrived. Rose says she feels his death could have been prevented. ""I can't really expect that an ambulance can take such a long time,"" she said. ""The children were alone in the house with their father who was unwell."" London 999 calls as high as Covid first wave peak Ambulance wait times in England 'off the scale' England care home residents to get one visitor each Ambulance Trusts record handover times if the wait outside hospital exceeds 30 minutes. BBC News has learned that ambulances outside Robert's local hospital, North Middlesex, spent, on average, double the time waiting during the week he died, compared with the equivalent week the year before. In the week Robert died the wait was 197.8 hours. For the corresponding week in 2019 it was 94.1 hours. In London overall, ambulances waited for 4,164 hours in the two weeks spanning Christmas and New Year - a 63% increase on the 2,550 hours for the same time period in 2019. In the West Midlands, there was a 48% increase on last year - 3,954 hours for the fortnight from 28 December 2020, compared to 2,673 hours for the same time period in 2019. In other parts of England, waiting times showed an improvement on the previous year. Richard Webber, from the College of Paramedics, said handover delays meant patients calling 999 may have to wait longer. BBC News has learned of other serious incidents in December and January: A patient with signs of sepsis and recent abdominal surgery waited for more than six hours A patient had a cardiac arrest and died following seven calls to 111 and 999 and having waited more than four hours for an ambulance A patient with heart palpitations faced a lengthy wait for paramedics and then suffered a heart attack Royal College of Emergency Medicine vice-president Adrian Boyle said:  ""All that's happened is Covid has taken a very fragile system and basically pushed it over the edge. ""The idea that there are patients who have called for help [and] a paramedic has made a judgement that this is a person who is seriously ill, and they get to the hospital and the whole system that's designed to help them is unable to help them...I think that's absolutely ghastly."" The London Ambulance Service said December 2020 was its busiest ever month, and it responded to more emergency calls than during the peak of the first pandemic wave. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it had ""substantially increased the number of staff available to respond to patients"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Covid-19 has put the NHS under acute pressure and our heroic paramedics, nurses and doctors have been doing everything possible to ensure hospitals continue to provide vital services and quality healthcare. ""We recognise the unique challenges facing the NHS and we continue to make sure our health service has the capacity and resources - both financial and practical - it needs to continue to weather the Covid storm.""

Have a good evening. We're going to be finishing our rolling updates soon, but before we go here's the latest coronavirus news from the UK:  And from around the world:  Les and Audrey have been married for 66 years Relatives with loved ones in care homes have been reacting to news that they will be able to makevisits from early March. In England, one designated visitor will be allowed, while in Scotlandtwo will be permitted. Les Wood's wife Audrey, who has vascular dementia, has been in a care home for 14 months. ""We havenât so much as touched fingertips in a year,"" he tells the BBC. He says the care home where his wife lives has been ""very strict right from the start, putting the safety of the residents first"". ""Their rules have normally been more restrictive than the government guidelines for which I have been grateful,"" says Wood, who lives in Deal in Kent. But he's hoping he will be able to visit her next month under the new rules. ""I hope that Audreyâs care home will be able to follow the new guidelines from next month,"" he says. ""If they donât, I will be very disappointed but also supportive. ""Itâs horrendous for me. I feel totally cut off. I barely exist.â Fifty people have been fined for attendingan illegal party in a soundproof room, police say. Class A drugs, birthday cake, beer, a DJ and disco lights were found by officers in a venue in Birmingham on Thursday. West Midlands Police say a member of the public had noticed taxis bringing guests. The suspected organiser was arrested after refusing to give their details to officers and could face a fine of Â£10,000 under coronavirus legislation, police say. This video can not be played Essex lockdown one-man choir of nine singers A musician has used technology to get creative in lockdown and become a one-man, nine-strong choir. Bobby Goulder, 26, from Essex, was commissioned to record The Lord Bless You And Keep You for somebody's memorial and used a self-cloning technique for the video. With social distancing making it difficult for groups to get together, rather than bring a choir together remotely, the baritone decided to sing the piece himself - nine times. Standing in slightly different locations at St Mary's Church in Saffron Walden, he performed a different part in his own arrangement adapted from a composition by John Rutter, before editing the versions together. Posting the final work on social media, Gouldler, a former chorister at the church, said: ""It's still strange seeing nine of myself. I've had lots of lovely messages and a really positive response."" Dr Fauci received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of last year The US top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has explained in an interview why he thinks Israel has been so successful in its vaccination drive. Its unique national circumstances set it up for success, he says. ""I can say without false flattery
that Israel really did it right, but it also had the right sort of ingredients
in its favour: the right size, the right healthcare system - everything was
geared to be successful for what they did, and they did it really very well,""he told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,external. ""To have over 80 in 100 people to receive a shot - the United
States is somewhere around 18, just look at the difference there. Israelâs
health system is quite uniform as a nation - perhaps due to size, location and
history,"" he said. Israel has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million- and about one million people have received two doses. ""The United States - a country that I love - has a different
system,â he added. ""Itâs good in some respects, but when youâre dealing with a
common enemy, you can have multiple ways of doing things and thatâs one of the
reasons we have not been as successful as we could have been thus far."" A mum and daughter have created a free online video series to help children with disabilities ""find a space of calm"" during the lockdowns. Founder of the disability dance charity Flamingo Chicks Katie Sparkes, 40, designed the relaxation videos with her 14-year-old daughter Poppy who has cerebral palsy. Sparkes, from Bristol, said the videos are needed as families don't have access to the special services that they need due to the pandemic. ""At moments of crisis it's a great tool to find those moments of calm,"" she says. The online videos use Makaton so that everyone can join in.

The devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds to ease lockdown: Need more information?Here's a full guide to lockdown rules where you live. Fights, Covid-19 outbreaks and alleged abuse have been reported at four west London hotels housing asylum seekers. Asylum seekers were moved to hotels - in Chiswick, Twickenham and Fulham -in response to the coronavirus pandemic. One woman, who spoke to the BBC under the condition of anonymity, said a resident at her hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. She said: ""She caught the virus and she been in hospital for three months and might not survive. ""We haven't been tested regularly in the hotel. The children play with each other. Maybe it can spread. ""We feel it is dangerous. When I hear my family cough, I just pray it's not coronavirus."" Police have not been able to find all the incidents described on their records and the Home Office has refused comment, saying it is not responsible. It directed the BBC to Clearspring, a company that is used by the government to house asylum seekers. Anti-vaccination protesters have gathered across Australia If you're just joining us, here are some of the latest coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world: We also have an update on the UK's vaccination programme. The number of people who have received their first coronavirus vaccine in the UK is 17,247,442. And 604,885 people have also received their second dose.

There were also 10,406 positive cases recorded in the UK in the last 24 hours. The Mona Lisa usually has crowds around it You may be wondering what's been happening inside museums all over the world during the pandemic while lockdowns have been in place. At the Louvre Museum in Paris, which has been closed to visitors for nearly four months, officials have taken the opportunity to carry out long-overdue refurbishments which would not normally have been possible. Some 10 million people come to what is thought to be the world's most visited museum each year, the majority from abroad. But the crowds are now gone and it instead looks like this... An empty Grande Galerie in the Louvre During this quiet time, curators, restorers and workers have been busy cleaning up sculptures, reordering artefacts, checking inventories, reorganising access and carrying out restorations. ""Weâre taking advantage of the museumâs closure to carry out a number of major works, speed up maintenance operations and start repair works that are difficult to schedule when the museum is operating normally,"" Laurent Le GuÃ©dart, the museum's architectural heritage and gardens director, toldthe Associated Press news agency,external. Around four million people in the UK suffer from diabetes - including around a million who have not been diagnosed, according to the charity Diabetes UK. And while it's already known that diabetics are more at risk of suffering severe cases of Covid - new evidence suggests the virus could actually be triggering the condition in some patients. Jordan Charles went months with undiagnosed diabetes after contracting Covid-19. Here's his story: This video can not be played Paul KirbyBBC News While the streets and tourist sites of Rome and Barcelona came to a standstill under lockdown, a curfew triggered riots in Dutch cities From the first case diagnosed a year ago at a hospital in northern Italy to the empty shops, restaurants and stadiums of Europe's cities, coronavirus has changed the lives of Europeans. Curbs on movement have forced every country and society to adapt its rules and rethink its culture. Italians were initially frightened into uncharacteristic obedience, says BBC Rome correspondent Mark Lowen. They were the first to be crushed by the virus, the first to see intensive care units close to collapse, and friends and family dying. Very widespread respect for restrictions began to change with the second wave, with some protests against renewed lockdowns, given the fear and fatigue. Read about the hard truths and unexpected innovations in a year that changed Europe. Earlier we heard from the co-founder of fast food chain Leon, who warned against extending lockdown. John Vincent says the length of restrictions ""matters hugely"" and ""could cost lives"". Responding to his comments, a government spokesperson said they understood that this is an ""extremely tough time for UK restaurants"". ""We are supporting business with one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth over Â£280bn,"" the spokesperson said. ""As we navigate our way out of lockdown, we will continue to work closely with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic."" The prime minister will set out the roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions on Monday.We've got more on this story here. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The political reality is that Boris Johnson had to offer up
a date for when heâd explain the path out of lockdown in England. There are those on the
Tory backbenches who would not have accepted an open-ended timeline. But the
government would argue that naming 22 February wasnât some
arbitrary effort to buy time, rather a logical choice - one thatâs linked to the
aim of reopening schools two weeks later, while allowing both the lockdown
and vaccine programme to take effect. Regardless of considerations in play, the
long-awaited roadmap does now loom on the very near horizon. Government sources
insist that the details are, even now, still being finalised but with two days
to go a broad plan must now be in place. The government can try to stress
caution or talk about caveats but all the build-up has led to a growing sense
of anticipation. And, for many, that anticipation is linked to a hope that our
daily lives may soon be less limited.

Very widespread respect for restrictions began to change with the second wave, with some protests against renewed lockdowns, given the fear and fatigue. Read about the hard truths and unexpected innovations in a year that changed Europe. Earlier we heard from the co-founder of fast food chain Leon, who warned against extending lockdown. John Vincent says the length of restrictions ""matters hugely"" and ""could cost lives"". Responding to his comments, a government spokesperson said they understood that this is an ""extremely tough time for UK restaurants"". ""We are supporting business with one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth over Â£280bn,"" the spokesperson said. ""As we navigate our way out of lockdown, we will continue to work closely with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic."" The prime minister will set out the roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions on Monday.We've got more on this story here. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The political reality is that Boris Johnson had to offer up
a date for when heâd explain the path out of lockdown in England. There are those on the
Tory backbenches who would not have accepted an open-ended timeline. But the
government would argue that naming 22 February wasnât some
arbitrary effort to buy time, rather a logical choice - one thatâs linked to the
aim of reopening schools two weeks later, while allowing both the lockdown
and vaccine programme to take effect. Regardless of considerations in play, the
long-awaited roadmap does now loom on the very near horizon. Government sources
insist that the details are, even now, still being finalised but with two days
to go a broad plan must now be in place. The government can try to stress
caution or talk about caveats but all the build-up has led to a growing sense
of anticipation. And, for many, that anticipation is linked to a hope that our
daily lives may soon be less limited. Union leaders will present a formal paper to the government as part of their campaign to get support for Eurostar services after the company admitted it is ""fighting for survival"". It comes after officials from the train drivers' union Aslef held a meeting at the Treasury on Friday to argue for jobs and services to be protected as the cross-Channel operator suffers from a fall in passengers because of the coronavirus crisis. Union leaders have beenurging the government to offer its support since last summerwhen The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union called on the transport secretary to intervene as a matter of urgency to prevent job cuts. Eurostar said at the time it was looking at ways to protect itself for the long term by reducing costs across the business, including ""a considered approach to reducing our payroll costs"". Today, Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: ""We are calling on the UK government to intervene to prevent Eurostar going to the wall. ""Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, and Grant Shapps must act now to save this service - for passengers, for the men and women who work on Eurostar, and for Britain and our connection with the continent."" He said train drivers and all the staff who keep our railways running have been instrumental in moving passengers and freight around this country during the pandemic ""So the government must not turn its back on them now,"" he added. Russia says it now has three vaccines against Covid-19 - Sputnik V (pictured), EpiVacCorona and now CoviVac Russia has registered its third Covid-19 vaccine, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has announced. The new vaccine, CoviVac, has been produced by the state-run Chumakov Centre in Moscow, and is due to be introduced in the country by March, though large-scale clinical trials are not yet under way. ""Today, Russia is the only country to have already three vaccines for preventing the coronavirus infection,"" Mishustin said. It's said to use a different method of development from Russia's other vaccines, Sputnik V and EpiVacCorona, using an inactive virus. Russia was the first country to register a vaccine against Covid-19 in Augustlast year. Despite early scepticism over Russia's testing strategy,the effectiveness of Sputnik was later confirmedby the Lancet medical journal, and it has been authorised by more than 20 countries.  Cathie Russell has window visits with her mum, Rose Hamilton In Scotland, the news families will be able to make regular indoor visits to older loved ones in care homes from early March has also been welcomed. The Scottish government has confirmedresidents will be allowed two designated visitors. Donald MacAskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said despite the many challenges presented by the pandemic, ""undoubtedly the hardest has been keeping residents apart from family and friends"". He said: ""We commit to working together to overcome any challenges and difficulties we might face and to support those who may still be anxious and fearful, so that together we can ensure that a painful period of separation can be replaced by greater togetherness."" Scottish Conservatives shadow health secretary Donald Cameron called on ministers to ensure the guidance is ""clear and practical"" so the return of visitors can ""operate as smoothly and safely as possible"". Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour's shadow health secretary, said the isolation of residents who were in some cases at the end of their lives was a ""human rights scandal"". She said: ""This is a welcome step in the right direction. Guidance, however, has fallen short before. Too many care providers and public health directors have brushed it aside.

Have a good evening. We're going to be finishing our rolling updates soon, but before we go here's the latest coronavirus news from the UK:  And from around the world:  Les and Audrey have been married for 66 years Relatives with loved ones in care homes have been reacting to news that they will be able to makevisits from early March. In England, one designated visitor will be allowed, while in Scotlandtwo will be permitted. Les Wood's wife Audrey, who has vascular dementia, has been in a care home for 14 months. ""We havenât so much as touched fingertips in a year,"" he tells the BBC. He says the care home where his wife lives has been ""very strict right from the start, putting the safety of the residents first"". ""Their rules have normally been more restrictive than the government guidelines for which I have been grateful,"" says Wood, who lives in Deal in Kent. But he's hoping he will be able to visit her next month under the new rules. ""I hope that Audreyâs care home will be able to follow the new guidelines from next month,"" he says. ""If they donât, I will be very disappointed but also supportive. ""Itâs horrendous for me. I feel totally cut off. I barely exist.â Fifty people have been fined for attendingan illegal party in a soundproof room, police say. Class A drugs, birthday cake, beer, a DJ and disco lights were found by officers in a venue in Birmingham on Thursday. West Midlands Police say a member of the public had noticed taxis bringing guests. The suspected organiser was arrested after refusing to give their details to officers and could face a fine of Â£10,000 under coronavirus legislation, police say. This video can not be played Essex lockdown one-man choir of nine singers A musician has used technology to get creative in lockdown and become a one-man, nine-strong choir. Bobby Goulder, 26, from Essex, was commissioned to record The Lord Bless You And Keep You for somebody's memorial and used a self-cloning technique for the video. With social distancing making it difficult for groups to get together, rather than bring a choir together remotely, the baritone decided to sing the piece himself - nine times. Standing in slightly different locations at St Mary's Church in Saffron Walden, he performed a different part in his own arrangement adapted from a composition by John Rutter, before editing the versions together. Posting the final work on social media, Gouldler, a former chorister at the church, said: ""It's still strange seeing nine of myself. I've had lots of lovely messages and a really positive response."" Dr Fauci received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of last year The US top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has explained in an interview why he thinks Israel has been so successful in its vaccination drive. Its unique national circumstances set it up for success, he says. ""I can say without false flattery
that Israel really did it right, but it also had the right sort of ingredients
in its favour: the right size, the right healthcare system - everything was
geared to be successful for what they did, and they did it really very well,""he told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,external. ""To have over 80 in 100 people to receive a shot - the United
States is somewhere around 18, just look at the difference there. Israelâs
health system is quite uniform as a nation - perhaps due to size, location and
history,"" he said. Israel has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million- and about one million people have received two doses. ""The United States - a country that I love - has a different
system,â he added. ""Itâs good in some respects, but when youâre dealing with a
common enemy, you can have multiple ways of doing things and thatâs one of the
reasons we have not been as successful as we could have been thus far."" A mum and daughter have created a free online video series to help children with disabilities ""find a space of calm"" during the lockdowns. Founder of the disability dance charity Flamingo Chicks Katie Sparkes, 40, designed the relaxation videos with her 14-year-old daughter Poppy who has cerebral palsy. Sparkes, from Bristol, said the videos are needed as families don't have access to the special services that they need due to the pandemic. ""At moments of crisis it's a great tool to find those moments of calm,"" she says. The online videos use Makaton so that everyone can join in. Makaton uses signs and symbols to help people who find speaking difficult.

But what's happening in the rest of the UK? The PM saysthe priority is to get pupils back to schoolfrom 8 March. After schools reopen, No 10 says reuniting families and allowing people to have more social contact will be an ""absolute priority"". There is also pressure to reopen pubs, restaurants, shops and the tourism industry, but the government says it will be""led by data, not dates"". The devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds to ease lockdown: Need more information?Here's a full guide to lockdown rules where you live. Fights, Covid-19 outbreaks and alleged abuse have been reported at four west London hotels housing asylum seekers. Asylum seekers were moved to hotels - in Chiswick, Twickenham and Fulham -in response to the coronavirus pandemic. One woman, who spoke to the BBC under the condition of anonymity, said a resident at her hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. She said: ""She caught the virus and she been in hospital for three months and might not survive. ""We haven't been tested regularly in the hotel. The children play with each other. Maybe it can spread. ""We feel it is dangerous. When I hear my family cough, I just pray it's not coronavirus."" Police have not been able to find all the incidents described on their records and the Home Office has refused comment, saying it is not responsible. It directed the BBC to Clearspring, a company that is used by the government to house asylum seekers. Anti-vaccination protesters have gathered across Australia If you're just joining us, here are some of the latest coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world: We also have an update on the UK's vaccination programme.

The Mona Lisa usually has crowds around it You may be wondering what's been happening inside museums all over the world during the pandemic while lockdowns have been in place. At the Louvre Museum in Paris, which has been closed to visitors for nearly four months, officials have taken the opportunity to carry out long-overdue refurbishments which would not normally have been possible. Some 10 million people come to what is thought to be the world's most visited museum each year, the majority from abroad. But the crowds are now gone and it instead looks like this... An empty Grande Galerie in the Louvre During this quiet time, curators, restorers and workers have been busy cleaning up sculptures, reordering artefacts, checking inventories, reorganising access and carrying out restorations. ""Weâre taking advantage of the museumâs closure to carry out a number of major works, speed up maintenance operations and start repair works that are difficult to schedule when the museum is operating normally,"" Laurent Le GuÃ©dart, the museum's architectural heritage and gardens director, toldthe Associated Press news agency,external. Around four million people in the UK suffer from diabetes - including around a million who have not been diagnosed, according to the charity Diabetes UK.

Despite early scepticism over Russia's testing strategy,the effectiveness of Sputnik was later confirmedby the Lancet medical journal, and it has been authorised by more than 20 countries.  Cathie Russell has window visits with her mum, Rose Hamilton In Scotland, the news families will be able to make regular indoor visits to older loved ones in care homes from early March has also been welcomed. The Scottish government has confirmedresidents will be allowed two designated visitors. Donald MacAskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said despite the many challenges presented by the pandemic, ""undoubtedly the hardest has been keeping residents apart from family and friends"". He said: ""We commit to working together to overcome any challenges and difficulties we might face and to support those who may still be anxious and fearful, so that together we can ensure that a painful period of separation can be replaced by greater togetherness."" Scottish Conservatives shadow health secretary Donald Cameron called on ministers to ensure the guidance is ""clear and practical"" so the return of visitors can ""operate as smoothly and safely as possible"". Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour's shadow health secretary, said the isolation of residents who were in some cases at the end of their lives was a ""human rights scandal"". She said: ""This is a welcome step in the right direction. Guidance, however, has fallen short before. Too many care providers and public health directors have brushed it aside. This can't happen again."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Ambulance delays led to 'secondary Covid victims'Waiting times outside some hospitals increased over Christmas, with a knock-on effect for 999 call-outsHealth","Ambulances waiting outside busy hospitals over Christmas led to ""secondary Covid victims"", the Royal College of Emergency Medicine has said. Information requests show that the number of hours ambulances spent waiting to offload patients rose by 63% in London and 48% in the West Midlands. BBC News has spoken to the widow of a man who died of a stroke, having waited three hours for an ambulance. The NHS said capacity had been freed up despite increasing Covid-19 infections. NHS England said the number of individual ambulances waiting more than 30 minutes across the whole of England from the end of December to the beginning of February, had fallen. A spokesperson said: ""Despite seeing a significant increase in the number of patients with coronavirus at the end of December, the NHS has worked together to free up capacity and enable quicker patient handovers."" Rose Rwagasore was working as a nurse treating coronavirus at North Middlesex Hospital in north London on New Year's Eve, when her teenage children called her late in the evening to say their father, Robert Wabwire, was unwell, with a sudden headache and vomiting. Despite calling 999, no ambulance had arrived. Increasingly concerned, Rose spoke to her husband on the phone and recognised his speech was slurred, a common warning sign of a stroke. Rose drove home but her husband deteriorated further, and she performed CPR. ""It is literally five minutes to the hospital"", she says. ""But because now he could not move, we couldn't get him in the car."" The first of three ambulances arrived more than three hours after the initial call. The family had rung 999 four times. The desired response time for patients with symptoms of a stroke is 18 minutes. Robert, 48 years old, had died by the time paramedics arrived. Rose says she feels his death could have been prevented. ""I can't really expect that an ambulance can take such a long time,"" she said. ""The children were alone in the house with their father who was unwell."" London 999 calls as high as Covid first wave peak Ambulance wait times in England 'off the scale' England care home residents to get one visitor each Ambulance Trusts record handover times if the wait outside hospital exceeds 30 minutes. BBC News has learned that ambulances outside Robert's local hospital, North Middlesex, spent, on average, double the time waiting during the week he died, compared with the equivalent week the year before. In the week Robert died the wait was 197.8 hours. For the corresponding week in 2019 it was 94.1 hours. In London overall, ambulances waited for 4,164 hours in the two weeks spanning Christmas and New Year - a 63% increase on the 2,550 hours for the same time period in 2019. In the West Midlands, there was a 48% increase on last year - 3,954 hours for the fortnight from 28 December 2020, compared to 2,673 hours for the same time period in 2019. In other parts of England, waiting times showed an improvement on the previous year. Richard Webber, from the College of Paramedics, said handover delays meant patients calling 999 may have to wait longer. BBC News has learned of other serious incidents in December and January: A patient with signs of sepsis and recent abdominal surgery waited for more than six hours A patient had a cardiac arrest and died following seven calls to 111 and 999 and having waited more than four hours for an ambulance A patient with heart palpitations faced a lengthy wait for paramedics and then suffered a heart attack Royal College of Emergency Medicine vice-president Adrian Boyle said:  ""All that's happened is Covid has taken a very fragile system and basically pushed it over the edge. ""The idea that there are patients who have called for help [and] a paramedic has made a judgement that this is a person who is seriously ill, and they get to the hospital and the whole system that's designed to help them is unable to help them...I think that's absolutely ghastly."" The London Ambulance Service said December 2020 was its busiest ever month, and it responded to more emergency calls than during the peak of the first pandemic wave. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it had ""substantially increased the number of staff available to respond to patients"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Covid-19 has put the NHS under acute pressure and our heroic paramedics, nurses and doctors have been doing everything possible to ensure hospitals continue to provide vital services and quality healthcare. ""We recognise the unique challenges facing the NHS and we continue to make sure our health service has the capacity and resources - both financial and practical - it needs to continue to weather the Covid storm.""

"Send vaccines to poorer nations now, WTO tells UKThe head of the World Trade Organization says it is in richer countries' interest to share vaccines.UK","The UK should donate vaccines to developing countries now rather than waiting until it has a surplus, the new head of the World Trade Organization has told the BBC. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said it was ""in the interest"" of wealthy countries that all nations access vaccines. It comes after PM Boris Johnsonsaid the UK would donate most of its surplus supplyto poorer nations. On Friday, G7 leaders pledged to intensify co-operation on Covid-19. They agreed to increase their contribution to the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative, which is aiming to get at least 1.3 billion doses to vulnerable populations worldwide in the coming months. Addressing the UK government's plans to donate its surplus vaccines to the developing world, Ms Okonjo-Iweala told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""welcome"" - but cautioned against delay. ""I don't think we should wait to get surplus when other people have been served,"" she said. ""I think that any donations that are coming must come now. ""The reason is very simple. It's in the interest of rich countries as well as poor countries to have equitable access."" G7 pledge billions for Covax vaccine scheme The scheme to share unused vaccines with other countries The new WTO chief cited a study by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), which outlined the economic case for global vaccinations. The ICC-commissioned research found that the world stood to lose as much as $9tn (Â£6.4tn) in GDP if, by the middle of the year, rich countries have vaccinated half their populations and poor countries have not vaccinated theirs, Ms Okonjo-Iweala said. ""Half of that cost will be borne by rich countries,"" she said. ""So we need to understand that it's in the self-interest of both rich and poor to have equitable access to vaccines otherwise all counties lose; all people lose."" Earlier this month, Ms Okonjo-Iweala was named as the WTO's first female and first African director-general G7 leaders said in a joint statement released after the virtual summit on Friday that they have raised their overall commitment to the Covax scheme to $7.5bn (Â£5.3bn). The leaders' commitments came just days after UN secretary general AntÃ³nio Guterres slated the distribution of vaccines so far as ""wildly uneven and unfair"". New WTO boss warns against vaccine nationalism How many Covid vaccines has my country given? Just 10 countries have administered 75% of all vaccinations worldwide, while 130 countries had not yet received a single dose, he said. Manufacturing is the biggest constraint in providing vaccines to people quickly, Ms Okonjo-Iweala said. She encouraged manufacturing companies to issue more licenses in developing countries, so a larger volume of doses could be produced across poorer regions. VACCINE:When will I get the jab?

HSBC fraud helpline's 20-hour wait 'disgraceful'The daughter of a fraud victim says it took hours to speak to staff after thousands were stolen from her father's bank account.Business,"Lynn, pictured here with her father Richard, described the wait time on HSBC's fraud helpline as ""disgraceful"" The daughter of a fraud victim has branded HSBC's dedicated fraud helpline a ""disgrace"" after it took 20 hours of waiting on hold to get help. Lynn Edmonds' father, Richard, had Â£8,500 stolen by criminals who tricked him to gain access to his HSBC account. As soon as he realised what had happened he called Lynn for help and their wait began. HSBC has apologised for Richard's prolonged wait and also agreed to refund the money stolen. ""In my opinion it's disgraceful the way HSBC's 24/7 fraud helpline is ran, there's no excuse for it. ""Not only is it appalling but it's also very stressful. ""Because [of Covid] we can't be near him at all, and we can't physically go and help him, we feel incredibly stressed by this and all the time we can't get through we're worried his money is being stolen."" HSBC said: ""Like others in the industry, we are currently receiving higher than normal reports of fraud. ""We are conscious of extended call waiting times, and while we have recently increased the size of the team, we are in the process of bringing on board new additional customer-facing colleagues which will cut waiting times."" To try to get an idea of how widespread the problem of long wait times on fraud helplines is BBC Radio 4's Money Box conducted a totally unscientific experiment. We called each of the big five High Street banks (HSBC, Santander, Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds), as well as Nationwide Building Society, at just after 09:00 on a weekday. Each call was answered in minutes - except our call to HSBC. In total we spent more than seven hours on hold to HSBC's dedicated scam helpline on three phone calls. Each one ended when we were cut off without being able to speak to anyone. Victims typically lose Â£45,000 each owing to investment scams Romance fraud on rise in coronavirus lockdown HSBC sent us a second statement: ""Customers who suspect fraud or wish to dispute a transaction should call the number on the back of their card, which is the best and fastest number to report the fraud. ""While we are seeing higher than normal levels of traffic to our contact centres as a result of Covid-19, customers should expect to be able to get through to us within a few minutes, which is within industry guidelines."" There are two numbers on the back of my HSBC card as it happens. One labelled as ""enquiries"" and another labelled as ""24-hour lost or stolen"". Neither of which are the same as the number scam victims are directed to call on the HSBC website - the number where Richard's family and I saw those terrible wait times. And in a third statement, HSBC said it's looking to update its website advice and that any delays for customers who are fraud victims will be taken into account: ""We are reviewing the wording of our website to be more clear about which numbers to call. ""Any delay in getting through on this number would of course be taken into account in any subsequent investigation into a scam."" Altogether Richard, his daughter, Lynn, and son-in-law, Steven, spent 20 hours on hold to HSBC before they got to speak to anyone The delay suffered by Richard and his family is all the more worrying because to be able to effectively tackle crime likeauthorised push payment fraud,external, when often vulnerable people are tricked into transferring money to criminals' accounts, time is critical. Detective Sergeant Marc Cananur, a specialist fraud investigator with Kent Police, said: ""In the event someone suspects they might have been a victim of fraud it really is of vital importance that they engage not only with law enforcement but their bank. ""It's of vital importance... to ensure funds don't fall into the hands of criminal gangs. He said with any investigation, time is of the essence. ""The sooner a bank and police are aware of a crime the sooner both can react... and attempt to claw back funds to the original victim.""

Have a good evening. We're going to be finishing our rolling updates soon, but before we go here's the latest coronavirus news from the UK:  And from around the world:  Les and Audrey have been married for 66 years Relatives with loved ones in care homes have been reacting to news that they will be able to makevisits from early March. In England, one designated visitor will be allowed, while in Scotlandtwo will be permitted. Les Wood's wife Audrey, who has vascular dementia, has been in a care home for 14 months. ""We havenât so much as touched fingertips in a year,"" he tells the BBC. He says the care home where his wife lives has been ""very strict right from the start, putting the safety of the residents first"". ""Their rules have normally been more restrictive than the government guidelines for which I have been grateful,"" says Wood, who lives in Deal in Kent. But he's hoping he will be able to visit her next month under the new rules. ""I hope that Audreyâs care home will be able to follow the new guidelines from next month,"" he says. ""If they donât, I will be very disappointed but also supportive. ""Itâs horrendous for me. I feel totally cut off. I barely exist.â Fifty people have been fined for attendingan illegal party in a soundproof room, police say. Class A drugs, birthday cake, beer, a DJ and disco lights were found by officers in a venue in Birmingham on Thursday. West Midlands Police say a member of the public had noticed taxis bringing guests. The suspected organiser was arrested after refusing to give their details to officers and could face a fine of Â£10,000 under coronavirus legislation, police say. This video can not be played Essex lockdown one-man choir of nine singers A musician has used technology to get creative in lockdown and become a one-man, nine-strong choir. Bobby Goulder, 26, from Essex, was commissioned to record The Lord Bless You And Keep You for somebody's memorial and used a self-cloning technique for the video. With social distancing making it difficult for groups to get together, rather than bring a choir together remotely, the baritone decided to sing the piece himself - nine times. Standing in slightly different locations at St Mary's Church in Saffron Walden, he performed a different part in his own arrangement adapted from a composition by John Rutter, before editing the versions together. Posting the final work on social media, Gouldler, a former chorister at the church, said: ""It's still strange seeing nine of myself. I've had lots of lovely messages and a really positive response."" Dr Fauci received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of last year The US top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has explained in an interview why he thinks Israel has been so successful in its vaccination drive. Its unique national circumstances set it up for success, he says. ""I can say without false flattery
that Israel really did it right, but it also had the right sort of ingredients
in its favour: the right size, the right healthcare system - everything was
geared to be successful for what they did, and they did it really very well,""he told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,external. ""To have over 80 in 100 people to receive a shot - the United
States is somewhere around 18, just look at the difference there. Israelâs
health system is quite uniform as a nation - perhaps due to size, location and
history,"" he said. Israel has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million- and about one million people have received two doses. ""The United States - a country that I love - has a different
system,â he added. ""Itâs good in some respects, but when youâre dealing with a
common enemy, you can have multiple ways of doing things and thatâs one of the
reasons we have not been as successful as we could have been thus far."" A mum and daughter have created a free online video series to help children with disabilities ""find a space of calm"" during the lockdowns. Founder of the disability dance charity Flamingo Chicks Katie Sparkes, 40, designed the relaxation videos with her 14-year-old daughter Poppy who has cerebral palsy. Sparkes, from Bristol, said the videos are needed as families don't have access to the special services that they need due to the pandemic. ""At moments of crisis it's a great tool to find those moments of calm,"" she says. The online videos use Makaton so that everyone can join in. Makaton uses signs and symbols to help people who find speaking difficult. This video can not be played Makaton relaxation videos 'a great tool to use' Boris Johnson is expected to announce a ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions in England on Monday. But what's happening in the rest of the UK? The PM saysthe priority is to get pupils back to schoolfrom 8 March. After schools reopen, No 10 says reuniting families and allowing people to have more social contact will be an ""absolute priority"". There is also pressure to reopen pubs, restaurants, shops and the tourism industry, but the government says it will be""led by data, not dates"". The devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds to ease lockdown: Need more information?Here's a full guide to lockdown rules where you live. Fights, Covid-19 outbreaks and alleged abuse have been reported at four west London hotels housing asylum seekers. Asylum seekers were moved to hotels - in Chiswick, Twickenham and Fulham -in response to the coronavirus pandemic. One woman, who spoke to the BBC under the condition of anonymity, said a resident at her hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. She said: ""She caught the virus and she been in hospital for three months and might not survive. ""We haven't been tested regularly in the hotel. The children play with each other. Maybe it can spread. ""We feel it is dangerous. When I hear my family cough, I just pray it's not coronavirus."" Police have not been able to find all the incidents described on their records and the Home Office has refused comment, saying it is not responsible. It directed the BBC to Clearspring, a company that is used by the government to house asylum seekers. Anti-vaccination protesters have gathered across Australia If you're just joining us, here are some of the latest coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world: We also have an update on the UK's vaccination programme. The number of people who have received their first coronavirus vaccine in the UK is 17,247,442. And 604,885 people have also received their second dose. A further 445 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,the government's daily figures show.,external This takes the total number of deaths, within 28 days of a positive Covid test, to 120,365. There were also 10,406 positive cases recorded in the UK in the last 24 hours. The Mona Lisa usually has crowds around it You may be wondering what's been happening inside museums all over the world during the pandemic while lockdowns have been in place. At the Louvre Museum in Paris, which has been closed to visitors for nearly four months, officials have taken the opportunity to carry out long-overdue refurbishments which would not normally have been possible. Some 10 million people come to what is thought to be the world's most visited museum each year, the majority from abroad. But the crowds are now gone and it instead looks like this... An empty Grande Galerie in the Louvre During this quiet time, curators, restorers and workers have been busy cleaning up sculptures, reordering artefacts, checking inventories, reorganising access and carrying out restorations. ""Weâre taking advantage of the museumâs closure to carry out a number of major works, speed up maintenance operations and start repair works that are difficult to schedule when the museum is operating normally,"" Laurent Le GuÃ©dart, the museum's architectural heritage and gardens director, toldthe Associated Press news agency,external. Around four million people in the UK suffer from diabetes - including around a million who have not been diagnosed, according to the charity Diabetes UK. And while it's already known that diabetics are more at risk of suffering severe cases of Covid - new evidence suggests the virus could actually be triggering the condition in some patients. Jordan Charles went months with undiagnosed diabetes after contracting Covid-19. Here's his story: This video can not be played Paul KirbyBBC News While the streets and tourist sites of Rome and Barcelona came to a standstill under lockdown, a curfew triggered riots in Dutch cities From the first case diagnosed a year ago at a hospital in northern Italy to the empty shops, restaurants and stadiums of Europe's cities, coronavirus has changed the lives of Europeans. Curbs on movement have forced every country and society to adapt its rules and rethink its culture. Italians were initially frightened into uncharacteristic obedience, says BBC Rome correspondent Mark Lowen. They were the first to be crushed by the virus, the first to see intensive care units close to collapse, and friends and family dying. Very widespread respect for restrictions began to change with the second wave, with some protests against renewed lockdowns, given the fear and fatigue. Read about the hard truths and unexpected innovations in a year that changed Europe. Earlier we heard from the co-founder of fast food chain Leon, who warned against extending lockdown. John Vincent says the length of restrictions ""matters hugely"" and ""could cost lives"". Responding to his comments, a government spokesperson said they understood that this is an ""extremely tough time for UK restaurants"". ""We are supporting business with one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth over Â£280bn,"" the spokesperson said. ""As we navigate our way out of lockdown, we will continue to work closely with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic."" The prime minister will set out the roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions on Monday.We've got more on this story here. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The political reality is that Boris Johnson had to offer up
a date for when heâd explain the path out of lockdown in England. There are those on the
Tory backbenches who would not have accepted an open-ended timeline. But the
government would argue that naming 22 February wasnât some
arbitrary effort to buy time, rather a logical choice - one thatâs linked to the
aim of reopening schools two weeks later, while allowing both the lockdown
and vaccine programme to take effect. Regardless of considerations in play, the
long-awaited roadmap does now loom on the very near horizon. Government sources
insist that the details are, even now, still being finalised but with two days
to go a broad plan must now be in place. The government can try to stress
caution or talk about caveats but all the build-up has led to a growing sense
of anticipation. And, for many, that anticipation is linked to a hope that our
daily lives may soon be less limited. Union leaders will present a formal paper to the government as part of their campaign to get support for Eurostar services after the company admitted it is ""fighting for survival"". It comes after officials from the train drivers' union Aslef held a meeting at the Treasury on Friday to argue for jobs and services to be protected as the cross-Channel operator suffers from a fall in passengers because of the coronavirus crisis. Union leaders have beenurging the government to offer its support since last summerwhen The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union called on the transport secretary to intervene as a matter of urgency to prevent job cuts. Eurostar said at the time it was looking at ways to protect itself for the long term by reducing costs across the business, including ""a considered approach to reducing our payroll costs"". Today, Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: ""We are calling on the UK government to intervene to prevent Eurostar going to the wall. ""Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, and Grant Shapps must act now to save this service - for passengers, for the men and women who work on Eurostar, and for Britain and our connection with the continent."" He said train drivers and all the staff who keep our railways running have been instrumental in moving passengers and freight around this country during the pandemic ""So the government must not turn its back on them now,"" he added. Russia says it now has three vaccines against Covid-19 - Sputnik V (pictured), EpiVacCorona and now CoviVac Russia has registered its third Covid-19 vaccine, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has announced. The new vaccine, CoviVac, has been produced by the state-run Chumakov Centre in Moscow, and is due to be introduced in the country by March, though large-scale clinical trials are not yet under way. ""Today, Russia is the only country to have already three vaccines for preventing the coronavirus infection,"" Mishustin said. It's said to use a different method of development from Russia's other vaccines, Sputnik V and EpiVacCorona, using an inactive virus. Russia was the first country to register a vaccine against Covid-19 in Augustlast year. Despite early scepticism over Russia's testing strategy,the effectiveness of Sputnik was later confirmedby the Lancet medical journal, and it has been authorised by more than 20 countries.  Cathie Russell has window visits with her mum, Rose Hamilton In Scotland, the news families will be able to make regular indoor visits to older loved ones in care homes from early March has also been welcomed. The Scottish government has confirmedresidents will be allowed two designated visitors. Donald MacAskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said despite the many challenges presented by the pandemic, ""undoubtedly the hardest has been keeping residents apart from family and friends"". He said: ""We commit to working together to overcome any challenges and difficulties we might face and to support those who may still be anxious and fearful, so that together we can ensure that a painful period of separation can be replaced by greater togetherness."" Scottish Conservatives shadow health secretary Donald Cameron called on ministers to ensure the guidance is ""clear and practical"" so the return of visitors can ""operate as smoothly and safely as possible"". Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour's shadow health secretary, said the isolation of residents who were in some cases at the end of their lives was a ""human rights scandal"". She said: ""This is a welcome step in the right direction. Guidance, however, has fallen short before. Too many care providers and public health directors have brushed it aside.

Have a good evening. We're going to be finishing our rolling updates soon, but before we go here's the latest coronavirus news from the UK:  And from around the world:  Les and Audrey have been married for 66 years Relatives with loved ones in care homes have been reacting to news that they will be able to makevisits from early March. In England, one designated visitor will be allowed, while in Scotlandtwo will be permitted. Les Wood's wife Audrey, who has vascular dementia, has been in a care home for 14 months. ""We havenât so much as touched fingertips in a year,"" he tells the BBC. He says the care home where his wife lives has been ""very strict right from the start, putting the safety of the residents first"". ""Their rules have normally been more restrictive than the government guidelines for which I have been grateful,"" says Wood, who lives in Deal in Kent. But he's hoping he will be able to visit her next month under the new rules. ""I hope that Audreyâs care home will be able to follow the new guidelines from next month,"" he says. ""If they donât, I will be very disappointed but also supportive. ""Itâs horrendous for me. I feel totally cut off. I barely exist.â Fifty people have been fined for attendingan illegal party in a soundproof room, police say. Class A drugs, birthday cake, beer, a DJ and disco lights were found by officers in a venue in Birmingham on Thursday. West Midlands Police say a member of the public had noticed taxis bringing guests. The suspected organiser was arrested after refusing to give their details to officers and could face a fine of Â£10,000 under coronavirus legislation, police say. This video can not be played Essex lockdown one-man choir of nine singers A musician has used technology to get creative in lockdown and become a one-man, nine-strong choir. Bobby Goulder, 26, from Essex, was commissioned to record The Lord Bless You And Keep You for somebody's memorial and used a self-cloning technique for the video. With social distancing making it difficult for groups to get together, rather than bring a choir together remotely, the baritone decided to sing the piece himself - nine times. Standing in slightly different locations at St Mary's Church in Saffron Walden, he performed a different part in his own arrangement adapted from a composition by John Rutter, before editing the versions together. Posting the final work on social media, Gouldler, a former chorister at the church, said: ""It's still strange seeing nine of myself. I've had lots of lovely messages and a really positive response."" Dr Fauci received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of last year The US top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has explained in an interview why he thinks Israel has been so successful in its vaccination drive. Its unique national circumstances set it up for success, he says. ""I can say without false flattery
that Israel really did it right, but it also had the right sort of ingredients
in its favour: the right size, the right healthcare system - everything was
geared to be successful for what they did, and they did it really very well,""he told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,external. ""To have over 80 in 100 people to receive a shot - the United
States is somewhere around 18, just look at the difference there. Israelâs
health system is quite uniform as a nation - perhaps due to size, location and
history,"" he said. Israel has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million- and about one million people have received two doses. ""The United States - a country that I love - has a different
system,â he added. ""Itâs good in some respects, but when youâre dealing with a
common enemy, you can have multiple ways of doing things and thatâs one of the
reasons we have not been as successful as we could have been thus far."" A mum and daughter have created a free online video series to help children with disabilities ""find a space of calm"" during the lockdowns. Founder of the disability dance charity Flamingo Chicks Katie Sparkes, 40, designed the relaxation videos with her 14-year-old daughter Poppy who has cerebral palsy. Sparkes, from Bristol, said the videos are needed as families don't have access to the special services that they need due to the pandemic. ""At moments of crisis it's a great tool to find those moments of calm,"" she says. The online videos use Makaton so that everyone can join in. Makaton uses signs and symbols to help people who find speaking difficult. This video can not be played Makaton relaxation videos 'a great tool to use' Boris Johnson is expected to announce a ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions in England on Monday. But what's happening in the rest of the UK? The PM saysthe priority is to get pupils back to schoolfrom 8 March. After schools reopen, No 10 says reuniting families and allowing people to have more social contact will be an ""absolute priority"". There is also pressure to reopen pubs, restaurants, shops and the tourism industry, but the government says it will be""led by data, not dates"". The devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds to ease lockdown: Need more information?Here's a full guide to lockdown rules where you live. Fights, Covid-19 outbreaks and alleged abuse have been reported at four west London hotels housing asylum seekers. Asylum seekers were moved to hotels - in Chiswick, Twickenham and Fulham -in response to the coronavirus pandemic. One woman, who spoke to the BBC under the condition of anonymity, said a resident at her hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. She said: ""She caught the virus and she been in hospital for three months and might not survive. ""We haven't been tested regularly in the hotel. The children play with each other. Maybe it can spread. ""We feel it is dangerous. When I hear my family cough, I just pray it's not coronavirus."" Police have not been able to find all the incidents described on their records and the Home Office has refused comment, saying it is not responsible. It directed the BBC to Clearspring, a company that is used by the government to house asylum seekers. Anti-vaccination protesters have gathered across Australia If you're just joining us, here are some of the latest coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world: We also have an update on the UK's vaccination programme. The number of people who have received their first coronavirus vaccine in the UK is 17,247,442. And 604,885 people have also received their second dose. A further 445 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,the government's daily figures show.,external This takes the total number of deaths, within 28 days of a positive Covid test, to 120,365. There were also 10,406 positive cases recorded in the UK in the last 24 hours. The Mona Lisa usually has crowds around it You may be wondering what's been happening inside museums all over the world during the pandemic while lockdowns have been in place. At the Louvre Museum in Paris, which has been closed to visitors for nearly four months, officials have taken the opportunity to carry out long-overdue refurbishments which would not normally have been possible. Some 10 million people come to what is thought to be the world's most visited museum each year, the majority from abroad. But the crowds are now gone and it instead looks like this... An empty Grande Galerie in the Louvre During this quiet time, curators, restorers and workers have been busy cleaning up sculptures, reordering artefacts, checking inventories, reorganising access and carrying out restorations. ""Weâre taking advantage of the museumâs closure to carry out a number of major works, speed up maintenance operations and start repair works that are difficult to schedule when the museum is operating normally,"" Laurent Le GuÃ©dart, the museum's architectural heritage and gardens director, toldthe Associated Press news agency,external.

The new vaccine, CoviVac, has been produced by the state-run Chumakov Centre in Moscow, and is due to be introduced in the country by March, though large-scale clinical trials are not yet under way. ""Today, Russia is the only country to have already three vaccines for preventing the coronavirus infection,"" Mishustin said. It's said to use a different method of development from Russia's other vaccines, Sputnik V and EpiVacCorona, using an inactive virus. Russia was the first country to register a vaccine against Covid-19 in Augustlast year. Despite early scepticism over Russia's testing strategy,the effectiveness of Sputnik was later confirmedby the Lancet medical journal, and it has been authorised by more than 20 countries.

Have a good evening. We're going to be finishing our rolling updates soon, but before we go here's the latest coronavirus news from the UK:  And from around the world:  Les and Audrey have been married for 66 years Relatives with loved ones in care homes have been reacting to news that they will be able to makevisits from early March. In England, one designated visitor will be allowed, while in Scotlandtwo will be permitted. Les Wood's wife Audrey, who has vascular dementia, has been in a care home for 14 months. ""We havenât so much as touched fingertips in a year,"" he tells the BBC. He says the care home where his wife lives has been ""very strict right from the start, putting the safety of the residents first"". ""Their rules have normally been more restrictive than the government guidelines for which I have been grateful,"" says Wood, who lives in Deal in Kent. But he's hoping he will be able to visit her next month under the new rules. ""I hope that Audreyâs care home will be able to follow the new guidelines from next month,"" he says. ""If they donât, I will be very disappointed but also supportive. ""Itâs horrendous for me. I feel totally cut off. I barely exist.â Fifty people have been fined for attendingan illegal party in a soundproof room, police say. Class A drugs, birthday cake, beer, a DJ and disco lights were found by officers in a venue in Birmingham on Thursday. West Midlands Police say a member of the public had noticed taxis bringing guests. The suspected organiser was arrested after refusing to give their details to officers and could face a fine of Â£10,000 under coronavirus legislation, police say. This video can not be played Essex lockdown one-man choir of nine singers A musician has used technology to get creative in lockdown and become a one-man, nine-strong choir. Bobby Goulder, 26, from Essex, was commissioned to record The Lord Bless You And Keep You for somebody's memorial and used a self-cloning technique for the video. With social distancing making it difficult for groups to get together, rather than bring a choir together remotely, the baritone decided to sing the piece himself - nine times. Standing in slightly different locations at St Mary's Church in Saffron Walden, he performed a different part in his own arrangement adapted from a composition by John Rutter, before editing the versions together. Posting the final work on social media, Gouldler, a former chorister at the church, said: ""It's still strange seeing nine of myself. I've had lots of lovely messages and a really positive response."" Dr Fauci received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of last year The US top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has explained in an interview why he thinks Israel has been so successful in its vaccination drive. Its unique national circumstances set it up for success, he says. ""I can say without false flattery
that Israel really did it right, but it also had the right sort of ingredients
in its favour: the right size, the right healthcare system - everything was
geared to be successful for what they did, and they did it really very well,""he told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,external. ""To have over 80 in 100 people to receive a shot - the United
States is somewhere around 18, just look at the difference there. Israelâs
health system is quite uniform as a nation - perhaps due to size, location and
history,"" he said. Israel has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million- and about one million people have received two doses. ""The United States - a country that I love - has a different
system,â he added. ""Itâs good in some respects, but when youâre dealing with a
common enemy, you can have multiple ways of doing things and thatâs one of the
reasons we have not been as successful as we could have been thus far."" A mum and daughter have created a free online video series to help children with disabilities ""find a space of calm"" during the lockdowns. Founder of the disability dance charity Flamingo Chicks Katie Sparkes, 40, designed the relaxation videos with her 14-year-old daughter Poppy who has cerebral palsy. Sparkes, from Bristol, said the videos are needed as families don't have access to the special services that they need due to the pandemic. ""At moments of crisis it's a great tool to find those moments of calm,"" she says. The online videos use Makaton so that everyone can join in. Makaton uses signs and symbols to help people who find speaking difficult. This video can not be played Makaton relaxation videos 'a great tool to use' Boris Johnson is expected to announce a ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions in England on Monday. But what's happening in the rest of the UK? The PM saysthe priority is to get pupils back to schoolfrom 8 March. After schools reopen, No 10 says reuniting families and allowing people to have more social contact will be an ""absolute priority"". There is also pressure to reopen pubs, restaurants, shops and the tourism industry, but the government says it will be""led by data, not dates"". The devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds to ease lockdown: Need more information?Here's a full guide to lockdown rules where you live. Fights, Covid-19 outbreaks and alleged abuse have been reported at four west London hotels housing asylum seekers. Asylum seekers were moved to hotels - in Chiswick, Twickenham and Fulham -in response to the coronavirus pandemic. One woman, who spoke to the BBC under the condition of anonymity, said a resident at her hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. She said: ""She caught the virus and she been in hospital for three months and might not survive. ""We haven't been tested regularly in the hotel. The children play with each other. Maybe it can spread. ""We feel it is dangerous. When I hear my family cough, I just pray it's not coronavirus."" Police have not been able to find all the incidents described on their records and the Home Office has refused comment, saying it is not responsible. It directed the BBC to Clearspring, a company that is used by the government to house asylum seekers. Anti-vaccination protesters have gathered across Australia If you're just joining us, here are some of the latest coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world: We also have an update on the UK's vaccination programme. The number of people who have received their first coronavirus vaccine in the UK is 17,247,442. And 604,885 people have also received their second dose. A further 445 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,the government's daily figures show.,external This takes the total number of deaths, within 28 days of a positive Covid test, to 120,365. There were also 10,406 positive cases recorded in the UK in the last 24 hours. The Mona Lisa usually has crowds around it You may be wondering what's been happening inside museums all over the world during the pandemic while lockdowns have been in place. At the Louvre Museum in Paris, which has been closed to visitors for nearly four months, officials have taken the opportunity to carry out long-overdue refurbishments which would not normally have been possible. Some 10 million people come to what is thought to be the world's most visited museum each year, the majority from abroad. But the crowds are now gone and it instead looks like this... An empty Grande Galerie in the Louvre During this quiet time, curators, restorers and workers have been busy cleaning up sculptures, reordering artefacts, checking inventories, reorganising access and carrying out restorations. ""Weâre taking advantage of the museumâs closure to carry out a number of major works, speed up maintenance operations and start repair works that are difficult to schedule when the museum is operating normally,"" Laurent Le GuÃ©dart, the museum's architectural heritage and gardens director, toldthe Associated Press news agency,external. Around four million people in the UK suffer from diabetes - including around a million who have not been diagnosed, according to the charity Diabetes UK. And while it's already known that diabetics are more at risk of suffering severe cases of Covid - new evidence suggests the virus could actually be triggering the condition in some patients. Jordan Charles went months with undiagnosed diabetes after contracting Covid-19. Here's his story: This video can not be played Paul KirbyBBC News While the streets and tourist sites of Rome and Barcelona came to a standstill under lockdown, a curfew triggered riots in Dutch cities From the first case diagnosed a year ago at a hospital in northern Italy to the empty shops, restaurants and stadiums of Europe's cities, coronavirus has changed the lives of Europeans. Curbs on movement have forced every country and society to adapt its rules and rethink its culture. Italians were initially frightened into uncharacteristic obedience, says BBC Rome correspondent Mark Lowen. They were the first to be crushed by the virus, the first to see intensive care units close to collapse, and friends and family dying. Very widespread respect for restrictions began to change with the second wave, with some protests against renewed lockdowns, given the fear and fatigue. Read about the hard truths and unexpected innovations in a year that changed Europe. Earlier we heard from the co-founder of fast food chain Leon, who warned against extending lockdown. John Vincent says the length of restrictions ""matters hugely"" and ""could cost lives"". Responding to his comments, a government spokesperson said they understood that this is an ""extremely tough time for UK restaurants"". ""We are supporting business with one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth over Â£280bn,"" the spokesperson said. ""As we navigate our way out of lockdown, we will continue to work closely with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic."" The prime minister will set out the roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions on Monday.We've got more on this story here. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The political reality is that Boris Johnson had to offer up
a date for when heâd explain the path out of lockdown in England. There are those on the
Tory backbenches who would not have accepted an open-ended timeline. But the
government would argue that naming 22 February wasnât some
arbitrary effort to buy time, rather a logical choice - one thatâs linked to the
aim of reopening schools two weeks later, while allowing both the lockdown
and vaccine programme to take effect. Regardless of considerations in play, the
long-awaited roadmap does now loom on the very near horizon. Government sources
insist that the details are, even now, still being finalised but with two days
to go a broad plan must now be in place. The government can try to stress
caution or talk about caveats but all the build-up has led to a growing sense
of anticipation. And, for many, that anticipation is linked to a hope that our
daily lives may soon be less limited. Union leaders will present a formal paper to the government as part of their campaign to get support for Eurostar services after the company admitted it is ""fighting for survival"". It comes after officials from the train drivers' union Aslef held a meeting at the Treasury on Friday to argue for jobs and services to be protected as the cross-Channel operator suffers from a fall in passengers because of the coronavirus crisis. Union leaders have beenurging the government to offer its support since last summerwhen The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union called on the transport secretary to intervene as a matter of urgency to prevent job cuts. Eurostar said at the time it was looking at ways to protect itself for the long term by reducing costs across the business, including ""a considered approach to reducing our payroll costs"". Today, Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: ""We are calling on the UK government to intervene to prevent Eurostar going to the wall. ""Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, and Grant Shapps must act now to save this service - for passengers, for the men and women who work on Eurostar, and for Britain and our connection with the continent."" He said train drivers and all the staff who keep our railways running have been instrumental in moving passengers and freight around this country during the pandemic ""So the government must not turn its back on them now,"" he added. Russia says it now has three vaccines against Covid-19 - Sputnik V (pictured), EpiVacCorona and now CoviVac Russia has registered its third Covid-19 vaccine, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has announced. The new vaccine, CoviVac, has been produced by the state-run Chumakov Centre in Moscow, and is due to be introduced in the country by March, though large-scale clinical trials are not yet under way.

"America is back, US secretary of state tells BBCAnthony Blinken signals a sharp change of tack after the ""America First"" years under Donald Trump.US & Canada","This video can not be played US Secretary of State Antony Blinken: ""We're determined to engage with the world"" ""America is back"" and is fully engaged in helping resolve issues including the pandemic, climate change and Iran's nuclear ambitions, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told the BBC. In his first international interview, Mr Blinken stressed the importance of worldwide vaccination against Covid-19. He also criticised China for its lack of transparency in uncovering how coronavirus emerged. It marks a break with the ""America First"" policy of Donald Trump. Mr Blinken was speaking as the leaders of the G7 richest industrialised nations met in virtual session. Who is America's new top diplomat? How will Biden change US foreign policy? The scheme to share unused vaccines with other countries By Yalda Hakim, BBC News The last four years with Donald Trump in charge, it has been all about America first. But what does the US now stand for in the world with Joe Biden as President? In his first international broadcast interview, I've been speaking to Secretary Blinken about what role Washington can play in resolving conflicts and navigating a path out of the coronavirus pandemic. Blinken has been Biden's top foreign policy advisor for nearly two decades. He has also served as deputy secretary of state. Arguably, not since James Baker under the first President Bush has a Secretary of State entered office with so close a relationship with the president. This is what distinguishes Antony Blinken from Colin Powell, Rex Tillerson or Hillary Clinton. None of these people knew the President deeply. None of them had worked for the president previously. When Antony Blinken speaks, he speaks for the president. He is a consummate foreign policy insider and like his boss he is also someone with a reputation for his civility and graciousness. Blinken has had a front row seat to history over the past 30 years and now he's been tasked by the president to re-frame America's relationship with the world. At the centre of the Trump Administration's approach was great power competition. For Obama it was restraint. For Bush it was the war on terror. I asked Blinken what the Biden Administration's foreign policy bumper sticker was. He smiled and without hesitation said ""American engagement, American leadership"". The US is giving $4bn (Â£2.85bn) to the Covax vaccination scheme, which aims to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. ""Unless and until everyone in the world is vaccinated, then no-one is really fully safe, because if the virus is out there and continuing to proliferate, it's also going to be mutating,"" Mr Blinken said. ""And if it's mutating, it's also going to come back and bite people everywhere."" The US has now vaccinated more than 27 million of its own people. However, in many poorer countries, vaccination has yet to begin. Mr Blinken also accused China of failing to share information that might shed light on the origins of coronavirus. A team of investigators from the World Health Organization (WHO) spent four weeks in China on a fact-finding mission at the beginning of 2021. However, two experts from the WHO team said afterwards thatChina refused to grant full access to the data they sought. The secretary of state said a better health security system was needed to spot pandemics before they fully emerged. ""It requires countries to be transparent. It requires them to share information. It requires them to give access to international experts at the beginning of an outbreak - things that unfortunately we haven't seen from China,"" he said. Yes. Under Donald Trump, the US left the deal under which world powers eased crippling economic sanctions, in return for limits on sensitive activities to show it was not developing nuclear weapons. Now the US is examining whether to rejoin the deal. President Biden said on Friday that the US must work with other major powers to rein in what he called Iran's ""destabilising"" nuclear ambitions. For its part, Iran says that despite an EU offer to broker talks with the US to revive the deal, the US ""must act"" first and lift sanctions. Mr Blinken told the BBC the US and its European partners were ""once again on the same page"" on Iran. ""President Biden has been clear for some time: if Iran returns to its obligations under the nuclear agreement, the United States will do the same thing,"" he said. And he said the US would then work with other countries to confront Iran on other issues, including its influence in the region and its ballistic missile programme. Asked by the BBC's Yalda Hakim how he would respond to accusations that the US had made concessions to Iran, he said the previous approach had failed. ""We have a policy in recent years of so-called 'maximum pressure' on Iran that has not produced results. In fact, the problem has gotten worse. Iran is now much closer to being able to produce, on short order, enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon."" Mr Blinken was also asked aboutthe case of Princess Latifa, the daughter of the ruler of Dubai, who has accused her family of holding her hostage since she tried to flee in 2018. In the secretly recorded videos, obtained by the BBC, the princess said she feared for her life. The story has prompted global calls for a UN investigation and the UN human rights agency has asked the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to provide proof that the princess is still alive. The US secretary of state said that the US would be closely monitoring the situation, adding: ""Across the board, with adversaries, competitors, with partners and allies alike.. we take human rights seriously and the president has put it at the heart of our foreign policy and countries can expect us to follow through on that."" On Friday, Dubai's royal family said via the UAE's London embassy that Princess Latifa was ""being cared for at home"". But there was no video or photo released with the family's statement which could serve as proof of life, nor did it give any details about her condition. The Americans are currently reviewing theirpolicy on Afghanistanto decide whether or not to keep troops there. Mr Blinken said the US and others would be putting pressure on the Taliban and others to honour their commitments to disassociate themselves from al-Qaeda. He described the recentmilitary coup in Myanmaras ""a tragic setback to what had been a historic democratic transition"". He condemnedChina's decision to block BBCWorld News television and World Service radio, calling the Chinese information space ""one of the least open"" in the world. ""China uses that to spread misinformation and propaganda... I think ultimately is unsustainable and it requires countries coming together to stand up for free and open information space and we are looking at ways to do that more effectively,"" he said. Mr Blinken refused to be drawn on calls for aboycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, due to be held in Beijing, over allegations of genocide against the Uighur minority, saying only: ""That's something we'll come to at the right time, in the right moment.""

Confusion over gestational diabetes Covid adviceSome women who've had the condition have been told to shield while others have not.,"Heather says the change in the way shielding has been calculated has caused some women to panic Some pregnant women who have had gestational diabetes say a change to shielding advice in England has caused confusion. Some have been told to stay at home while others have not, based on a new algorithm which calculates an individual's risk from Covid. It identified an extra 1.7 million people as extremely clinically vulnerablein England this week. They will now be prioritised for a Covid vaccine. The risk calculator, which identified the additional shielders, is based on factors such as age, ethnicity, postcode and weight, as well as health. NHS England says not everyone with the same condition will be advised to shield but suggests people contact their GP to discuss their individual case. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (glucose) that develops during pregnancy because the body cannot produce enough insulin. It can happen at any stage and, if not detected, can cause problems for both mother and baby. Although it usually disappears after giving birth, women who've had it are more likely to go on to develop type 2 diabetes and should have their blood sugar levels monitored. Heather Davis Mahoney, from Hertfordshire, had gestational diabetes while carrying her second child, and was monitored closely during her third pregnancy. She has not been told to shield, but says it's worrying when others from similar backgrounds have been told they should. ""There's been an explosion of confusion. People don't know what's going on and are worried about putting themselves and their babies at risk,"" she says. Vicky, from Melton Mowbray, had gestational diabetes two years ago and at first thought her shielding letter was a hoax. She works as a supermarket store manager and has carried on throughout the pandemic. ""I rang the GP but I couldn't get an answer as to why it was [that I was on the list]. I haven't fully decided what I'm going to do,"" she told the Jeremy Vine show on BBC Radio 2. But GP Dr David Triska said just because someone has gestational diabetes or had it in the past, doesn't mean they should be shielding. ""I think the major point of confusion is that people are expecting that this is a binary 'yes' or 'no' per condition algorithm - and it is not,"" he said. ""The reason why people are getting different answers from various sources is because this is an individual risk assessment."" Anyone considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable is advised to stay at home at all times and only go out to exercise or for medical appointments. In England, the new way of calculating who is most at risk from Covid-19, called 'QCovid', has been introduced based on data gathered during the first wave of coronavirus in spring 2020. Who is on the shielding list now? As with the previous shielding list, it looks at an individual's overall health. But it also factors in other things to work out how likely it is that someone will become seriously ill with the disease. These are: someone's age ethnicity the postcode they live in and how deprived it is their weight Anyone added to the list will now be made a priority when it comes to getting the Covid vaccine. Decisions about who should shield in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are taken separately. NHS Digital says the new algorithm takes a careful approach. It says anyone with a current or previous history of gestational diabetes is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes or have undiagnosed diabetes. When combined with other factors used by the QCovid model, it says this could mean people are more likely to become seriously ill with Covid-19. But anyone who has been told to shield or feels they should be, should contact their GP for advice. Diabetes UK,external's policy manager, Nikki Joule, says: ""We know the UK government is taking a precautionary approach as to who should be added to the clinically extremely vulnerable list in England, and we expect the process will be reviewed and refined over time,"" she said.

"Travel industry begs for 'route out of crisis'Industry figures have urged the prime minister to provide a ""roadmap"" to get people travelling again.","The travel industry has urged the prime minister to provide a ""roadmap"" to get people travelling again this summer. A number of travel organisations and businesses have written an open letter to Mr Johnson begging for tailored support to prevent more jobs being lost and businesses going bust. ""We urge you to provide a route out of the crisis for the travel industry,"" it says. Mr Johnson will set out his plans for easing lockdown rules on 22 February. Under the current national restrictions, holidays are not permitted anywhere in the UK. International travel is restricted to essential purposes, such as for work, medical appointments, or education. A government spokeswoman said it has already put in place ""one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world"". But signatories of the letter have asked for further help to safeguard the livelihoods of the hundreds of thousands of people employed in the sector and rebuild the Â£80bn contribution the sector makes to the UK economy. It was organised by the Association of British Travel Agents and the Save Future Travel Coalition and its signatories include organisations and businesses across the travel industry, such as Tui, EasyJet Holidays and Airlines UK. 'Too early' to decide on summer holidays, says Hancock 'Optimistic' PM plots 'cautious' lockdown easing What are the new rules for testing and hotel quarantine? About 160,000 jobs have been lost and many businesses have closed their doors for good during the pandemic, it says. The economic output for travel fell by 86% for travel agents and tour operators and 90% for aviation, between February and December 2020,according to recent figures from the Office for National Statistics,external. There has been little opportunity to recover or generate cash since Covid-19 first hit the sector 12 months ago, the letter pointed out, with restrictions in place on international travel for much of the last year. The industry said the government needs to provide tailored financial support to help travel businesses through, including grants that take account of the impact of international travel restrictions, and the extension of other support measures, such as business rates relief, into the next financial year. ""We also know that the recovery of travel is likely to be gradual, which will require the maintenance of flexible furlough support throughout the summer season, as well as other regulatory alleviations and support measures to help businesses meet their fixed costs,"" the letter added. On top of that it asked the government to: Recognise that the industry ""cannot wait"" for the full roll-out of the vaccination programme before people start to travel again. Facilitate travel through a recognised certificate to enable restrictions to be relaxed for vaccinated travellers. Return Foreign Office travel advice on Covid-19 to a regional basis, as opposed to a whole country. Ensure advice focuses on the risk to people in destinations. A financial support system for airports in England opened in January, as all UK travel corridors - which had been in place to allow arrivals from some countries to forgo quarantine - were closed. Aviation minister Robert Courts said at the time that the Airport and Ground Operations Support Scheme ""will help airports reduce"" additional costs faced due to the pandemic. The scheme had first been announced in November, but without a set start date. It involves grants of up to Â£8m per applicant, to be used to cover fixed costs, such as business rates. A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport added: ""There is continuous work taking place across government looking at how best to support all sectors of the economy, including the travel industry, and the Budget on 3 March will set out the next phase of economic support.

"America is back, US secretary of state tells BBC","This video can not be played US Secretary of State Antony Blinken: ""We're determined to engage with the world"" ""America is back"" and is fully engaged in helping resolve issues including the pandemic, climate change and Iran's nuclear ambitions, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told the BBC. In his first international interview, Mr Blinken stressed the importance of worldwide vaccination against Covid-19. He also criticised China for its lack of transparency in uncovering how coronavirus emerged. It marks a break with the ""America First"" policy of Donald Trump. Mr Blinken was speaking as the leaders of the G7 richest industrialised nations met in virtual session. Who is America's new top diplomat? How will Biden change US foreign policy? The scheme to share unused vaccines with other countries By Yalda Hakim, BBC News The last four years with Donald Trump in charge, it has been all about America first. But what does the US now stand for in the world with Joe Biden as President? In his first international broadcast interview, I've been speaking to Secretary Blinken about what role Washington can play in resolving conflicts and navigating a path out of the coronavirus pandemic. Blinken has been Biden's top foreign policy advisor for nearly two decades. He has also served as deputy secretary of state. Arguably, not since James Baker under the first President Bush has a Secretary of State entered office with so close a relationship with the president. This is what distinguishes Antony Blinken from Colin Powell, Rex Tillerson or Hillary Clinton. None of these people knew the President deeply. None of them had worked for the president previously. When Antony Blinken speaks, he speaks for the president. He is a consummate foreign policy insider and like his boss he is also someone with a reputation for his civility and graciousness. Blinken has had a front row seat to history over the past 30 years and now he's been tasked by the president to re-frame America's relationship with the world. At the centre of the Trump Administration's approach was great power competition. For Obama it was restraint. For Bush it was the war on terror. I asked Blinken what the Biden Administration's foreign policy bumper sticker was. He smiled and without hesitation said ""American engagement, American leadership"". The US is giving $4bn (Â£2.85bn) to the Covax vaccination scheme, which aims to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. ""Unless and until everyone in the world is vaccinated, then no-one is really fully safe, because if the virus is out there and continuing to proliferate, it's also going to be mutating,"" Mr Blinken said. ""And if it's mutating, it's also going to come back and bite people everywhere."" The US has now vaccinated more than 27 million of its own people. However, in many poorer countries, vaccination has yet to begin. Mr Blinken also accused China of failing to share information that might shed light on the origins of coronavirus. A team of investigators from the World Health Organization (WHO) spent four weeks in China on a fact-finding mission at the beginning of 2021. However, two experts from the WHO team said afterwards thatChina refused to grant full access to the data they sought. The secretary of state said a better health security system was needed to spot pandemics before they fully emerged. ""It requires countries to be transparent. It requires them to share information. It requires them to give access to international experts at the beginning of an outbreak - things that unfortunately we haven't seen from China,"" he said. Yes. Under Donald Trump, the US left the deal under which world powers eased crippling economic sanctions, in return for limits on sensitive activities to show it was not developing nuclear weapons. Now the US is examining whether to rejoin the deal. President Biden said on Friday that the US must work with other major powers to rein in what he called Iran's ""destabilising"" nuclear ambitions. For its part, Iran says that despite an EU offer to broker talks with the US to revive the deal, the US ""must act"" first and lift sanctions. Mr Blinken told the BBC the US and its European partners were ""once again on the same page"" on Iran. ""President Biden has been clear for some time: if Iran returns to its obligations under the nuclear agreement, the United States will do the same thing,"" he said. And he said the US would then work with other countries to confront Iran on other issues, including its influence in the region and its ballistic missile programme. Asked by the BBC's Yalda Hakim how he would respond to accusations that the US had made concessions to Iran, he said the previous approach had failed. ""We have a policy in recent years of so-called 'maximum pressure' on Iran that has not produced results. In fact, the problem has gotten worse. Iran is now much closer to being able to produce, on short order, enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon."" Mr Blinken was also asked aboutthe case of Princess Latifa, the daughter of the ruler of Dubai, who has accused her family of holding her hostage since she tried to flee in 2018. In the secretly recorded videos, obtained by the BBC, the princess said she feared for her life. The story has prompted global calls for a UN investigation and the UN human rights agency has asked the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to provide proof that the princess is still alive. The US secretary of state said that the US would be closely monitoring the situation, adding: ""Across the board, with adversaries, competitors, with partners and allies alike.. we take human rights seriously and the president has put it at the heart of our foreign policy and countries can expect us to follow through on that."" On Friday, Dubai's royal family said via the UAE's London embassy that Princess Latifa was ""being cared for at home"". But there was no video or photo released with the family's statement which could serve as proof of life, nor did it give any details about her condition. The Americans are currently reviewing theirpolicy on Afghanistanto decide whether or not to keep troops there. Mr Blinken said the US and others would be putting pressure on the Taliban and others to honour their commitments to disassociate themselves from al-Qaeda. He described the recentmilitary coup in Myanmaras ""a tragic setback to what had been a historic democratic transition"". He condemnedChina's decision to block BBCWorld News television and World Service radio, calling the Chinese information space ""one of the least open"" in the world. ""China uses that to spread misinformation and propaganda... I think ultimately is unsustainable and it requires countries coming together to stand up for free and open information space and we are looking at ways to do that more effectively,"" he said. Mr Blinken refused to be drawn on calls for aboycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, due to be held in Beijing, over allegations of genocide against the Uighur minority, saying only: ""That's something we'll come to at the right time, in the right moment.""

Confusion over gestational diabetes Covid advice,"Heather says the change in the way shielding has been calculated has caused some women to panic Some pregnant women who have had gestational diabetes say a change to shielding advice in England has caused confusion.

HSBC fraud helpline's 20-hour wait 'disgraceful',"Lynn, pictured here with her father Richard, described the wait time on HSBC's fraud helpline as ""disgraceful"" The daughter of a fraud victim has branded HSBC's dedicated fraud helpline a ""disgrace"" after it took 20 hours of waiting on hold to get help. Lynn Edmonds' father, Richard, had Â£8,500 stolen by criminals who tricked him to gain access to his HSBC account. As soon as he realised what had happened he called Lynn for help and their wait began. HSBC has apologised for Richard's prolonged wait and also agreed to refund the money stolen. ""In my opinion it's disgraceful the way HSBC's 24/7 fraud helpline is ran, there's no excuse for it. ""Not only is it appalling but it's also very stressful. ""Because [of Covid] we can't be near him at all, and we can't physically go and help him, we feel incredibly stressed by this and all the time we can't get through we're worried his money is being stolen."" HSBC said: ""Like others in the industry, we are currently receiving higher than normal reports of fraud. ""We are conscious of extended call waiting times, and while we have recently increased the size of the team, we are in the process of bringing on board new additional customer-facing colleagues which will cut waiting times."" To try to get an idea of how widespread the problem of long wait times on fraud helplines is BBC Radio 4's Money Box conducted a totally unscientific experiment. We called each of the big five High Street banks (HSBC, Santander, Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds), as well as Nationwide Building Society, at just after 09:00 on a weekday. Each call was answered in minutes - except our call to HSBC. In total we spent more than seven hours on hold to HSBC's dedicated scam helpline on three phone calls. Each one ended when we were cut off without being able to speak to anyone. Victims typically lose Â£45,000 each owing to investment scams Romance fraud on rise in coronavirus lockdown HSBC sent us a second statement: ""Customers who suspect fraud or wish to dispute a transaction should call the number on the back of their card, which is the best and fastest number to report the fraud. ""While we are seeing higher than normal levels of traffic to our contact centres as a result of Covid-19, customers should expect to be able to get through to us within a few minutes, which is within industry guidelines."" There are two numbers on the back of my HSBC card as it happens. One labelled as ""enquiries"" and another labelled as ""24-hour lost or stolen"". Neither of which are the same as the number scam victims are directed to call on the HSBC website - the number where Richard's family and I saw those terrible wait times. And in a third statement, HSBC said it's looking to update its website advice and that any delays for customers who are fraud victims will be taken into account: ""We are reviewing the wording of our website to be more clear about which numbers to call. ""Any delay in getting through on this number would of course be taken into account in any subsequent investigation into a scam."" Altogether Richard, his daughter, Lynn, and son-in-law, Steven, spent 20 hours on hold to HSBC before they got to speak to anyone The delay suffered by Richard and his family is all the more worrying because to be able to effectively tackle crime likeauthorised push payment fraud,external, when often vulnerable people are tricked into transferring money to criminals' accounts, time is critical. Detective Sergeant Marc Cananur, a specialist fraud investigator with Kent Police, said: ""In the event someone suspects they might have been a victim of fraud it really is of vital importance that they engage not only with law enforcement but their bank. ""It's of vital importance... to ensure funds don't fall into the hands of criminal gangs. He said with any investigation, time is of the essence. ""The sooner a bank and police are aware of a crime the sooner both can react... and attempt to claw back funds to the original victim.""

"Harry and Meghan not returning to Royal Family""Service is universal"", the couple say, after the Queen confirms they will not continue with duties.UK","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The Queen confirmed the couple would not ""continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service"". A statement from the palace added Prince Harry and Meghan ""remain much loved members of the family"". The couple said ""service is universal"" and offered to continue supporting the organisations they have represented. Theduke and duchess said last Januarythey would step back as ""senior"" royals and work to become financially independent. The couple, who now live in California, formally stepped down in March, with aplan to review the arrangements after 12 months. The confirmation means Prince Harry and Meghan will return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together 'Overjoyed' Harry and Meghan expecting second child Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win Under the arrangement agreed last year, the couple gave up using the HRH titles. But Harry retains the title of prince, having been born one. Their departure follows conversations between Harry and members of the Royal Family. A statement from Buckingham Palace said: ""The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service. ""While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family."" A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: ""As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role."" They added: ""We can all live a life of service. Service is universal."" This could have been a formality - the end of the review period was coming up, it's very clear what the Sussexes' direction of travel is and equally clear that the patronages and appointments can't really be held on to from California. Thanks for your service, goodbye. But instead the duelling statements - and their bizarre timing, withthe Duke of Edinburgh in hospital- look as if there is a fair amount of bitterness remaining. The statement from the palace lays down the Queen's philosophy; as far as she is concerned the couple have left the life of public service. That's why the honorary commands and patronages have to go. You can't do half in-half out. Not so fast, the couple shoot back. They remain, they say, ""committed to duty and service"" - and ""service"", far from being a matter of titles and roles, ""is universal"". There is more than a flash of anger in their words. Like all good family arguments it blows up at a sticky moment - Harry's grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh is in hospital.  So why now? One source says the story was all over the place already and would have been in the papers by the weekend. The suggestion: that one party is stampeding the other. As to the meat of the announcement, the loss of the Captain Generalcy of the Royal Marines will sting. Harry's military life has defined him. ""Don't cock it up,"" Prince Philip told his grandson on the day he passed on the honorary command of the Marines. To yield it up now must be a heavy blow. Several of the duke and duchess's former patronages have thanked the couple for their support following the announcement. The Queen's Commonwealth Trust - which was founded in 2018, with Harry and Meghan appointed president and vice-president respectively - said it was ""very lucky"" to have had their ""keen support and encouragement"" in its formative years. ""We are glad that they remain in our circle of supporters,"" the trust said in a statement. The Association of Commonwealth Universities said Meghan had been ""a passionate advocate for our mission to build a better world through higher education"" since she took over the role of patron from the Queen in January 2019. And the National Theatre, another of Meghan's patronages, said the duchess had ""championed"" its work with communities and young people across the UK to make theatre accessible to all. This video can not be played Harry's friend JJ Chalmers said family was the prince's ''number one priority'' Meanwhile, the Rugby Football League thanked Harry ""for his time, care and commitment"" in supporting the organisation at all levels - from the children's game to the England teams. The Rugby Football Union also thanked the duke for his work as patron and vice patron, adding that it had ""greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game"". However, the Invictus Games Foundation, which runs an international sporting event for injured servicemen and women, said Harry would remain a patron for the organisation. The duke remained ""fully committed"" to the games, which he founded, it said in a statement. ""His military service and experience, combined with his genuine compassion and understanding for those who serve their countries, has raised awareness of wounded, injured and sick service personnel and the role they continue to play in society,"" the statement added. Harry will also continue to work with veterans' charity Walking With The Wounded as its expedition patron. Smart Works, a charity which helps women with clothes and coaching to get into work, and animal welfare charity Mayhew also said Meghan would remain a private patron. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's military, Commonwealth and charitable association roles will be handed back to the Queen. For Harry, those are: Captain General, the Royal Marines Honorary Air Commandant, RAF Honington Commodore-in-Chief, Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Rugby Football Union Patron, the Rugby Football League And for Meghan: Vice-President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Royal National Theatre Patron, the Association of Commonwealth Universities Broadcaster and Royal Marines veteran JJ Chalmers, who is a friend of Prince Harry, said the duke's family remained ""his number one priority"" and suggested a desire to have ""an element of control"" was behind his decision to step back as a senior royal. ""So much of his life, particularly the way that it faces into the media, is out of his control... and any individual wants to try and take control of that,"" he told the BBC. ""I will continue to have the utmost respect for the service that he has given so far and I'm hopeful and optimistic that he will continue to serve in a greater purpose,"" he added.
