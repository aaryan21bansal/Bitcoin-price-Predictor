Sniper 'kills IS militant two miles away',"A Canadian sniper team working in Afghanistan A sniper in the Canadian special forces shot and killed an Islamic State (IS) fighter from a distance of 2.1 miles (3,540m) in Iraq last month. Military sourcestold Toronto's Globe and Mail newspaper,externalthe soldier was a member of Joint Task Force 2, and made the shot from a high-rise building. It took the bullet almost 10 seconds to hit its target, it reports. The Canadian Special Operations Command confirmed to the BBC the sniper ""hit a target"" from that distance. The shot, which sources tell the paper was filmed, is thought to be a record for the longest confirmed kill. The sniper worked in tandem with an observer, who helps to spot targets, and used a standard Canadian military issued McMillan TAC-50 rifle. ""The shot in question actually disrupted a Daesh [so-called Islamic State] attack on Iraqi security forces,"" a military source told the paper. ""Instead of dropping a bomb that could potentially kill civilians in the area, it is a very precise application of force and because it was so far away, the bad guys didn't have a clue what was happening."" This video can not be played Sergeant Craig Harrison served as a soldier in the army between 1991 and 2014 The source described the difficultly of the shot, which required the shooter to account for wind, ballistics, and even the Earth's curvature. Military experts believe the successful shot may have set a record. The previous record was held by British sniper, Craig Harrison, who shot and killed a Taliban attacker from 2,475 metres in 2009 using an L115A3 long range rifle. The government of Canada's Liberal Party Prime Minister Justin Trudeauhalted air strikes against the so-called Islamic State in 2016. But at the same time, Mr Trudeau announced plans to treble the number of special forces on the ground, as well as increase the number of Canadian Armed Forces members who are tasked with training and assisting local forces.

May unveils Brexit offer for EU citizens,"About three million EU citizens living in the UK would be allowed to stay after Brexit, Theresa May has proposed. A new ""UK settled status"" would grant EU migrants who had lived in the UK for five years rights to stay and access health, education and other benefits. Proposals were unveiled at a Brussels summit but are dependent on EU states guaranteeing Britons the same rights. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the plan a ""good start"", but Labour said it was ""too little, too late"". Many EU citizens in the UK, and Britons living abroad, are worried about their status once Brexit happens. The UK's exit deadline is 30 March 2019. Addressing other EU leaders at her first summit since the general election, the prime minister said she did not want anyone to have to leave or families to split up. ""No one will face a cliff edge,"" she said. ""The UK's position represents a fair and serious offer, one aimed at giving as much certainty as possible to citizens who have settled in the UK, building careers and lives and contributing so much to our society.'' 'Dreamer' Tusk says UK may yet stay in EU Brexit: All you need to know Mrs May said the UK wanted to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK - and the rights of UK expats in other European countries. Angela Merkel said she wanted the ""widest possible guarantee"" for EU citizens But Downing Street has not yet specified what the cut-off date will be for new residents, after which the guarantee would no longer apply. It will be no earlier than March 2017, when the UK formally began leaving the EU by issuing the Article 50 notification, and no later than March 2019 when it will actually leave. Those arriving up until the point of departure would have a ""grace period"" - expected to be two years - to build up the same ""UK settled status"", she told EU leaders. Mrs May also said the system would be streamlined, doing away with an 85-page permanent residency application form which has attracted complaints. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM was already on a collision course with her European counterparts over her plan for the rules of the new system to be applied by a British court - Brussels has insisted it must be the European Court of Justice that oversees it. But she added that the offer was intended to be a symbol that the UK was getting on with Brexit at a time of turmoil at home, in the wake of the general election result which led to Mrs May losing her Commons majority. Our correspondent said the full details would not be unveiled until next Monday, and it was not yet clear if the offer was as generous as that put forward by the EU a month ago. Details on issues such as the rights of EU citizens' relatives abroad and their descendants, were not yet known. Labour's Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: ""Labour has been clear that people should not be bargaining chips in the Brexit negotiations. ""The prime minister's offer is too little too late and falls far short of the full and unilateral guarantee Labour would make."" Giving a ""clear commitment"" that there would be no change in the status of EU nationals in the UK would help deliver the same deal for UK nationals living in the EU, he added. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the plans left too many unanswered questions. ""Theresa May could have given a guarantee from day one, instead she has allowed our friends, colleagues and neighbours to live in uncertainty for a year,"" he said. ""Even now, Theresa May continues to insist on using EU nationals in Britain as bargaining chips and has failed to provide a full and clear right to stay for all."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters she wanted ""the widest possible security guarantees for EU citizens"" from the Brexit deal and called the offer ""a good start"". She added: ""But there are still many many other questions linked to the exit, including on finances and the relationship with Ireland. So we have a lot to do until [the next EU summit in] October."" Both the UK and the rest of the EU say they want to come to an arrangement to secure the status of the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries. The European Union has said they should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice. UK opposition parties had urged the government to make a unilateral guarantee to the EU migrants - but ministers have insisted a reciprocal deal is needed to ensure British expats are protected. The gathering of 28 EU member states' leaders came the day after measures to enable Brexit dominated the Queen's Speech. Mrs May's Conservatives are still trying to secure the Commons support needed to pass their programme. Mrs May was not present when the leaders of the remaining 27 EU states held a brief discussion about Brexit after her presentation.

Eleven high rises 'fail fire-risk tests',"This video can not be played Theresa May is booed on her latest visit to meet Grenfell Tower residents Eleven residential high-rise buildings in eight local authority areas have been found with cladding which raises safety concerns. It comes as tests are being carried out on about 600 high rises across England. Meanwhile, the BBC has learned that Premier Inn is ""extremely concerned"" about cladding on three of its hotels. Cladding is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of fire at Grenfell Tower, in which at least 79 people are believed to have died. Nine people are still in hospital following the fire on 14 June, of which three are in critical care. Until now, safety fears over cladding have centred on council high rises, but concerns appear to reach beyond the housing sector. Premier Inn has told BBC Newsnight that cladding on its hotels in Maidenhead, Brentford and Tottenham did not appear to comply with government guidance for tall buildings - although it did appear to be a less flammable type than that used at Grenfell Tower. This video can not be played Watch BBC Newsnight's report on Premier Inn's urgent review into hotel cladding The hotel chain said an independent expert has assured them that the hotels were safe to stay open given their ""robust"" safety measures including fire detectors and smoke alarms in every room. The hotels do not operate a ""stay put"" policy and have multiple means of escape. Newsnight's Chris Cook said Premier Inn was just one of a long list of places that could have fire safety issues - and were only singled out by the programme because they responded so quickly and in full to his questions. London fire: Who are the victims? Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Flats acquired for Grenfell fire survivors Grenfell cladding 'linked to other fires' The Department for Communities and Local Government has written to all local authority and housing association chief executives to advise them on steps to take if tower blocks in their area are found to be covered in cladding they are concerned about. Read theletter here. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has also written to all MPs saying landlords of the 11 affected buildings have been told to inform their tenants - once done, the areas could be identified to the public. Only Camden, Manchester and Plymouth are named in his letter, which also says the Army has been assisting with building repairs. Michelle Urquhart has lived intower blocks in the Camden boroughfor 50 years. She said she was ""absolutely furious"" when she found out Bray Tower, where she lives, is covered in potentially dangerous cladding. Ms Urquhart said: ""They have been fobbing us off, we've had letters to say ""oh everything is fine, it's fireproof"", and then we got a letter today to say the polythene is in the middle. ""All the neighbours are going mad, we all want to know why they weren't honest with us from the beginning. ""If they didn't know then they shouldn't have reassured us."" The prime minister's spokesman said extra checks by the fire service would determine whether the 11 high-rise buildings found to have this type of cladding were safe and what - if any - action needed to be taken. He pointed out that a failed cladding test did not necessarily mean a building was unsafe - that would depend on the amount of cladding used and where it was fitted. Arconic, an engineering and manufacturing company, said one of its products, Reynobond PE (polyethylene) - an aluminium composite material - was ""used as one component in the overall cladding system"" of Grenfell Tower. ""We will fully support the authorities as they investigate this tragedy,"" a spokesman for the US-based firm said. The BBC has established that Reynobond PE was issued a certificate in the UK in 1997 allowing it to be used on high-rise buildings. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said he thought the Grenfell cladding was banned in the UK. This video can not be played Mohammed Abdur Rahim, who lost family in the fire, says a third world country would have handled it better In the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, councils were told to give the government samples of cladding used in their tower blocks for testing. Cladding is typically fitted to the outside of high-rise buildings to improve insulation and tidy up the appearance of the exterior. A Downing Street spokeswoman said no-one would be left to live in unsafe buildings. ""They will be rehoused if they need to be and landlords will be asked to provide alternative accommodation where that's possible,"" she said. Arnold Tarling, a member of the Association for Specialist Fire Protection, told BBC 5 live that removing the cladding around the country could cost ""hundreds of millions of pounds"". Samples from the tower block in Camden were found to be a safety concern, and are now removed Tests showed that decorative cladding around Village 135, a tower block in south Manchester, could have been made with the same materials as the Grenfell Tower. As a result, that cladding would be replaced ""as soon as possible so that residents feel reassured"", Wythenshawe Housing Group said. Another of the blocks found to havepotentially hazardous cladding is on Camden Council's Chalcots estate, in north London. The panels, found to have been made up of aluminium with a polyethylene core, are now being removed, the council said. Its leader Georgia Gould said the panels were ""not to the standard"" that the council had commissioned, and it would be informing the contractor behind the work that they would be taking legal advice. Three tower blocks in Plymouthhave also been found to be clad in panels which raise safety concerns. One is Mount Wise Towers, which caught fire in February, with one resident having to run out of the building with her seven-week-old daughter. This video can not be played Resident Chloe Brewster speaks about a fire at a Plymouth tower block in February Plymouth Community Homes said it was taking immediate precautions andall three tower blocks would have their cladding removed. ""We are completing further checks to ensure all fire doors remain in place and closers are fitted and operating as they should be,"" it added. ""We are installing additional fire protection to the interiors to the stairwells of each tower today as an extra fire safety measure."" By Jim Reed, BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme This video can not be played 'These things should have been checked out before people moved in' Residents at a 22-storey block of flats in Tottenham, north London, have been sent an email - seen by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme - saying the building has the same cladding as Grenfell Tower. Rivers Apartments - which is shared ownership, so classed as social housing - was built just two years ago, with the cladding incorporated as part of the design. It is understood the block is clad in Reynobond PE, the same brand of cladding believed to have been used on Grenfell Tower. The programme was told the tower passed all building regulation checks by Haringey Council. Unlike Grenfell Tower, this block does contain modern safety features, such as a sprinkler system. Newlon Housing Trust, the housing association that part-owns the block, said it had arranged with the fire service to carry out more checks. It is still waiting for final test results to confirm it is the most flammable type of cladding. It says the cladding on the building may have to be replaced. Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday that she expected to name the judge who would lead a public inquiry into the fire within the next few days. Council boss quits amid Grenfell criticism Sprinkler plan for tower blocks Trauma counselling for tower firefighters Since the fire on 14 June, more than Â£700,000 had been paid out to survivors - none of which would have to be repaid, said Mrs May. Resources, including healthcare and accommodation, would be available to everyone affected by the fire, regardless of their immigration status, she added. The fire destroyed 151 homes - most in the tower block itself, but also a number of surrounding properties. Mrs May said that 164 ""suitable properties"" had now been found for those made homeless, and they were being checked over before residents can move in. These include 68 in a new development nearby. The Scottish government and Welsh ministers have said that none of their council high-rise blocks has cladding of the type said to have been used in the Grenfell Tower. Similarly, there is no evidence of Grenfell Tower-type cladding used on tower blocks managed by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Checks on other high-rise buildings owned by housing associations or private developers in Northern Ireland and Scotland are continuing.

Antiques Roadshow find 'valued at Â£1m',"The intricate Faberge ornament was reportedly valued at Â£1m Antiques Roadshow experts say a Faberge ornament they recently valued could be one of the most significant finds in the show's history. Jewellery expert Geoffrey Munn valued the intricate Faberge object at about Â£1m,The Express and Star reports.,external The show was filmed at the Black Country Living Museum in Dudley, West Midlands, on Wednesday and will be aired later this year on BBC One. The Antiques Roadshow team is currently filming its 40th anniversary series. The show's executive producer Simon Shaw said the ornament, which is shaped like a stem of flowers, was likely to be one of the show's most expensive valuations. Expert Geoffrey Munn valued the find Builder Dan Bansal, 50, from Hagley, observed the valuation and told the Express & Star Mr Munn was stunned by the quality of the ornament. ""The expert said it's probably the second time he's ever done that type of valuation,"" he said. ""I think he was reluctant to say Â£1 million and nervous to say it was worth that much."" Mr Shaw said: ""We've had one of the most significant jewellery finds in 40 years of Antiques Roadshow history - but we don't want to spoil the surprise."" The series will be aired in the autumn.

Raqqa: The desperate fight for IS âcapitalâ,"This video can not be played ""Welcome to Raqqa"": Watch Gabriel Gatehouse's full report As a battle to eject so-called Islamic State from Mosul grinds on, across the border in Syria, an alliance of US-backed fighters is advancing on the IS stronghold of Raqqa. The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse is one of the first reporters to reach the city. This has been a long and brutal road. Driving through the suburbs of Raqqa towards the centre, we pass collapsed buildings, hit by American air strikes, and pockmarked shop fronts, caught between the advance of the Syrian Democratic Forces and the retreating fighters who call themselves Islamic State. As the SDF, a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, pushes forwards, carts emerge, piled high with people and belongings, flying white flags. Some of these families sought refuge in Raqqa from other battles in Syria's long war, only to find themselves now back at the centre of the fighting. Others are emerging from years inside a living nightmare. ""They slaughtered us,"" says one man, a local house painter. ""They told us we were unbelievers, even though we are Muslims from birth, fasting and praying."" There are still tens of thousands ofpeople inside Raqqa, hostages to a regime that has been killing anyone who tries to leave. A Kurdish fighter looks across Raqqa after a coalition air strike ""We pray that God will have revenge against Islamic State,"" a woman says, clutching a small child. ""Everything that's happened to us is because of them."" The SDF made rapid advances through the outskirts of the city earlier this month, their progress eased by US air strikes and artillery. That bombardment continues: every so often the dull thud of a falling shell is followed by a cloud of dust over the centre of the city. A rare glimpse inside Raqqa Life inside 'Islamic State' Has IS's leader been killed? Trump and the battle for eastern Syria But now that SDF forces have reached the edge of the old city, the advance has slowed. IS fighters are hemmed in inside these narrow streets. Bombed from the air and surrounded on three sides, they are fighting back, with all the means at their disposal. We drive closer towards the centre. A sound overhead signals the presence of an IS drone: a small, remote-controlled helicopter that can drop a hand grenade, unseen, from the sky. On the top floor of a building overlooking the old city, a group of SDF fighters suddenly comes under fire. ""Sniper, sniperâ¦"" someone shouts. A woman in camouflage fatigues lies face-down on the ground and loads a heavy-calibre sniper rifle, loosing off rounds in the direction of the IS fire. Among the Kurds, men and women fight alongside one another. The sniper's name is Delilah. She is 22 years old, and was studying to become a nurse. But it is here, on the front lines, that she seems to have found her true calling. ""When I hit my target and I kill the enemy I become very happy,"" she says, laughing in between bursts of heavy gunfire. ""It boosts our morale and our power. We are protecting our friends and our people."" Delilah swapped nursing studies for the front line Returning from the front, exhausted fighters describe intense, all-night battles, as so-called Islamic State uses its network of tunnels to stage sneak attacks behind the SDF lines. ""They surrounded us. They were shooting from every side,"" says an Arab fighter who calls himself Mashuk. ""They caught one of us, they took him hostage. But we managed to get him back."" Drones, tunnels, suicide bombs, snipers: even in war, IS has weaponised fear. It has done this perhaps more successfully than any other group. The battle for Raqqa will be a long, hard fight. If IS loses its capital, it will surely mean the eventual end of the caliphate. But then what? Will the IS ideology die along with it? Probably not. It certainly won't be the end of Syria's long war, or the violence it has spawned around the world. Inside Raqqa: Full report.

Tower 'death traps' and EU migrant rights,"The Financial Times says Theresa May's offer to Brussels to allow three million EU citizens to stay in the UKshows a ""weakened"" prime minister,external, trying to regain the initiative on Brexit.

The Daily Mail saysMrs May promised EU leaders last night,externalthat she would remain as prime minister until the Brexit talks are completed. The Daily Telegraph reports her proposal comes as sheattempts to keep pro-European Conservative MPs onside,externalfollowing the election.

For the Daily Express, a ""tough-talking Theresa May"" made a generous offer in a bid to show the UK wants a friendly relationship with the EU.

Biggest UK population rise for 70 years,"The population of the UK has increased by more than half a million - the biggest rise for 70 years - according to official figures. There were 65,648,000 people in the UK in June 2016,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS),external. The ONS said that was a rise of 538,000 on the figure in 2015, equivalent to a city the size of Bradford. Net migration of 336,000 accounted for 62.4%, while the difference between birth and death rates made up 35.8%. There was also an increase of 9,500 in armed forces personnel based in the UK. The population went up in 364 local authority areas, with the biggest rises in the City of London (7.3%) and Tower Hamlets (3.3%). It fell in 26 areas, including South Lakeland and Aberdeen, 17 of them on the coast, and remained the same in one. Last year's increase was the highest since 1947, which saw a rise of 551,000, driven mainly by a surge in births after World War Two. Around the UK, the population of England jumped by 481,800 (0.9%) to 55,268,100 - and is now more than 55 million for the first time. The population of Scotland increased by 31,700 (0.6%) to 5,404,700, Wales by 14,100 (0.5%) to 3,113,200, and Northern Ireland by 10,500 (0.6%) to 1,862,100. Neil Park, head of the Population Estimates Unit at the ONS, said: ""The population of the UK continued to grow in the year to mid-2016 at a similar rate to that seen over recent years. ""Net international migration continued to be the main driver, but there was also an increase in births and fewer deaths than last year."" The population of the UK has increased by just over five million in 11 years - previously it took 35 years, from 1970 to 2005, to make the same leap. Population change in the UK has averaged 482,000 a year over the past decade. The ONS bases its figures on the usually resident population of the UK, and long-term international migrants who change their country of usual residence for a period of 12 months or more.

Thousands turn out for Warmbier funeral,"This video can not be played Funeral for North Korea captive Otto Warmbier held in Ohio More than 2,500 family, friends and well-wishers gathered for the funeral of Otto Warmbier, the US student who died after falling into a coma while in prison in North Korea. The service was held at the 22-year-old's school in Ohio, before his burial at a nearby cemetery. His death has heightened tensions between the US and North Korea. Pyongyang has called President Donald Trump a ""psychopath"", while he describes N Korea as a brutal regime. Pyongyang's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper claimed Mr Trump might launch a pre-emptive strike on North Korea to divert attention from his domestic difficulties, and warned South Korea ""that following psychopath Trump... will only lead to disaster"". Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier? How do you solve a problem like North Korea? The star student and a dream holiday that ended in tragedy Earlier in the week, after announcing Mr Warmbier's death, President Trump said he was determined to ""prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency"". Monitors were provided in overflow rooms so everyone could watch the service The thousands of funeral goers formed two lines as Mr Warmbier's coffin was carried into Wyoming High School for the 45-minute service, and then along the three-mile route to the cemetery. There was only space for 800 people inside the school's auditorium so most attendees watched the service on monitors in overflow rooms, CNN reports. The belongings Otto took to North Korea were on display during his funeral Mr Warmbier's brother and sister, along with some friends, spoke during the service. Bagpipes played as mourners, wearing blue and white ribbons - the school's colours - to honour the former student, left the school. Thousands of people from his small hometown of Wyoming, Ohio, packed into Otto Warmbier's old high school for his funeral. For most, his casket was the first they had seen of Otto since he went to North Korea - awful confirmation of the shocking, surreal set of circumstances that had played out since early last year. Among several politicians in attendance, including officials from the state and defence departments, was the Ohio Senator Rob Portman, who had been involved in the quest to bring him home. Mr Portman reflected a sense that while today was a time to talk about Mr Warmbier's life, as a young man with huge potential, the issue of responsibility had to be addressed. After the funeral, mourners stood to watch the cortege pass and disappear through the streets with blue and white ribbons tied to all the trees in his honour. As they reflect, there are many not just here but across the country, asking how North Korea will now pay for what many see as the murder of an American citizen. Otto Warmbier was returned by North Korea to the US last week, more than a year after he had been sentenced to 15 years' hard labour. He was in a coma and died a few days later. His parents say that though he never spoke or opened his eyes, ""the countenance of his face changed - he was at peace. He was home and we believe he could sense that"". US doctors say he suffered a ""severe neurological injury"", the most likely cause of which was a cardiopulmonary arrest that had cut the blood supply to the brain. A post-mortem examination was not carried out at the request of the family. This video can not be played Mr Warmbier, fourth from right, is seen shortly before his arrest Otto Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia, was travelling with a tour group when he was arrested at Pyongyang airport in January 2016. He was accused of stealing a propaganda sign from a hotel and, two months later, was sentenced during a short trial. His family had no news of him until 13 June, when Pyongyang said he had been in a coma since his trial after contracting botulism and receiving a sleeping pill. US doctors say there is no evidence he suffered from botulism, and the Warmbier family believe he died as a result of ""awful torturous mistreatment"".

Homeless man's boots save diner's night,"This video can not be played Mr Badshah told 5 live's Emma Barnett he hopes to take John out for a meal to thank him A diner who was turned away from a restaurant for wearing sandals had his evening saved by a homeless man who offered him his boots. Akbar Badshah, from Bradford, drove ""for an hour"" to celebrate his wife's birthday at Fazenda's in Manchester but was told he needed different footwear. He turned to nearby rough sleeper John, who said he would be ""happy"" to help and lend him his boots. Mr Badshah now intends to thank John with a meal at the restaurant. Rozmin Badshah originally suggested her husband should rethink his footwear Mr Badshah, who also wanted to break hisRamadanfast, told BBC Radio 5 live: ""The [staff] said, 'unfortunately we have to turn you away - do you have any spare shoes?' ""I said, 'I don't, I've driven an hour to get here, I'm starving, I've not eaten all day.'"" He and his wife Rozmin - who had previously suggested her husband should wear shoes - left the restaurant and later struck up a conversation with John, who had recently received a new pair of boots from an outreach shelter. ""We had a little chat and I just asked John, 'What shoe size are you?',"" Mr Badshah said. ""He said, 'I'm a 14,' and I said, 'I'm a size 9, I'm in a bit of predicament... can I borrow your shoes?' ""He goes, 'Yes certainly, I'll be happy to lend you my shoes.'"" The husband and wife enjoyed a meal at the restaurant, thanks to John's boots The couple went on to enjoy their meal as planned, then returned the boots to John, who told Mr Badshah he had just wanted ""to help another human being out"".

US man 'gave Chinese agent secrets',"A former US diplomatic officer has been arrested and charged with giving top-secret documents to a Chinese agent. According to an affidavit, Kevin Mallory, a 60-year-old from Virginia, is said to have travelled to Shanghai in March and April 2017. He also failed to declare $16,500 (Â£13,000) in cash found in two carry-on bags when travelling through Chicago airport, said the Associated Press. Under the federal Espionage Act, he could face life in prison. The FBI has confirmed he was entrusted with high-level clearance when working for the government. His access was rescinded when he ceased to be a state employee in 2012, after which he became a self-employed consultant. The Washington Post said that, according to two government officials, Mr Mallory was employed by the CIA, but this information was not given in court. During a voluntary interview with FBI agents in May, Mr Mallory said the person he met in Shanghai told him he was working for a Chinese think-tank, the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences (SASS). The FBI has, since at least 2014, believed that Chinese spies use SASS affiliations to cover-up their identities, according to theUS Department of Justice,external. The affidavit also detailed a note Mr Mallory allegedly wrote to the individual, saying ""your object is to gain information, and my object is to be paid"". Mr Mallory, who speaks Chinese Mandarin, made an initial appearance in court on Thursday, and will return for a preliminary hearing on Friday. ""These charges should send a message to anyone who would consider violating the public's trust and compromising our national security by disclosing classified information,"" said Dana J Boente, acting assistant attorney general for national security.

How do you keep a celebrity wedding secret?,"He's behind you... Jessica Chastain was upset by press intrusion at her wedding Celebrity weddings appear to be everyone's business, regardless of whether the two people getting married actually want the world to see them tying the knot. Jessica Chastain, who married earlier this month, had been intent on keeping prying eyes away. But her ceremony was gatecrashed - by a helicopter and a long lens. The photographs were widely shared, prompting the Oscar-nominated actress to ask fans to respect her privacy. She tweeted,external: ""I am going to ask you to please stop sharing the photos. Helicopters disregarded a no-fly zone and took those pics during the ceremony. Every time I see them I'm reminded of the insensitivity of that incident."" George and Amal Clooney sold photos of their wedding to the press When George Clooney and his wife Amal married in 2014, they kept the press pack at bay byselling photographs,externalto Hello! and People magazines, reportedly giving the fee to charity. Brad Pitt and Angelina Joliedid the same,externalwhen they married a month earlier. But what if, like Jessica, celebrities would rather not allow the world to see their private, personal day? Celebrity wedding plannerLisa Vorce,external, who was behind John Legend and Chrissy Tiegen's wedding in 2013, says the paparazzi are ""ruthless"". She told us how she manages to keep the press where she wants them - at a distance. Chrissy Tiegen and John Legend, pictured earlier this year, married in 2013 It's not easy! You have to be incredibly stealthy about the process and unfortunately you have to operate from a ""trust no-one"" perspective. Unfortunately - yes absolutely. It is very helpful (and necessary). Guests are usually understanding and willing to do whatever it takes to help the wedding couple celebrate their big day in peace. It can cause some stress (for example, guests might say, ""what if my child needs to reach me?"") but that is easily mitigated by having an emergency contact number (i.e. us) and phones on site for emergency calls out (under security supervision). Jessica Chastain asked fans not to share paparazzi photos of her wedding Aside from trying on the wedding gown, we are able to do the majority of the planning and production without the vendors having face-to-face contact with the client. Because I specialise in destination weddings, that's typically our norm anyway - so it's not outside of our typical operations. We use aliases for the clients on all vendor contracts, send videos of venues, sample floral mock-ups, etc. I don't want to disclose too many of our strategies - let's just say diversion techniques and non-disclosures are involved. One image is better than none - but I think it's human nature for the public or fans to always be after more. Yes - without exception. Yes - the paparazzi are ruthless. However, there's always a way to combat the intrusions. For example, at one of my celebrity weddings we had paparazzi in boats trying to capture images of the wedding. Our security team disbursed our own boats to create choppy waves while flashing lights at the paparazzi cameras. They made it nearly impossible for the paparazzi to get a focused image. We shelter the guests and clients from everything to the best of our ability. Our job is to take care of things before it impacts the client or the guest experience. We plan for all scenarios, have counter-strategies in place, and have an incredible security team. The nature of weddings are celebrations of love - there are grandmothers and family members and great friends who are so happy for the wedding couple - all of those positive, heartfelt emotions rise above press intrusion. 1) Stay off social media, and 2) Take a trip to a beautiful place where you don't want to get married and say you would love to get married there! I most enjoyed that John and Chrissy trusted me and gave me artistic licence to design something that was a reflection of them. Their wedding was full of joy, music, beauty, friends, and family - all things that are truly a part of their daily lives. I remember one guest said to me: ""This is the best day of my life, and it is not even my wedding!"" That was a lovely testament to the joy of that day.

Trump: I did not record ex-FBI chief,"This video can not be played Trump injects reality TV suspense into 'Comey tapes' saga US President Donald Trump has stated he did not make secret recordings of ex-FBI chief James Comey, despite an earlier hint to the contrary. He tweeted that he ""did not make, and do not have, any such recordings"", a day before he was required to hand over any such tapes by Congress. Mr Trump kick-started speculation of recordings in a tweet he posted days after firing Mr Comey in May. He said: ""James Comey better hope there are no 'tapes' of our conversations"". This tweet resulted in a flurry of allegations and speculation that Mr Comey was fired in order to hamper the FBI's investigation into alleged Russian interference in last year's election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign team and Moscow. Whatever its intention, the tweet ultimately led to theappointment of a special counselthat has taken over the investigation. It all stems from last year's presidential election and mounting evidence thatRussian cyber hackers targetedUS electoral systems in order to help Donald Trump win - something Moscow has strongly denied. This video can not be played Do Trump voters care about the Russia investigation? Within days of his appointment as Mr Trump's new National Security Adviser in February, Mike Flynn resigned after it emerged he had lied to federal agents about a conversation about sanctions with the Russian ambassador before taking office. Other key members of Mr Trump's campaign team have also been accused of meeting key Russian officials before taking office; it is illegal to conduct US diplomacy as a private citizen. Although Mr Trump has made no secret of his desire to have greater links with Russia - and evenshared highly-sensitive ""codeword"" materialwith them last month - he has adamantly denied any collusion to alter the result of the election. This video can not be played James Comey told Congress earlier this month: ""Lordy I hope there are tapes"" But the ongoing leaks of alleged links and the FBI probe clearly rattled him. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded At a meeting in the Oval Office in February, President Trump made the unusual request to speak alone with Mr Comey. It was during this one-to-one meeting, Mr Comey testified to Congress earlier this month, that Mr Trump asked him to ""let go"" any possible prosecution of Mr Flynn. He was also asked to give assurances of his loyalty. Mr Comey confirmed for the first time in March that the FBI was indeed investigating possible links between Mr Trump's campaign aides and the Russian government. This video can not be played Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year A few weeks later, in a move that shocked Washington, Mr Trump fired Mr Comey. He told NBC News: ""When I decided to just do it [fire Mr Comey] I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story..."" James Comey: From 'brave' to fired Did Trump fire Comey as part of a cover-up? Three days later on 12 May, in what was then perceived to be a threat to Mr Comey, he tweeted: ""James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!"" Mr Comey then leaked memos he had written of his own private meetings with Mr Trump, and expanded on the contentswhen he appeared before Congress. When asked whether he thought the conversation had been recorded, Mr Comey replied: ""Lordy, I hope there are tapes."" Trump v Comey: Who said what The House Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating Russian meddling in the election, sent a letter to the White House on 9 June asking that, if the tapes exist, they be handed over by Friday. Mr Trumptweeted,externalon Thursday: ""With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea... whether there are ""tapes"" or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings."" Asked why it took more than a month to end speculation about the tapes, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: ""You guys asked for an answer, he gave you one, he said he would have it to you by the end of this week, which he did, and beyond timing of that I can't speak anything further."" There are elements of Donald Trump's presidency that come straight from a reality TV show. You saw it when he was assembling key figures for his administration. You would see them arrive for interviews as if it was an audition, and Mr Trump talked in those terms. Much of the way Donald Trump operates seems to follow on from the time he was on The Apprentice when you would have to wait until the end of the episode to see who would be hired and who would be fired. There is an element of that in the White House. There is great theatricality over some of the most serious issues. For instance, on something like the Paris climate change deal he says he will make an announcement at the end of the week, even though he already knows what that decision is going to be, he is gaming it. This is something new. Not just in US politics, but in any politics I've reported on from anywhere around the world.

May unveils offer on EU citizens,"About three million EU citizens living in the UK would be allowed to stay after Brexit, Theresa May has proposed. A new ""UK settled status"" would grant EU migrants who had lived in the UK for five years rights to stay and access health, education and other benefits. Proposals were unveiled at a Brussels summit but are dependent on EU states guaranteeing Britons the same rights. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the plan a ""good start"", but Labour said it was ""too little, too late"". Many EU citizens in the UK, and Britons living abroad, are worried about their status once Brexit happens. The UK's exit deadline is 30 March 2019. Addressing other EU leaders at her first summit since the general election, the prime minister said she did not want anyone to have to leave or families to split up. ""No one will face a cliff edge,"" she said. ""The UK's position represents a fair and serious offer, one aimed at giving as much certainty as possible to citizens who have settled in the UK, building careers and lives and contributing so much to our society.'' 'Dreamer' Tusk says UK may yet stay in EU Brexit: All you need to know Mrs May said the UK wanted to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK - and the rights of UK expats in other European countries. Angela Merkel said she wanted the ""widest possible guarantee"" for EU citizens But Downing Street has not yet specified what the cut-off date will be for new residents, after which the guarantee would no longer apply. It will be no earlier than March 2017, when the UK formally began leaving the EU by issuing the Article 50 notification, and no later than March 2019 when it will actually leave. Those arriving up until the point of departure would have a ""grace period"" - expected to be two years - to build up the same ""UK settled status"", she told EU leaders. Mrs May also said the system would be streamlined, doing away with an 85-page permanent residency application form which has attracted complaints. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM was already on a collision course with her European counterparts over her plan for the rules of the new system to be applied by a British court - Brussels has insisted it must be the European Court of Justice that oversees it. But she added that the offer was intended to be a symbol that the UK was getting on with Brexit at a time of turmoil at home, in the wake of the general election result which led to Mrs May losing her Commons majority. Our correspondent said the full details would not be unveiled until next Monday, and it was not yet clear if the offer was as generous as that put forward by the EU a month ago. Details on issues such as the rights of EU citizens' relatives abroad and their descendants, were not yet known. Labour's Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: ""Labour has been clear that people should not be bargaining chips in the Brexit negotiations. ""The prime minister's offer is too little too late and falls far short of the full and unilateral guarantee Labour would make."" Giving a ""clear commitment"" that there would be no change in the status of EU nationals in the UK would help deliver the same deal for UK nationals living in the EU, he added. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the plans left too many unanswered questions. ""Theresa May could have given a guarantee from day one, instead she has allowed our friends, colleagues and neighbours to live in uncertainty for a year,"" he said. ""Even now, Theresa May continues to insist on using EU nationals in Britain as bargaining chips and has failed to provide a full and clear right to stay for all."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters she wanted ""the widest possible security guarantees for EU citizens"" from the Brexit deal and called the offer ""a good start"". She added: ""But there are still many many other questions linked to the exit, including on finances and the relationship with Ireland. So we have a lot to do until [the next EU summit in] October."" Both the UK and the rest of the EU say they want to come to an arrangement to secure the status of the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries. The European Union has said they should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice. UK opposition parties had urged the government to make a unilateral guarantee to the EU migrants - but ministers have insisted a reciprocal deal is needed to ensure British expats are protected. The gathering of 28 EU member states' leaders came the day after measures to enable Brexit dominated the Queen's Speech. Mrs May's Conservatives are still trying to secure the Commons support needed to pass their programme. Mrs May was not present when the leaders of the remaining 27 EU states held a brief discussion about Brexit after her presentation.

Boys wear skirts to school in protest,"This video can not be played These boys want to be cool in school Some 30 boys have worn skirts to school in protest at being told they were not allowed to wear shorts. The pupils from ISCA Academy in Exeter asked permission to modify their uniform because of the hot weather. One of the boys who took part in the protest said: ""We're not allowed to wear shorts, and I'm not sitting in trousers all day, it's a bit hot."" Head teacher Aimee Mitchell said shorts were ""not part"" of the school uniform, as first reported byDevon Live,external. For more on the school skirt protest, and other stories from across Devon and Cornwall. Pupils said the idea for the protest came from the head teacher, who originally made the suggestion, although one student said he did not think she was being serious. They said they hoped the school would reconsider its shorts policy as a result of the protest and the head has indicated it might be considered. Walking to school, the pupils shouted ""Let boys wear shorts"" Ms Mitchell said: ""We recognise that the last few days have been exceptionally hot and we are doing our utmost to enable both students and staff to remain as comfortable as possible. ""Shorts are not currently part of our uniform for boys and I would not want to make any changes without consulting both students and their families. ""However, with hotter weather becoming more normal, I would be happy to consider a change for the future."" Claire Reeves, whose son is a student at the school, said she had asked the school about her son being able to wear shorts, but was ""shot down"". ""I feel extremely proud of them all for standing up for their rights. People are always talking about equal right for males and females and school uniform shouldn't be any different"", she said.

Republican revolt threatens health bill,"The legislation affects tens of millions of Americans and about a sixth of the US economy Four Republican senators have expressed reservations about their party's plan to repeal Obamacare, throwing the health bill's fate into uncertainty. Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee and Rand Paul said they were ""not ready to vote for this bill"", but were ""open to negotiation"". The Senate's Republican leader unveiled his plan to overhaul the US healthcare system after drafting it in secret. The party can only afford to have two defections to pass the measure. Republicans need to secure 50 votes when the bill comes to the floor next week. No Democrats are expected to support it. Forty-three people were arrested on Thursday while protesting against the legislation outside the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who crafted most of the plan. The statement from the four senators, who are from the more conservative wing of the party, said: ""Currently, for a variety of reasons, we are not ready to vote for this bill, but we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor."" This video can not be played Trump's battles with Obamacare - in his own words The four conservatives are concerned the legislation is not hardline enough, however, two more moderate Republican senators voiced fears it might be too severe. The bill would slash taxes on the wealthy as well as insurance and drug companies, all paid for by steep cuts to Medicaid, a government medical programme for the poor and the majority of older Americans in nursing homes. Senator Dean Heller - who faces re-election next year - said he had ""serious concerns"" about the bill's impact on his home state of Nevada. ""As I have consistently stated, if the bill is good for Nevada, I'll vote for it and if it's not - I won't,"" he said in a statement. Obamacare v Republican plan compared Susan Collins of Maine said it was ""too soon"" to decide on whether she would vote for the bill. She expressed ""concerns"" about the proposed Medicaid cuts and eliminating funding for the women's health group Planned Parenthood for a year. This video can not be played Healthcare battle in rural America The 142-page ""discussion draft"" scraps most of President Barack Obama's 2010 signature health law, including dropping the requirement for individuals to have health insurance. Repealing Mr Obama's law, called the Affordable Care Act but also known as Obamacare, was a central promise of Republicans throughout his presidency. Ina Facebook post,external, Mr Obama said there was a ""fundamental meanness"" at the core of the Republican bill. He described it as ""a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America"". The Senate's legislation follows the House of Representatives version, which passed the lower chamber six weeks ago. The proposals affects tens of millions of Americans and a sixth of the US economy. ""Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act - and we are,"" Mr McConnell said after presenting theBetter Care Reconciliation Act Of 2017,externalto the upper chamber on Thursday. The bill mostly aligns with the House plan, but ties federal subsidies for individuals based on their income rather than age - as the Affordable Care Act currently does. It would make it more difficult for recipients to qualify for those subsidies, however, by implementing more restrictions on income requirements. Is Obamacare more popular than ever? Critics of the House bill, which tied the subsidies to age, say it unfairly penalised older Americans. The Senate plan phases out the expansion of Medicaid more gradually than the House bill. But it would impose deeper long-term cuts to the programme. The bill also gives states more latitude in requiring insurers to provide essential health benefits guaranteed under Obamacare, including emergency and maternity care and mental health services. The curtain has finally come up on the Senate healthcare bill, and the product of weeks of back-room negotiations looks a lot like theoft-derided House version.,external Sure, there are a few key differences. In some places, it's more moderate - keeping in place income-adjusted subsidies to help less affluent Americans purchase insurance, for instance. In other areas the cuts are actually much more aggressive. It appears Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hopes to mollify moderates and hard-liners by pushing the painful changes to low-income insurance programmes farther down the road. Whether that's enough to cobble together the bare-minimum 50 votes necessary from the 52 Republicans in the Senate will be the big question next week. They party has spent the last seven years saying it would tear Obamacare up ""root and branch"", in Mr McConnell's words, and they can't risk walking away empty handed. Senator McConnell expects the bill to come to the Senate floor as early as next week, when the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office releases the plan's estimated cost and impact on Americans. The Republican Senate leadership is hoping to pass the measure, before sending it back to the House for approval of the new draft. The House would need to pass the bill as it stands and send it to President Donald Trump's desk to sign into law or draft another version, which both chambers would again have to approve. Mr Trump has previously referred to the House version as ""mean"" and implored senators to draft a more ""generous"" version.

'Dreamer' Tusk open to UK Brexit rethink,"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: Dreaming of a Brexit 'miracle' European Council President Donald Tusk has quoted lyrics from John Lennon's Imagine to suggest the door remains open to the UK staying in the EU. Ahead of a Brussels summit he said of that prospect: ""You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."" Theresa May, who has said the UK will honour the referendum vote to leave, was due to outline her plans for the issue of expats' rights to EU leaders. Speaking at the summit she hailed the ""constructive"" start to Brexit talks. The gathering of 28 EU member states' leaders comes the day after measures to enable Brexit dominated the Queen's Speech. Mrs May's Conservatives are still trying to secure the Commons support needed to pass their programme. Kuenssberg: The Brexit expats questions Brexit and security loom large at EU summit Bill-by-bill guide: Queen's SpeechBill-by-bill guide: Queen's Speech Corbyn attacks 'threadbare' programme Mrs May told reporters as she arrived: ""I'm going to be setting out some of the UK's plans particularly on how we propose to protect the rights of EU citizens and UK citizens as we leave. ""That's been an important issue. We've wanted it to be one of the early issues to be considered in the negotiations. That is now the case. That work is starting."" She also said she would be raising other important issues, including how European leaders could work together to stop the spread of extremism online and ensure there was no ""safe space"" online for terrorists. Brexit negotiations began on Monday. Speaking before the summit, Mr Tusk said: ""It is a most difficult process, for which the EU is well prepared. You can hear different predictions coming from different people about the possible outcome of these negotiations - hard Brexit, soft Brexit or no deal. ""Some of my British friends have even asked me whether Brexit could be reversed and whether I could imagine an outcome where the UK stays part of the EU. ""I told them that, in fact, the European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve. So, who knows. You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."" His comments were raised at a press conference in Brussels later with President of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, who said: ""In Europe, I never have illusions because I don't want to lose them."" But Mr Tusk said: ""I still have dreams. Politics without dreams - it would be a nightmare."" ""If you had my experience from my part of Europe you would know that miracles do happen and some of my political dreams have come true... but at the same time I am a realist, this is why first of all we should start our negotiations as effectively as possible and the final decision... this is a decision for Britain and UK citizens."" Earlier Chancellor Philip Hammond toldBBC Radio 4's Todayhe wanted an early agreement on the principle of a ""transitional"" period to reassure business there would not be a ""cliff edge"" when the UK leaves the EU at the end of March 2019. He also denied that a series of controversial Conservative manifesto commitments had been dumped in the wake of the disappointing election result. He told Today that the manifesto was for a five-year period, but the Queen's Speech programme had been for the first two years, which are dominated by the process of Brexit. Both the UK and the rest of the EU say they want to come to an arrangement to secure the status of about 3.2 million EU nationals living in the UK, and 900,000 Britons overseas, but nothing has been decided so far. UK opposition parties have urged the government to make a unilateral guarantee to the EU migrants - but ministers have insisted a reciprocal deal is needed to ensure British expats are protected. This video can not be played Philip Hammond on Today backs a post-Brexit transitional arrangement Mrs May will not be present when the leaders of the remaining 27 EU states hold a brief discussion about Brexit after her presentation. They are expected to consider the relocation of the two EU agencies governing medicine and banking which are currently based in London. Of the 27 bills in the Queen's Speech, eight related to Brexit and its impact on immigration, trade and sectors such as fisheries and farming. At the centre was the so-called Repeal Bill, which will copy over all EU laws into UK law, with Parliament then deciding which bits to retain. With MPs voting on the speech next week, the Conservatives are hoping an  arrangement with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party will be in place to support their minority government. But despite both sides saying they were confident of a deal being agreed, sources suggested to the BBC the DUP were ""getting to the limits"" of what they were requesting in return for supporting the Tories - with the chances of a plausible long-term deal, rather than a short-term bargain to get the Queen's Speech through, diminishing. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn, speaking after the Queen's speech, said austerity must come to an end As well as clearing the Commons, Brexit legislation will also have to navigate the House of Lords, where the Tories also do not have a majority. Another potential obstacle could emerge if the approval of the Scottish Parliament is needed for the Repeal Bill. Speaking in the Commons after the Queen's Speech, Mrs May said there was a ""possibility"" the bill, which is needed to stop EU law applying in the UK, could require Holyrood's consent. At the two-day summit, where the agenda is formally dominated by immigration, security and the economy, Mrs May will also brief her counterparts on the UK's commitment to a new Â£75m plan designed to stem the flow of illegal migrants from Africa to Europe.

Seven high rises 'fail fire-risk tests',"This video can not be played Theresa May is booed on her latest visit to meet Grenfell Tower residents Eleven residential high-rise buildings in eight local authority areas have been found with cladding which raises safety concerns. It comes as tests are being carried out on about 600 high rises across England. Meanwhile, the BBC has learned that Premier Inn is ""extremely concerned"" about cladding on three of its hotels. Cladding is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of fire at Grenfell Tower, in which at least 79 people are believed to have died. Nine people are still in hospital following the fire on 14 June, of which three are in critical care. Until now, safety fears over cladding have centred on council high rises, but concerns appear to reach beyond the housing sector. Premier Inn has told BBC Newsnight that cladding on its hotels in Maidenhead, Brentford and Tottenham did not appear to comply with government guidance for tall buildings - although it did appear to be a less flammable type than that used at Grenfell Tower. This video can not be played Watch BBC Newsnight's report on Premier Inn's urgent review into hotel cladding The hotel chain said an independent expert has assured them that the hotels were safe to stay open given their ""robust"" safety measures including fire detectors and smoke alarms in every room. The hotels do not operate a ""stay put"" policy and have multiple means of escape. Newsnight's Chris Cook said Premier Inn was just one of a long list of places that could have fire safety issues - and were only singled out by the programme because they responded so quickly and in full to his questions. London fire: Who are the victims? Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Flats acquired for Grenfell fire survivors Grenfell cladding 'linked to other fires' The Department for Communities and Local Government has written to all local authority and housing association chief executives to advise them on steps to take if tower blocks in their area are found to be covered in cladding they are concerned about. Read theletter here. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has also written to all MPs saying landlords of the 11 affected buildings have been told to inform their tenants - once done, the areas could be identified to the public. Only Camden, Manchester and Plymouth are named in his letter, which also says the Army has been assisting with building repairs. Michelle Urquhart has lived intower blocks in the Camden boroughfor 50 years. She said she was ""absolutely furious"" when she found out Bray Tower, where she lives, is covered in potentially dangerous cladding. Ms Urquhart said: ""They have been fobbing us off, we've had letters to say ""oh everything is fine, it's fireproof"", and then we got a letter today to say the polythene is in the middle. ""All the neighbours are going mad, we all want to know why they weren't honest with us from the beginning. ""If they didn't know then they shouldn't have reassured us."" The prime minister's spokesman said extra checks by the fire service would determine whether the 11 high-rise buildings found to have this type of cladding were safe and what - if any - action needed to be taken. He pointed out that a failed cladding test did not necessarily mean a building was unsafe - that would depend on the amount of cladding used and where it was fitted. Arconic, an engineering and manufacturing company, said one of its products, Reynobond PE (polyethylene) - an aluminium composite material - was ""used as one component in the overall cladding system"" of Grenfell Tower. ""We will fully support the authorities as they investigate this tragedy,"" a spokesman for the US-based firm said. The BBC has established that Reynobond PE was issued a certificate in the UK in 1997 allowing it to be used on high-rise buildings. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said he thought the Grenfell cladding was banned in the UK. This video can not be played Mohammed Abdur Rahim, who lost family in the fire, says a third world country would have handled it better In the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, councils were told to give the government samples of cladding used in their tower blocks for testing. Cladding is typically fitted to the outside of high-rise buildings to improve insulation and tidy up the appearance of the exterior. A Downing Street spokeswoman said no-one would be left to live in unsafe buildings. ""They will be rehoused if they need to be and landlords will be asked to provide alternative accommodation where that's possible,"" she said. Arnold Tarling, a member of the Association for Specialist Fire Protection, told BBC 5 live that removing the cladding around the country could cost ""hundreds of millions of pounds"". Samples from the tower block in Camden were found to be a safety concern, and are now removed Tests showed that decorative cladding around Village 135, a tower block in south Manchester, could have been made with the same materials as the Grenfell Tower. As a result, that cladding would be replaced ""as soon as possible so that residents feel reassured"", Wythenshawe Housing Group said. Another of the blocks found to havepotentially hazardous cladding is on Camden Council's Chalcots estate, in north London. The panels, found to have been made up of aluminium with a polyethylene core, are now being removed, the council said. Its leader Georgia Gould said the panels were ""not to the standard"" that the council had commissioned, and it would be informing the contractor behind the work that they would be taking legal advice. Three tower blocks in Plymouthhave also been found to be clad in panels which raise safety concerns. One is Mount Wise Towers, which caught fire in February, with one resident having to run out of the building with her seven-week-old daughter. This video can not be played Resident Chloe Brewster speaks about a fire at a Plymouth tower block in February Plymouth Community Homes said it was taking immediate precautions andall three tower blocks would have their cladding removed. ""We are completing further checks to ensure all fire doors remain in place and closers are fitted and operating as they should be,"" it added. ""We are installing additional fire protection to the interiors to the stairwells of each tower today as an extra fire safety measure."" By Jim Reed, BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme This video can not be played 'These things should have been checked out before people moved in' Residents at a 22-storey block of flats in Tottenham, north London, have been sent an email - seen by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme - saying the building has the same cladding as Grenfell Tower. Rivers Apartments - which is shared ownership, so classed as social housing - was built just two years ago, with the cladding incorporated as part of the design. It is understood the block is clad in Reynobond PE, the same brand of cladding believed to have been used on Grenfell Tower. The programme was told the tower passed all building regulation checks by Haringey Council. Unlike Grenfell Tower, this block does contain modern safety features, such as a sprinkler system. Newlon Housing Trust, the housing association that part-owns the block, said it had arranged with the fire service to carry out more checks. It is still waiting for final test results to confirm it is the most flammable type of cladding. It says the cladding on the building may have to be replaced. Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday that she expected to name the judge who would lead a public inquiry into the fire within the next few days. Council boss quits amid Grenfell criticism Sprinkler plan for tower blocks Trauma counselling for tower firefighters Since the fire on 14 June, more than Â£700,000 had been paid out to survivors - none of which would have to be repaid, said Mrs May. Resources, including healthcare and accommodation, would be available to everyone affected by the fire, regardless of their immigration status, she added. The fire destroyed 151 homes - most in the tower block itself, but also a number of surrounding properties. Mrs May said that 164 ""suitable properties"" had now been found for those made homeless, and they were being checked over before residents can move in. These include 68 in a new development nearby. The Scottish government and Welsh ministers have said that none of their council high-rise blocks has cladding of the type said to have been used in the Grenfell Tower. Similarly, there is no evidence of Grenfell Tower-type cladding used on tower blocks managed by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Checks on other high-rise buildings owned by housing associations or private developers in Northern Ireland and Scotland are continuing.

Siri storm caused by economist's comments,"When it comes to virtual assistants, do you trust a male or a female voice more? A leading economist has inadvertently caused a storm by saying he preferred the voice on the iPhone Siri virtual assistant to be male because he felt that made it more trustworthy. Nobel prize laureate Sir Christopher Pissarides's comments at a conference in Norway attracted fierce criticism. He told the BBC he apologised for upsetting people and his comment was meant to be ""light-hearted"". ""It's a mistake and I'm sorry, but the audience was laughing."" Sir Christopher was part of an all-male panel taking part in a Q&A audience discussion at theStarmus Festival,externalin Trondheim about the future of humanity. During the conversation, he took out his iPhone and asked Siri a question about the temperature. The answer was given in a male voice and when moderator Larry King pointed out that Siri is typically voiced by a woman in the US, Sir Christopher replied: ""I chose a man because you trust the voice of a man more, I was told."" His comments were strongly criticised as being sexist by both the audience and later on Twitter. However, he defended himself, saying: ""I'm not trying to make excuses for myself, After I demonstrated Siri, the audience was laughing, I was being teased. ""I said it at the beginning of the panel and someone only raised it one hour later at the end of the session. It was the last comment made in a session lasting 70 minutes and my comment was the first comment. No one raised it at the time, but when the woman did raise it, I apologised."" Sir Christopher, who jointly won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Economics, said that earlier in the day, he had given a lecture about the future of work, in which he discussed two policies to empower more women in the labour force. These were education for girls and government-subsidised elderly care centres so that instead of caring for family members, more women could enter the workforce and get jobs better suited to their talents. ""My work, over the last 40 years, has been dedicated to equality in the labour market. When people ask me what is the greatest problem in the labour market, I tell them equality between men and women and races. Of course I believe in equality,"" he said. Film director Oliver Stone (left) was another panel member along with Sir Christopher Pissarides The prestigious festival had already attracted negative comments for lacking invited female speakers. Mr King and another moderator Neil deGrasse Tyson, were also criticised for failing to stop Sir Christopher's comments, according to news siteMotherboard.,external Several high-profile attendees, including physicist Jim Al-Khalili (winner of the 2016 Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication), astrobiologist Sara Seager and the renowned astronomer Jill Tarter decided to walk out as a result. The event's organisers later issued an apology, saying: ""Starmus deeply regrets the sexist comments made by Chris Pissarides during a panel discussion and we accept the outrage that this has sparked. ""Our programme consists of incredible women and men from all over the world and we have made it clear that comments of this nature will not be tolerated at our festival."" The gender and accent of Apple's voice assistant across iPhone, iPad, Mac and other Apple devices has historically been dependent on regional settings. However, recent software updates have allowed users to change both the gender and accent via a menu. ""The comments made do reflect consistent results that people make social judgements about computer speech outputs, and those seem to relate to gender stereotypes that exist in the wider world,"" Dr Kate Hone, a computer science academic at Brunel University, told the BBC. Apple reveals HomePod smart speaker Boy, 4, uses Siri to help save mum's life Apple's Siri calls ambulance for baby Dr Hones carried out a study in 2003 looking at which voices older adults would prefer to listen to on smartphones. Out of the 15 male and 17 female participants interviewed,the participants mainly preferred male voices,externalbecause they found the voices to be more reassuring. Other studies have produced similar results,with one in 1997 by Stanford University,externalfinding that people were more comfortable getting technical advice from a male voice, but preferred a female voice for tips on emotional issues. However, Prof Aaron Sloman, an artificial intelligence and cognitive science expert at the University of Birmingham said he was not bothered how these voices sounded. ""It sounds completely idiotic to me,"" he said. ""The voice of a computer-generated chatbot is something that can be arbitrarily changed. I cannot see how gender would have anything to do with the reliability of the content or the quality of the engineering that went into the AI system."" Prof Sloman, who is 80, said that he has problems with his ears and some radio programmes feature male voices that for him are more penetrating and easier to hear rather than female voices. ""I don't understand why we are gendering our AI at all - it's a computer program, not a person,"" said Phoenix Perry, a lecturer in computing and researcher for feminism in science, technology, engineering and mathematics at Goldsmiths, University of London. ""When we use search, we don't think of Google or Safari as having a gender. I'm not sure why when we interact with it using voice command, it needs a gender. Microsoft Word, which can read out documents to you, definitely does not have a gender.""

Why so few women headline music festivals,"This video can not be played UK festival line-ups dominated by male headliners Music festivals fail to reflect the diversity of the UK music scene, with headline slots being dominated by a small band of male rock acts over the decades, a study suggests. Some eight out of 10 top slots were occupied by all-male acts, analysis of more than 600 headline appearances across 14 major festivals found. And a quarter of all headline slots were taken up by the same 20 acts. The study comes as 175,000 peoplehead to the Glastonbury Festival. Musician and writerEmma-Lee Moss,externalsaid the music industry was ""skewed towards a male demographic"". She said: ""If we continue talking - and we continue investigating and agitating - hopefully, naturally, things will become more inclusive. ""We have got such amazing musicians in the UK who are women. What about a festival that wasn't just women-led headliners, but also most of the bands? ""It's not just the headliners that are imbalanced, it's acts all across the board, and we all know there are people making music that are not just white men.  If someone decided to reflect that in their line-up, they'd be celebrated."" From top left clockwise: Rihanna, Florence Welch, Grace Jones, Joanna Newsom, Pink and Beyonce Watch Glastonbury live streams Ultimate survival guide Which stage are you? How to listen outside the UK? Male rock acts such as Muse, Kasabian and The Killers dominated the festival headline slots in our analysis. Twenty acts - or about 6% of the 308 acts in our sample - took up 24% of all headline slots. Dr Simon Warner, a popular music researcher at Leeds University, said: ""There remains a small number of groups who can actually generate consumer interest, and I think it's down to sheer economics. ""If you are going to get 80,000 you need to have acts that can get [punters] to spend cash. If you are spending hundreds of pounds, you are not going to go for an indie band, you are going to go and see the Red Hot Chili Peppers or whoever."" And there was a stark gender imbalance. In our study, only 37 headline performances involved all-female acts, while 68 were bands of mixed gender. Rihanna was the only female act to clock up four top slots. She was followed by Florence and the Machine and Grace Jones, with three headline slots each. Michael Baker, of the publicationFestival Insights,,externalwhich runs the UK Festival Awards, said: ""Some festivals do attempt to address gender imbalance, such as Field Day, whose curator recently told me that they failed to book 50% female acts because there simply weren't that many available."" To promote diversity, festival organisers need to foster and promote emerging talent, he said. ""Festival organisers are aware of the lack of interesting acts at the top, and many have taken to differentiating themselves from their competitors via non-music activities,"" he said. ""What needs to happen, however, is more long-term thinking and effort applied to the representation and promotion of emerging talent at festivals."" The lack of women headliners was reflected not just in traditional rock festivals, but at more pop focussed events such as V and Wireless. As Prince once put it, there's joy in repetition. If you're tired of Radiohead playing Street Spirit, or The Killers bashing out Mr Brightside, then you're either not a fan or (more likely) a member of the band. But there is a worrying reliance on white, male guitar bands at music festivals - which is strange, because white, male guitar music is massively out of favour. The charts are dominated by pop and hip-hop, with acts like Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Stormzy, Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift dominating streaming services. If bookers took a risk on these acts, they'd undoubtedly attract a younger, more passionate crowd - ensuring their longevity in the process. Of course, no-one is going to do that when heritage rock bands guarantee ticket sales. Festivals are already taking a financial risk - why take on more? The V Festival is an honourable exception. Born in the midst of Britpop, it's re-positioned itself as a festival for pop connoisseurs, booking acts like Calvin Harris, Beyonce, Rudimental, Olly Murs and P!nk as headliners. It's proof that audiences will embrace diversity - in gender, in genre and in the race of their artists - if they're given the chance. Hopefully others will take note. And when they do, it's our responsibility as fans to make it work. Success on the music streaming service Spotify does not guarantee top dog status on the festival circuit. Drake, Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna were the most listened to on Spotify, but had just nine festival headline slots between them. The most listened-to tracks from our sample of headliners came from the world of mainstream pop, hip hop and dance. Ed Sheeran -Shape of You (Glastonbury, 2017) Bruno Mars -That's What I Like (Wireless, 2014) Kygo and Selena Gomez -It Ain't Me (Wireless, 2016) Calvin Harris -Slide (Wireless, 2016) Kygo and Ellie Goulding -First Time Coldplay and The Chainsmokers -Something Just Like This (Glastonbury, 2016) Drake -Passionfruit (Wireless, 2015) Ed Sheeran -Perfect Calvin Harris -Rollin Ed Sheeran -Castle on the Hill And it appears the dominance of hip hop and pop on streaming services is changing the make-up of festivals. Based on Spotify's classification system, the proportion of headline acts in our sample described as being indie and rock has been in decline since the 1990s, at the same time as hip hop and pop acts rise. Though, as 1990s pop duoDaphne and Celeste,externalcan attest, rock fans do not always appreciate pop invading its territory. The pair were faced with a barrage of boos and bottles when they took the main stage at Reading Festival in 2000. Some 94% of headline acts hailed from the UK, the US and Canada. London was the music capital in the UK, producing most headline acts, followed by New York, California, Manchester and Glasgow. Mr Baker said: ""Our tiny nation alone exports a massive amount of the world's most popular music."" The average age of a festival headliner is 39.  The V Festival, held in Essex and Staffordshire at the end of August, had the youngest headliners with an average age of 32. The Rewind Festival, which showcases bands from the 1980s and is held at three sites - Berkshire, Cheshire and Perthshire - in August, had the oldest headliners with an average age of 56. And Glastonbury headliners have been getting older. BBC England's data unit analysed more than 600 separate headline performances across 14 UK festivals. They were Download, Reading/Leeds, T in the Park, V Festival, Isle of Wight, Bestival, Latitude, Wireless, Rewind, End of the Road, Cornbury, Boardmasters and Lovebox. Festivals that were not defined around headline acts were excluded. These include Creamfields, Boomtown Fair and Womad. Fairport's Cropredy Convention was also excluded as it is traditionally headlined by its organisers.

The silence of stillbirth,"It's six weeks after your due date and you reach the front of the long coffee queue at work. ""Oh my goodness! You're back! What did you have?"" Silence. What I had was a baby girl stillborn at 38 weeks. In the last few weeks I had given birth to a baby I knew was already dead (in a hospital, surrounded by the screams of newborn babies) and organised and attended her funeral. But people don't talk about stillbirth, so the girl who has made your coffee for the past five years doesn't know. What do you do at the front of that line, when a thoroughly good human being has asked you a question to which there is no answer that will not make her feel like the worst person on earth? I felt physically sick. I could feel my eyes burning. ""I can't talk about this just now. I'll talk to you later,"" I said, and walked away from a whole queue of people left wondering what on earth had happened to me. Three years on, I still don't really talk about stillbirth very much. It's painful not just for me, but everyone around me. Another scenario: you are at a baby shower for a friend who is about to have her first baby. All the other women tell their childbirth stories, good and bad. I say nothing. No pregnant woman wants to contemplate what happened to my daughter happening to their child. What happened to me happening to them. So the silence continues. I edit my life story so as not to frighten others. Deep down though, I know this silence about stillbirth - all these silences about stillbirth - are part of the reason that every day in the UK, 15 babies are stillborn and 15 families DO go through what I've been through. So as part of this awareness month,external, I am talking about stillbirth. The good and the bad. The good? How can there be good in a stillbirth? Firstly there's the kindness of others - and especially others with a silent grief. There are countless men and women out there who carry with them a burden of early pregnancy loss or the death of a child that people don't know about - or the inability to have a child in the first place. Their quiet whispering of 'I know a bit of what you are going through' was gentle and human and warm. But the process of losing my daughter has also given me something like a superpower. There's something very liberating about knowing that you have survived this horrible event. I don't worry about losing my job - I've lost my child. I never worry about the day ahead, because I remember waking up on the day when I had to drag my heavily pregnant body into hospital and give birth in extreme emotional and therefore physical pain. To hold my dead baby, while in the room next door a family was celebrating their live one. So throw any kind of every day stress at me and it bounces off. Deep down of course there is pain. Grace had Down's Syndrome. We knew that from around 14 weeks and faced a lot of pressure to terminate but that is not really how my heart is set up. So I actually knew more about how her life would have been than most expectant parents and I'd given up almost every bit of work I had in preparation to care for her. These were not easy choices, and I won't pretend they were, but I'd adjusted to them in my head and my heart and I was ready to be someone different. Someone, frankly, better. The loss of Grace took that different life from me. There I was, back at work, in the coffee queue - no longer having to worry about how my special needs child would be treated by the world, whether we'd be stared at on holiday. And do you know what? I'm now the woman who stares at the kids with Down's Syndrome in the soft play or at the beach, but obviously for very different reasons. I was at a spa last month and a girl with Down's Syndrome I didn't know at all came running across and hugged me. Her mother was so apologetic as I just stood there with big smile on my face and tears in my eyes. ""She's fine,"" I said. ""In fact she's just what I needed!"" That mum will never know what happened to me, or why that hug meant so much. And again, that's the silence of stillbirth. You carry with you being 'different', behaving 'differently' - but many of the people you work with or become friends with through your other children, will never know why. No-one knows why Grace died. The post-mortem couldn't find anything concrete. She had Down's Syndrome but her heart was perfect with none of the defects associated with the condition. I'd been having weekly scans so she was definitely not neglected by the NHS. Between the scan at the 37 weeks and the scan at 38 weeks, she died without ever seeing the world, or me her mother. I'll never know why it happened in medical terms, and the question 'why me?' goes through my head every day. We've got to create a world where women - and wider families - aren't expected to be silent about such a catastrophic event happening to them, because it is contributing to the problem not going away. When women know that this is a reality, they can feel more empowered to turn up to that maternity hospital if they even have the slightest inkling that something is wrong. To not care about the glances from medical staff that say ""she's just neurotic"". When the outcome I am living with is the other option, please - be as neurotic as you like. Print this out and take it with you. Ask them how they'd feel at the baby shower or at the front of that coffee queue. I've just survived another pregnancy  - barely - and given birth to a beautiful healthy baby boy. He'll never replace Grace, but he's the sort of happy ending that should come at the end of every pregnancy and with more research and greater awareness we can make sure that is the case.

Can Holyrood 'veto' Brexit?,"Does Holyrood have a power of veto over the Great Repeal Bill? Could the Scottish Parliament block Brexit? Bluntly, no. The issue arises once more because there is discourse again over the prospect that the Brexit bill might require an accompanying Legislative Consent Motion (LCM) at Holyrood. That is because departing from the European Union impinges upon powers - such as justice and agriculture - which are devolved to Edinburgh. In the Commons today, the new Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, confirmed that the prospect of an LCM was under active consideration by the UK government. In the Scottish Parliament today, the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""unthinkable"" for Holyrood and the Scottish Government to be sidelined. She urged a unity of purpose among MSPs. Now, it seems at the very least highly likely that an LCM would be appropriate. It is not just that Scotland has devolved powers. It is what those powers entail - including, in the justice arena, a distinct and separate Scottish legal system, with a canon of ancient and contemporary Scots Law. But back to the opening question. Does an LCM amount to a veto? I think not, for three principal reasons. One, we have had this discussion previously and Scottish Ministers have never at any point claimed they had a potential veto over Brexit. Two, it could be argued that an LCM would cover those parts of the Great Repeal Bill which involve devolved provisions. It would not, of itself, be a vote upon the entire substance of the Bill but upon the devolved implications. Thus it would be designed to plug any unwanted gaps in Scots Law which might result if the return of EU powers did not feature the Scottish dimension. In short, to help Holyrood, not hinder Westminster. The Supreme Court ruled in January that the Sewel convention is just that - a convention Three, and most saliently, we already have a legal ruling on this matter. The Legislative Consent Motion builds upon the original Sewel Convention, named after the Labour peer and minister who steered the original devolution legislation through the House of Lords. In January, the UK Supreme Court ruled on the procedures required in order to trigger Article 50, the formal notice that the UK intended to leave the EU. Inter alia, the Court ruledthat the Sewel Convention was just that: a convention. It was not justiciable. It was not legally enforceable. It had no statutory force. This confirmed the intrinsic power structure in the UK. Westminster is and remains sovereign. MPs can legislate as they choose - including in devolved areas. That was made plain when the Scottish Parliament was established and remains germane today. So the UK government could go ahead and invite MPs to implement the Great Repeal Bill, including in devolved areas, whatever MSPs say. That is the story. But it is not the whole story. The UK government, particularly in its weakened state, will not want to roll over the devolved parliament. It could, legally. But it will not want to, politically. As the Queen said in the Gracious Speech, her UK ministers will want to proceed by building consensus with others - including the devolved administrations. So where might this go? The Scottish Secretary David Mundell has already signalled that he isready for an LCM to be requiredwith regard to the Great Repeal Bill. (There would be distinct decisions to be taken with regard to the other seven Brexit Bills, dealing with individual issues). UK government sources indicate they are reasonably confident that a deal can be done with the devolved administrations. That would not be, they say, endorsing the principle of Brexit - but consenting, in the event of Brexit, to a legislatively tidy and sensible implementation. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon said it would be unthinkable if Holyrood did not play its part in the legislative process of the Repeal Bill Might Nicola Sturgeon deal? I think she might. Scottish government sources indicate they would be much more inclined to consent to the Bill if they were granted a real role in the Brexit negotiations themselves. It was no accident, therefore, that Ms Sturgeon listed two items together in one sentence today: the demand for Holyrood to have a legislative role in Brexit and the demand for the Scottish government to have a say in the talks. Ideally, the Scottish government would like to be at the top table throughout for the Brexit negotiations with the European Commission. But that might well be far too much for UK ministers who have tended to stress that it is up to the UK, as member state, to negotiate exit from the EU. Further, it might not be wholly acceptable to the EU Commission who will find it tricky enough to deal with UK ministers without encompassing a kaleidoscopic mix. But SG sources ponder whether a compromise might be possible. For the devolved administrations to have a significant role in the wider UK negotiation team with, perhaps, an occasional place in the talks themselves when, for example, justice provisions are being discussed. We shall see. Alongside that issue is the question of powers. Nicola Sturgeon says that devolved matters like agriculture and fisheries should come straight back from Brussels to Edinburgh, with no stop in a London lay-by on the way. UK ministers say the priority is an orderly return of powers to the member state from the EU. After that, powers can be redistributed across the UK. On agriculture and fish, for example, they seem to favour a UK form of the common policies which presently govern such matters across the EU. Scottish ministers say devolve first, set up common structure second. More talking to come, then. Much more.

The woman making her country a better place to die,"Fifteen years ago there was no such thing as palliative care - care for the dying - in Mongolia. Now there is, thanks to the efforts of one woman, who persuaded the country's medical establishment that it was possible and worthwhile to prevent people dying in agony. Odontuya Davaasuren was 17 years old, studying paediatrics far from home in Leningrad, Russia when her father died of lung cancer in Mongolia. ""I didn't have the opportunity to care for my father or say goodbye,"" she recalls. ""When I returned to Mongolia, my sister told me that our father had been in constant pain."" Several years later, as a practising doctor, she shared her apartment with her mother-in-law, who was dying of liver cancer, and she saw first-hand how pain could deprive people of peace at the end their life. ""I cared for her. I fed, washed and changed her, but I could not relieve her pain because I didn't know how,"" she says. The only medication available for dying patients in Mongolia at the time was what you'd get for muscle pain or headaches, not the persistent pain of a tumour pressing on nerves in the upper abdomen. Nor the multiple other symptoms like constant nausea and vomiting. ""I felt shame and that I am a bad doctor because I didn't know how to help,"" she says. If these experiences weren't enough, at work Davaasuren witnessed children with leukaemia so wracked with pain they never smiled or spoke, and a young mother who cried constantly and asked to be killed to escape the pain of stomach cancer. ""Many, many patients died at home, in pain, with great physical and psychological suffering,"" she recalls. ""Many times, the families bought so much traditional medicine and other expensive medicines. But that was just false hope."" The idea of palliative or end-of-life care, to support people in the last months or years of their life, was well established in other countries. But in Mongolia, home of the conqueror Genghis Khan, where nomads have lived and died by the harsh conditions of the landscape for millennia, it was entirely unknown. Then a trip to Sweden in 2000, to attend a European Palliative Care Association conference, opened Davaasuren's eyes and eventually helped her make Mongolia a better place to die. ""Before I went to Stockholm in 2000, I had never heard these words, 'palliative care',"" she says. ""This was not available in Mongolia or other post-socialist societies."" On returning, her pleas to Mongolia's health ministry initially fell on deaf ears. ""'Why do you want to spend money on people who are dying,' they asked me, 'when we don't have enough for living patients?'"" Listen to:The Truth About Cancer: Dying in Comfort in Mongoliaon BBC World Service A wind cold enough to freeze your fingers within seconds is blowing across low brown hills that ripple across the landscape on the outskirts of Ulan Bator, the Mongolian capital. Not a single building, streetlight or electrical pylon is visible, just a scattering of round tents, calledgers, the traditional home of nomadic farmers. Entering through the sky blue wooden door of one ger, Davaasuren, now 59 and a grandmother, meets Timurbat. He sits propped on a wooden bed, against turquoise fabric printed with large, red roses that lines the inside of the dwelling. Timurbat's abdomen is painfully distended, his skin has a yellow cast, and the whites of his eyes have turned turmeric-coloured as his cancer-riddled liver struggles to break down the pigment from dying red blood cells. Like his ancestors, Timurbat has spent a lifetime herding sheep and cattle on horseback, to shelter in winter and water in summer. But now he is too weak to speak, much less stand. ""My leg and arm hurt, and I have headaches,"" he says, groaning and closing his eyes.  ""I can't sleep at night. I wish it didn't hurt so much."" Davaasuren kneels in front of him, gently prodding his abdomen. ""You can see the cancer here in the lower abdomen,"" she says. ""This stage is incurable, but I wish for him to be comfortable, without suffering and pain."" Davaasuren asks Timurbat's wife, Enkjargal, what medication he has been taking and suggests increasing the dose of morphine. ""Before, he received one tablet every four hours, now he needs more because it doesn't help,"" she says. Outside the ger as Davaasuren prepares to leave, Enkjargal breaks down in tears. Davaasuren hugs her close and whispers to her. Mongolia has the highest rate of death from liver cancer - six times the global average - and the number of cases is constantly increasing. The culprit is a viral infection, either Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. Spread by contamination with infected blood, and through sex (particularly in the case of Hepatitis B) more than a quarter of Mongolians are chronically infected with at least one of the strains. It is a slow killer. Over many years, the virus causes genetic changes in liver cells, eventually leading to tumours in some patients. By the time symptoms appear, it is usually too late. ""A good death... and a good life before death, it is a human right,"" Davaasuren says. To make her point to the Health Ministry, after her return from Sweden in 2000, she visited dying patients at home and filmed their desperate testimonies. Back then, terminally ill patients were routinely discharged from hospitals once doctors felt they could not be helped and left to cope alone. Without pain relief, many considered suicide. ""Many people asked, 'Please kill me,'"" Davaasuren says. ""They preferred to die than suffer. After [filming], I would come back in the evening. I just watched and cried, watched and cried. I saw so much suffering."" Because of the liver cancer statistics, Davaasuren knew most families in Mongolia were likely to experience this suffering. Her emotionally charged lobbying paid off and in 2002, she was allowed to establish a national palliative care programme, designed to support the dying and those who love them. Odontuya Davaasuren (centre) with two of her nurses Fifteen years on, each provincial hospital in the country provides palliative care, as do hospitals in each of Ulan Bator's nine districts. Five hospices care for dying patients on wards and at home. One major change Davaasuren has made is to increase the availability of morphine. Before she helped rewrite the legislation on the use of the drug for pain relief, many officials believed making it more easily accessible would fuel addiction. ""Now pharmacies can distribute morphine free for all cancer patients according to each person's need until death,"" she says. She has also trained thousands of doctors to provide both pain relief and psychological support to the dying, arguing both aspects are crucial. ""Spiritual care is sometimes much more important than morphine,"" she says. ""Spiritual care can relieve pain. Patients lose their anxiety, fear, insomnia... and there are very good changes after accepting death."" A doctor at the National Cancer Hospital examines a patient's liver tumour using ultrasound In the palliative care ward of Mongolia's National Cancer Hospital, Davaasuren sits talking to a man with sad eyes and salt-and-pepper hair in a bed by the window. As she chats with him about routine matters, their conversation gradually becomes more intimate. There are soft words and a few soft laughs. ""His name is Renchin and he worked in the forest as a builder,"" Davaasuren explains. ""He has five children. He feels death is coming, but sometimes when the children are here, he says, 'I'm OK, don't worry,' because he is a father,"" she says. ""But I told him, 'Now it's time to think about what you need to tell your children, how you need to prepare, because I think it is time. It's better to know the truth than have false hope.'

Toxic family feud as Germany mourns unifier Kohl,"Helmut Kohl pictured with his second wife, Maike Kohl-Richter, in 2014 In the bright heat of a Berlin summer morning, the flags above the Reichstag flew at half-mast. And in the chamber beneath the great glass dome, there was a sombre atmosphere as German politicians paid tribute to the country's longest-serving post-war chancellor, who died on Friday at the age of 87. ""We owe it to Helmut Kohl"" said the speaker of the house, Norbert Lammert, ""that a peacefully united Germany in a free and peaceful Europe is a reality"". How ironic, then, that as Europe prepares to publicly honour the man often referred to as the chancellor of unity, it is becoming increasingly clear that Helmut Kohl also left behind a personal legacy of discord and acrimony. Even as MPs stood for a minute's silence, German TV news programmes were running reports of the escalating conflict within Helmut Kohl's family. Extraordinary footage has emerged of his son Walter and two of his grandchildren arriving, dressed smartly in black clothes, at the family home in Ludwigshafen. Walter Kohl was turned away from the family home, along with two of the late chancellor's grandchildren In front of journalists and well-wishers bringing flowers and candles, they knocked several times but were apparently refused entry and eventually escorted away by a policeman, who was overheard telling Mr Kohl that there was a restraining order in place which prevented him from visiting the property. Police explained to the visiting relatives that they could not visit Helmut Kohl's home It is common knowledge here that Walter Kohl does not get on with his father's second wife. And an undignified public row over the episode at the house has erupted as Maike Kohl-Richter's lawyer issued a statement blaming Mr Kohl for his actions. Mrs Kohl-Richter, an economist who once worked for the late chancellor, is herself a controversial figure who, as her husband's health declined, fiercely guarded access to the former chancellor. They married in 2008 after he suffered a severe brain injury which left him largely unable to speak. She was more than 30 years his junior and, following the marriage, Mr Kohl became estranged from the rest of his family and was rarely seen in public. Germany's 'under-appreciated' political giant Tributes to Kohl from around the world Obituary: Helmut Kohl Helmut Kohl's life in pictures Nevertheless, his opinions still made headlines, thanks largely to one of his very few confidants, Kai Diekmann, the former editor of Germany's tabloid newspaper Bild. It is through Mr Diekmann that we know that Helmut Kohl will not be buried alongside his first wife, who took her own life in 2001. Hannelore Kohl, who suffered from a debilitating allergy to sunlight, is buried in the Kohl family grave in Ludwigshafen. Flowers have been laid at Kohl's former home in Oggersheim According to Mr Diekmann, Helmut Kohl and his second wife changed his funeral plans two years ago when he was seriously ill. He will now be laid to rest in the grounds of Speyer Cathedral. But what has intrigued many Germans is the late chancellor's apparent decision to refuse a state memorial ceremony. Mrs Kohl-Richter has insisted his wish is honoured and so, instead, a European service will be held in Strasbourg Cathedral. It is widely believed that Mr Kohl, who was notorious for harbouring resentment, held many current German ministers in contempt. Do not forget, after all, that Angela Merkel, once the protegee he referred to as his ""MÃ¤dchen"" (girl), betrayed him by highlighting his role in a party corruption scandal. Mr Kohl, it appears, neither forgave nor forgot. German Chancellor Angela Merkel (R) and senior colleagues during a commemoration ceremony at the Bundestag Maike Kohl-Richter reportedly tried, and failed, to prevent the German chancellor from speaking at the Strasbourg memorial. In addition to the praise heaped upon the late chancellor in the German parliament on Thursday, the speaker of the house also said that Helmut Kohl had ""sometimes an exceptionally stubborn personality"". It was, of course, a characteristic that helped him to achieve the political victories for which he is now so widely lauded. As the funeral arrangements are made and as the biographies and eulogies are prepared, the Kohl family continues to squabble. Kohl's political creed was said to have been shaped by his childhood in the destruction of wartime Germany. He understood how terrible the consequences of division could be. He also knew, perhaps better than anyone, how hard it is to heal such discord.

'My kids can't speak the word'. Family tales of house fires,"As the survivors of Grenfell Tower will be finding out, rebuilding your life when you've lost everything takes a while. After the initial shock wears off, and you're left with nothing - literally nothing - what do you do? There are both practical and emotional hurdles to overcome. Three people to whom it has happened have spoken to the BBC. Michelle Drew's home in Bath went up in flames in May. She was in her house with her three children when a fire started in her autistic son's sensory tent. The fire spread to the nearby sofa and blind, across the living room and eventually the whole house. She and the children all escaped the fire without physical injury but lost all of their possessions. ""We just had the clothes we were standing in,"" Mrs Drew says. ""We didn't even have shoes on. I just stood outside the house and watched the fire go up through the roof. ""We were without anything. We lost our home. We had nowhere to live."" Fortunately, the family had insurance, but until some money was released, they made do with what other people gave them and lived with friends and family. Valuables such as jewellery and her husband's extensive film collection were destroyed, along with sentimental items including a hospital scan of a pregnancy that ended in miscarriage. But the main impact has been on the children. This video can not be played Watch: Michelle Drew returned to the scene of the fire ""With autism, routine and ritual is so important. My son really had problems dealing with any changes. I mean, he couldn't cope with having a new pair of shoes and here we were telling him he's got a new house and all of his clothes and toys are gone. He's really feeling the effects of it - it's chaos. ""We're in a new home now but he's still suffering - he's badly behaved, has sensory problems and is really destructive. But everyone's been really great, his school has been really helpful. ""My youngest daughter hashypermobility syndrome,externaland has difficulty getting about - and someone gave us a pushchair. My other daughter needed asthma medication and the head teacher of her school came and opened up especially so we could get the medicine from the supply she keeps at school."" Mrs Drew says it took a couple of weeks for the impact to hit her: ""The reality of what could have happened is terrifying. I'm just grateful my kids are alive."" Does she have any advice for people who may find themselves in a similar situation? ""Surround yourself with people who care about you. Concentrate on what you've got. Try not to think of what you've lost, no good will come of that. ""But you know, the thing that will stick with me is the kindness we experienced. Everyone was fantastic. People went out of their way to help, not just on the day it happened but for weeks afterwards."" Maria De Vita's neighbour died in the fire WhenMaria De Vitaheard glass smashing at her home in Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, she thought it was someone outside doing a spot of late-night recycling. She later discovered it was one of next door's windows exploding in afire in which her neighbour died. Ms De Vita woke her two young daughters and they left the house with nothing. The girls even had to go to school the next day dressed only in their pyjamas. ""The school was so kind, they gave them some spare bits of uniform,"" says Ms De Vita, who did not have any contents insurance. ""Everything has gone. Just gone. We'll have to start from the beginning again. ""Don't get me wrong, I'm very appreciative of the fact we're all here and alive. But dealing with the aftermath is horrendous. ""We stayed with various friends for a bit, and now I've got housing benefit and we're in a B&B 40 miles away from our hometown. It would take the kids four hours each way to get to school, so they're not going at the moment. ""We're staying in a quite a rough area and my kids were threatened when I took them to the park, so we don't want to go out. They've both been affected. They're clingy, and we can't talk about the fire as it upsets them so much. They have taken to calling it 'erif' - which is 'fire' backwards - and can't speak the word fire aloud. ""I suppose we're managing because we have no choice, but to be honest, we're struggling. We will make it but I can't yet see the light at the end of the tunnel. ""People have been so generous - one lady offered me a sofa - but because we don't have anywhere to live I have to turn down offers of help. ""On the one hand, it's restored my faith in humanity, but then I have to reject their kindness. ""All I want is to go home."""" Martin Sigstonlost all of his belongings in a fire just before Christmas in 2001. ""There was shock and horror and emptiness. When you see your home on fire it's partly panic but at the same time you know you can't do anything."" When the Grenfell Tower fire happened, he was moved to post some advice on his Facebook page, letting people know the best ways they could help survivors. Speaking from experience, Mr Sigston, who's from Sussex, pointed out that the things people need are not always obvious. ""It's a daily grind. You're trying to organise yourself and you don't even have basic things like a pen and paper. And you need something to carry it in. ""And there are things you've lost that you don't remember until you need them, and it all really adds up. It sounds silly and petty, but even things like ink cartridges for printers need to be replaced. ""I was insured, but it was still a nightmare. Very difficult. Some of my friends said it could be exciting and a new start. I remember standing in the middle of Ikea and just being too drained, I didn't know where to begin. ""The thing is, I didn't want new furniture or a big TV. I just wanted my own stuff. ""It's like being bereaved. You don't actually get over it but you learn to live with it. It's a long slog, but it does get easier. ""If anyone was in my position I'd say: 'Just let it go. It's gone. ""It's really tough but you'll get there'."" Our homes and belongings tell the story of who we are, where we've been, and the people we love. Research into the psychology of ownership has shown that we come to see our possessions as extensions of ourselves. We place more value in something just as soon as we own it, and at a neural level, when we think about our stuff, the same regions light up in our brains as when we think about ourselves. Although it may seem trivial to worry about physical objects in the context of such a tragic loss of human life, when disaster survivors lose their homes and belongings, they often experience a profound sense of personal bereavement, as if a part of their ""selves"", their identity, their story, has gone forever. This is especially likely to be the case for any possessions that have come to be imbued with personal meaning, such as gifts received from loved ones, items acquired on cherished holidays, or family heirlooms. Indeed, part of the reason that many of our things mean so much to us is that we think about them in an almost magical way - for instance a gift from a loved one may feel as if it is imbued with the essence of that person, such that a physical replica would be no substitute. This magical thinking may also apply to the home itself, especially if it is filled with poignant memories of family events that have taken place there.

Hateful content: Is the media biased?,"The attack on Muslims at Finsbury Park mosque has prompted a debate about whether the media has inherent biases, and caused a major kerfuffle within Britain's newspapers. To take just a single example, one person on Twittersaid,externalof The Times's front page: ""He's white, so let's highlight the fact that he's jobless, a lone wolf and suffered mental health issues."" The Times certainly wasn't alone in receiving such opprobrium. On Thursday morning, the Daily Mail devoted an entire page to an editorial taking umbrage, to put it mildly, with a Guardian cartoon suggesting the attacker at Finsbury Park mosque may have been indoctrinated by reading that paper and The Sun. I tweeted about that battlehere,external. But the issue that most interests me is that Facebook and Google have beengetting it in the neck,externalfor not doing more to remove far-right material online glorifying the attack. In recent months, political pressure has mounted on these two tech giants, as well as other smaller firms, to ensure that the internet is not a ""safe space"" for terrorists. That old political instinct that Something Must Be Done has kicked into overdrive. At a recent press conference, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron committed not only to working together on this issue, but introducing fines if companies didn't act faster to remove hateful material. It is interesting that this political pressure has been re-applied in the light of an attack by a white man on Muslims. It suggests that the scope of material on the web that could meet with popular disapproval is vast. Will an anti-Semitic attack prompt demands that Facebook and Google act on anti-Semitism? Could a rise in sectarian hatred in India prompt demands in that country for, say, Hindu nationalist content to be removed? Perhaps so. Which means this is a good time to remind you of the complexity of this issue and why, though I certainly don't instinctively take the side of the most powerful companies in the world, it's important to be clear about the implications of turning our Something Must Be Done ire against them. First of all, we have to separate the issue of encryption from the broader one about hateful content. At times, leading British politicians haven't seemed to grasp the difference. Messaging apps like WhatsApp are attractive to terrorists because they are protected at both ends: security services can't easily infiltrate them. But if you undermine that protection by creating a so-called back door to encryption, that is an invitation to all sorts of nasties - from foreign powers to cyber-criminals - to take advantage. On the issue of what to do about hateful material, the problems with clamping down on it are several, and both practical and philosophical. Practically speaking, the sheer volume of content is impossible to manage, probably even with Artificial Intelligence. Some 350 million photos are posted on Facebook every day, and 400 hours of video uploaded on YouTube every minute. Moreover, internet content appears in multiple jurisdictions. If my mate in Jamaica is a fascist, and uploads a violent video from his veranda in Kingston Town saying all non-Rastafarians must die, with a specific threat attached, some people might say that is a matter for the Jamaican authorities. But if I download it and share it among my school mates in Tooting, London is it a matter for UK authorities too? Internet companies are also to a large extent protected by the Communications Decency Act, an American law from 1996 which says social media users rather than platforms are responsible for content. This legislation was designed to protect freedom of information. Companies like Google say they are doing lots to tackle extremism. See Kent Walker's piece earlier this week in the Financial Times for instance. As I'vewritten before, Silicon Valley companies are terrified of legislation and have a mindset that promotes technological over regulatory solutions to social problems. In this, they differ from many Europeans. And this points to a philosophical problem about asking the likes of Google and Facebook to police the internet more closely. Do we really want private companies - who have what critics argue is a global monopoly - to censor ever more of our lives? Having completely reinvented our public domain in a very, very short space of time, asking tech giants to now do more to tackle extremism, whether Muslim, anti-Muslim or whatever, gives them a social role we may not like the implications of when we think about it. Of course, with their immense power must come immense responsibility - from paying taxes properly to submitting themselves to greater public scrutiny (something they far too often run scared of). But for the practical and philosophical reasons I outline, responding to the political imperative for something to be done on hateful online content is as complicated as it is vital.

Single parents win benefits cap challenge,"Single parents with a child under two have won a court challenge as they face ""real misery"" from the government's benefits cap. A High Court judge said the cap was not intended to cover such households, had ""no good purpose"", and the failure to exempt them was discriminatory. The government said it intended to appeal and there would be no change to the cap while this process was ongoing. The cap limits the income households receive in certain benefits. It stands at Â£23,000 for those in London and Â£20,000 a year outside London. Parents must work for at least 16 hours a week to avoid the cap. The ruling was made in response to a judicial review brought by four lone parent families - including two who had been made homeless owing to domestic violence. Their solicitor said their benefits were, or were expected to be, cut as they were unable to work the 16 hours. A judge in London ruled on Thursday that he was ""satisfied that the claims must succeed"" against the work and pensions secretary. Mr Justice Collins said: ""Whether or not the defendant accepts my judgment, the evidence shows that the cap is capable of real damage to individuals such as the claimants. ""They are not workshy but find it, because of the care difficulties, impossible to comply with the work requirement. ""Most lone parents with children under two are not the sort of households the cap was intended to cover and, since they will depend on DHP (Discretionary Housing Payments), they will remain benefit households. ""Real misery is being caused to no good purpose."" Solicitor Rebekah Carrier, who represented the claimants, said: ""The benefit cap has had a catastrophic impact upon vulnerable lone parent families and children across the country. ""Single mothers like my clients have been forced into homelessness and reliance on food banks as a result of the benefit cap. ""Thousands of children have been forced into poverty, which has severe long-term effects on the health and well-being."" She said she thought around 17,000 families were affected. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said the government was ""disappointed"" with the decision and intended to appeal. ""Work is the best way to raise living standards, and many parents with young children are employed,"" he said. ""The benefit cap incentivises work, even if it's part-time, as anyone eligible for working tax credits or the equivalent under Universal Credit, is exempt. Even with the cap, lone parents can still receive benefits up to the equivalent salary of Â£25,000, or Â£29,000 in London and we have made Discretionary Housing Payments available to people who need extra help."" He said that households with young babies were among the groups that such housing payments were specifically aimed to assist. The department said the benefits cap remained in place while the appeal process continued. Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: ""We have the ridiculous situation where one part of the DWP has been telling lone parents with very young children that it understands they should not be expected to work, and another part of the DWP is punishing them severely for exactly the same thing.""

Church 'colluded' with sex abuse bishop,"Ball was jailed for sex offences against teenagers and young men between the 1970s and 1990s Senior figures in the Church of England ""colluded"" with a former bishop who abused young men, an independent review has found. Peter Ball, who is now 85, wasjailed for 32 monthsin October 2015 after admitting sex offences against 18 teenagers and young men. The former bishop of Lewes and bishop of Gloucester carried out the abuse between the 1970s and 1990s Dame Moira Gibb's review criticises ex-Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey. He accepted the criticism and apologised to Ball's victims. The review found Lord Carey received seven letters from families and individuals following the arrest and cautioning of Ball in 1992 for gross indecency - when he stood down as bishop of Gloucester - but failed to pass six of them to the police. He also chose not to put Ball on the Church of England's ""Lambeth List"", which names clergymen about whom questions of suitability for ministry have been raised. Ball was given funds authorised by Lord Carey to support him. Lord Carey also wrote to Ball's identical twin brother, Michael Ball - another bishop - in 1993 saying: ""I believed him to be basically innocent"". The current Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has asked Lord Carey to step down from his position as an honorary assistant bishop within the Diocese of Oxford. The Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend Dr Steven Croft,  said the archbishop had asked Lord Carey to talk to him. ""We have agreed to meet in the coming days for that conversation. ""In the meantime he has voluntarily agreed to step back from public ministry,"" he said in a statement. Lord Carey has apologised to the victims of Peter Ball Ball wasreleased from jailin February after serving 16 months. Dame Moira, a former senior social worker, said there was a failure of the Church to respond appropriately to misconduct over a period of many years. In her report, ""An Abuse of Faith"", Dame Moira said: ""Ball's priority was to protect and promote himself and he maligned the abused. ""The Church colluded with that rather than seeking to help those he had harmed, or assuring itself of the safety of others."" The review found that ""Ball's conduct has caused serious and enduring damage to the lives of many men... Peter Ball betrayed his Church and abused individual followers of that Church."" This video can not be played ""I believe that the church has made a lot of progress but it does have more to do,"" says Dame Moira Gibb In a statement, Lord Carey said the report made deeply uncomfortable reading. ""I accept the criticisms made of me. I apologise to the victims of Peter Ball. ""I believed Peter Ball's protestations and gave too little credence to the vulnerable young men and boys behind these allegations,"" he said. The Gibb report makes a number of recommendations about the Church, saying it should ""reaffirm and take steps to demonstrate the individual and collective accountability of bishops for the safety and protection of everyone within the church"". Lord Carey said: ""I believe the Church is now willing to 'think the unthinkable'. ""I hopeâ¦ Dame Moira Gibb's recommendations will make it less likely that a prolific abuser such as Peter Ball can flourish in the Church of England.""

Tributes to Finsbury Park attack victim,"Tributes have been paid to Makram Ali, who has been named as the man who died in the Finsbury Park terror attack. His family described him as a ""quiet, gentle man"" who ""spent his whole life without any enemies"". Mr Ali, 51, died from multiple injuries after a man drove a van into worshippers close to the Muslim Welfare House mosque in north London. Darren Osborne, 47, has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and terror offences. In a statement, Mr Ali's family said:  ""Our father was a quiet gentle man, he didn't get involved in political or social discussion, he instead took comfort and enjoyment spending time with his wife, children and grandchildren and he was always ready to make a funny joke when you least expected."" What we know so far Community holds vigil Horror and sympathy among locals His relatives said they wanted everyone to know what a ""loving man"" he was and that he had ""spent his whole life without any enemies"". They added that Mr Ali would not wish for there to be ""any retaliation or recriminations"" and urged people to ""remain calm and to pray for peace in these difficult times"". This video can not be played ""I have no doubt that our father would not wish for there to be any retaliation"" - family of Makram Ali Mr Ali came to the UK from Bangladesh aged 10 and was married with four daughters, two sons and two grandchildren. His family said he regularly attended the local mosque and enjoyed visiting the park with his grandchildren. He had suffered some form of collapse due to a weak leg and was ""sitting up and expressing a wish to return home"" when the attack happened, they said. ""An incident made only more tragic as he had only just completed his evening prayers, something he did regularly. He took great comfort in the feelings of peace his prayers provided,"" they added. Police want to speak to anyone who spoke to the driver of this van, which was used in the attack The Metropolitan Police are appealing for witnesses to the attack, which happened shortly after midnight on Seven Sisters Road in Finsbury Park and left 11 other people injured. The force released a photo of the van used in the attack and urged anyone who spoke to the driver of the vehicle during the day leading up to the incident to contact them. It is believed the van was driven from Cardiff, Wales at about 08:20 BST on 18 June to London. Police have spoken to 28 witnesses from the scene, examined 80 hours of CCTV and recovered 33 digital devices from several addresses in Wales, Scotland Yard said.

Exploding cream dispenser kills blogger,"Ms Burger described herself as a fitness, travel, and fashion enthusiast A well-known lifestyle blogger in France has been killed by an exploding whipped cream dispenser. Rebecca Burger's death was announced on Facebook in what her family called a ""domestic accident"". A warning against the faulty dispensers was posted to her Instagram account, saying it had ""exploded and struck Rebecca's chest, causing her death"". French media reported she had died of cardiac arrest after the incident, despite medical attention. The popular fitness and travel figure was well-known in France, with some 55,000 Facebook fans and 154,000 followers on Instagram. One of Ms Burger's family members took to Instagram, warning readers not to use the dispenser, saying that tens of thousands of ""defective devices"" remain in circulation. ""An example of a whipped cream siphon that exploded"" A whipped cream dispenser works by injecting gas into a metal container, keeping the entire dispenser under high pressure. One French consumer group has warned readers for years about faulty connectors on the gas capsules, causing them to break and expel at high speed. China cracks down on toothpick crossbows Prince Harry says no royal wants to be king or queen Thai king shot at with air pistol The rise of the female fitness model The injuries caused range from broken teeth and tinnitus to multiple fractures and, in one case, the loss of an eye, consumer magazine 60 Millions said. But the magazine says new dispensers made since 2015 appear to be safe. In 2013, one victim of an exploding cream dispenser told RTL radio: ""I had six broken ribs, and my sternum was broken. ""At the hospital, I was told that if the shock and blast had been facing the heart, I would be dead now."" The number of accidents prompted the government office for consumers to issue a warning, saying the accidents stretch back as far as 2010, and can occur at any time - even after years of use. At least one manufacturer issued a product recall - but a year after that recall, only 25,000 were returned out of 160,000 sold, Le Parisien reported.

Putting the fun back into dance classes,"No Lights No Lycra sessions are kept deliberately dark Annie Blatchford has just finished dancing with 50 strangers in the darkness of a hired church hall. With the windows covered over to keep out the daylight, she could barely see her fellow dancers as they all got lost in the music at the alcohol-free gathering, in Melbourne, Australia. Annie, 26, says she is normally too shy to dance in public, but that it is much easier to go for it when she knows that no-one is watching. ""There is no judgement, or need to feel uncomfortable,"" she says. ""It was a great space to let loose."" Annie is one of thousands of people around the world who now meet regularly to dance together in near darkness (there is just enough light to prevent you from bumping into other participants), as part of a dance organisation called No Lights No Lycra. It is part of a growing change in the world of dance classes for women, away from the formality of mirror-lined exercise studios, and pressures to get your moves correct and in time with everyone else. Instead the emphasis is increasingly on unstructured fun, not taking yourself seriously, and the freedom to dance without any concern about how you look, or whether you should be losing any weight. In addition to the success of No Lights No Lyrca, the movement has seen the rise of dance classes based solely upon the distinctive moves of US singer Beyonce, or the poses made by New York drag queens. As the old saying goes, ""dance like no-one is watching"". That was what Melbourne friends Alice Glenn and Heidi Barrett, both 34, had in mind when they founded No Lights No Lycra in 2009. Alice Glenn and Heidi Barrett dancing with the lights on for a change ""We were just tired of going to dance classes and trying to move the way everyone else was moving, and constantly being critical of ourselves,"" says Alice. ""People want to enjoy that freedom of moving just because it feels good, not because you look great."" A 2013report,externalsaid the fitness industry needed to cater more for young people who had rejected the health clubs of their parents' generation in favour of exercise regimes that place an emphasis on music and community relationships. That was another motivation, adds Alice, who says that participants don't have ""to take themselves too seriously"". While just five people attended the first No Lights No Lyrca session in the fashionable Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, within six months numbers hit 100 people a week. ""It all just went gangbusters,"" says Alice, especially after a friend started a franchise in Brooklyn that was covered in the New York Times. No Lights No Lyrca now operates in 75 locations around the world, including Los Angeles and Hong Kong. Prices vary, although in Melbourne the cost-per-class is seven Australian dollars ($5.30; Â£4.30). Franchises pay about 200 Australian dollars a year, plus a portion of their earnings for larger operations. In Miami, Florida, Simone Sobers decided to launch a dance workout after she learned that women of colour had particularly high levels of obesity and heart disease. Miami-based Simone Sobers (in red shoes) had a sell-out tour of her Boss Chick workout ""I wanted to use elements of our culture that we could easily connect with - music and dance,"" she says. Simone's Boss Chick Dance Workout is a combination of styles - hip-hop, dance hall, afrobeat, and twerking. Classes are for women only, so that they can ""let loose without the male gaze, and have a safe space to dance in a sexy way"". With just $100 in the bank, Simone started the classes back in 2013. It has now expanded to New York and Philadelphia, with classes costing between $14 and $25. She event staged a sold-out 21-city tour across the US. Back in Melbourne, Liz Cahalan's company Bey Dance is devoted almost entirely to the spirit of the singer Beyonce. A dancer by profession, Liz says she was inspired by her love of the music video for Beyonce's 2008 hit single Single Ladies. The first Bey Dance studio opened last year in the Australian city, and has since expanded across the country to Perth and Adelaide. Liz now employs 35 people to help teach the classes and maintain the business. ""It became about more than just a dance class,"" she says. ""It became about teaching women that it is OK to have curves, to feel powerful about the way that you stand with your body."" Liz adds that she thinks the rise of classes such as Bey Dance and No Lights No Lycra was ""one of those zeitgeist things"". She says like-minded people became tired of feeling like they ""couldn't dance because we weren't a certain body shape, that we didn't have a certain technique, or do ballet"". Beydance's classes are a bit with Beyonce fans In London, Juliet Murrell got inspiration for her House of Voga dance classes from a 1980 documentary called Paris Is Burning that chronicled New York's drag scene. The film showcased the ""vogueing"" style of dance popular with drag queens at the time, which involves brief pauses in movement to pose, as if for a camera. Juliet's classes, which launched in 2013 combine vogueing moves with yoga. Juliet Murrell's dance sessions are inspired by a 1980 documentary ""There's a focus on arm, gesture, body language and coordinated arm movements,"" she says of the classes, which have now expanded to Paris, Edinburgh and Barcelona. ""There's an increasing appetite for unique dance classes as people want to feel they're upping their skills and feeling great,"" adds Juliet.

Earthquake alarm sounded - 92 years late,"Californians regularly go through safety drills to help them survive quakes and tremors A warning about a massive earthquake off the coast of California has been sent 92 years late. A computer error caused the US Geological Survey (USGS) to issue the false alarm about the magnitude 6.8 quake. Thequake actually took place in 1925,externalwhen it laid waste to the city of Santa Barbara and caused 13 deaths. In a statement,,externalthe USGS said its computers had ""misinterpreted"" data causing the alarm to be wrongly issued. News organisations across the US received the emailed alert about the quake which, if it had been real, would have been one of the largest ever recorded in California. Few organisations reacted directly to the news because it was dated 29 June 2025 - exactly 100 years after the actual event took place. The LA Times, which uses AI-based software to automatically write up the USGS alerts, did issue a news story based on the alarm notice. The federal body said work it was doing to revise and update information about where the historic quake struck had caused computer systems to misinterpret the data and think it was seeing a novel event. It apologised for causing any alarm and said it was ""working to resolve the issue"". The 1925 quake is classed as a level seven-to-nine event on the intensity scale used by the USGS to measure the damage done by earthquakes. At the higher end of this range, the quakes would cause ""considerable"" damage even to structures designed to withstand tremors, bring about a partial collapse of substantial buildings and make many buildings shift on their foundations.

Why are countries laying claim to the deep-sea floor?,"Around the world, countries are claiming obscure and difficult-to-reach tracts of the deep-sea floor, far from the surface and further still from land. Why? There is a long history of claiming newly discovered territories, of planting the flag at far outposts of the known world. In the early 20th Century, explorers raced to the South Pole, their sponsors keen to benefit from future exploitation of these unknown areas. In 1945, President Harry S Truman broke with convention to claim the entire continental shelf off the US. And, in 2007,Russia used a submersible to plant a flag at the North Pole,external. All shared a common motivation - the hunt for new resources - and there is now a new frontier: the deep-sea floor. Exploration offers the prospect of finding huge amounts of previously untapped resources, but serious environmental concerns remain. Only 5% of the deep-sea floor, which covers about 60% of the Earth's surface, has been properly explored. Light penetrates only the top layers, and the vast, deep oceans are pitch-black, with temperatures just a few degrees above freezing point. Each time it is explored - by mini-submarines tethered to surface ships - strong lights pick out fragile structures and animals that have never been seen before. But countries and companies are turning their eyes towards its minerals, potentially worth billions of pounds. Nautilus deep-sea mining machines Already, there have been significant advances in the technology required to discover, map and mine them - with robotic equipment built to operate at great depths. There are significant deposits scattered over the plains of the ocean's deepest abysses and encrusted on the rocky outcrops of underwater mountains. They are also on active and extinct hydrothermal vents - the fissures in the planet's surface from which hot water spouts. Deep-sea mining, an idea dating back to the 1960s, could now happen within 10 years. It has been made a possibility by population growth, economic growth and concerns over the supply and security of minerals on land. Copper, nickel and cobalt can all be found at high concentrations, in mineral deposits, as can the so-called ""critical"" metals. These include the rare earth elements used in a range of new technologies such as memory chips, LEDs and batteries for electric vehicles. It is thought the mountains of the Pacific alone could contain about 22 times more tellurium - which is used in solar panels - than the known land-based reserves combined. At present there is no exploitation of deep-sea mineral resources, only exploration. The UK - through a partnership between the government and a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin UK -  is among countries exploring one of the main areas, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, which stretches across the Pacific Ocean for thousands of miles between Mexico and Hawaii. There are serious challenges to overcome at this remote location. A deep-water prawn on the floor of the Clarion Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean Equipment has to function reliably at depths of 5km (three miles) - where pressure is 500 times that at the surface - before deposits are brought on to ships and taken back to land. There are other resources closer to shore. Rich deposits of minerals are found at depths of over 1km (0.6 miles) in the Bismarck Sea off Papua New Guinea. For these easier-to-access reserves, deep-sea mining equipment has been designed, tested and built. If mining operations go ahead here, they will offer some insights for future and deeper operations. However, strong opposition remains over concerns about the potential environmental impact. Renewables' deep-sea mining conundrum New life found in deep-sea vents Deep-sea mining threat to Octopus Mining 'must respect ecosystems' This video can not be played Should we be mining the seabed for minerals? The rules for exploitation are yet to be agreed, but contractors will have to demonstrate they have assessed the environmental impact of mining and that plans are in place to manage the effects. This is perhaps the greatest challenge for deep-sea mining and the area of greatest tension. Our understanding of the deep-sea environment is very limited, let alone our understanding of the effects of mining it. The diversity of life in the oceans, particularly around deep-sea vents and other mineral deposits, is spectacular, yet we know there are many more species still to be discovered. A ""black smoker"" hydrothermal vent on the floor of the Pacific Ocean, viewed from a deep-sea vehicle Recent research by international consortiums of scientists has begun to try to measure the impact of churning up the ocean floor. Mining could have consequences for many forms of life in the ocean. That could, in turn, affect the ocean's function as a food source and a carbon sink. It could also affect the search for new drugs and other products. For example: An anti-inflammatory extract from a Caribbean octocoral is now used in a commercial skincare range An anti-cancer treatment uses a natural product extracted from a marine sponge A painkiller based on a synthetic derivative from a cone snail is being made Where the resources are found within 200 nautical miles (370km) of shore, it is up to individual countries to reach agreement about who owns them. In the deeper international waters, it becomes more difficult. Here, theInternational Seabed Authority (ISA),externalis responsible for awarding licenses for mining. Established by the UN in 1984, its decisions are legally binding on the 166 states - and the EU - who are party to it. 1934 - William Beebe and Otis Barton descend 923m (3,028ft) in a ""bathysphere"" - an unpowered deep-sea submersible made of cast-iron, lowered by a cable 1960 - In the Trieste submersible (pictured), Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh explore the Challenger Deep in the Marianas Trench - the deepest known part of the Pacific Ocean - reaching a depth of roughly 11km Administering resources defined as being for ""the common heritage of mankind"", the ISA has so far approved 26 contracts of 15 years. These are held by 20 sponsor countries, including China and Russia - which have four licences each - and the UK, France, Germany, India and Japan - which have two licences. Licences have to be shared equally with a developing nation - each getting half the sea floor. The oceans already provide humanity with many resources, but the deep oceans have long been overlooked because of their inaccessibility. The coming years will potentially see a lot of changes, as our understanding and technology improves. The race to license areas of the deep ocean will only intensify.

Fire-risk tests on '600 high rises',"This video can not be played Theresa May is booed on her latest visit to meet Grenfell Tower residents Eleven residential high-rise buildings in eight local authority areas have been found with cladding which raises safety concerns. It comes as tests are being carried out on about 600 high rises across England. Meanwhile, the BBC has learned that Premier Inn is ""extremely concerned"" about cladding on three of its hotels. Cladding is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of fire at Grenfell Tower, in which at least 79 people are believed to have died. Nine people are still in hospital following the fire on 14 June, of which three are in critical care. Until now, safety fears over cladding have centred on council high rises, but concerns appear to reach beyond the housing sector. Premier Inn has told BBC Newsnight that cladding on its hotels in Maidenhead, Brentford and Tottenham did not appear to comply with government guidance for tall buildings - although it did appear to be a less flammable type than that used at Grenfell Tower. This video can not be played Watch BBC Newsnight's report on Premier Inn's urgent review into hotel cladding The hotel chain said an independent expert has assured them that the hotels were safe to stay open given their ""robust"" safety measures including fire detectors and smoke alarms in every room. The hotels do not operate a ""stay put"" policy and have multiple means of escape. Newsnight's Chris Cook said Premier Inn was just one of a long list of places that could have fire safety issues - and were only singled out by the programme because they responded so quickly and in full to his questions. London fire: Who are the victims? Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Flats acquired for Grenfell fire survivors Grenfell cladding 'linked to other fires' The Department for Communities and Local Government has written to all local authority and housing association chief executives to advise them on steps to take if tower blocks in their area are found to be covered in cladding they are concerned about. Read theletter here. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has also written to all MPs saying landlords of the 11 affected buildings have been told to inform their tenants - once done, the areas could be identified to the public. Only Camden, Manchester and Plymouth are named in his letter, which also says the Army has been assisting with building repairs. Michelle Urquhart has lived intower blocks in the Camden boroughfor 50 years. She said she was ""absolutely furious"" when she found out Bray Tower, where she lives, is covered in potentially dangerous cladding. Ms Urquhart said: ""They have been fobbing us off, we've had letters to say ""oh everything is fine, it's fireproof"", and then we got a letter today to say the polythene is in the middle. ""All the neighbours are going mad, we all want to know why they weren't honest with us from the beginning. ""If they didn't know then they shouldn't have reassured us."" The prime minister's spokesman said extra checks by the fire service would determine whether the 11 high-rise buildings found to have this type of cladding were safe and what - if any - action needed to be taken. He pointed out that a failed cladding test did not necessarily mean a building was unsafe - that would depend on the amount of cladding used and where it was fitted. Arconic, an engineering and manufacturing company, said one of its products, Reynobond PE (polyethylene) - an aluminium composite material - was ""used as one component in the overall cladding system"" of Grenfell Tower. ""We will fully support the authorities as they investigate this tragedy,"" a spokesman for the US-based firm said. The BBC has established that Reynobond PE was issued a certificate in the UK in 1997 allowing it to be used on high-rise buildings. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said he thought the Grenfell cladding was banned in the UK. This video can not be played Mohammed Abdur Rahim, who lost family in the fire, says a third world country would have handled it better In the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, councils were told to give the government samples of cladding used in their tower blocks for testing. Cladding is typically fitted to the outside of high-rise buildings to improve insulation and tidy up the appearance of the exterior. A Downing Street spokeswoman said no-one would be left to live in unsafe buildings. ""They will be rehoused if they need to be and landlords will be asked to provide alternative accommodation where that's possible,"" she said. Arnold Tarling, a member of the Association for Specialist Fire Protection, told BBC 5 live that removing the cladding around the country could cost ""hundreds of millions of pounds"". Samples from the tower block in Camden were found to be a safety concern, and are now removed Tests showed that decorative cladding around Village 135, a tower block in south Manchester, could have been made with the same materials as the Grenfell Tower. As a result, that cladding would be replaced ""as soon as possible so that residents feel reassured"", Wythenshawe Housing Group said. Another of the blocks found to havepotentially hazardous cladding is on Camden Council's Chalcots estate, in north London. The panels, found to have been made up of aluminium with a polyethylene core, are now being removed, the council said. Its leader Georgia Gould said the panels were ""not to the standard"" that the council had commissioned, and it would be informing the contractor behind the work that they would be taking legal advice. Three tower blocks in Plymouthhave also been found to be clad in panels which raise safety concerns. One is Mount Wise Towers, which caught fire in February, with one resident having to run out of the building with her seven-week-old daughter. This video can not be played Resident Chloe Brewster speaks about a fire at a Plymouth tower block in February Plymouth Community Homes said it was taking immediate precautions andall three tower blocks would have their cladding removed. ""We are completing further checks to ensure all fire doors remain in place and closers are fitted and operating as they should be,"" it added. ""We are installing additional fire protection to the interiors to the stairwells of each tower today as an extra fire safety measure."" By Jim Reed, BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme This video can not be played 'These things should have been checked out before people moved in' Residents at a 22-storey block of flats in Tottenham, north London, have been sent an email - seen by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme - saying the building has the same cladding as Grenfell Tower. Rivers Apartments - which is shared ownership, so classed as social housing - was built just two years ago, with the cladding incorporated as part of the design. It is understood the block is clad in Reynobond PE, the same brand of cladding believed to have been used on Grenfell Tower. The programme was told the tower passed all building regulation checks by Haringey Council. Unlike Grenfell Tower, this block does contain modern safety features, such as a sprinkler system. Newlon Housing Trust, the housing association that part-owns the block, said it had arranged with the fire service to carry out more checks. It is still waiting for final test results to confirm it is the most flammable type of cladding. It says the cladding on the building may have to be replaced. Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday that she expected to name the judge who would lead a public inquiry into the fire within the next few days. Council boss quits amid Grenfell criticism Sprinkler plan for tower blocks Trauma counselling for tower firefighters Since the fire on 14 June, more than Â£700,000 had been paid out to survivors - none of which would have to be repaid, said Mrs May. Resources, including healthcare and accommodation, would be available to everyone affected by the fire, regardless of their immigration status, she added. The fire destroyed 151 homes - most in the tower block itself, but also a number of surrounding properties. Mrs May said that 164 ""suitable properties"" had now been found for those made homeless, and they were being checked over before residents can move in. These include 68 in a new development nearby. The Scottish government and Welsh ministers have said that none of their council high-rise blocks has cladding of the type said to have been used in the Grenfell Tower. Similarly, there is no evidence of Grenfell Tower-type cladding used on tower blocks managed by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Checks on other high-rise buildings owned by housing associations or private developers in Northern Ireland and Scotland are continuing.

The prince also spoke about walking in the funeral procession for his mother, Princess Diana, when he was 12, saying no child ""should be asked to do that"". In 1997, Harry joined his father, the Prince of Wales, grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, 15-year-old brother, the Duke of Cambridge, and uncle, Earl Spencer, in the procession through the streets of London. Harry, whorecently said he had received counselling to cope with the death of his motherin a car crash in Paris, said: ""My mother had just died, and I had to walk a long way behind her coffin, surrounded by thousands of people watching me while millions more did on television. ""I don't think any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances. I don't think it would happen today."" The Prince also talked about the role he and his brother are taking in what he called ""modernising the monarchy"". He also paid tribute to his ""remarkable"" grandmother for letting the younger royals do things their own way. ""The Queen has been fantastic in letting us choose,"" he says. ""She tells us to take our time and really think things through."" Prince Harry standing between his brother and father at Diana's funeral By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent This is an interview that will generate some sympathy - a prince still struggling with the death of his mother - and raise some eyebrows. Such a reaction will be prompted by Harry's suggestion that the Windsors aren't exactly falling over each other to fill what his mother once called ""the top job"", when it becomes vacant. The Queen's heirs, he implies, will take on a position of enormous privilege because they have to, not because they want to. And despite the prince's important caveat that the royals do what they do for the greater good and not for themselves, his words have generated the Daily Mail headline ""Harry: No Royal Wants Throne"". Prince Harry is on marginally safer ground talking about his mother's funeral even though his comments do contain an implied criticism of his immediate family. They could have decided in 1997 that he was too young to walk, so publicly, behind Diana's coffin. There is one other striking aspect to this lengthy article.  It contains no comments, by Harry, about his father. Prince Harry told the magazine, which says it was given access to the prince for nearly a year, that he was ""involved in modernising the British monarchy"". ""It's a tricky balancing act. We don't want to dilute the magic. The British public and the whole world need institutions like it."" Harry praised Princess Diana for playing a part in showing him an ordinary life, saying people would be ""amazed"" at how ordinary his and Prince William's lives were. ""I do my own shopping. Sometimes... I worry someone will snap me with their phone. But I am determined to have a relatively normal life and if I am lucky enough to have children, they can have one too. ""Even if I was king, I would do my own shopping.""

Grenfell-type cladding on 600 high rises,"This video can not be played Theresa May is booed on her latest visit to meet Grenfell Tower residents Eleven residential high-rise buildings in eight local authority areas have been found with cladding which raises safety concerns. It comes as tests are being carried out on about 600 high rises across England. Meanwhile, the BBC has learned that Premier Inn is ""extremely concerned"" about cladding on three of its hotels. Cladding is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of fire at Grenfell Tower, in which at least 79 people are believed to have died. Nine people are still in hospital following the fire on 14 June, of which three are in critical care. Until now, safety fears over cladding have centred on council high rises, but concerns appear to reach beyond the housing sector. Premier Inn has told BBC Newsnight that cladding on its hotels in Maidenhead, Brentford and Tottenham did not appear to comply with government guidance for tall buildings - although it did appear to be a less flammable type than that used at Grenfell Tower. This video can not be played Watch BBC Newsnight's report on Premier Inn's urgent review into hotel cladding The hotel chain said an independent expert has assured them that the hotels were safe to stay open given their ""robust"" safety measures including fire detectors and smoke alarms in every room. The hotels do not operate a ""stay put"" policy and have multiple means of escape. Newsnight's Chris Cook said Premier Inn was just one of a long list of places that could have fire safety issues - and were only singled out by the programme because they responded so quickly and in full to his questions. London fire: Who are the victims? Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Flats acquired for Grenfell fire survivors Grenfell cladding 'linked to other fires' The Department for Communities and Local Government has written to all local authority and housing association chief executives to advise them on steps to take if tower blocks in their area are found to be covered in cladding they are concerned about. Read theletter here. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has also written to all MPs saying landlords of the 11 affected buildings have been told to inform their tenants - once done, the areas could be identified to the public. Only Camden, Manchester and Plymouth are named in his letter, which also says the Army has been assisting with building repairs. Michelle Urquhart has lived intower blocks in the Camden boroughfor 50 years. She said she was ""absolutely furious"" when she found out Bray Tower, where she lives, is covered in potentially dangerous cladding. Ms Urquhart said: ""They have been fobbing us off, we've had letters to say ""oh everything is fine, it's fireproof"", and then we got a letter today to say the polythene is in the middle. ""All the neighbours are going mad, we all want to know why they weren't honest with us from the beginning. ""If they didn't know then they shouldn't have reassured us."" The prime minister's spokesman said extra checks by the fire service would determine whether the 11 high-rise buildings found to have this type of cladding were safe and what - if any - action needed to be taken. He pointed out that a failed cladding test did not necessarily mean a building was unsafe - that would depend on the amount of cladding used and where it was fitted. Arconic, an engineering and manufacturing company, said one of its products, Reynobond PE (polyethylene) - an aluminium composite material - was ""used as one component in the overall cladding system"" of Grenfell Tower. ""We will fully support the authorities as they investigate this tragedy,"" a spokesman for the US-based firm said. The BBC has established that Reynobond PE was issued a certificate in the UK in 1997 allowing it to be used on high-rise buildings. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said he thought the Grenfell cladding was banned in the UK. This video can not be played Mohammed Abdur Rahim, who lost family in the fire, says a third world country would have handled it better In the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, councils were told to give the government samples of cladding used in their tower blocks for testing. Cladding is typically fitted to the outside of high-rise buildings to improve insulation and tidy up the appearance of the exterior. A Downing Street spokeswoman said no-one would be left to live in unsafe buildings. ""They will be rehoused if they need to be and landlords will be asked to provide alternative accommodation where that's possible,"" she said. Arnold Tarling, a member of the Association for Specialist Fire Protection, told BBC 5 live that removing the cladding around the country could cost ""hundreds of millions of pounds"". Samples from the tower block in Camden were found to be a safety concern, and are now removed Tests showed that decorative cladding around Village 135, a tower block in south Manchester, could have been made with the same materials as the Grenfell Tower. As a result, that cladding would be replaced ""as soon as possible so that residents feel reassured"", Wythenshawe Housing Group said. Another of the blocks found to havepotentially hazardous cladding is on Camden Council's Chalcots estate, in north London. The panels, found to have been made up of aluminium with a polyethylene core, are now being removed, the council said. Its leader Georgia Gould said the panels were ""not to the standard"" that the council had commissioned, and it would be informing the contractor behind the work that they would be taking legal advice. Three tower blocks in Plymouthhave also been found to be clad in panels which raise safety concerns. One is Mount Wise Towers, which caught fire in February, with one resident having to run out of the building with her seven-week-old daughter. This video can not be played Resident Chloe Brewster speaks about a fire at a Plymouth tower block in February Plymouth Community Homes said it was taking immediate precautions andall three tower blocks would have their cladding removed. ""We are completing further checks to ensure all fire doors remain in place and closers are fitted and operating as they should be,"" it added. ""We are installing additional fire protection to the interiors to the stairwells of each tower today as an extra fire safety measure."" By Jim Reed, BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme This video can not be played 'These things should have been checked out before people moved in' Residents at a 22-storey block of flats in Tottenham, north London, have been sent an email - seen by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme - saying the building has the same cladding as Grenfell Tower. Rivers Apartments - which is shared ownership, so classed as social housing - was built just two years ago, with the cladding incorporated as part of the design. It is understood the block is clad in Reynobond PE, the same brand of cladding believed to have been used on Grenfell Tower. The programme was told the tower passed all building regulation checks by Haringey Council. Unlike Grenfell Tower, this block does contain modern safety features, such as a sprinkler system. Newlon Housing Trust, the housing association that part-owns the block, said it had arranged with the fire service to carry out more checks. It is still waiting for final test results to confirm it is the most flammable type of cladding. It says the cladding on the building may have to be replaced. Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday that she expected to name the judge who would lead a public inquiry into the fire within the next few days. Council boss quits amid Grenfell criticism Sprinkler plan for tower blocks Trauma counselling for tower firefighters Since the fire on 14 June, more than Â£700,000 had been paid out to survivors - none of which would have to be repaid, said Mrs May. Resources, including healthcare and accommodation, would be available to everyone affected by the fire, regardless of their immigration status, she added. The fire destroyed 151 homes - most in the tower block itself, but also a number of surrounding properties. Mrs May said that 164 ""suitable properties"" had now been found for those made homeless, and they were being checked over before residents can move in. These include 68 in a new development nearby. The Scottish government and Welsh ministers have said that none of their council high-rise blocks has cladding of the type said to have been used in the Grenfell Tower. Similarly, there is no evidence of Grenfell Tower-type cladding used on tower blocks managed by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Checks on other high-rise buildings owned by housing associations or private developers in Northern Ireland and Scotland are continuing.

PM to address EU leaders on citizen rights,"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: Dreaming of a Brexit 'miracle' European Council President Donald Tusk has quoted lyrics from John Lennon's Imagine to suggest the door remains open to the UK staying in the EU. Ahead of a Brussels summit he said of that prospect: ""You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."" Theresa May, who has said the UK will honour the referendum vote to leave, was due to outline her plans for the issue of expats' rights to EU leaders. Speaking at the summit she hailed the ""constructive"" start to Brexit talks. The gathering of 28 EU member states' leaders comes the day after measures to enable Brexit dominated the Queen's Speech. Mrs May's Conservatives are still trying to secure the Commons support needed to pass their programme. Kuenssberg: The Brexit expats questions Brexit and security loom large at EU summit Bill-by-bill guide: Queen's SpeechBill-by-bill guide: Queen's Speech Corbyn attacks 'threadbare' programme Mrs May told reporters as she arrived: ""I'm going to be setting out some of the UK's plans particularly on how we propose to protect the rights of EU citizens and UK citizens as we leave. ""That's been an important issue. We've wanted it to be one of the early issues to be considered in the negotiations. That is now the case. That work is starting."" She also said she would be raising other important issues, including how European leaders could work together to stop the spread of extremism online and ensure there was no ""safe space"" online for terrorists. Brexit negotiations began on Monday. Speaking before the summit, Mr Tusk said: ""It is a most difficult process, for which the EU is well prepared. You can hear different predictions coming from different people about the possible outcome of these negotiations - hard Brexit, soft Brexit or no deal. ""Some of my British friends have even asked me whether Brexit could be reversed and whether I could imagine an outcome where the UK stays part of the EU. ""I told them that, in fact, the European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve. So, who knows. You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."" His comments were raised at a press conference in Brussels later with President of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, who said: ""In Europe, I never have illusions because I don't want to lose them."" But Mr Tusk said: ""I still have dreams. Politics without dreams - it would be a nightmare."" ""If you had my experience from my part of Europe you would know that miracles do happen and some of my political dreams have come true... but at the same time I am a realist, this is why first of all we should start our negotiations as effectively as possible and the final decision... this is a decision for Britain and UK citizens."" Earlier Chancellor Philip Hammond toldBBC Radio 4's Todayhe wanted an early agreement on the principle of a ""transitional"" period to reassure business there would not be a ""cliff edge"" when the UK leaves the EU at the end of March 2019. He also denied that a series of controversial Conservative manifesto commitments had been dumped in the wake of the disappointing election result. He told Today that the manifesto was for a five-year period, but the Queen's Speech programme had been for the first two years, which are dominated by the process of Brexit. Both the UK and the rest of the EU say they want to come to an arrangement to secure the status of about 3.2 million EU nationals living in the UK, and 900,000 Britons overseas, but nothing has been decided so far. UK opposition parties have urged the government to make a unilateral guarantee to the EU migrants - but ministers have insisted a reciprocal deal is needed to ensure British expats are protected. This video can not be played Philip Hammond on Today backs a post-Brexit transitional arrangement Mrs May will not be present when the leaders of the remaining 27 EU states hold a brief discussion about Brexit after her presentation. They are expected to consider the relocation of the two EU agencies governing medicine and banking which are currently based in London. Of the 27 bills in the Queen's Speech, eight related to Brexit and its impact on immigration, trade and sectors such as fisheries and farming. At the centre was the so-called Repeal Bill, which will copy over all EU laws into UK law, with Parliament then deciding which bits to retain. With MPs voting on the speech next week, the Conservatives are hoping an  arrangement with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party will be in place to support their minority government. But despite both sides saying they were confident of a deal being agreed, sources suggested to the BBC the DUP were ""getting to the limits"" of what they were requesting in return for supporting the Tories - with the chances of a plausible long-term deal, rather than a short-term bargain to get the Queen's Speech through, diminishing.

Speaking in the Commons after the Queen's Speech, Mrs May said there was a ""possibility"" the bill, which is needed to stop EU law applying in the UK, could require Holyrood's consent. At the two-day summit, where the agenda is formally dominated by immigration, security and the economy, Mrs May will also brief her counterparts on the UK's commitment to a new Â£75m plan designed to stem the flow of illegal migrants from Africa to Europe.

School in 'lockdown' after shooting,"Police were outside the school on Thursday A man ran into a primary school to escape shots being fired from a car outside the building. Two shots were fired at the man, who was on a bicycle outside St Edmund's RC Primary School and Nursery in Springhill, Birmingham. The man later fled and the school was locked ""to maintain the safety of everyone"", said police. A staff member's car was damaged but no-one was hurt. Police said the shooting appeared to be targeted. More updates on this story Officers were at the school on Thursday to reassure people. ""It is not believed that the school or any of the children or staff were the target of the attack. ""We are still searching for the victim, who is also thought not to have been injured, and the offender who made off in the vehicle,"" said West Midlands Police. Det Insp Richard Marsh said a number of people were outside the school at the time and he urged them to contact the force. ""We are still trying to identify the vehicle and the public could have crucial information to assist our enquiries,"" he said. ""We appreciate this will have caused some shock in the community, but we believe this was a targeted incident unconnected to the school. ""We are still trying the establish the full circumstances behind what happened and we need the victim to come forward, along with the help of witnesses in the area at the time.""

UK rail ticket machines hit by IT glitch,"Rail ticket machines across the UK fell out of service this morning preventing commuters from using them to pay fares. On-screen messages said they had ""no online connectivity"", making them unable to send payment card details. The issue began at about 06:00 BST. A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) told the BBC the issue had been resolved shortly before 09:00 BST. He added that the fault appeared to have been with the software and systems provided by Scheidt & Bachmann. A spokeswoman for the German firm was unable to provide additional information. RDG later issued a statement saying: ""We're sorry that some customers were inconvenienced by a technical fault which affected one supplier's system, which meant that some train companies' ticket machines, not all, couldn't authorise card payments."" Southern Rail, Greater Anglia, Great Northern and ScotRail were among those affected to have apologised via Twitter after customer complaints. Manchester's Metrolink confirmed that ticket machines for its tram network had also been disrupted as a consequence. ""The problem is now fixed and all our machines are able to accept credit cards,"" added a spokesman for Thameslink. ""Anyone who was unable to buy a ticket as a result of the problem will not be penalised."" Ticket machines at Winchester station were still said to be having problems after 13:00 BST However, notices on others' ticket machines suggested they were still having a problem at lunchtime. Customers were still able to buy tickets online via the web and apps while the faults were ongoing.

Prince Harry: No one wants to be king,"No-one in the Royal Family wants to be king or queen, Prince Harry has told a US magazine, but adds: ""We will carry out our duties at the right time."" ""Is there any one of the Royal Family who wants to be king or queen? I don't think so,"" he toldNewsweek,external. And he said the royals were doing it ""for the greater good of the people"". The prince also spoke about walking in the funeral procession for his mother, Princess Diana, when he was 12, saying no child ""should be asked to do that"". In 1997, Harry joined his father, the Prince of Wales, grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, 15-year-old brother, the Duke of Cambridge, and uncle, Earl Spencer, in the procession through the streets of London. Harry, whorecently said he had received counselling to cope with the death of his motherin a car crash in Paris, said: ""My mother had just died, and I had to walk a long way behind her coffin, surrounded by thousands of people watching me while millions more did on television. ""I don't think any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances. I don't think it would happen today."" The Prince also talked about the role he and his brother are taking in what he called ""modernising the monarchy"". He also paid tribute to his ""remarkable"" grandmother for letting the younger royals do things their own way. ""The Queen has been fantastic in letting us choose,"" he says. ""She tells us to take our time and really think things through."" Prince Harry standing between his brother and father at Diana's funeral By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent This is an interview that will generate some sympathy - a prince still struggling with the death of his mother - and raise some eyebrows. Such a reaction will be prompted by Harry's suggestion that the Windsors aren't exactly falling over each other to fill what his mother once called ""the top job"", when it becomes vacant. The Queen's heirs, he implies, will take on a position of enormous privilege because they have to, not because they want to. And despite the prince's important caveat that the royals do what they do for the greater good and not for themselves, his words have generated the Daily Mail headline ""Harry: No Royal Wants Throne"". Prince Harry is on marginally safer ground talking about his mother's funeral even though his comments do contain an implied criticism of his immediate family. They could have decided in 1997 that he was too young to walk, so publicly, behind Diana's coffin. There is one other striking aspect to this lengthy article.  It contains no comments, by Harry, about his father. Prince Harry told the magazine, which says it was given access to the prince for nearly a year, that he was ""involved in modernising the British monarchy"". ""It's a tricky balancing act. We don't want to dilute the magic. The British public and the whole world need institutions like it."" Harry praised Princess Diana for playing a part in showing him an ordinary life, saying people would be ""amazed"" at how ordinary his and Prince William's lives were. ""I do my own shopping. Sometimes... I worry someone will snap me with their phone. But I am determined to have a relatively normal life and if I am lucky enough to have children, they can have one too. ""Even if I was king, I would do my own shopping.""

Mosul mosque's ruin 'shows IS defeat',"This video can not be played Blast in Iraq destroys Great Mosque of al-Nuri Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi says the destruction of an ancient mosque in the city of Mosul is ""an official declaration of defeat"" by so-called Islamic State (IS). Iraqi forces say IS blew up the Great Mosque of al-Nuri and its famous leaning minaret as jihadists battled to stop advancing pro-government troops. IS said American aircraft had destroyed the complex, a claim denied by the US. Aerial photographs show the complex largely destroyed. The mosque, which was more than 800 years old, was where in July 2014 IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi demanded allegiance in his first and only public appearance following the declaration days earlier of a ""caliphate"". Why Mosulâs Great Mosque of al-Nuri mattered WATCH: Mosul from above in 360 video Why IS militants destroy ancient sites The Iraqi towns still under IS control The mosque's destruction has brought widespread condemnation. Lazare Eloundou Assomo, deputy director of the UN's cultural organisation Unesco, said the ""iconic"" mosque could have helped foster ""reconciliation and peace"" in Iraq in future. The Iraqi commander in charge of the offensive to retake Mosul said troops were within 50m (160ft) of the mosque when IS ""committed another historical crime"". Footage released by the Iraqi forces shows the ancient landmark being demolished. The Iraqi military provided this image showing the destruction at the mosque compound Previous reports said IS had rigged the mosque with explosives to stop the advance of Iraqi troops, but that local residents had until now prevented the militants from blowing it up. IS says the mosque was destroyed by a US air strike but has not provided any evidence to support this. Iraqi forces are one street away from entering the mosque site, according to state TV, and more details may emerge if they do so. One local resident, Ahmed Saied, told Reuters news agency that ""when I looked out of the window and saw the minaret was no longer there, I felt a part of me had died."" But 38-year-old Yasser Ali told the Agence France-Presse that while it was ""Mosul's symbol and icon, there are people who have been killed. They are much more precious than the minaret"". The al-Nuri mosque dated back to 1172 and was Mosul's most famous Sunni mosque. It was named after the Muslim leader, Nur al-Din Mahmoud Zanki, famous for waging jihad against Christian crusaders. The leaning minaret, covered with elaborate brickwork, was nicknamed ""the hunchback"". The BBC gained access to the site of the destroyed mosque on Thursday A month after IS forces overran Mosul in June 2014, Baghdadi gave a Friday sermon from the pulpit inside the mosque and spoke about the newly-proclaimed caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia, by God's deputy on Earth, or caliph. The militant group flew its black flag from the famous minaret and the building became the centre of IS activities. IS fighters have shown scant regard for history or culture in the three years since their lightning advance across northern Iraq, says Paul Adams, BBC News world affairs correspondent. Destruction of the mosque, most observers assumed, would mark the group's final act of angry defiance before finally losing their grip on Mosul. Destroying the landmark would perhaps be better for IS than seeing it in the hands of its enemies - a scenario that would be a bigger symbolic blow for the group, adds BBC Monitoring journalist Mina al-Lami. Moreover, IS has openly said it will pursue scorched earth tactics in Mosul, she says. It has already targeted several mosques and tombs, includingThe Shrine of Yunus. This video can not be played The BBC filmed these pictures of the mosque from across the front line just hours before it was destroyed Meanwhile, the group's official line that the mosque was destroyed in US air strikes has inspired defiance and threats of retaliation among its supporters online, according to BBC Monitoring. Sympathisers said Iraqi forces believed that destroying the mosque would break IS militants' spirit but that instead it would make them more determined to fight on. Thousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, supported by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, have been involved in the battle to retake the key city since17 October last year. The government announced the full ""liberation"" of eastern Mosul in January, but the west of the city has presented a more difficult challenge, with its narrow, winding streets. Battle for Mosul: The story so far Russia 'may have killed IS head Baghdadi' The UN has warned that IS may be holding more than 100,000 people in the city as human shields. On Sunday, commanders announced the start of the ""final chapter"" of the offensive, with Iraq's counter-terrorism service, army and federal police attacking the Old City from all directions. The army said it believed there were no more than 300 militants left in the city, compared with almost 6,000 in October. On Tuesday, an Iraqi military statement on state TV said IS had lost control and civilians previously trapped in the Old City were being released. The US military has hailed gains by Iraqi forces but says the full liberation of the city from IS control is not yet complete. Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry said on Thursday that it was ""possible to say with a high degree of certainty"" that one of its air strikes had killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria. Russiaannounced earlier this monththat it was investigating whether a 28 May air strike on Raqqa had killed the IS leader.

Leader outlines forthcoming business,"Statement on Grenfell Tower fire from Prime Minister Theresa May There were two other statements: the first on terrorism, the second on forthcoming business The rest of the day's debate was on the Queen's Speech Esther Webber and Patrick Cowling A bill-by-bill guide to the proposed legislation in the 2017 Queen's Speech. House of CommonsParliament Theresa
May made a statement to Parliament on the Grenfell Tower Fire, in west London,
which killed at least 79 people. The
prime minister told MPs the cladding used on some tower blocks in the UK is ""combustible""
according to government test results. Mrs
May said that cladding on all relevant tower blocks was being sent for tests. And
she also said she expected to name the judge who will lead a public inquiry
into the fire within the next few days. During
the debate on the Queenâs Speech later, the new Labour MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, told the
Commons the ""burnt-out carcass"" of the tower revealed the ""true
face"" of her constituency, with poverty, malnutrition and overcrowding
existing alongside wealth. In
her maiden speech, she criticised people who think social tenants have ""no
right to live in an area like desirable Kensington"", and called for fire
service cuts to be reversed. House of LordsParliament The Lords adjourns for the day and will return on Monday at 14:30 BST. Queen's Speech debate House of LordsParliament Responding to the day's debate for the government, Foreign Office Minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon says as the UK goes out onto the international stage we should be mindful of the ""values that bind us together"". The UK will seek ""peace, stability and prosperity"" as we ""reset the UK's role in the world"" after Brexit, he tells peers. He highlights the importance of relations with the Commonwealth and the trade bill outlined in the Queen's Speech. Queen's Speech debate House of LordsParliament Labour spokesman Lord Tunnicliffe says armed forces have been ""cut to the bone"". ""If Labour had allowed them to become so run-down, there would have been howls of protest,"" he claims. He points to comments from the US defence secretary suggesting the UK will not be able to remain a ""full partner"" to the United States with military resources at current levels, ""no matter how many times the prime minister holds hands with Donald Trump. UK Prime Minister Theresa May says she will give plans to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK. Queen's Speech debate House of LordsParliament Responding to the debate for the Lib Dems, Lord Bruce of Bennachie focuses on international aid. He says ""the enemies or critics of aid do not let go"" - holding up a copy of the Daily Mail - and he ""welcomes the secretary of state's defence of the international aid department"". ""We've got to be with the world, not turn our backs on it,"" he argues. House of CommonsParliament The Commons has now adjourned and will return on Monday at 14:30 BST for continuation of debate on the Queen's Speech. Adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Responding, Health Minister Philip Dunne says: ""I don't stand here with all the answers to all the questions"" as ""many decisions will be taken by clinicians"". He cites ""legitimate concerns"" raised over training at Kent and Canterbury Hospital, and says staffing has been an ""ongoing challenge"". Adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Helen Whately opens her adjournment debate on the future of Kent and Canterbury Hospital. She says ""there are thousands who would not be here today"" without it but people are ""worried because there is a big question mark"" over its sustainability. Acute heart and stroke services were recently transferred to Ashford and Margate. House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Suri says that he is concerned about the EU's ability and commitment to impose economic sanctions on countries like Russia after the UK leaves the organisation. He says that the UK has consistently been the strongest advocate in the commission and that we have experts in targeted sanctions who do a ""significant proportion"" of the heavy lifting for the EU when it comes to this. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament David Gauke is making his Commons debut as work and pensions secretary, and he echoes other members in describing the Grenfell Tower fire as a ""terrible tragedy"". He tells the House his department is ensuring survivors' benefit claims are treated with ""sensitivity and flexibility"". He says more generally his government is committed to providing ""work to those who can and help to those who can't"" as part of their objective of ""fairness for all"". Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams winds up the day's debate for Labour, paying tribute in particular to her colleague Emma Dent Coad who she says spoke ""so movingly about the devastating effect"" of the Grenfell Tower fire. She expresses ""profound disappointment"" with the Queen's Speech on behalf of all those who ""voted against austerity"" at the election. ""The government's warm words of making our country fairer ring hollow,"" she claims. House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Alli reminds peers that it is the 50th anniversary of the start of the process to decriminalise homosexuality, which he says was by no means a perfect piece of legislation but began the process of bringing the lives of gay men from the shadows and into the open. He says it is easy to forget how extraordinary the UK is and how extraordinary the people are. ""We tolerate and celebrate the diversity of our land."" Lord Alli tells peers that ""divided people are a weaker people"" and that equality is not just an issue for those affected but speaks to the character of our country. He also warns that ""too often"" it is the big corporations who drive the international agenda; ""trade for hunger, disease for keeping the medicine prices competitive, supporting oppressive regimes, and selling arms to people who have no business owning them"".

House of LordsParliament Non-affiliated peer Baroness Tonge says that she is concerned about the future funding of international sexual and reproductive health during the Trump administration in the United States, after theJanuary announcement of a ban on federal money going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions. Baroness Tonge says that it is ""simply impossible"" to work in this field without mentioning abortions at some stage. She tells peers that 22 million unsafe abortions are performed every year leading to 50-70,000 maternal deaths, and muses ""I wonder if Donald Trump will support the existing children of those motherless families."" ""He has become the grim reaper of women's lives in the poorest countries."" Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament The new Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, Simon Clarke, is giving his maiden speech. He says it's fitting that his constituency produced Captain Cook as the UK prepares to go on a journey of discovery after Brexit. He says he is ""passionate about helping people to help themselves"" and that's something he wants to pursue on behalf of constituents. Esther WebberBBC News Several Conservative backbenchers used the first day of debate on the Queen's Speech to pick apart their party's election campaign. On Wednesday in the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg compared the ""strong and stable"" slogan to Stanley Baldwin's ""safety first"" message in the 1929 election, condemning them both as ""deeply unappealing"". He said Conservatives underperformed at the election because ""voters do not feel that we are on their side - they feel instead that it is business as normal"" whereas they should be showing ""we can help them lead better, more prosperous lives"". Nigel Evans attacked the ""toxic rubbish"" in the manifesto, including the promise of a free vote on fox-hunting in the manifesto, saying that even in his rural constituency it was seen as ""irrelevant"". He added he was ""delighted that some of the people involved in putting those things in the manifesto are no longer working at 10 Downing Street and that there is now a change in style of governance"". George Freeman, who was until recently a policy aide to the prime minister, was more conciliatory, but emphasised the government would have to pay more attention to young voters and public service professionals who want a change after ""seven years of a particular model of austerity"". House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Judd begins his contribution by speaking of the Grenfell tower fire, saying that although he is ""greatly reassured"" by the full public inquiry, he has ""one big anxiety"" - that in the desire to learn the lessons of the disaster, peers do not overlook ""our own responsibility"". He asks what the values are on which our country is operating at the moment - and whether we are too preoccupied with cost and managerial considerations. Lord Judd also talks of the recent terror attacks in the UK and tells peers that he worries about the ""erosion of our values and equalities that make our society worth protecting"", saying that it is at the times of the greatest pressures that we must be firmest. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Zac Goldsmith is making his first speech since his comeback - and is reminded by another MP, ""you can't be a maiden twice"". He says low-rise, high-density, street-based design is a better solution for council housing and that this issue has taken on a ""grim relevance"" in light of recent events. ""Now is surely the time to look at a different way of doing things,"" he argues. Â© 2025 BBC.

Jailed and ransomed in Libya,"Back home in Nigeria, Seun says he regrets ever setting out for Europe It was called ""Morning Tea"" - a brutal flogging with a hosepipe. Every morning for four months, Seun Femi's captors beat him at a makeshift prison in Libya. ""They would flog my head, my hands, my bum,"" says the 34-year-old. ""The guard would beat me until he got tired."" Two of Seun's fingers were broken during one of the brutal sessions. But the Nigerian says it could have been far worse. One man was beaten to death in front of him. ""I thought I was going to die in that prison,"" he says. Seun was one of the tens of thousands of West Africans who cross the Sahara Desert into Libya every year, from where they hope to be trafficked by boat to Europe. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates there are between 700,000 and one million people in Libya awaiting their chance to cross the Mediterranean. It was always a dark and desperate journey but now appears to be increasingly dangerous as undocumented migrants fall prey to militias and criminal gangs in war-torn Libya. Earlier this year,the IOM reportedthat African migrants were being sold by their captors in ""slave markets"" in the south-western Libyan city of Sabha. It was in the same city that Seun says he was held with about 300 other African migrants for ransom. ""We thought the traffickers were taking us to a place to stay and not a place to lock us up,"" he says. Seun says a hunchbacked Libyan called Ali ran the makeshift prison. African migrants sold in Libya 'slave markets' 'My sister drowned getting to Europe' The start of the desert trek from Africa to Europe Why is Libya so lawless? It was a half-constructed building. The male migrants, mainly from Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal, were separated into large rooms, each called a ghetto. Seun was held in the Nigeria ghetto. In two of the ghettos, called Ghana and VIP (for very important person), the guards would extort a higher ransom in order for the migrants to be freed. ""We were packed on the floor like sardines when we tried to sleep,"" says Seun. There was little food but enough bottled water as otherwise the migrants would die of thirst in the stifling heat. Up to one million migrants are thought to be in Libya attempting to reach Europe The brutal business model was simple, says Seun. Guards with nicknames like ""Rambo"" would beat the migrants and then hand them a phone. ""They would let us phone our people once a day,"" he said. ""They would whip us while we were on the call so our families would get the message. We would beg them to send us money."" On Tuesday, the Italian authorities said they had arrested a notorious human trafficker known as Rambo on charges of torturing and killing migrants but it is not possible to verify whether it was the same man. Seun needed to a pay a ransom of approximately $500. It was to be deposited in a bank account in Nigeria. But he did not have the money. He urged his ex-girlfriend to sell his car. ""It was in bad shape. It took three months for her to sell it,"" says Seun. ""There were no buyers."" The irony is that Seun, a taxi driver, had no money to repair the vehicle in the first place, which is why he decided to go to Libya. This video can not be played How I smuggle people from Nigeria to Europe His ransom was finally paid last December. Seun thought he was free. But then he was told he needed to pay a ""gate-fee"" of approximately $50. He had no money. But a Nigerian baker who sold bread at the prison took pity on him and paid the fee. ""He helped me a lot by taking me out of that place - it's bad, very bad,"" says Seun. Seun then paid the man back by working in his bakery for several weeks in Sabha. He then pushed on to Tripoli but was detained by Libyan police earlier this year and held at a detention centre. He was repatriated to Nigeria in April. Now back in Lagos, he has no work, and rents a small dark room in one of the city's sprawling slums. He is trying to piece his life back together. He hopes to raise cash to buy a car and work as a taxi driver again. He wants to move to a better area so his young daughter can visit. He regrets ever setting out to Europe. ""The desert is such a dangerous place,"" he says. ""Many people died on the way. No-one should follow that path.""

How do you cope when your home burns down?,"As the survivors of Grenfell Tower will be finding out, rebuilding your life when you've lost everything takes a while. After the initial shock wears off, and you're left with nothing - literally nothing - what do you do? There are both practical and emotional hurdles to overcome. Three people to whom it has happened have spoken to the BBC. Michelle Drew's home in Bath went up in flames in May. She was in her house with her three children when a fire started in her autistic son's sensory tent. The fire spread to the nearby sofa and blind, across the living room and eventually the whole house. She and the children all escaped the fire without physical injury but lost all of their possessions. ""We just had the clothes we were standing in,"" Mrs Drew says. ""We didn't even have shoes on. I just stood outside the house and watched the fire go up through the roof. ""We were without anything. We lost our home. We had nowhere to live."" Fortunately, the family had insurance, but until some money was released, they made do with what other people gave them and lived with friends and family. Valuables such as jewellery and her husband's extensive film collection were destroyed, along with sentimental items including a hospital scan of a pregnancy that ended in miscarriage. But the main impact has been on the children. This video can not be played Watch: Michelle Drew returned to the scene of the fire ""With autism, routine and ritual is so important. My son really had problems dealing with any changes. I mean, he couldn't cope with having a new pair of shoes and here we were telling him he's got a new house and all of his clothes and toys are gone. He's really feeling the effects of it - it's chaos. ""We're in a new home now but he's still suffering - he's badly behaved, has sensory problems and is really destructive. But everyone's been really great, his school has been really helpful. ""My youngest daughter hashypermobility syndrome,externaland has difficulty getting about - and someone gave us a pushchair. My other daughter needed asthma medication and the head teacher of her school came and opened up especially so we could get the medicine from the supply she keeps at school."" Mrs Drew says it took a couple of weeks for the impact to hit her: ""The reality of what could have happened is terrifying. I'm just grateful my kids are alive."" Does she have any advice for people who may find themselves in a similar situation? ""Surround yourself with people who care about you. Concentrate on what you've got. Try not to think of what you've lost, no good will come of that. ""But you know, the thing that will stick with me is the kindness we experienced. Everyone was fantastic. People went out of their way to help, not just on the day it happened but for weeks afterwards."" Maria De Vita's neighbour died in the fire WhenMaria De Vitaheard glass smashing at her home in Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, she thought it was someone outside doing a spot of late-night recycling. She later discovered it was one of next door's windows exploding in afire in which her neighbour died. Ms De Vita woke her two young daughters and they left the house with nothing. The girls even had to go to school the next day dressed only in their pyjamas. ""The school was so kind, they gave them some spare bits of uniform,"" says Ms De Vita, who did not have any contents insurance. ""Everything has gone. Just gone. We'll have to start from the beginning again. ""Don't get me wrong, I'm very appreciative of the fact we're all here and alive. But dealing with the aftermath is horrendous. ""We stayed with various friends for a bit, and now I've got housing benefit and we're in a B&B 40 miles away from our hometown. It would take the kids four hours each way to get to school, so they're not going at the moment. ""We're staying in a quite a rough area and my kids were threatened when I took them to the park, so we don't want to go out. They've both been affected. They're clingy, and we can't talk about the fire as it upsets them so much. They have taken to calling it 'erif' - which is 'fire' backwards - and can't speak the word fire aloud. ""I suppose we're managing because we have no choice, but to be honest, we're struggling. We will make it but I can't yet see the light at the end of the tunnel. ""People have been so generous - one lady offered me a sofa - but because we don't have anywhere to live I have to turn down offers of help. ""On the one hand, it's restored my faith in humanity, but then I have to reject their kindness. ""All I want is to go home."""" Martin Sigstonlost all of his belongings in a fire just before Christmas in 2001. ""There was shock and horror and emptiness. When you see your home on fire it's partly panic but at the same time you know you can't do anything."" When the Grenfell Tower fire happened, he was moved to post some advice on his Facebook page, letting people know the best ways they could help survivors. Speaking from experience, Mr Sigston, who's from Sussex, pointed out that the things people need are not always obvious. ""It's a daily grind. You're trying to organise yourself and you don't even have basic things like a pen and paper. And you need something to carry it in. ""And there are things you've lost that you don't remember until you need them, and it all really adds up. It sounds silly and petty, but even things like ink cartridges for printers need to be replaced. ""I was insured, but it was still a nightmare. Very difficult. Some of my friends said it could be exciting and a new start. I remember standing in the middle of Ikea and just being too drained, I didn't know where to begin. ""The thing is, I didn't want new furniture or a big TV. I just wanted my own stuff. ""It's like being bereaved. You don't actually get over it but you learn to live with it. It's a long slog, but it does get easier. ""If anyone was in my position I'd say: 'Just let it go. It's gone. ""It's really tough but you'll get there'."" Our homes and belongings tell the story of who we are, where we've been, and the people we love. Research into the psychology of ownership has shown that we come to see our possessions as extensions of ourselves. We place more value in something just as soon as we own it, and at a neural level, when we think about our stuff, the same regions light up in our brains as when we think about ourselves. Although it may seem trivial to worry about physical objects in the context of such a tragic loss of human life, when disaster survivors lose their homes and belongings, they often experience a profound sense of personal bereavement, as if a part of their ""selves"", their identity, their story, has gone forever. This is especially likely to be the case for any possessions that have come to be imbued with personal meaning, such as gifts received from loved ones, items acquired on cherished holidays, or family heirlooms. Indeed, part of the reason that many of our things mean so much to us is that we think about them in an almost magical way - for instance a gift from a loved one may feel as if it is imbued with the essence of that person, such that a physical replica would be no substitute. This magical thinking may also apply to the home itself, especially if it is filled with poignant memories of family events that have taken place there.

Terror attacks: Rudd announces review,"Statement on Grenfell Tower fire from Prime Minister Theresa May There were two other statements: the first on terrorism, the second on forthcoming business The rest of the day's debate was on the Queen's Speech Esther Webber and Patrick Cowling A bill-by-bill guide to the proposed legislation in the 2017 Queen's Speech. House of CommonsParliament Theresa
May made a statement to Parliament on the Grenfell Tower Fire, in west London,
which killed at least 79 people. The
prime minister told MPs the cladding used on some tower blocks in the UK is ""combustible""
according to government test results. Mrs
May said that cladding on all relevant tower blocks was being sent for tests. And
she also said she expected to name the judge who will lead a public inquiry
into the fire within the next few days. During
the debate on the Queenâs Speech later, the new Labour MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, told the
Commons the ""burnt-out carcass"" of the tower revealed the ""true
face"" of her constituency, with poverty, malnutrition and overcrowding
existing alongside wealth. In
her maiden speech, she criticised people who think social tenants have ""no
right to live in an area like desirable Kensington"", and called for fire
service cuts to be reversed. House of LordsParliament The Lords adjourns for the day and will return on Monday at 14:30 BST. Queen's Speech debate House of LordsParliament Responding to the day's debate for the government, Foreign Office Minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon says as the UK goes out onto the international stage we should be mindful of the ""values that bind us together"". The UK will seek ""peace, stability and prosperity"" as we ""reset the UK's role in the world"" after Brexit, he tells peers. He highlights the importance of relations with the Commonwealth and the trade bill outlined in the Queen's Speech. Queen's Speech debate House of LordsParliament Labour spokesman Lord Tunnicliffe says armed forces have been ""cut to the bone"". ""If Labour had allowed them to become so run-down, there would have been howls of protest,"" he claims. He points to comments from the US defence secretary suggesting the UK will not be able to remain a ""full partner"" to the United States with military resources at current levels, ""no matter how many times the prime minister holds hands with Donald Trump. UK Prime Minister Theresa May says she will give plans to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK. Queen's Speech debate House of LordsParliament Responding to the debate for the Lib Dems, Lord Bruce of Bennachie focuses on international aid. He says ""the enemies or critics of aid do not let go"" - holding up a copy of the Daily Mail - and he ""welcomes the secretary of state's defence of the international aid department"". ""We've got to be with the world, not turn our backs on it,"" he argues. House of CommonsParliament The Commons has now adjourned and will return on Monday at 14:30 BST for continuation of debate on the Queen's Speech. Adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Responding, Health Minister Philip Dunne says: ""I don't stand here with all the answers to all the questions"" as ""many decisions will be taken by clinicians"". He cites ""legitimate concerns"" raised over training at Kent and Canterbury Hospital, and says staffing has been an ""ongoing challenge"". Adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Helen Whately opens her adjournment debate on the future of Kent and Canterbury Hospital. She says ""there are thousands who would not be here today"" without it but people are ""worried because there is a big question mark"" over its sustainability. Acute heart and stroke services were recently transferred to Ashford and Margate. House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Suri says that he is concerned about the EU's ability and commitment to impose economic sanctions on countries like Russia after the UK leaves the organisation. He says that the UK has consistently been the strongest advocate in the commission and that we have experts in targeted sanctions who do a ""significant proportion"" of the heavy lifting for the EU when it comes to this. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament David Gauke is making his Commons debut as work and pensions secretary, and he echoes other members in describing the Grenfell Tower fire as a ""terrible tragedy"". He tells the House his department is ensuring survivors' benefit claims are treated with ""sensitivity and flexibility"". He says more generally his government is committed to providing ""work to those who can and help to those who can't"" as part of their objective of ""fairness for all"". Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams winds up the day's debate for Labour, paying tribute in particular to her colleague Emma Dent Coad who she says spoke ""so movingly about the devastating effect"" of the Grenfell Tower fire. She expresses ""profound disappointment"" with the Queen's Speech on behalf of all those who ""voted against austerity"" at the election. ""The government's warm words of making our country fairer ring hollow,"" she claims. House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Alli reminds peers that it is the 50th anniversary of the start of the process to decriminalise homosexuality, which he says was by no means a perfect piece of legislation but began the process of bringing the lives of gay men from the shadows and into the open. He says it is easy to forget how extraordinary the UK is and how extraordinary the people are. ""We tolerate and celebrate the diversity of our land."" Lord Alli tells peers that ""divided people are a weaker people"" and that equality is not just an issue for those affected but speaks to the character of our country. He also warns that ""too often"" it is the big corporations who drive the international agenda; ""trade for hunger, disease for keeping the medicine prices competitive, supporting oppressive regimes, and selling arms to people who have no business owning them"".

House of LordsParliament Non-affiliated peer Baroness Tonge says that she is concerned about the future funding of international sexual and reproductive health during the Trump administration in the United States, after theJanuary announcement of a ban on federal money going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions. Baroness Tonge says that it is ""simply impossible"" to work in this field without mentioning abortions at some stage. She tells peers that 22 million unsafe abortions are performed every year leading to 50-70,000 maternal deaths, and muses ""I wonder if Donald Trump will support the existing children of those motherless families."" ""He has become the grim reaper of women's lives in the poorest countries."" Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament The new Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, Simon Clarke, is giving his maiden speech. He says it's fitting that his constituency produced Captain Cook as the UK prepares to go on a journey of discovery after Brexit. He says he is ""passionate about helping people to help themselves"" and that's something he wants to pursue on behalf of constituents. Esther WebberBBC News Several Conservative backbenchers used the first day of debate on the Queen's Speech to pick apart their party's election campaign. On Wednesday in the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg compared the ""strong and stable"" slogan to Stanley Baldwin's ""safety first"" message in the 1929 election, condemning them both as ""deeply unappealing"". He said Conservatives underperformed at the election because ""voters do not feel that we are on their side - they feel instead that it is business as normal"" whereas they should be showing ""we can help them lead better, more prosperous lives"". Nigel Evans attacked the ""toxic rubbish"" in the manifesto, including the promise of a free vote on fox-hunting in the manifesto, saying that even in his rural constituency it was seen as ""irrelevant"". He added he was ""delighted that some of the people involved in putting those things in the manifesto are no longer working at 10 Downing Street and that there is now a change in style of governance"". George Freeman, who was until recently a policy aide to the prime minister, was more conciliatory, but emphasised the government would have to pay more attention to young voters and public service professionals who want a change after ""seven years of a particular model of austerity"". House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Judd begins his contribution by speaking of the Grenfell tower fire, saying that although he is ""greatly reassured"" by the full public inquiry, he has ""one big anxiety"" - that in the desire to learn the lessons of the disaster, peers do not overlook ""our own responsibility"". He asks what the values are on which our country is operating at the moment - and whether we are too preoccupied with cost and managerial considerations. Lord Judd also talks of the recent terror attacks in the UK and tells peers that he worries about the ""erosion of our values and equalities that make our society worth protecting"", saying that it is at the times of the greatest pressures that we must be firmest. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Zac Goldsmith is making his first speech since his comeback - and is reminded by another MP, ""you can't be a maiden twice"". He says low-rise, high-density, street-based design is a better solution for council housing and that this issue has taken on a ""grim relevance"" in light of recent events. ""Now is surely the time to look at a different way of doing things,"" he argues. Â© 2025 BBC.

Church 'colluded' with abusive bishop,"Ball was jailed for sex offences against teenagers and young men between the 1970s and 1990s Senior figures in the Church of England ""colluded"" with a former bishop who abused young men, an independent review has found. Peter Ball, who is now 85, wasjailed for 32 monthsin October 2015 after admitting sex offences against 18 teenagers and young men. The former bishop of Lewes and bishop of Gloucester carried out the abuse between the 1970s and 1990s Dame Moira Gibb's review criticises ex-Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey. He accepted the criticism and apologised to Ball's victims. The review found Lord Carey received seven letters from families and individuals following the arrest and cautioning of Ball in 1992 for gross indecency - when he stood down as bishop of Gloucester - but failed to pass six of them to the police. He also chose not to put Ball on the Church of England's ""Lambeth List"", which names clergymen about whom questions of suitability for ministry have been raised. Ball was given funds authorised by Lord Carey to support him. Lord Carey also wrote to Ball's identical twin brother, Michael Ball - another bishop - in 1993 saying: ""I believed him to be basically innocent"". The current Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has asked Lord Carey to step down from his position as an honorary assistant bishop within the Diocese of Oxford. The Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend Dr Steven Croft,  said the archbishop had asked Lord Carey to talk to him. ""We have agreed to meet in the coming days for that conversation. ""In the meantime he has voluntarily agreed to step back from public ministry,"" he said in a statement. Lord Carey has apologised to the victims of Peter Ball Ball wasreleased from jailin February after serving 16 months. Dame Moira, a former senior social worker, said there was a failure of the Church to respond appropriately to misconduct over a period of many years. In her report, ""An Abuse of Faith"", Dame Moira said: ""Ball's priority was to protect and promote himself and he maligned the abused. ""The Church colluded with that rather than seeking to help those he had harmed, or assuring itself of the safety of others."" The review found that ""Ball's conduct has caused serious and enduring damage to the lives of many men... Peter Ball betrayed his Church and abused individual followers of that Church."" This video can not be played ""I believe that the church has made a lot of progress but it does have more to do,"" says Dame Moira Gibb In a statement, Lord Carey said the report made deeply uncomfortable reading. ""I accept the criticisms made of me. I apologise to the victims of Peter Ball. ""I believed Peter Ball's protestations and gave too little credence to the vulnerable young men and boys behind these allegations,"" he said. The Gibb report makes a number of recommendations about the Church, saying it should ""reaffirm and take steps to demonstrate the individual and collective accountability of bishops for the safety and protection of everyone within the church"". Lord Carey said: ""I believe the Church is now willing to 'think the unthinkable'. ""I hopeâ¦ Dame Moira Gibb's recommendations will make it less likely that a prolific abuser such as Peter Ball can flourish in the Church of England.""

High rise cladding 'combustible' says PM,"This video can not be played Theresa May is booed on her latest visit to meet Grenfell Tower residents Eleven residential high-rise buildings in eight local authority areas have been found with cladding which raises safety concerns. It comes as tests are being carried out on about 600 high rises across England. Meanwhile, the BBC has learned that Premier Inn is ""extremely concerned"" about cladding on three of its hotels. Cladding is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of fire at Grenfell Tower, in which at least 79 people are believed to have died. Nine people are still in hospital following the fire on 14 June, of which three are in critical care. Until now, safety fears over cladding have centred on council high rises, but concerns appear to reach beyond the housing sector. Premier Inn has told BBC Newsnight that cladding on its hotels in Maidenhead, Brentford and Tottenham did not appear to comply with government guidance for tall buildings - although it did appear to be a less flammable type than that used at Grenfell Tower. This video can not be played Watch BBC Newsnight's report on Premier Inn's urgent review into hotel cladding The hotel chain said an independent expert has assured them that the hotels were safe to stay open given their ""robust"" safety measures including fire detectors and smoke alarms in every room. The hotels do not operate a ""stay put"" policy and have multiple means of escape. Newsnight's Chris Cook said Premier Inn was just one of a long list of places that could have fire safety issues - and were only singled out by the programme because they responded so quickly and in full to his questions. London fire: Who are the victims? Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Flats acquired for Grenfell fire survivors Grenfell cladding 'linked to other fires' The Department for Communities and Local Government has written to all local authority and housing association chief executives to advise them on steps to take if tower blocks in their area are found to be covered in cladding they are concerned about. Read theletter here. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has also written to all MPs saying landlords of the 11 affected buildings have been told to inform their tenants - once done, the areas could be identified to the public. Only Camden, Manchester and Plymouth are named in his letter, which also says the Army has been assisting with building repairs. Michelle Urquhart has lived intower blocks in the Camden boroughfor 50 years. She said she was ""absolutely furious"" when she found out Bray Tower, where she lives, is covered in potentially dangerous cladding. Ms Urquhart said: ""They have been fobbing us off, we've had letters to say ""oh everything is fine, it's fireproof"", and then we got a letter today to say the polythene is in the middle. ""All the neighbours are going mad, we all want to know why they weren't honest with us from the beginning. ""If they didn't know then they shouldn't have reassured us."" The prime minister's spokesman said extra checks by the fire service would determine whether the 11 high-rise buildings found to have this type of cladding were safe and what - if any - action needed to be taken. He pointed out that a failed cladding test did not necessarily mean a building was unsafe - that would depend on the amount of cladding used and where it was fitted. Arconic, an engineering and manufacturing company, said one of its products, Reynobond PE (polyethylene) - an aluminium composite material - was ""used as one component in the overall cladding system"" of Grenfell Tower. ""We will fully support the authorities as they investigate this tragedy,"" a spokesman for the US-based firm said. The BBC has established that Reynobond PE was issued a certificate in the UK in 1997 allowing it to be used on high-rise buildings. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said he thought the Grenfell cladding was banned in the UK. This video can not be played Mohammed Abdur Rahim, who lost family in the fire, says a third world country would have handled it better In the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, councils were told to give the government samples of cladding used in their tower blocks for testing. Cladding is typically fitted to the outside of high-rise buildings to improve insulation and tidy up the appearance of the exterior. A Downing Street spokeswoman said no-one would be left to live in unsafe buildings. ""They will be rehoused if they need to be and landlords will be asked to provide alternative accommodation where that's possible,"" she said. Arnold Tarling, a member of the Association for Specialist Fire Protection, told BBC 5 live that removing the cladding around the country could cost ""hundreds of millions of pounds"". Samples from the tower block in Camden were found to be a safety concern, and are now removed Tests showed that decorative cladding around Village 135, a tower block in south Manchester, could have been made with the same materials as the Grenfell Tower. As a result, that cladding would be replaced ""as soon as possible so that residents feel reassured"", Wythenshawe Housing Group said. Another of the blocks found to havepotentially hazardous cladding is on Camden Council's Chalcots estate, in north London. The panels, found to have been made up of aluminium with a polyethylene core, are now being removed, the council said. Its leader Georgia Gould said the panels were ""not to the standard"" that the council had commissioned, and it would be informing the contractor behind the work that they would be taking legal advice. Three tower blocks in Plymouthhave also been found to be clad in panels which raise safety concerns. One is Mount Wise Towers, which caught fire in February, with one resident having to run out of the building with her seven-week-old daughter. This video can not be played Resident Chloe Brewster speaks about a fire at a Plymouth tower block in February Plymouth Community Homes said it was taking immediate precautions andall three tower blocks would have their cladding removed. ""We are completing further checks to ensure all fire doors remain in place and closers are fitted and operating as they should be,"" it added. ""We are installing additional fire protection to the interiors to the stairwells of each tower today as an extra fire safety measure."" By Jim Reed, BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme This video can not be played 'These things should have been checked out before people moved in' Residents at a 22-storey block of flats in Tottenham, north London, have been sent an email - seen by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme - saying the building has the same cladding as Grenfell Tower. Rivers Apartments - which is shared ownership, so classed as social housing - was built just two years ago, with the cladding incorporated as part of the design. It is understood the block is clad in Reynobond PE, the same brand of cladding believed to have been used on Grenfell Tower. The programme was told the tower passed all building regulation checks by Haringey Council. Unlike Grenfell Tower, this block does contain modern safety features, such as a sprinkler system. Newlon Housing Trust, the housing association that part-owns the block, said it had arranged with the fire service to carry out more checks. It is still waiting for final test results to confirm it is the most flammable type of cladding. It says the cladding on the building may have to be replaced. Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday that she expected to name the judge who would lead a public inquiry into the fire within the next few days. Council boss quits amid Grenfell criticism Sprinkler plan for tower blocks Trauma counselling for tower firefighters Since the fire on 14 June, more than Â£700,000 had been paid out to survivors - none of which would have to be repaid, said Mrs May. Resources, including healthcare and accommodation, would be available to everyone affected by the fire, regardless of their immigration status, she added. The fire destroyed 151 homes - most in the tower block itself, but also a number of surrounding properties. Mrs May said that 164 ""suitable properties"" had now been found for those made homeless, and they were being checked over before residents can move in. These include 68 in a new development nearby. The Scottish government and Welsh ministers have said that none of their council high-rise blocks has cladding of the type said to have been used in the Grenfell Tower. Similarly, there is no evidence of Grenfell Tower-type cladding used on tower blocks managed by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Checks on other high-rise buildings owned by housing associations or private developers in Northern Ireland and Scotland are continuing.

Duke of Edinburgh leaves hospital,"The Duke of Edinburgh has left hospital after being admitted two days ago as ""a precautionary measure"". Prince Philip was treated at the private King Edward VII Hospital, in central London, for an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman had said on Wednesday that the 96-year-old was in good spirits. The BBC understands his condition is ""not a cause for serious concern"". The duke left from the rear of the private hospital just before 10:00 BST on Thursday, and was driven away. He had been with the Queen at Trooping the Colour on Saturday and the opening day of Royal Ascot on Tuesday. However, after being admitted to hospital on Tuesday evening, he missed Wednesday's State Opening of Parliament, where his place was taken by the Prince of Wales, and a second day at Ascot. It is understood the duke was not admitted to hospital as an emergency but, on a doctor's advice, was driven from Windsor Castle. BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said that, given the duke was treated for a pre-existing condition, it is safe to assume he has been suffering from the recurrence of the bladder infection he suffered twice in 2012. Prince Philip has spent much of his life in good health, but he was treated for a blocked coronary artery in 2011 and the bladder infection the following year.

Leading universities rated 'bronze',"Several leading universities have failed to score highly in a new ranking of degree teaching standards. The Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) has rated 295 institutions bronze, silver or gold according to their standard of undergraduate teaching. Gold went to 59 and silver to 116. The lowest score of bronze was awarded to 56 - including the London School of Economics (LSE), Southampton, Liverpool, Goldsmiths and the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas). The new teaching rankings aim to help students make informed choices about degree courses, but many universities rated as bronze have criticised the system as unfair and unreliable. The TEF, which was introduced by the previous government, is being administered by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). Degree providers - a mixture of universities, colleges offering degree courses and alternative providers - could choose whether or not to take part. However, those awarded a bronze or higher - all institutions that took part, besides 64 who were given a provisional rating - are now set to be able to raise tuition fees, which currently stand at about Â£9,000, in line with inflation in 2018-19. Higher education providers are assessed on a range of measures, including facilities, student satisfaction, drop-out rates and whether students go on to employment or further study after graduating. It is based on data and not actual inspections of lectures or other teaching. Fourteen further education colleges that offer degrees received the top ranking of gold, alongside some elite universities. University grading system explained Differences between institutions, such as entry qualifications and subjects studied, were taken into account by an independent panel - made up of 27 academics, students, employers and experts in widening participation - which made the final awards. A gold award means a university is of the highest quality found in the UK, providing ""consistently outstanding teaching, learning and outcomes for its students"", while the silver award was given for consistently exceeding ""rigorous national quality requirements for UK higher education"" and bronze was awarded to those that met these national requirements. The ranking of provisional is given to those institutions that do not yet have sufficient data to be fully assessed. Hefce said the rankings measured the issues that students cared about: high-quality, engaged teaching a supportive, stimulating learning environment having the knowledge and skills they need to achieve their potential the opportunity to progress to a good job or further study Madeleine Atkins, chief executive of Hefce, said students invested significant amounts of time and money in their higher education and ""rightly expected a high-quality learning experience and outcomes"". Prof Chris Husbands, who chairs the TEF assessment panel, said he hoped the TEF ""provided clear and easily understandable ratings to be used alongside other information"". He stressed that within individual awards, universities may have elements of others - for example a university awarded bronze could have elements of gold or silver. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said the fact that some of the results ""seemed surprising"" suggested the TEF was working. ""The TEF would have comprehensively failed if it had simply replicated existing hierarchies,"" he said. ""It was always designed to do something different to other league tables and rankings - namely, to show where there are pockets of excellence that have been ignored and to encourage improvements elsewhere."" But he added that students should remember the TEF did not ""accurately reflects precisely what goes on in lecture halls"". ""I hope university applicants will use the results in their decision-making - but they should do so with caution, not least because the ratings are for whole universities rather than individual courses,"" he said. Sir Christopher Snowden, president and vice-chancellor of the University of Southampton, which received a bronze award, said it was ""hard to have confidence in a TEF which appears devoid of any meaningful assessment of teaching"". ""I know I am not alone in having deep concerns about its subjective assessment, its lack of transparency, and with different benchmarks for each institution removing any sense of equity and equality of assessment,"" he said. ""Our own student satisfaction metrics, including satisfaction with teaching, are better than some of those universities who have been awarded silver and gold today."" Southampton intends to appeal against its rating. Dr Deborah Johnston, pro-director of Soas, said she was concerned that the TEF did not ""accurately reflect what we do"". ""There is clearly also a London effect, with one in three London institutions achieving bronze, compared to just one in eight outside London. ""The metrics were not benchmarked for London, when we believe there was a significant difference for London institutions, for example in relation to retention rates due to costs of living."" In a statement, the University of Liverpool said it was disappointing to receive a bronze rating, but added that the TEF was ""not an absolute measure of quality"". ""By other widely recognised rankings, the University of Liverpool is consistently named in the top 200 universities globally,"" it said. ""Nonetheless, we're committed to improving against the measures used in the TEF."" Patrick Loughrey, warden of Goldsmiths said the TEF rating showed ""we must improve in a number of areas to ensure our students have the best possible experience during their time here"". ""We are already working hard to do this, and look forward to meeting these challenges together over the coming months and years"" he said. Interim director of the LSE, Prof Julia Black, said there were limits to the measures the TEF used, but added: ""We recognise that we have work to do, but we are confident that the education initiatives that we have under way will lead to improvements for our students.""

Two men killed as crane collapses,"The fire service's major incident unit was at the scene Two men have died and another man has been airlifted to hospital after a crane collapsed. A parent and child were taken to hospital as a precaution because the falling crane damaged a home. The airlifted man, believed to be the crane driver, has serious injuries but they are not thought to be life-threatening. An eyewitness said the crane ""slowly started tilting"" before it fell on to the building site in Crewe. Live updates on this and other stories for Staffordshire and Cheshire here Cheshire Fire and Rescue's major incident unit attended and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has been informed. The construction site belonged to Seddon Homes.  Its chief executive said he could not speculate as to the cause of the incident. Cheshire Police confirmed the fatalities at 22:50 BST on Wednesday, after the crane collapsed at a new housing estate on Dunwoody Way, near the Bombardier works, at 16:30. The force said the two people at the house were uninjured. This video can not be played Scene of crane collapse in Crewe A man who lives nearby, who only gave his name as Jason, told BBC Radio Stoke the crane - being used to help build new homes - had been lifting tools before it fell. ""They finished the work, the crane positioned itself facing Bombardier. ""The guys finished their work and they were still up there when all of a sudden, it slowly just started to tilt, tilt tilt. ""Guys started shouting and it completely fell on the floor."" Flowers and written tributes have been left Ch Supt Matt Welsted, of Cheshire Police, has said: ""This is a truly tragic incident, and our deepest condolences go out to the families affected at this extremely difficult time."" Following the collapse, police closed Dunwoody Way at the junction of West Street. Ch Supt Welsted said: ""A residential property has been damaged as a result of the incident, the occupants were not injured and were checked over by medical professionals. ""They have since been relocated while the investigation continues. ""The bodies of those who have sadly lost their lives will shortly be recovered from the scene."" He urged anyone with footage taken from the scene to ""please respect the families involved"" and if any could be of use to the investigation make it available to investigators. The road where a crane collapsed in Crewe is a main route in the centre of the town through a built-up, industrial area. At one end, Dunwoody Way has Phoenix Leisure Park (a site with a cinema, bowling alley and bingo hall), with routes off to housing estates and a Morrisons. It then continues past the Bombardier Transportation factory (Crewe's historical railway works) before heading west out of the town. In a statement Seddon Homes boss Jonathan Seddon said his company was working with the HSE. ""On behalf of everyone at Seddon I'd like to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of those who so tragically lost their lives yesterday. ""At this time I cannot speculate as to the cause of this incident, but needless to say there will be a full investigation and Seddon is working closely with the emergency services and Health and Safety Executive."" Laura Smith, Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich, said: ""It's going to be very important for me today to find out the people who have been affected and make sure the residents are supported and also sending all my thoughts to the families who have lost members.""

Fruit and veg farmers face labour crunch,"This video can not be played Fruit farmers are finding it hard to recruit pickers UK summer fruit and salad growers are having difficulty recruiting pickers, with more than half saying they don't know if they will have enough migrant workers to harvest their crops. Many growers blame the weak pound which has reduced their workers' earning power, as well as uncertainty over Brexit, according to a BBC survey. About 80,000 seasonal workers a year pick and process British fruit and veg. Most of them are from the European Union, mainly Romania and Bulgaria. One in five growers says they already have fewer pickers than they need. British Summer Fruits, the body which represents soft fruit growers, says labour shortages are now the worst seen since 2004. Queen's Speech: Brexit bills dominate agenda Ahmed: Immigration is Brexit dividing line Bloom: Free trade area, single market, customs union - what's the difference? Rolls-Royce warns against 'hard Brexit' Carmakers 'face Brexit cliff edge' Recruitment was getting harder even before the vote to leave the EU. But the industry believes Brexit is exacerbating the problem and if access to non-UK workers dries up, it could cripple home-grown berry production. Their concern is backed up by an in-depth survey of growers by the BBC. The questionnaire was sent to members of the British Leafy Salad Association and British Summer Fruits, which represent 90% of growers in their sector. There was a big response. Three-quarters of growers completed the survey, which was carried out between 16 May and 5 June, as harvesting started to peak. We asked if they had enough seasonal workers for the start of the main picking season: 32% said they weren't sure 18% said they had slightly fewer than they needed Just over 3% reported having many fewer than required 42% said they had just enough 1% said they had more than enough Meanwhile, 78% of respondents said recruitment had been more difficult than last year, with 20% saying it had been the hardest for years. At Wilkin and Sons in Essex, the picking season for strawberries is in full swing. But this year, they have 20% fewer workers than they would like. ""We're managing, but we're not comfortable,"" said joint managing director Chris Newenham. This video can not be played Manager at fruit farm tells Today he has only been able to recruit one British person in five years ""Our seasonal workers are a critical resource for us to be able to save our crop each year. And the logical extension of not being able to harvest that crop is that we will have to bring our production in from overseas and that's a position none of us want to see. "" He's not the only one. Of those surveyed, 71% said they would consider reducing UK production if there were future restrictions on seasonal workers. British Summer Fruits has commissioned its own separate report, just published, on the potential implications for its growers, and consumers, of Brexit. It warns that soft fruit prices could rise by up to 50% if the UK relied solely on imports. ""It is inconceivable that people who voted to leave the European Union wanted to destroy an iconic and incredibly competitive British horticulture industry,"" said Laurence Olins, chairman of British Summer Fruits. ""Failure to secure the future of soft fruit production in the UK will have a negative impact on the economy, family budgets, the nation's health, UK food security and the environment,"" he added. So why doesn't horticulture, now a Â£3bn industry, simply try to employ British workers? The answer is straightforward for Beverley Dixon, from G's Fresh, which employs some 2,500 seasonal workers growing salad crops across large areas of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, as well as other farms dotted across the UK. ""We operate in areas of such low unemployment, so here in Cambridgeshire, it's less than 1.5%,"" she said. ""So there simply aren't the people available to do the work, added to which UK people tend to want permanent year-round work and this is seasonal work.' Reliance on migrant workers isn't a specific challenge for the UK, according to David Swales, analyst at the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board. ""If we look at other developed countries around the world, places like Australia and New Zealand, they source labour from the Pacific Islands. ""In the US, they source labour from Mexico and the Caribbean countries. So there are a number of places where countries have to go outside their borders to source the seasonal workers that they need,"" he added. The nationalities of these workers have changed over the decades in the UK. There used to be a seasonal agricultural workers scheme which allowed growers and farmers to attract workers from across the world. The industry says it worked and believes it's the obvious solution now Britain has decided to leave the EU. During a recent select committee inquiry into seasonal labour shortfalls, the government said net migration figures showed that sufficient labour was available in the UK and that there was currently no need for a seasonal agricultural workers scheme for migrants. The BBC survey is hard evidence that recruitment has proved tougher this year, with some shortages reported. A government spokesperson said: ""The government places great value on the UK's food and farming industries, both as a crucial component of the UK economy and of the fabric of rural Britain. ""We are determined to get the best deal for the UK in our negotiations to leave the EU, not least for our world-leading food and farming industry, which is a key part of our nation's economic success.""

PM makes statement on Grenfell Tower fire,"Statement on Grenfell Tower fire from Prime Minister Theresa May There were two other statements: the first on terrorism, the second on forthcoming business The rest of the day's debate was on the Queen's Speech Esther Webber and Patrick Cowling A bill-by-bill guide to the proposed legislation in the 2017 Queen's Speech. House of CommonsParliament Theresa
May made a statement to Parliament on the Grenfell Tower Fire, in west London,
which killed at least 79 people. The
prime minister told MPs the cladding used on some tower blocks in the UK is ""combustible""
according to government test results. Mrs
May said that cladding on all relevant tower blocks was being sent for tests. And
she also said she expected to name the judge who will lead a public inquiry
into the fire within the next few days. During
the debate on the Queenâs Speech later, the new Labour MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, told the
Commons the ""burnt-out carcass"" of the tower revealed the ""true
face"" of her constituency, with poverty, malnutrition and overcrowding
existing alongside wealth. In
her maiden speech, she criticised people who think social tenants have ""no
right to live in an area like desirable Kensington"", and called for fire
service cuts to be reversed. House of LordsParliament The Lords adjourns for the day and will return on Monday at 14:30 BST. Queen's Speech debate House of LordsParliament Responding to the day's debate for the government, Foreign Office Minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon says as the UK goes out onto the international stage we should be mindful of the ""values that bind us together"". The UK will seek ""peace, stability and prosperity"" as we ""reset the UK's role in the world"" after Brexit, he tells peers. He highlights the importance of relations with the Commonwealth and the trade bill outlined in the Queen's Speech. Queen's Speech debate House of LordsParliament Labour spokesman Lord Tunnicliffe says armed forces have been ""cut to the bone"". ""If Labour had allowed them to become so run-down, there would have been howls of protest,"" he claims. He points to comments from the US defence secretary suggesting the UK will not be able to remain a ""full partner"" to the United States with military resources at current levels, ""no matter how many times the prime minister holds hands with Donald Trump. UK Prime Minister Theresa May says she will give plans to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK. Queen's Speech debate House of LordsParliament Responding to the debate for the Lib Dems, Lord Bruce of Bennachie focuses on international aid. He says ""the enemies or critics of aid do not let go"" - holding up a copy of the Daily Mail - and he ""welcomes the secretary of state's defence of the international aid department"". ""We've got to be with the world, not turn our backs on it,"" he argues. House of CommonsParliament The Commons has now adjourned and will return on Monday at 14:30 BST for continuation of debate on the Queen's Speech. Adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Responding, Health Minister Philip Dunne says: ""I don't stand here with all the answers to all the questions"" as ""many decisions will be taken by clinicians"". He cites ""legitimate concerns"" raised over training at Kent and Canterbury Hospital, and says staffing has been an ""ongoing challenge"". Adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Helen Whately opens her adjournment debate on the future of Kent and Canterbury Hospital. She says ""there are thousands who would not be here today"" without it but people are ""worried because there is a big question mark"" over its sustainability. Acute heart and stroke services were recently transferred to Ashford and Margate. House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Suri says that he is concerned about the EU's ability and commitment to impose economic sanctions on countries like Russia after the UK leaves the organisation. He says that the UK has consistently been the strongest advocate in the commission and that we have experts in targeted sanctions who do a ""significant proportion"" of the heavy lifting for the EU when it comes to this. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament David Gauke is making his Commons debut as work and pensions secretary, and he echoes other members in describing the Grenfell Tower fire as a ""terrible tragedy"". He tells the House his department is ensuring survivors' benefit claims are treated with ""sensitivity and flexibility"". He says more generally his government is committed to providing ""work to those who can and help to those who can't"" as part of their objective of ""fairness for all"". Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams winds up the day's debate for Labour, paying tribute in particular to her colleague Emma Dent Coad who she says spoke ""so movingly about the devastating effect"" of the Grenfell Tower fire. She expresses ""profound disappointment"" with the Queen's Speech on behalf of all those who ""voted against austerity"" at the election. ""The government's warm words of making our country fairer ring hollow,"" she claims. House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Alli reminds peers that it is the 50th anniversary of the start of the process to decriminalise homosexuality, which he says was by no means a perfect piece of legislation but began the process of bringing the lives of gay men from the shadows and into the open. He says it is easy to forget how extraordinary the UK is and how extraordinary the people are. ""We tolerate and celebrate the diversity of our land."" Lord Alli tells peers that ""divided people are a weaker people"" and that equality is not just an issue for those affected but speaks to the character of our country. He also warns that ""too often"" it is the big corporations who drive the international agenda; ""trade for hunger, disease for keeping the medicine prices competitive, supporting oppressive regimes, and selling arms to people who have no business owning them"".

House of LordsParliament Non-affiliated peer Baroness Tonge says that she is concerned about the future funding of international sexual and reproductive health during the Trump administration in the United States, after theJanuary announcement of a ban on federal money going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions. Baroness Tonge says that it is ""simply impossible"" to work in this field without mentioning abortions at some stage. She tells peers that 22 million unsafe abortions are performed every year leading to 50-70,000 maternal deaths, and muses ""I wonder if Donald Trump will support the existing children of those motherless families."" ""He has become the grim reaper of women's lives in the poorest countries."" Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament The new Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, Simon Clarke, is giving his maiden speech. He says it's fitting that his constituency produced Captain Cook as the UK prepares to go on a journey of discovery after Brexit. He says he is ""passionate about helping people to help themselves"" and that's something he wants to pursue on behalf of constituents. Esther WebberBBC News Several Conservative backbenchers used the first day of debate on the Queen's Speech to pick apart their party's election campaign. On Wednesday in the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg compared the ""strong and stable"" slogan to Stanley Baldwin's ""safety first"" message in the 1929 election, condemning them both as ""deeply unappealing"". He said Conservatives underperformed at the election because ""voters do not feel that we are on their side - they feel instead that it is business as normal"" whereas they should be showing ""we can help them lead better, more prosperous lives"". Nigel Evans attacked the ""toxic rubbish"" in the manifesto, including the promise of a free vote on fox-hunting in the manifesto, saying that even in his rural constituency it was seen as ""irrelevant"". He added he was ""delighted that some of the people involved in putting those things in the manifesto are no longer working at 10 Downing Street and that there is now a change in style of governance"". George Freeman, who was until recently a policy aide to the prime minister, was more conciliatory, but emphasised the government would have to pay more attention to young voters and public service professionals who want a change after ""seven years of a particular model of austerity"". House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Judd begins his contribution by speaking of the Grenfell tower fire, saying that although he is ""greatly reassured"" by the full public inquiry, he has ""one big anxiety"" - that in the desire to learn the lessons of the disaster, peers do not overlook ""our own responsibility"". He asks what the values are on which our country is operating at the moment - and whether we are too preoccupied with cost and managerial considerations. Lord Judd also talks of the recent terror attacks in the UK and tells peers that he worries about the ""erosion of our values and equalities that make our society worth protecting"", saying that it is at the times of the greatest pressures that we must be firmest. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Zac Goldsmith is making his first speech since his comeback - and is reminded by another MP, ""you can't be a maiden twice"". He says low-rise, high-density, street-based design is a better solution for council housing and that this issue has taken on a ""grim relevance"" in light of recent events. ""Now is surely the time to look at a different way of doing things,"" he argues. Â© 2025 BBC.

Council boss quits amid Grenfell criticism,"Protesters gathered outside Kensington Town Hall last week to demand support The chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea council has resigned amid criticism over the borough's response to the Grenfell Tower fire. Nicholas Holgate said Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid asked for him to go - this is denied by the government. Mr Holgate said last week's fire in North Kensington, in which at least 79 people died, was ""heart-breaking"" but his presence would be a ""distraction"". Residents had condemned the initial relief effort as ""absolute chaos"". In astatement,externalissued by the council on Wednesday, Mr Holgate, who has been in post since 2014, said it was the ""highest priority"" of the council to help families affected by the fire. He said the communities and local government secretary had on Tuesday ""required the leader of the council to seek my resignation"". However, a spokesman from the Department for Communities and Local Government denied involvement, saying: ""The appointment of chief executives is entirely the responsibility of the local authority."" Nicholas Holgate became chief executive of the council in December 2014 Mr Holgate said: ""Despite my wish to have continued, in very challenging circumstances, to lead on the executive responsibilities of the council, I have decided that it is better to step down from my role, once an appropriate successor has been appointed. ""There is a huge amount still to do for the victims of the fire, requiring the full attention of this council and many others. If I stayed in post, my presence would be a distraction."" What we know so far Who are the victims? Visual guide to what happened He added: ""Whilst the public inquiry and other investigations will get to the truth of the causes of this tragedy and the management of its aftermath, I strongly believe that councillors and officers have always endeavoured to have the interests of our residents at heart and will continue to do so."" Nicholas Paget-Brown, the leader of the council, said it was with ""regret"" that he had accepted Mr Holgate's resignation. He said: ""The council has been grief stricken by the tragedy of the Grenfell Tower fire and has sought to provide the greatest level of support we can to victims. ""That is a huge challenge and Nicholas has led from the front in seeking to do this."" Shadow housing secretary John Healey told BBC Breakfast that Mr Holgate was ""right to go"". He added: ""He had to go. His council went awol in the days after this terrible fire - at a time when the victims, survivors, those families still looking for their family members who were missing, needed help on the ground and, above all, someone to reassure them and coordinate the relief and help efforts. ""The council were nowhere to be seen when I was down there the day after the fire - he had no option and he was right to go."" Since the fire on 14 June, some Grenfell Tower families have been staying in hotels and B&Bs, and there were concerns that more permanent housing would be offered in other parts of the country. And residents have said that Kensington and Chelsea council provided little support or information. Government staff and other London boroughs weredrafted in to help with relief effortsin the wake of the fire, with humanitarian assistance being provided by the west London borough of Ealing. The Justice4Grenfell campaign group welcomed Mr Holgate's resignation. The group's spokeswoman, Yvette Williams, told the Press Association: ""He wasn't left with any alternative, I think it was the right thing for him to do, the community had been completely abandoned by the local authority."" This video can not be played Theresa May on Grenfell fire: ""As prime minister I've taken responsibility"" The council's Â£8.6m refurbishment of the tower has also faced questions, withsuggestions that new claddingfitted during the refurbishment could have made the blaze worse. The refurbishment will be one issue looked at by afull public inquiry into the fire, ordered by Theresa May last week. The PM, who is among those to have faced criticism after she failed to meet survivors in the immediate aftermath, hasapologised for ""State"" failuresafter the blaze. She is expected to make a statement about the fire in the House of Commons on Thursday. She told MPs on Wednesday: ""People were left without belongings, without roofs over their heads, without even basic information about what had happened, what they should do and where they could seek help."" And the government announced that68 social housing flatsin Kensington Row, about 1.5 miles away from Grenfell Tower, would be made available to survivors. The funeral of 23-year-old Syrian refugee Mohammed Alhajali, who was among the first victims of the fire to be named, also took place on Wednesday. His family, who arrived from war-torn Syria, and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan attended the ceremony, called a Janazat, at an east London mosque. Meanwhile, a number of inquests have been opened and adjourned, with the coroner finding: Retired lorry driver Anthony Disson, 65, died from inhalation of fire fumes Farah Hamdan, a 31-year-old nursery nurse, died from smoke inhalation Her husband, Omar Belkadi, 32, who worked as a courier, died from inhalation from fire fumes Abufars Ibrahim, a 39-year-old shopkeeper, had been visiting his mother in the tower. The coroner said he had been found at the foot of the building and died from multiple injuries Khadija Khalloufi, a 52-year-old married woman, also died from inhalation of fire fumes Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Are you a Grenfell Tower resident?

The doctor making her country a better place to die,"Fifteen years ago there was no such thing as palliative care - care for the dying - in Mongolia. Now there is, thanks to the efforts of one woman, who persuaded the country's medical establishment that it was possible and worthwhile to prevent people dying in agony. Odontuya Davaasuren was 17 years old, studying paediatrics far from home in Leningrad, Russia when her father died of lung cancer in Mongolia. ""I didn't have the opportunity to care for my father or say goodbye,"" she recalls. ""When I returned to Mongolia, my sister told me that our father had been in constant pain."" Several years later, as a practising doctor, she shared her apartment with her mother-in-law, who was dying of liver cancer, and she saw first-hand how pain could deprive people of peace at the end their life. ""I cared for her. I fed, washed and changed her, but I could not relieve her pain because I didn't know how,"" she says. The only medication available for dying patients in Mongolia at the time was what you'd get for muscle pain or headaches, not the persistent pain of a tumour pressing on nerves in the upper abdomen. Nor the multiple other symptoms like constant nausea and vomiting. ""I felt shame and that I am a bad doctor because I didn't know how to help,"" she says. If these experiences weren't enough, at work Davaasuren witnessed children with leukaemia so wracked with pain they never smiled or spoke, and a young mother who cried constantly and asked to be killed to escape the pain of stomach cancer. ""Many, many patients died at home, in pain, with great physical and psychological suffering,"" she recalls. ""Many times, the families bought so much traditional medicine and other expensive medicines. But that was just false hope."" The idea of palliative or end-of-life care, to support people in the last months or years of their life, was well established in other countries. But in Mongolia, home of the conqueror Genghis Khan, where nomads have lived and died by the harsh conditions of the landscape for millennia, it was entirely unknown. Then a trip to Sweden in 2000, to attend a European Palliative Care Association conference, opened Davaasuren's eyes and eventually helped her make Mongolia a better place to die. ""Before I went to Stockholm in 2000, I had never heard these words, 'palliative care',"" she says. ""This was not available in Mongolia or other post-socialist societies."" On returning, her pleas to Mongolia's health ministry initially fell on deaf ears. ""'Why do you want to spend money on people who are dying,' they asked me, 'when we don't have enough for living patients?'"" Listen to:The Truth About Cancer: Dying in Comfort in Mongoliaon BBC World Service A wind cold enough to freeze your fingers within seconds is blowing across low brown hills that ripple across the landscape on the outskirts of Ulan Bator, the Mongolian capital. Not a single building, streetlight or electrical pylon is visible, just a scattering of round tents, calledgers, the traditional home of nomadic farmers. Entering through the sky blue wooden door of one ger, Davaasuren, now 59 and a grandmother, meets Timurbat. He sits propped on a wooden bed, against turquoise fabric printed with large, red roses that lines the inside of the dwelling. Timurbat's abdomen is painfully distended, his skin has a yellow cast, and the whites of his eyes have turned turmeric-coloured as his cancer-riddled liver struggles to break down the pigment from dying red blood cells. Like his ancestors, Timurbat has spent a lifetime herding sheep and cattle on horseback, to shelter in winter and water in summer. But now he is too weak to speak, much less stand. ""My leg and arm hurt, and I have headaches,"" he says, groaning and closing his eyes.  ""I can't sleep at night. I wish it didn't hurt so much."" Davaasuren kneels in front of him, gently prodding his abdomen. ""You can see the cancer here in the lower abdomen,"" she says. ""This stage is incurable, but I wish for him to be comfortable, without suffering and pain."" Davaasuren asks Timurbat's wife, Enkjargal, what medication he has been taking and suggests increasing the dose of morphine. ""Before, he received one tablet every four hours, now he needs more because it doesn't help,"" she says. Outside the ger as Davaasuren prepares to leave, Enkjargal breaks down in tears. Davaasuren hugs her close and whispers to her. Mongolia has the highest rate of death from liver cancer - six times the global average - and the number of cases is constantly increasing. The culprit is a viral infection, either Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. Spread by contamination with infected blood, and through sex (particularly in the case of Hepatitis B) more than a quarter of Mongolians are chronically infected with at least one of the strains. It is a slow killer. Over many years, the virus causes genetic changes in liver cells, eventually leading to tumours in some patients. By the time symptoms appear, it is usually too late. ""A good death... and a good life before death, it is a human right,"" Davaasuren says. To make her point to the Health Ministry, after her return from Sweden in 2000, she visited dying patients at home and filmed their desperate testimonies. Back then, terminally ill patients were routinely discharged from hospitals once doctors felt they could not be helped and left to cope alone. Without pain relief, many considered suicide. ""Many people asked, 'Please kill me,'"" Davaasuren says. ""They preferred to die than suffer. After [filming], I would come back in the evening. I just watched and cried, watched and cried. I saw so much suffering."" Because of the liver cancer statistics, Davaasuren knew most families in Mongolia were likely to experience this suffering. Her emotionally charged lobbying paid off and in 2002, she was allowed to establish a national palliative care programme, designed to support the dying and those who love them. Odontuya Davaasuren (centre) with two of her nurses Fifteen years on, each provincial hospital in the country provides palliative care, as do hospitals in each of Ulan Bator's nine districts. Five hospices care for dying patients on wards and at home. One major change Davaasuren has made is to increase the availability of morphine. Before she helped rewrite the legislation on the use of the drug for pain relief, many officials believed making it more easily accessible would fuel addiction. ""Now pharmacies can distribute morphine free for all cancer patients according to each person's need until death,"" she says. She has also trained thousands of doctors to provide both pain relief and psychological support to the dying, arguing both aspects are crucial. ""Spiritual care is sometimes much more important than morphine,"" she says. ""Spiritual care can relieve pain. Patients lose their anxiety, fear, insomnia... and there are very good changes after accepting death."" A doctor at the National Cancer Hospital examines a patient's liver tumour using ultrasound In the palliative care ward of Mongolia's National Cancer Hospital, Davaasuren sits talking to a man with sad eyes and salt-and-pepper hair in a bed by the window. As she chats with him about routine matters, their conversation gradually becomes more intimate. There are soft words and a few soft laughs. ""His name is Renchin and he worked in the forest as a builder,"" Davaasuren explains. ""He has five children. He feels death is coming, but sometimes when the children are here, he says, 'I'm OK, don't worry,' because he is a father,"" she says. ""But I told him, 'Now it's time to think about what you need to tell your children, how you need to prepare, because I think it is time. It's better to know the truth than have false hope.' He smiled but did not cry."" Davaasuren speaks to Renchin's daughter next, who is sitting nearby. Her polite smile changes during the course of the conversation. Tears begin to fall and her cheeks quiver. ""I told her her father is dying,"" says Davaasuren. ""She said she had hoped for a cure. I said, 'It is the terminal stage. Now it is not the time to bomb by medicine, it is time to surround him with love.' She said, 'Thank you, I understand it now.' ""It's very difficult for me still. I sometimes cry together with my patients.""

Trump talks up solar panel plan for wall,"Donald Trump's proposed wall on the US-Mexico border was a campaign rallying cry US President Donald Trump has told supporters that his proposed wall along the border with Mexico could have solar panels fixed to it. Addressing a rally in Iowa, he said the panels would provide cheap energy and help to pay for the controversial wall. He suggested the plan was his own, saying: ""Pretty good imagination, right? Good? My idea."" However, solar panels have been included in designs for the wall submitted by companies. During his campaign, Mr Trump pledged to build a wall along the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He insisted he would make Mexico foot the bill, but President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto has dismissed the idea. Six things that could topple Trump's wall What might the border wall look like? Mexico: We will not pay for border wall Will Trump's wall destroy a desert? Mr Trump told cheering supporters at a campaign-style rally in Cedar Rapids on Wednesday that he would ""give you an idea that nobody has heard about yet"". ""We're thinking of something that's unique, we're talking about the southern border, lots of sun, lots of heat. We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall, so it creates energy and pays for itself. And this way, Mexico will have to pay much less money, and that's good, right?"" This video can not be played Trump : ""Pretty good imagination right? Good? My idea."" He added: ""Solar wall, panels, beautiful. I mean actually think of it, the higher it goes the more valuable it is. Pretty good imagination right? Good? My idea."" More than 200 companies are believed to have responded toan invitation from the Department of Homeland Security,external(DHS) to submit designs for the wall. Among them was one from Gleason Partners in Las Vegas that proposed a wall of steel, cement and solar panels. The DHS told the BBC that 20 companies had been shortlisted.

Festivals dominated by male rock acts,"This video can not be played UK festival line-ups dominated by male headliners Music festivals fail to reflect the diversity of the UK music scene, with headline slots being dominated by a small band of male rock acts over the decades, a study suggests. Some eight out of 10 top slots were occupied by all-male acts, analysis of more than 600 headline appearances across 14 major festivals found. And a quarter of all headline slots were taken up by the same 20 acts. The study comes as 175,000 peoplehead to the Glastonbury Festival. Musician and writerEmma-Lee Moss,externalsaid the music industry was ""skewed towards a male demographic"". She said: ""If we continue talking - and we continue investigating and agitating - hopefully, naturally, things will become more inclusive. ""We have got such amazing musicians in the UK who are women. What about a festival that wasn't just women-led headliners, but also most of the bands? ""It's not just the headliners that are imbalanced, it's acts all across the board, and we all know there are people making music that are not just white men.  If someone decided to reflect that in their line-up, they'd be celebrated."" From top left clockwise: Rihanna, Florence Welch, Grace Jones, Joanna Newsom, Pink and Beyonce Watch Glastonbury live streams Ultimate survival guide Which stage are you? How to listen outside the UK? Male rock acts such as Muse, Kasabian and The Killers dominated the festival headline slots in our analysis. Twenty acts - or about 6% of the 308 acts in our sample - took up 24% of all headline slots. Dr Simon Warner, a popular music researcher at Leeds University, said: ""There remains a small number of groups who can actually generate consumer interest, and I think it's down to sheer economics. ""If you are going to get 80,000 you need to have acts that can get [punters] to spend cash. If you are spending hundreds of pounds, you are not going to go for an indie band, you are going to go and see the Red Hot Chili Peppers or whoever."" And there was a stark gender imbalance. In our study, only 37 headline performances involved all-female acts, while 68 were bands of mixed gender. Rihanna was the only female act to clock up four top slots. She was followed by Florence and the Machine and Grace Jones, with three headline slots each. Michael Baker, of the publicationFestival Insights,,externalwhich runs the UK Festival Awards, said: ""Some festivals do attempt to address gender imbalance, such as Field Day, whose curator recently told me that they failed to book 50% female acts because there simply weren't that many available."" To promote diversity, festival organisers need to foster and promote emerging talent, he said. ""Festival organisers are aware of the lack of interesting acts at the top, and many have taken to differentiating themselves from their competitors via non-music activities,"" he said. ""What needs to happen, however, is more long-term thinking and effort applied to the representation and promotion of emerging talent at festivals."" The lack of women headliners was reflected not just in traditional rock festivals, but at more pop focussed events such as V and Wireless. As Prince once put it, there's joy in repetition. If you're tired of Radiohead playing Street Spirit, or The Killers bashing out Mr Brightside, then you're either not a fan or (more likely) a member of the band. But there is a worrying reliance on white, male guitar bands at music festivals - which is strange, because white, male guitar music is massively out of favour. The charts are dominated by pop and hip-hop, with acts like Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Stormzy, Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift dominating streaming services. If bookers took a risk on these acts, they'd undoubtedly attract a younger, more passionate crowd - ensuring their longevity in the process. Of course, no-one is going to do that when heritage rock bands guarantee ticket sales. Festivals are already taking a financial risk - why take on more? The V Festival is an honourable exception. Born in the midst of Britpop, it's re-positioned itself as a festival for pop connoisseurs, booking acts like Calvin Harris, Beyonce, Rudimental, Olly Murs and P!nk as headliners. It's proof that audiences will embrace diversity - in gender, in genre and in the race of their artists - if they're given the chance. Hopefully others will take note. And when they do, it's our responsibility as fans to make it work. Success on the music streaming service Spotify does not guarantee top dog status on the festival circuit. Drake, Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna were the most listened to on Spotify, but had just nine festival headline slots between them. The most listened-to tracks from our sample of headliners came from the world of mainstream pop, hip hop and dance. Ed Sheeran -Shape of You (Glastonbury, 2017) Bruno Mars -That's What I Like (Wireless, 2014) Kygo and Selena Gomez -It Ain't Me (Wireless, 2016) Calvin Harris -Slide (Wireless, 2016) Kygo and Ellie Goulding -First Time Coldplay and The Chainsmokers -Something Just Like This (Glastonbury, 2016) Drake -Passionfruit (Wireless, 2015) Ed Sheeran -Perfect Calvin Harris -Rollin Ed Sheeran -Castle on the Hill And it appears the dominance of hip hop and pop on streaming services is changing the make-up of festivals. Based on Spotify's classification system, the proportion of headline acts in our sample described as being indie and rock has been in decline since the 1990s, at the same time as hip hop and pop acts rise. Though, as 1990s pop duoDaphne and Celeste,externalcan attest, rock fans do not always appreciate pop invading its territory. The pair were faced with a barrage of boos and bottles when they took the main stage at Reading Festival in 2000. Some 94% of headline acts hailed from the UK, the US and Canada. London was the music capital in the UK, producing most headline acts, followed by New York, California, Manchester and Glasgow. Mr Baker said: ""Our tiny nation alone exports a massive amount of the world's most popular music."" The average age of a festival headliner is 39.  The V Festival, held in Essex and Staffordshire at the end of August, had the youngest headliners with an average age of 32. The Rewind Festival, which showcases bands from the 1980s and is held at three sites - Berkshire, Cheshire and Perthshire - in August, had the oldest headliners with an average age of 56. And Glastonbury headliners have been getting older. BBC England's data unit analysed more than 600 separate headline performances across 14 UK festivals. They were Download, Reading/Leeds, T in the Park, V Festival, Isle of Wight, Bestival, Latitude, Wireless, Rewind, End of the Road, Cornbury, Boardmasters and Lovebox. Festivals that were not defined around headline acts were excluded. These include Creamfields, Boomtown Fair and Womad. Fairport's Cropredy Convention was also excluded as it is traditionally headlined by its organisers.

Why are countries laying claim to the sea floor?,"Around the world, countries are claiming obscure and difficult-to-reach tracts of the deep-sea floor, far from the surface and further still from land. Why? There is a long history of claiming newly discovered territories, of planting the flag at far outposts of the known world. In the early 20th Century, explorers raced to the South Pole, their sponsors keen to benefit from future exploitation of these unknown areas. In 1945, President Harry S Truman broke with convention to claim the entire continental shelf off the US. And, in 2007,Russia used a submersible to plant a flag at the North Pole,external. All shared a common motivation - the hunt for new resources - and there is now a new frontier: the deep-sea floor. Exploration offers the prospect of finding huge amounts of previously untapped resources, but serious environmental concerns remain. Only 5% of the deep-sea floor, which covers about 60% of the Earth's surface, has been properly explored. Light penetrates only the top layers, and the vast, deep oceans are pitch-black, with temperatures just a few degrees above freezing point. Each time it is explored - by mini-submarines tethered to surface ships - strong lights pick out fragile structures and animals that have never been seen before. But countries and companies are turning their eyes towards its minerals, potentially worth billions of pounds. Nautilus deep-sea mining machines Already, there have been significant advances in the technology required to discover, map and mine them - with robotic equipment built to operate at great depths. There are significant deposits scattered over the plains of the ocean's deepest abysses and encrusted on the rocky outcrops of underwater mountains. They are also on active and extinct hydrothermal vents - the fissures in the planet's surface from which hot water spouts. Deep-sea mining, an idea dating back to the 1960s, could now happen within 10 years. It has been made a possibility by population growth, economic growth and concerns over the supply and security of minerals on land. Copper, nickel and cobalt can all be found at high concentrations, in mineral deposits, as can the so-called ""critical"" metals. These include the rare earth elements used in a range of new technologies such as memory chips, LEDs and batteries for electric vehicles. It is thought the mountains of the Pacific alone could contain about 22 times more tellurium - which is used in solar panels - than the known land-based reserves combined. At present there is no exploitation of deep-sea mineral resources, only exploration. The UK - through a partnership between the government and a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin UK -  is among countries exploring one of the main areas, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, which stretches across the Pacific Ocean for thousands of miles between Mexico and Hawaii. There are serious challenges to overcome at this remote location. A deep-water prawn on the floor of the Clarion Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean Equipment has to function reliably at depths of 5km (three miles) - where pressure is 500 times that at the surface - before deposits are brought on to ships and taken back to land. There are other resources closer to shore. Rich deposits of minerals are found at depths of over 1km (0.6 miles) in the Bismarck Sea off Papua New Guinea. For these easier-to-access reserves, deep-sea mining equipment has been designed, tested and built. If mining operations go ahead here, they will offer some insights for future and deeper operations. However, strong opposition remains over concerns about the potential environmental impact. Renewables' deep-sea mining conundrum New life found in deep-sea vents Deep-sea mining threat to Octopus Mining 'must respect ecosystems' This video can not be played Should we be mining the seabed for minerals? The rules for exploitation are yet to be agreed, but contractors will have to demonstrate they have assessed the environmental impact of mining and that plans are in place to manage the effects. This is perhaps the greatest challenge for deep-sea mining and the area of greatest tension. Our understanding of the deep-sea environment is very limited, let alone our understanding of the effects of mining it. The diversity of life in the oceans, particularly around deep-sea vents and other mineral deposits, is spectacular, yet we know there are many more species still to be discovered. A ""black smoker"" hydrothermal vent on the floor of the Pacific Ocean, viewed from a deep-sea vehicle Recent research by international consortiums of scientists has begun to try to measure the impact of churning up the ocean floor. Mining could have consequences for many forms of life in the ocean. That could, in turn, affect the ocean's function as a food source and a carbon sink. It could also affect the search for new drugs and other products. For example: An anti-inflammatory extract from a Caribbean octocoral is now used in a commercial skincare range An anti-cancer treatment uses a natural product extracted from a marine sponge A painkiller based on a synthetic derivative from a cone snail is being made Where the resources are found within 200 nautical miles (370km) of shore, it is up to individual countries to reach agreement about who owns them. In the deeper international waters, it becomes more difficult. Here, theInternational Seabed Authority (ISA),externalis responsible for awarding licenses for mining. Established by the UN in 1984, its decisions are legally binding on the 166 states - and the EU - who are party to it. 1934 - William Beebe and Otis Barton descend 923m (3,028ft) in a ""bathysphere"" - an unpowered deep-sea submersible made of cast-iron, lowered by a cable 1960 - In the Trieste submersible (pictured), Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh explore the Challenger Deep in the Marianas Trench - the deepest known part of the Pacific Ocean - reaching a depth of roughly 11km Administering resources defined as being for ""the common heritage of mankind"", the ISA has so far approved 26 contracts of 15 years. These are held by 20 sponsor countries, including China and Russia - which have four licences each - and the UK, France, Germany, India and Japan - which have two licences. Licences have to be shared equally with a developing nation - each getting half the sea floor. The oceans already provide humanity with many resources, but the deep oceans have long been overlooked because of their inaccessibility. The coming years will potentially see a lot of changes, as our understanding and technology improves. The race to license areas of the deep ocean will only intensify.

May to address EU leaders on Brexit plans,"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: Dreaming of a Brexit 'miracle' European Council President Donald Tusk has quoted lyrics from John Lennon's Imagine to suggest the door remains open to the UK staying in the EU. Ahead of a Brussels summit he said of that prospect: ""You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."" Theresa May, who has said the UK will honour the referendum vote to leave, was due to outline her plans for the issue of expats' rights to EU leaders. Speaking at the summit she hailed the ""constructive"" start to Brexit talks. The gathering of 28 EU member states' leaders comes the day after measures to enable Brexit dominated the Queen's Speech. Mrs May's Conservatives are still trying to secure the Commons support needed to pass their programme. Kuenssberg: The Brexit expats questions Brexit and security loom large at EU summit Bill-by-bill guide: Queen's SpeechBill-by-bill guide: Queen's Speech Corbyn attacks 'threadbare' programme Mrs May told reporters as she arrived: ""I'm going to be setting out some of the UK's plans particularly on how we propose to protect the rights of EU citizens and UK citizens as we leave. ""That's been an important issue. We've wanted it to be one of the early issues to be considered in the negotiations. That is now the case. That work is starting."" She also said she would be raising other important issues, including how European leaders could work together to stop the spread of extremism online and ensure there was no ""safe space"" online for terrorists. Brexit negotiations began on Monday. Speaking before the summit, Mr Tusk said: ""It is a most difficult process, for which the EU is well prepared. You can hear different predictions coming from different people about the possible outcome of these negotiations - hard Brexit, soft Brexit or no deal. ""Some of my British friends have even asked me whether Brexit could be reversed and whether I could imagine an outcome where the UK stays part of the EU. ""I told them that, in fact, the European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve. So, who knows. You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."" His comments were raised at a press conference in Brussels later with President of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, who said: ""In Europe, I never have illusions because I don't want to lose them."" But Mr Tusk said: ""I still have dreams. Politics without dreams - it would be a nightmare."" ""If you had my experience from my part of Europe you would know that miracles do happen and some of my political dreams have come true... but at the same time I am a realist, this is why first of all we should start our negotiations as effectively as possible and the final decision... this is a decision for Britain and UK citizens."" Earlier Chancellor Philip Hammond toldBBC Radio 4's Todayhe wanted an early agreement on the principle of a ""transitional"" period to reassure business there would not be a ""cliff edge"" when the UK leaves the EU at the end of March 2019. He also denied that a series of controversial Conservative manifesto commitments had been dumped in the wake of the disappointing election result. He told Today that the manifesto was for a five-year period, but the Queen's Speech programme had been for the first two years, which are dominated by the process of Brexit. Both the UK and the rest of the EU say they want to come to an arrangement to secure the status of about 3.2 million EU nationals living in the UK, and 900,000 Britons overseas, but nothing has been decided so far. UK opposition parties have urged the government to make a unilateral guarantee to the EU migrants - but ministers have insisted a reciprocal deal is needed to ensure British expats are protected. This video can not be played Philip Hammond on Today backs a post-Brexit transitional arrangement Mrs May will not be present when the leaders of the remaining 27 EU states hold a brief discussion about Brexit after her presentation. They are expected to consider the relocation of the two EU agencies governing medicine and banking which are currently based in London. Of the 27 bills in the Queen's Speech, eight related to Brexit and its impact on immigration, trade and sectors such as fisheries and farming. At the centre was the so-called Repeal Bill, which will copy over all EU laws into UK law, with Parliament then deciding which bits to retain. With MPs voting on the speech next week, the Conservatives are hoping an  arrangement with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party will be in place to support their minority government. But despite both sides saying they were confident of a deal being agreed, sources suggested to the BBC the DUP were ""getting to the limits"" of what they were requesting in return for supporting the Tories - with the chances of a plausible long-term deal, rather than a short-term bargain to get the Queen's Speech through, diminishing. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn, speaking after the Queen's speech, said austerity must come to an end As well as clearing the Commons, Brexit legislation will also have to navigate the House of Lords, where the Tories also do not have a majority. Another potential obstacle could emerge if the approval of the Scottish Parliament is needed for the Repeal Bill. Speaking in the Commons after the Queen's Speech, Mrs May said there was a ""possibility"" the bill, which is needed to stop EU law applying in the UK, could require Holyrood's consent. At the two-day summit, where the agenda is formally dominated by immigration, security and the economy, Mrs May will also brief her counterparts on the UK's commitment to a new Â£75m plan designed to stem the flow of illegal migrants from Africa to Europe.

DUP MP plays down reports of Â£2bn deal,"DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson described the Â£2bn figure as ""wild speculation"" but did say the DUP wanted help with infrastructure spending The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has played down reports it is seeking Â£2bn in extra funding for Northern Ireland in return for supporting the Tories. Earlier, sources told the BBC the DUP wantedÂ£1bn invested in Northern Ireland's health service and a similar figure for infrastructureprojects. However, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has described the figures as ""wild speculation"" and ""wide of the mark"". But he did say the DUP wanted Treasury ""help"" with public spending priorities. ""We're talking to the the Treasury and to the government about, yes, investing in our infrastructure in Northern Ireland, because we've lagged behind the rest of the UK, not least due to 30 years of violence,"" he told BBC Newsline. In a separate exchange in the House of Commons, he stepped in to defend the DUP after they were branded ""dinosaurs"". Sir Jeffrey was indignant when the co-leader of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, used the insult in the House of Commons. This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey complained after Caroline Lucas called the DUP ""dinosaurs"" Ms Lucas suggested that the lack of bills concerned with the environment inthe government's legislative programwas influenced by the DUP. Objecting to her remarks, Sir Jeffrey invited Ms Lucas to read his party's manifesto. He also asked the Commons Speaker to rule on whether Ms Lucas had used ""unparliamentary"" language, but his complaint was dismissed. Sir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, is a senior negotiator in the DUP's ongoing discussions with the Conservative Party. Prime Minister Theresa May isseeking the support of the DUP's 10 MPs after losing her majorityin the general election. Both sides have been locked in talks for 11 days, but to date they have not confirmed a deal to prop up a Conservative minority government. On Tuesday, a senior DUP source said the partycould not be ""taken for granted""and urged the Conservatives to give a ""greater focus"" to their negotiations. But on Wednesday, Sir Jeffrey told the BBC his party is ""confident"" that it can agree a confidence and supply arrangement with the Tories before Parliament votes next week on the measures outlined in the Queen's Speech. He said the talks were ""making progress"". He confirmed that as well as DUP requests for infrastructure spending, a reduction in Northern Ireland's rate of corporation tax, VAT on tourism and air passenger duty have all formed part of the negotiations. Sir Jeffrey said giving Stormont control to set its own rate of corporation tax could give Northern Ireland ""a leading edge in attracting investment"". He described how during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, public funding had been diverted into ""security apparatus rather than our roads and our bridges and other elements of our infrastructure - our hospital, our schools"". ""We're looking at health and education as well,"" he said. ""These are priorities for us, in terms of government spending, and we want some help from the Treasury.""

The selfies that got people talking,"Barack Obama's daughters took a selfie during his Presidential Inaugural Parade in 2013 Pose. Snap. Filter. Upload. These are the steps many will take on National Selfie Day. Named as word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries in 2013, the selfie has stuck around. Here are some famous examples. Justin Timberlake wasn't quite N Sync with the rules of casting a ballot when he voted in the US elections in 2016. The singer uploaded a photo of himself voting inside the polling station,which has been illegal in Tennessee since 2015. Despite his good intentions to encourage people to vote on Instagram, Timberlake could have faced up to 30 days in prison or a fine of $50 (Â£40), or both. UK astronaut Tim Peake's journey into space captivated the nation. He was the first astronaut representing Britain to carry out a spacewalk andnaturally took a selfie to remember the moment.

Some critics said they were ""disrespectful"" and ""inappropriate"" at the event. Two gymnasts at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games showed the two parts of Korea could get on - at least for a moment. Lee Eun-ju of South Korea and Hong Un-jong of the Northtook a smiling selfie together during the training period before the games started. The pictures of the two women were widely praised at the time as capturing the Olympic spirit. The Britons who competed at Rio 2016 also got in on the selfie action. But unlike the Korean gymnasts they waited until after the Games. Members of Team GB, who won gold medals,were snapped on their flight home with a British Airways cabin crew member. Revellers flocked to not only get a glimpse of Pope Francis but also to take a selfie with him. These musicians looked extremely pleased to have been able to capture the moment during his Jubilee audience in St Peter's Square, in Rome, in 2016.
