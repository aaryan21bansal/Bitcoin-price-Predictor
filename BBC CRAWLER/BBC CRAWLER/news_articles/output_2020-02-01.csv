Lucky Ireland hold off wasteful Scotland,"This video can not be played Six Nations: Ireland 19-12 Scotland highlights 2020 Six Nations Ireland (10) 19 Tries:SextonCon:SextonPens:Sexton 4 Scotland (6) 12 Pens:Hastings 4 Andy Farrell's reign as Ireland coach got off to a winning but unimpressive start as his side earned a fortunate 19-12 Six Nations win over Scotland. New captain Johnny Sexton scored all of Ireland's points, including a first-half try, as the hosts profited from Scotland's inability to take chances. Scotland's new skipper Stuart Hogg's knock-on over the line in the second half summed up his side's try-less day. Man-of-the-match CJ Stander's late turnover secured Ireland's win. 'Gutted' Hogg apologises for 'schoolboy' error Reaction after Ireland hold off Scotland Adams hat-trick as Wales thrash Italy All you need to know about the 2020 Six Nations It was a game that leaves both camps much to ponder before challenging matches next weekend. The home side got the win but will know a similar performance against Wales next week will surely result in defeat. Ireland were looking to rediscover their identify following a troubled World Cup, but this was not so much a new dawn as an indication their most glaring issues were not left in Japan. Scotland will take little solace from the fact they dominated large parts of the game, because once again their lack of cutting edge saw a positive result slip away. Johnny Sexton's try helped Ireland lead at half-time despite Scotland's bossing possession in the first half Scotland's pre-tournament build-up was thrown off course last Monday when news emerged of star fly-halfFinn Russell's exit from the camp following a breach of team protocol. His absence was one of the reasons the visitors began in Dublin as firm underdogs - but they clearly relished the opportunity to send a clear message to those who had written them off. Up front, where Ireland would have expected to dominate, Scotland stood toe-to-toe with their opponents at every physical encounter. The pack's endeavours should have yielded more points than the six they took into half-time. Head coach Farrell will be thankful for Ireland's outstanding work at the breakdown, where they won five penalties inside their own 22 in the opening half to keep the Scots at bay. The first turnover came after just 90 seconds as debutant Caelan Doris announced himself on the international stage. However the 21-year-old's day was cruelly cut short following an accidental clash of heads with Adam Hastings. He was replaced by Peter O'Mahony and he played like a man with a chip on his shoulder following his omission from the starting side. The Munster player produced one of his most influential displays in green for years, winning another crucial turnover with Josh van der Flier on 24 minutes. Ireland's four-point lead at the break owed largely to a few huge defensive moments and one wonderfully executed move involving Cian Healy and Conor Murray which saw Sexton charge through a gaping hole inside 10 minutes. Farrell's first team selection was eagerly anticipated, with fans waiting to see how far the former defence coach would divert from the core of starters that featured regularly under his predecessor Joe Schmidt. The biggest call to be made was at scrum-half, where Farrell resisted the excellent provincial form of John Cooney and stuck with two-time British and Irish Lion Conor Murray. Murray's performance will only shine a brighter spotlight on that position, with the Munster man enduring a torrid afternoon before being replaced by Cooney after 60 minutes. For years Murray, and indeed Ireland, have relied on the relentless consistency and accuracy of the scrum-half's box kicking. On Saturday however, his kicking provided Ireland with more problems than solutions as he either kicked too long to allow Scotland to run the ball back to a broken field, or too high and short leaving Ireland scrambling to recover the situation. After 30 minutes he found himself isolated and coughed up a penalty that would have seen Ireland relinquish the lead had Hastings not pushed his kick wide. Just before the break Murray saw his pass picked off by Sam Johnson, prompting a desperate chase down the field. This video can not be played Six Nations: Scotland's Stuart Hogg drops ball on try line against Ireland After extending their lead through a Sexton penalty early in the second half, Ireland soon found themselves back in defensive mode as Scotland again bulldozed their way inside the 22. After 50 minutes they finally found a route across the tryline, making use of an overlap on the left to send Hogg in - only for the skipper to drop the ball as he went to touch down. It was the ultimate let-off for the hosts, who could not keep possession for sufficient length of time to release the pressure valve as the game hung in the balance with 10 minutes remaining. Trailing by seven, Scotland made one last foray forward which took them to within a metre of the line. Having tried to find space out wide, they directed themselves back inside but Stander, who was at the heart of Ireland's defensive effort, got himself over the ball and held on to win the penalty that secured an unconvincing victory for his side. Even then, with three minutes left, Ireland made heavy weather of seeing out the game as replacement hooker Ronan Kelleher was penalised for a wayward line-out on his own 22. Ireland and Scotland left the Aviva Stadium knowing much more than just fine-tuning will be required over the next week if they are to avoid defeat to Wales and England respectively in their next fixtures.

'Obscene' 18-month delay for DWP complaints,"The most serious complaints about DWP agencies like the Child Maintenance Service can sometimes take years to be resolved People with the most serious complaints about the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have to wait 18 months before their cases are investigated. BBC Radio 4's Money Box has also learnt that nearly two-thirds of investigations miss their target of being cleared within 20 weeks. One man in dispute with one of its agencies called the delay ""obscene"". The DWP said it understands ""the impact that waiting for an investigation can have on people and their families."" The most common complaints to the DWP include things like a failure to follow proper procedures, excessive delays and poor customer service. Alan, who did not want his real name used, said he faces nearly a four-year wait in total before his case is resolved. He first complained to the government-run Child Maintenance Service (CMS) in November 2017. He says it took thousands of pounds of a redundancy payment directly from his bank account. The dispute has made his existing mental health problems worse and left him ""flatlining"", he says. He added that he is unable to motivate himself to work and is ""getting poorer by the day"". 'Exhausted' by procedure After 18 months, Alan's case still was not resolved. He was then given permission to take his complaint to the Independent Case Examiner (ICE). ICE acts as a free, independent referee for people with complaints about the DWP - and its contracted services, which include things like the CMS, pension payments and disability benefits. Alan was told his complaint had been accepted, but that it would be more than a year before someone was assigned to investigate it. Even after that, Money Box has seen figures which suggest two-thirds of cases take longer than the 20-week target, while half of them take six months or even longer. That means that hundreds of people face a wait of more than two years for their complaints to be resolved once they have been accepted by ICE. He said: ""I am just one of thousands of people in this situation. ""I think the delay in the complaints procedure is atrocious. It's symptomatic of a department that doesn't take its obligations to people it is dealing with seriously."" He added: ""It's a damning indictment of the modus operandi of the Department for Work and Pensions."" ICE only looks at the""most serious complaints"",externalabout services offered by the DWP. That includes organisations such as Jobcentre Plus, the Pension Service, the Disability and Carers Service and Pension Wise, as well as the CMS. ICE will only consider people's complaints if they have finished the complaints procedure with the original agency or organisation. It then decides whether or not it will ""accept"" someone's complaint. If it does, BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme has learnt through a freedom of information request there is a delay of about 18 months before it is opened. Once it is opened, most cases require a full investigation with a 20-week target. Money Box has seen figures which suggest that nearly two-thirds of cases miss this deadline. The Department for Work and Pensions said in a statement: ""We want to make sure people can get the support they are entitled to if they have been treated unfairly, and understand the impact that waiting for an investigation can have on people and their families. ""We are hiring and training new staff as quickly as we can, and cleared more complaints last year than in 2017-18. ""The vast majority of complainants are satisfied with the service they receive.""

Smoke plume from bakery fire covers city,"The Speedibake factory is near Wakefield's Westgate Retail Park About 140 firefighters are tackling a major fire at an industrial bakery in Wakefield, which is covering the area in thick black smoke. The blaze at the Speedibake factory, close to Westgate Retail Park, started at about 13:30 GMT. Police said there were no reports of injuries but the fire service said the ""building construction may contain asbestos"". People living nearby have been told to shut all doors and windows. The wind is also causing smoke to blow towards the city centre, West Yorkshire Police said. Several roads have been shut and drivers have been told to find alternative routes. Wakefield Counciltweeted,externalanyone ""affected by the fire in Wakefield and unable to get home please make your way to Thornes Park Stadium"", adding it would ""remain open"". Police urged those living nearby to close their windows and doors due to the amount of smoke A spokesperson told BBC News: ""There are 15 to 20 people currently there at the rest centre who are affected."" They said the council was helping people with transport to reach the stadium and it would help them return once the area was declared safe. Wakefield residents who were earlier evacuated from the area can now return home, the council added, but they ""are advised to keep all windows and doors closed as a precaution"". People also reported being evacuated from nearby buildings. Connor Strachan, 19, from Alverthorpe, and Eleanor Goldthorpe, 17, had planned to watch Jumanji at the Cineworld cinema opposite the bakery, but when they arrived they were told they had to wait in the building. Mr Strachan said there were nearly 100 people at the cinema, including some from Mecca Bingo directly opposite the bakery. He said: ""We were eventually let out, a lot of the other buildings were evacuated too."" Cineworld Wakefield tweeted at 18:00 GMT to say it was currently closed. This video can not be played Smoke from the fire in Wakefield is blowing towards the city centre Nicky Harley was going to the B&Q shop on the retail park when the fire broke out. ""As I approached the store I saw police officers in masks telling people to move back,"" she said. ""There was heavy thick black smoke."" She said she then walked over to a nearby supermarket and saw people with their hands over their mouths saying they felt light headed. ""I also felt faint and light headed,"" she said. ""My friend is a nurse and she told me there might be a risk of airborne asbestos."" West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service initially warned of the potential for asbestos in the smoke plume, but later confirmed the substance was not present in the section of building hit by the blaze. Eyewitness Nicky Harley said people reported feeling faint due to the smoke Power cuts were also reported but electricity has since been restored. Northern Powergrid tweeted to thank customers for their patience during the outage. Some people on social media also reported hearing explosions coming from the factory. Andrew Jackson, BBC News Great palls of smoke have been covering much of the city skyline, with people stopping to look in astonishment. The wind has blown the acrid smoke across large parts of the city as firefighters work to contain the blaze and police wearing protective masks have put road blocks around the scene, stopping people from getting too close to the factory. People have been starting to make their way home and the area around the blaze is eerily quiet, disturbed only by the sound of trains passing by on a nearby line. In a statement, West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said: ""As a precautionary measure we are advising people living in the vicinity to remain indoors and keep windows and a doors closed."" The service said it expected to remain at the scene for the next 24 to 48 hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UK leaves the European Union,"This video can not be played Pre-recorded bongs from Big Ben played out as the UK left the European Union The UK has officially left the European Union after 47 years of membership - and more than three years after it voted to do so in a referendum. The historic moment, which happened at 23:00 GMT, was marked by both celebrations and anti-Brexit protests. Candlelit vigils were held in Scotland, which voted to stay in the EU, while Brexiteers partied in London's Parliament Square. Boris Johnson has vowed to bring the country together and ""take us forward"". Bells and bunting for Brexit, or shedding a tear? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't In a message released on social media an hour before the UK's departure, the prime minister said: ""For many people this is an astonishing moment of hope, a moment they thought would never come. ""And there are many of course who feel a sense of anxiety and loss."" He said some had worried the political ""wrangle"" would not end but it was his job to take the country forward. Sir John Curtice: Do Britons now agree about Brexit? Brexitcast: The live final 12 moments in the UK-EU relationship Brexit supporters held a party in Parliament Square Brexit parties were held in pubs and social clubs across the UK as the country counted down to its official departure. Thousands gathered in Parliament Square to celebrate Brexit, singing patriotic songs and cheering speeches from leading Brexiteers, including Nigel Farage. The Brexit Party leader said: ""Let us celebrate tonight as we have never done before. ""This is the greatest moment in the modern history of our great nation."" Pro-EU demonstrators earlier staged a march in Whitehall to bid a ""fond farewell"" to the union - and anti-Brexit rallies and candlelit vigils were held in Scotland. Police in Whitehall arrested four men and also charged one man with criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly, while in Glasgow one man was arrested. Meanwhile, other symbolic moments on a day of mixed emotions included: The Union flag being removed from the European Union institutions in Brussels The Cabinet meeting in Sunderland, the first city to declare in favour of Brexit when the 2016 results were announced A light show illuminating 10 Downing Street and Union flags lining The Mall A 50p coin to mark the occasion entering circulation The building of the UK government's delegation to the EUchanged its name and sign,external The government's EU delegation has changed its name from ""representation"" to ""mission"" A pro-EU group earlier projected a message onto the White Cliffs of Dover In Northern Ireland, the campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit staged a series of protests in Armagh, near to the border with the Irish Republic. The Irish border - now the UK's land border with the EU - wasa major sticking pointin the Brexit divorce talks. NI and the Irish Republic ""will continue to remain neighbours"",said NI First Minister Arlene Fosteron RTÃ on Friday. At 23:00 GMT, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted a picture of the EU flag, adding: ""Scotland will return to the heart of Europe as an independent country - #LeaveALightOnForScotland"". Ms Sturgeonis calling for a new referendumon Scottish independence, arguing that Brexit is a ""material change in circumstances"". Speaking in Cardiff, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales, which voted to leave the EU, remained a ""European nation"". Can laughing at Brexit bring Leavers and Remainers together? How the UK celebrated joining Europe Brexit in key quotes Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Brexit select committee and backed Remain, said he was ""sad last night... but we have to accept it"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was always a ""reluctant"" EU nation, adding: ""We joined late and we left early."" Pro-EU campaigners take part in a ""Missing EU Already"" rally outside the Scottish Parliament What now? It's happened. A dreary night didn't discourage those celebrating in Parliament Square. We wake this morning out of the European Union. But we follow their rules until the end of the year, without a say. We are separate after more than 40 years, but remember much of the status quo will hold for now - the UK and the EU, the awkward couple, finally divorced - but still sharing a house and the bills. But what the prime minister hails as a new era, a bright new dawn, starts months of hard bargaining with our neighbours across the Channel. The UK's requests: a free trade agreement, cooperation on security, and new arrangements for fishing are just some of the vital arguments that lie ahead. Read more from Laura here. UK citizens will notice few immediate changes now that the country is no longer in the European Union. Most EU laws will continue to be in force - including the free movement of people - until 31 December, when thetransition periodcomes to an end. The UK is aiming to sign a permanent free trade agreement with the EU, along the lines of the one the EU has with Canada. But European leaders have warned that the UK faces a tough battle to get a deal by that deadline. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said agreeing a trade deal was ""not a charitable exercise, this is an exercise of both sides recognising their own best interests"". ""From today, we are their [the EU's] biggest export market,"" he told the Today programme. Officials remove the British flag at European Union Council in Brussels In anopen letter to the British people,,externalFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he was ""deeply sad"" but: ""The channel has never managed to separate our destinies; Brexit will not do so, either."" He also defended the way France acted in the negotiations, saying neither the French nor anyone else in the EU was ""driven by a desire for revenge or punishment"". Meanwhile, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinatorGuy Verhofstadt said,externalhe would ""look after your star and work to ensure the EU is a project you'll want to be a part of again soon"". European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has said Britain and Brussels will fight for their interests in trade talks. She paid tribute to UK citizens who had ""contributed to the European Union and made it stronger"" and said the UK's final day in the EU was ""emotional"".

Two years later the country voted by an overwhelming majority to remain in the bloc in the first nationwide referendum. Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron held another referendum in June 2016, amid growing pressure from his own MPs and Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party. Mr Cameron led the campaign to stay in the EU but lost by the narrow margin of 52% to 48% to the Leave campaign, fronted by fellow Conservative Boris Johnson. Mr Cameron's successor as prime minister, Theresa May, repeatedly failed to get her version of an EU withdrawal agreement passed by Parliament and was replaced by Mr Johnson, who also failed to get his plans through. Mr Johnson managed to secure an early general election in December last year, which he won with an 80-seat majority on a promise to ""get Brexit done"". The PM's EU withdrawal deal was approved by MPs just before Christmas, and the bill became law earlier this year.

UK begins new chapter outside European Union,"This video can not be played Pre-recorded bongs from Big Ben played out as the UK left the European Union European leaders have expressed sadness at the UK leaving the EU, with France's Emmanuel Macron emphasising Britain's ""unrivalled ties"" with the French. Mr Macronsaid he was,external""deeply sad"" while the EU's Guy Verhofstadt pledged to try and ""ensure the EU is a project you'll want to be a part of again"". Celebrations and anti-Brexit protestswere held on Friday night to mark the UK's departure. Ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis said everyone would be a winner in the end. The UK officially left the European Union on Friday at 23:00 GMT after 47 years of membership, and more than three years after it voted to do so in a referendum. In Pictures: The UK leaves the EU Brexit: What happens next? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't Brexit parties were held in some pubs and social clubs as well as in London's Parliament Square, as the country counted down to its official departure.

""For many people this is an astonishing moment of hope, a moment they thought would never come,"" he said. ""And there are many of course who feel a sense of anxiety and loss."" In an open letter,externalto the British public, French President Mr Macron said he was thinking of the millions of Britons ""who still feel deeply attached to the European Union"". ""You are leaving the European Union but you are not leaving Europe,"" he said. ""Nor are you becoming detached from France or the friendship of its people. ""The Channel has never managed to separate our destinies; Brexit will not do so, either."" Mr Macron also said the EU must learn lessons from the ""shock"" of Brexit, adding: ""I am convinced therefore that Europe needs new momentum."" And he defended the way France acted in the Brexit negotiations, saying neither the French nor anyone else in the EU was ""driven by a desire for revenge or punishment"".

Brexitcast: The live final 12 big moments in the UK-EU relationship Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Davis - who quit as Brexit secretary in protest at former prime minister Theresa May's Brexit plan - said it would be a ""fair race"" to reach a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020 but ""it can be done"". The UK is aiming to sign a permanent free trade agreement with the EU, along the lines of the one the EU has with Canada, by the end of the transition period in December. Mr Davis said reaching a deal was ""not a charitable exercise, this is an exercise of both sides recognising their own best interests"". European leaders have warned that the UK faces a tough battle to get a deal by that deadline. Mairead McGuinness, the vice president of the European Parliament, said progress to agree a trade deal ""might be left to the very last minute"". ""Normally in trade negotiations we're trying to come together,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""For the first time we're going try and negotiate a trade agreement where somebody wants to pull away from us. I can't get my head around that and I think it's going to be quite complicated."" We are separate after more than 40 years, but remember much of the status quo will hold for now - the UK and the EU, the awkward couple, finally divorced - but still sharing a house and the bills.

How will Brexit affect holidays?,"Rules on travelling between the UK and European Union countries change on 1 January 2021, after an agreement to keep many rules the same for 11 months after Brexit comes to an end. At the moment, no. Because of Covid, travellers from most non-EU countries can't visit except for essential reasons. After 31 December, the UK will no longer be treated like a member of the EU, so becomes subject to these rules. The only non-EU countries exempt from these restrictions are those with very low infection rates, such as New Zealand. The EU could choose to exempt the UK, and individual EU countries could create a ""travel corridor"" with the UK, allowing restriction-free travel. If the rules are changed, you'll be able to travel to all EU countries - plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - as a tourist, without needing a visa. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal You'll be able to stay for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. So, an Easter weekend in Spain, followed by a June fortnight in Italy, would be covered by your 90-day limit. The rules for Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are different. You could make a 90-day trip to any of them and still not use up your 90-day allowance for other EU countries. You may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, to work or study, or forbusiness travel.,external From 2022, UK nationals will have to pay for avisa-waiver scheme,externalin order to visit many European countries. No. Your current passport will be valid as long as: It is less than 10 years old And has six months left before it runs out The six-month rule won't apply for visits to Ireland, because it is part ofthe Common Travel Area.,external If you need a new passport -which will be a different colour- the government says youshould apply in plenty of time.,external The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)has entitled about 27 million UK citizens to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in EU countries, as well as a number of others. All EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will be valid until their expiry date (on the front of your card). The government says it will issue a new card, called the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Like EHIC, it will cover chronic or existing illnesses, routine maternity care and emergencies. However, there are no further details yet on when it will start. Its advice,externalis that you should buy travel insurance with healthcare cover before going on holiday - especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition. You'll no longer be able to use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes. When you arrive in an EU country (except Ireland), be prepared to show your return ticket. You could also be asked to show that you have enough money for your stay. It could also takelonger to cross the UK border.,external The guarantee of free roaming throughout the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norwayends on 1 January 2021. You should check with your mobile provider to see if you're likely to face extra charges. The four main UK operators have said they have no plans to reintroduce roaming fees. The EU and the UK agreed to co-operate on international mobile roaming. But there is nothing in the post-Brexit trade agreement that would stop travellers being charged for using their phone in the EU, and vice versa, in the future. The government has passed laws to protect customers, including: A Â£45-a-month cap on using mobile data abroad (then you must opt in to use more) Requirements for customers to be informed when they've reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance Yes, but you'll need to take your driving licence, as well as your log book (V5C) and valid insurance documents if you are taking your own car. You will need to contact your insurer six weeks before you travel to get a green card that will prove you have insurance. Most drivers will not need to buy an International Driving Permit, with the exception of those with paper licences (not photocards) and those with licences issued in Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man, who will need one for some European countries. What are the rules on driving in the EU after transition? Pet passports issued in Great Britain will not be valid for travel to the EU from 1 January 2021. From that date,pets travelling from Great Britain to the EU will need to have an animal health certificate (AHC).,externalThe same rules will apply if you are taking your pet to Northern Ireland. In 2002, this dog was the first to travel to the UK using a pet passport AHCs will be issued by a vet, will be valid for four months and must be obtained no more than 10 days before travel. AHCs will be valid for a single trip into the EU, onward travel within the EU and re-entry to Great Britain. Your pet must have been microchipped and have had a rabies vaccination. It will also have to have a treatment againstEchinococcus multilocularis(a type of tapeworm) for entry into Finland, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway or Malta.

Things that will change after Brexit,"Now that the UK has formally left the European Union, it immediately enters an 11-month transition period. During the transition the UK will continue to obey EU rules and pay money to the EU. Most things will stay the same but there will be some changes: The Brexit Party won the most UK seats in the May 2019 European elections Familiar faces such as Nigel Farage and Ann Widdecombe are among the UK's 73 MEPs who will automatically lose their seats in the European Parliament. That's because, at the moment of Brexit, the UK will leave all of the EU's political institutions and agencies. However, in addition to the UK following EU rules during the transition period, the European Court of Justice will continue to have the final say over legal disputes. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will have to be specially invited if he wants to join other leaders at EU Council summits in the future. British ministers will also no longer attend regular EU meetings that decide things such as fishing limits. The UK will be able to start talking to countries around the world about setting new rules for buying and selling goods and services. It has not been allowed to hold formal trade negotiations with countries like the US and Australia while it remained an EU member. Brexit supporters argue that having the freedom to set its own trade policy will boost the UK's economy. There's also a lot to be discussed with the EU. Agreeing a UK-EU trade deal is a top priority, so extra charges on goods and other trade barriers aren't needed when the transition ends. If any trade deals are reached, they won't be able to start until the transition period ends. Sir John Curtice: Do Britons now agree about Brexit? Brexit: What is a level playing field? Blue passports were replaced in 1988 with the burgundy design Blue passports will be making a return, more than 30 years after they were replaced by the current burgundy design. Announcing the change in 2017, then Immigration Minister, Brandon Lewis, praised thereturn to the ""iconic"" blue-and-gold design, first used in 1921. The new colour will be phased in over a number of months, with all new passports issued in blue by the middle of the year. Existing burgundy passports will continueto be valid. The coins had to be re-made after Brexit was delayed About three million commemorative 50p Brexit coins bearing the date ""31 January"" and the inscription: ""Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations"", will enter circulation on Friday. Thecoin has received a mixed reaction,with some Remain supporters saying they will refuse to accept it. The government had planned to introduce a similar coin on 31 October, the date Brexit was previously meant to happen. However, those coins had to be melted down and recycled after the deadline was extended. The team that handled the UK-EU negotiations andno-deal preparationswill disband on Brexit day. The Department for Exiting the European Union was set up by former Prime Minister Theresa May in 2016. For the upcoming talks, the UK's negotiating team will be based in Downing Street. It won't be possible for some suspected criminals to be brought back to the UK if they flee to Germany. Germany's constitution does not allow its citizens to be extradited, unless it's to another EU country. ""This exception cannot apply any more after the UK has left EU,"" a spokesman from the German Federal Ministry of Justice told BBC News. It's unclear if the same restrictions will apply to other countries. Slovenia, for example, says the situation is complicated, while the European Commission was unable to provide comment. The UK Home Office says the European Arrest Warrant will continue to apply during the transition period. (That means Germany will be able to extradite non-German citizens.) However, it adds that if a country's laws prevent extradition to the UK it ""will be expected to take over the trial or sentence of the person concerned"". A really simple guide to Brexit What is the transition period? Because thetransition periodbegins immediately after Brexit, the vast majority of other things remain the same - at least until 31 December 2020 including: UK nationals will still be treated the same as EU nationals during the transition Flights, boats and trains will operate as usual. When it comes to passport control, during the transition period, UK nationals will still be allowed to queue in the areas reserved for EU arrivals only. As long as they are valid, these will continue to be accepted. Driving after Brexit: What you need to know EHICs will still be valid during the transition These are the cards that provide UK nationals with state-provided medical treatment in case of illness or accident. They can be used in any EU country (as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and will continue to be valid during the transition period. Will the EHIC still be valid after Brexit? Freedom of movement will continue to apply during the transition, so UK nationals will still be able to live and work in the EU as they currently do. The same applies for EU nationals wanting to live and work in the UK. UK nationals living in the EU will continue to receive their state pension and will also receive the annual increase. How will Brexit affect UK pensioners in Europe? The UK will continue to pay into the EU budget during the transition. This means existing schemes, paid for by EU grants, will continue to be funded. UK-EU trade will continue without any extra charges or checks being introduced.

What does healing the Brexit divide mean?,"The moment of Brexit is a time to ""find closure and let the healing begin"", according to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. But what does ""healing"" involve? If there is one thing that people on both sides of the referendum debate agree on it is that, at times, the argument became far too hostile. In the House of Commons, on social media and in the streets, passions became inflamed. An official statement from the prime minister earlier this month said now was ""a moment to heal divisions"". It was also announced that Brexit would be marked with a Downing Street light display, the hoisting of flags, a countdown clock and the minting of a commemorative coin. While many of his supporters want to celebrate leaving the European Union, there's little sign that these events have healed political divisions. On the other hand, it's not clear how the decision of the SNP to fly an EU flag outside the Scottish Parliament building was going to bring people together. To heal, we need to understand the nature of the divide. Why do people feel so strongly about Brexit? What are the values that lie behind the slogans and insults? There is a danger in trying to characterise the Leave/Remain split too rigidly. The practice of describing people, places, regions and nations as ""Leave"" or ""Remain"" risks polarising the argument with a binary description that fails to reflect the nuance behind the choice and the result. For instance, London is often described as a ""Remain city"". But more Londoners voted to leave the EU than voted for Remain-supporting Sadiq Khan as mayor. Meanwhile, even in that most pro-Brexit town of Boston in Lincolnshire, a quarter of those who took part opted to remain. Voters had a whole list of reasons for choosing to support one side or the other, often weighing up different arguments. No place was 100% for leaving or remaining in the EU. But new opinion polling, commissioned by the BBC and theCampaign for Social Science,external, helps us understand the core beliefs associated with the way people voted. The survey, conducted by Ipsos MORI, asked people to say which propositions came closest to their view. The phrase ""influences from other countries and other cultures make Britain a better place to live"" was supported by a majority of Remain voters (56%), but just a quarter (23%) of Leave voters. The alternative proposition - ""influences from other countries and cultures threaten the British way of life"" - was supported by just 18% of Remain voters but 52% of Leave voters. A similar result was found with a slightly different proposition. The phrase ""Britain will be stronger if it is open to changes and influences from other countries and other cultures"" was supported by 58% of Remain voters but just 22% of Leave voters. The alternative - ""Britain will be stronger in the future if it sticks to its traditions and way of life"" - was supported by 56% of Leave voters and just 14% of Remain voters. Along with other polling data, Remain voters emerge as significantly more likely to celebrate Britain's diversity and say they feel European. Leave voters are more likely to say Britain's history, heritage, pageantry and Christian tradition are important to their national identity. Leave voters appeared more patriotic, proud of their nationality and more likely to suggest their country was better than others. Remain voters placed more importance on being part of the international community. What is suggested by the survey is two visions of Britain - one which seeks to protect tradition, heritage, culture and familiar way of life, another which is happy to embrace change and keen to be part of a global conversation. They are not mutually exclusive ideas - there is always a balance to be found between continuity and change. We can all feel that we want to protect tradition and be open to new ideas. It is a matter of emphasis. But the reason that this debate has inspired such passions is that it goes to the kind of country we want to live in, its priorities and values. In that context, what does healing look like? Culturally, British politics and public discourse tend to be adversarial. The House of Commons is designed to pit one side against the other. Compromise is often portrayed as weakness. Consensus-building seen as alien to our political tradition. But conflict-resolution experts say healing doesn't mean conceding the argument. It is about understanding and valuing the views of people with whom you don't agree. It is not about trying to change people's minds or prove them wrong. It is about""respectful disagreement"". Part of the problem is that it's increasingly easy to live our lives in echo chambers, surrounding ourselves with those who endorse our personal view of the world. On Facebook and Twitter, we naturally exclude those whose views we don't like. The newspapers and websites we choose, the books we read, the pubs and cafes we frequent, the films we watch - all of them are to some extent selected because they bolster our views and values rather than challenging them. Indeed, when we do find ourselves hearing opinions at odds with our own core beliefs, it can feel quite upsetting. The views of people we disagree with have a much bigger psychological effect on us than the voices of those who think like us. Healing the divide, it seems, is going to require us to get out of our comfort zone, out of our bubble. ""More in Common"" is the name of more than one body trying to understand this situation. A foundation set up in memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox organises community events which encourage people with different views to come together and explore what unites rather than divides them. A separate research organisation operating in the UK, US, Germany and France, describes its mission as working to ""address the underlying drivers of fracturing and polarisation, and build more united, resilient and inclusive societies"". This year they will be teaming up with organisations and institutions to see what role they can play in ""bridging divides"" in Britain. One charity they already work with is the Roots Programme which takes people from different walks of life and gets them to ""meet and eat, talk and debate"", physically removing them from their ""bubble"". The first pair to take part were Ben Lane, 31, a Remain-supporting, north-London-dwelling former business strategy consultant, and Peter Curtis, 47, a community football coach from Sunderland who voted to leave. Both men acknowledge their exchange visits could have been better. ""It was quite depressing going down to London and seeing the money flying about,"" said Peter, a former construction worker who now earns less than Â£10,000 a year in Sunderland. For Ben, the experience made him embarrassed that he played no role in his community, despite his prestigious job as a charity chief executive. But they now both feel optimistic about the healing of the nation after Brexit. Ben said: ""One of the worst ingredients for healing is uncertainty, and now we've got more certainty. ""It definitely means we can try and galvanise around something."" Helpfully, the phrase ""more in common"" has some truth to it in the UK. Compared with the US where the liberal/conservative divide runs along almost every area of policy, here there is still broad national consensus on many key issues - taxation, welfare, the NHS, abortion, gun control or homosexuality. That is not to say that everyone agrees on everything, but it is more likely there will be some common ground where people can gather to explore the aspirations and values they share. Healing the Brexit divide, though, needs to be more than a group hug. It also means dealing with the consequences of a very fractious and unpleasant period in our politics, a time when many questioned the effectiveness of our system of governance and when confidence in our democracy was shaken. A season of stories about bringing people together in a fragmented world. Watch: Get a flavour of the Crossing Divides season How the BBC is tackling the issue of polarisation in society Her ancestors enslaved mine - now we're friends Tellingly, all the big political parties included proposals for democratic renewal in their manifestos. There was consensus, at least, on the need to take a close look at how power works. The Brexit vote itself has been interpreted as a cry of pain from communities which felt that their voice was being ignored, that decisions affecting their lives were being taken without consultation or discussion in anonymous offices in Westminster or behind mirrored glass in Brussels. Politicians of all stripes appear to accept the need to listen to and respond to those concerns, finding ways to help people feel they have a genuine connection to power. The government intends to create a Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission that willâbe instructed to come up with proposals to ""restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates"". No details have been given on the terms of reference or make-up of this new body, although there have been suggestions that it may be asked to look at the balance of power between government, MPs and the judiciary after the Supreme Court ruled that Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament last autumn was unlawful. Already, some have argued that might be interpreted as Brexiteer vengeance rather than a sincere attempt to heal a wounded democracy. Such speculation helps explain why constitutional or democratic reform is tricky for government or even for Parliament. Any adjustment to the architecture is likely to have implications for the power of ministers and MPs. That is why civil society has stepped into this space, looking at ways to involve citizens directly in any redesign of the British constitution - trying to take party politics out of the process and give power to the people. Citizens' assemblies are increasingly used by governments around the world to find answers to the trickiest of problems - abortion in Ireland, nuclear power in South Korea, energy policy in Texas, waste recycling in South Australia. More on Brexit What will change after 31 January? 12 big moments in the UK-EU relationship Sir John Curtice: Do Britons now agree about leaving the EU? A randomly selected cross-section of the public is recruited to consider a policy question through rational, respectful and reasoned discussion. They engage with information and arguments around a topic before agreeing on a proposal for consideration by lawmakers. UK parliamentary committees have held citizens' assemblies on climate change and social care to help understand what really matters to informed voters.  In Scotland, a randomly selected assembly is currently considering the nation's governance, with its recommendations to be considered by the Scottish Parliament. Over the next two years, the Citizens' Convention on UK Democracy will attempt to engage 10 million people in what it describes as a ""UK conversation"". Thousands will receive a formal invitation to participate in a convention, their names selected by civic lottery. Among the issues that will be considered are the voting system, the future of the House of Lords, devolving power to local and regional bodies, how politics should be paid for and whether the UK should have a written constitution. A number of senior MPs from across the political spectrum have agreed to help ensure that the conclusions of the convention are considered by Parliament. There are other initiatives working in the same area, all convinced that the divide exposed by the Brexit debate can be healed only by getting under the bonnet of the UK's democracy, examining its inner workings and looking at ways to improve the performance. The Hansard Society's most recent annual Audit of Political Engagement suggested 72% of voters think Britain's system of governance needs significant improvement and almost half (47%) say they feel they have no influence at all over national decision-making. With the arguments and campaigns over Brexit now over, this does seem to be a good moment to consider the lessons of what has been an uncomfortable and at times painful process. It has knocked the confidence and pride Britain once had in its democracy. If healing is to happen, it will require the nation to ask some searching questions of itself and what kind of country we want to be. Additional reporting by Callum May Â© 2025 BBC.

Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for BrexitWhat now after Brexit? The EU viewThe story of Brexit in key quotes,"It used to be a fringe obsession ignored by the political mainstream. So how did Euroscepticism conquer Britain? The word ""Eurosceptic"" was not coined until the 1980s, to describe a rebellious band of Tory MPs, but hostility to closer European integration dates back decades. Britain voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Economic Community in 1975, but never joined the currency or the passport-free area, and a substantial body of public opinion had always believed the country was better off out. They rarely had a voice at Westminster. The campaign to leave the European Union - via another referendum - took root outside of Parliament. It was pursued by mavericks, political outcasts and a fair few eccentrics. It was a long, and often thankless, battle - and it began before Britain had even joined. Many viewed EEC membership as a betrayal of the Commonwealth With World War II fresh in the memory, and the Empire rapidly disintegrating, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan decided Britain's future lay in Europe. His, in the end unsuccessful, application to join the six nation European Economic Community enraged many in his party, who saw it as a betrayal of the Commonwealth nations, which were Britain's biggest trading partners at the time. Many in Labour viewed the EEC as a business-led Tory con trick. Both sides fretted about the loss of independence and status it would seem to entail. Most opponents of membership tended to be on the far left and right fringes, but there were big, mainstream voices in both the Labour and Tory parties that were also firmly against it. ""I'm not very keen on the Common Market. After all, we beat Germany and we beat Italy and we saved France and Belgium and Holland. I never see why we should go crawling to them,"" said former Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee. The first substantial campaign against British membership - The Anti-Common Market League - was formed in June 1961, by a bunch of disgruntled Conservatives. It had broadened out into a cross-party effort by the following September, when it staged a mass anti-Common Market rally at London's Albert Hall. Major Smedley sets off for Rome, to campaign against Britain's second, failed, attempt to join the EEC Euroscepticism has always attracted colourful characters. Major Oliver Smedley was a decorated World War II veteran and pirate radio entrepreneur, who was cleared of murder in 1966 after he shot a business rival in a dispute over a transmitter. Keep Britain Out stage a mock funeral for democracy in Whitehall Maj Smedley, who quit the Liberal Partyafter being slow-handclapped at the party's conference,external, believed joining the ""protectionist"" EEC would lead to higher food prices and poverty. His Keep Britain Out campaign merged with the Anti-Common Market League in the late 1960s and is still going today, as Get Britain Out. The tabloids were cheerleaders for Britain's membership of the EEC On 1 January 1973, Britain officially joined the EEC, at the third attempt.Opinion polls suggested the nation was divided,externalover Tory Prime Minister Ted Heath's decision. Eurosceptics, on the left and right, stepped up their calls for a referendum. Enoch Powell (second left) shares a stage with future Labour leader Michael Foot (far right) There was widespread disbelief in Eurosceptic circles when voters opted by 67% to 33% to stay in the Common Market, in the UK's first nationwide referendum. The vote had been called by Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson largely as a way to paper over the huge divisions in his party over Europe. Margaret Thatcher was a leading voice in the campaign to stay in the EEC Some polls suggested the unlikely alliance of Tony Benn, from the Labour left, and Enoch Powell, Ulster Unionist and former Tory, who emerged as the chief spokesmen for the No campaign, was a turn-off for voters. Whatever the case, the defeat was a body blow to the Eurosceptics. Many lean years followed, with poorly attended meetings, lost election deposits and pamphlets few read, even if polls suggested Britain was turning against the EEC. Labour campaigned to leave the EEC at the 1983 general election but went down to a heavy defeat and the Eurosceptics in its ranks were pushed to the margins. Margaret Thatcher warned against 'dominance from Brussels' Margaret Thatcher's Bruges speech was the moment Euroscepticism in the UK was reborn and it arguably set Britain on the path to Brexit. She had travelled to the Belgian city to fire a warning shot across the EEC's bows, over its ambitions to move beyond the single market to create a ""social Europe"", with new employment rights and regulations on business, as well as a single currency. It all smacked of socialism by the backdoor to Mrs Thatcher, rather than the free trade area she had enthusiastically championed in 1975. Britain's ""destiny is in Europe"", she stressed, but added: ""We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels."" It was a riposte to a speech Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, had given to the Trades Union Congress 12 weeks earlier. Which brings us to... Jacques Delors sets out his vision of a ""social Europe"" at the TUC conference In 1975, Britain's best-selling newspaper, The Sun, had told its readers: ""We are all Europeans now."" In November 1990, it called on its front page for them to stick two fingers up to Jacques Delors - ""Up, Yours Delors"", said the headline - to ""tell the French fool where to stuff his ECU"" (the ECU was the forerunner of the euro). The rest of the right-wing tabloids were now just as Eurosceptic, if not as blunt. But calling for Britain to leave was still strictly off limits in the mainstream media and politics. Alan Sked came fourth in the 1993 Newbury by-election with 601 votes It began in a dusty office at the London School of Economics. European history lecturer Alan Sked founded the Anti-Federalist League to ""prevent the UK becoming a province of a united European superstate"". The tiny group, which included Nigel Farage among its early recruits, campaigned against the Maastricht Treaty, which would turn the EEC into the European Union, including a commitment to ""ever closer union"" and the free movement of people. The League soon changed its name to the more voter-friendly UK Independence Party and began calling for Britain's exit from the EU. But it was largely ignored, or ridiculed, by the media, and struggled to make an impact. Mr Sked, a former member of the Liberal Party, left in 1997, complaining that it had been taken over by right wingers and racists. Conservative MPs fought a guerrilla war against their own government's support for the Maastricht Treaty. Some of the Maastricht rebels would go on to play leading roles in the 2016 Brexit campaign (before receiving knighthoods), including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Bernard Jenkin. But even the most Eurosceptic among them never spoke publicly about leaving the EU at this stage, preferring instead to talk about ""reform"" or, if they were in a daring mood, ""fundamental reform"". Sir James Goldsmith injected cash and energy into the Eurosceptic cause The mercurial billionaire, and father of Conservative minister Zac, founded the Referendum Party to campaign for Britain to be given another say on Europe. He spent more than Â£7m on the party's 1997 general election campaign - including a glossy promotional video mailed to five million households - for a 2.6% share of the vote. Nigel Farage was one of three UKIP candidates to make a breakthrough In many ways, Nigel Farage owes his political career to a Belgian mathematician. In 1878, Victor D'Hondt devised the system of proportional representation adopted by the UK in 1999 for elections to the European Parliament. UKIP and other smaller parties, like the Greens, had stood no chance under first-past-the-post. Suddenly the door to a seat in Brussels was open, and Mr Farage and two other UKIP candidates were first through it, despite receiving virtually no national media coverage for their campaign. ""Brexit wouldn't have happened without proportional representation or, ironically, the European Parliament,""Mr Farage told Channel 4 News this week,external. ""It was actually getting elected to that place that gave us some kind of platform,"" he added, and UKIP used the ""wherewithal"" provided by the Brussels parliament to ""build a UK political movement"". The same year saw the arrival of Dominic Cummings, future mastermind of the Vote Leave campaign, on the Eurosceptic scene, as campaign director of anti-euro pressure group Business for Sterling. Robert Kilroy-Silk helped to put UKIP on the political map UKIP was still struggling for public recognition and credibility when, out of nowhere, Robert Kilroy-Silk joined it. A household name, due to his long-running daytime talk show, Kilroy, he had been fired by the BBC over comments he'd made in a newspaper column. Mr Kilroy-Silk's brief UKIP adventure - and the massive injection of cash that came with it, from self-made Yorkshire millionaire Paul Sykes - helped the party to the best results in its history in the 2004 European elections, gaining 2.6 million votes. UKIP - and its call for a referendum on leaving the EU - were now on the political map. UKIP used David Cameron's insult as a rallying cry It's possible to track the rise of UKIP in insults directed at its members by Conservative leaders, as they tried in vain to stem the flow of supporters to Nigel Farage's ""People's Army"". In 2004, Michael Howard - who would go on to be a Brexit supporter - called them ""extremists"" and ""cranks"". Two years later David Cameron refused to apologise for labelling them ""fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists"", handing UKIP a publicity coup and a rallying cry. This video can not be played The Commons Speaker John Bercow announced the result of the vote by MPs Some 81 Tory MPs defied Prime Minister David Cameron to vote in favour of an EU referendum in October 2011. Mr Cameron easily won the vote, with Labour support, but leaving the EU - as one of a range of options - was now firmly on the agenda at Westminster. Mr Cameron wouldannounce plans for a referendum just under two years later. UKIP's Suzanne Evans in the 2014 election campaign Nigel Farage had finally found a way to turn the latent Euroscepticism in large sections of the British public into electoral gold, as concerns about the flow of migrants from new EU states were added to the traditional cry for freedom from bossy Brussels bureaucracy. UKIP seemed unstoppable in 2014. It topped the poll in the European elections, with a massive 3.8 million votes - and made further gains in local elections to consolidate the breakthrough it had made in 2012. Then Mr Farage turned up the heat on David Cameron by unveiling two Tory defectors, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, in quick succession, with the threat of more to come. Boris Johnson was the biggest name to embrace the Eurosceptic cause David Cameron had been stunned by the number of Conservative MPs who had joined the Leave campaign, not realising the depth of Eurosceptic feeling in his party. But he had not expected Boris Johnson to join the cause. The official Leave campaign wanted nothing to do with Nigel Farage over fears he would scare off floating voters. Its recruitment of Mr Johnson - one of the biggest, and most popular, names in British politics - was a game changing moment. Euroscepticism had finally shaken off its reputation as an eccentric fringe movement. Recalling UKIP's early days in the European Parliament in 1999, at a farewell press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Farage said: ""We were considered pretty odd. Perhaps we were, I don't know, certainly very eccentric. ""And as those years went by I did begin to wonder whether I might become the patron saint of lost causes."" But now, he added, ""far from being a minority sport, Euroscepticism had become the mainstream, settled view in the United Kingdom"".

What now after Brexit? The EU viewThe story of Brexit in key quotes,"This video can not be played Brexit: How did we get here? As Brexit dawned, I found myself reporting for the BBC from outside the glass and concrete behemoth otherwise known as the European Commission building, in Brussels. It's the same place I've regularly stood over the past three-and-a-half years, attempting to explain the EU perspective on Brexit following our referendum and throughout the divorce negotiations. It struck me that the impersonal, impenetrable-looking monolith embodies the image so many in the UK have of the EU as a whole. But going through my mind on Friday night were all the ""ordinary"" Europeans I've met across the continent while covering the Brexit story: engineers, teachers, bakers and bus drivers who asked ""Why are you doing this?"" and insisted: ""Don't leave!"" Whilst never the most enthusiastic member, the UK was part of the European project for almost half a century. Behind closed doors and away from gaze of the UK's more eurosceptic media, we were known for playing a big part in launching some of the bloc's most ambitious projects: the single market, the single currency (though we then opted not to join the euro) and the EU's enlargement eastwards. Bells and bunting for Brexit, or shedding a tear? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't 12 moments in the UK-EU relationship On a personal level, EU leaders tell me they'll miss having the British sense of humour and no-nonsense attitude at their table. If they were to be brutally honest, they'd have admitted they'll mourn the loss of our not-insignificant contribution to the EU budget too. But now we've left the ""European family"" (as Brussels insiders sometimes like to call the EU) and as trade talks begin, how long will it take for warm words to turn into gritted teeth? On the eve of Brexit, the President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, pledged the EU would always act ""with a sense of brotherhood"" towards the UK. But familiarity can breed contempt. Whether family feuds or lovers' quarrels, aren't some of the deepest rifts between people who once shared the closest of bonds? Ministers in Boris Johnson's government wonder aloud why the EU demands they sign up to free trade agreement conditions the EU didn't impose on others like Canada or Japan. This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""It's a very emotional day"" But Canada and Japan aren't family for the EU. They don't share the same intimate history or geography. They don't pose the same threat of overnight, on-the-doorstep serious competition. So when EU leaders tell the freshly-Brexited UK that they love them but they'll do them no favours across the negotiating table, they mean it. And it's not just about business and economics. Brussels feels defensive about Brexit because some see it as a significant EU failure that the UK couldn't be persuaded to stay. In almost the same breath as telling me how emotional she felt about the UK's departure this week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told me that Brexit has also had a very positive effect on the EU. It's helped unify the member states, she told me. She argued it was clear Brexit could not solve big problems like climate change, so it was evidently better to stick together. The EU's lead Brexit negotiator and go-to man on EU-UK trade talks, Michel Barnier, told me that Brussels had lessons to learn from Brexit. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. He said the EU had many regions similar to the North East of England that felt underfunded and overlooked and believed, he said, that the EU did not protect them from the effects of globalisation. The EU must listen more to European voters, he concluded. Eurosceptism remains alive and well across the EU, though the temptation to leave the bloc evident in Italy, France, Sweden and elsewhere back in 2016 has all but disappeared. Eurosceptic politicians like Italy's Matteo Salvini and France's Marine Le Pen are watching the UK closely. They say they hope Brexit will be a huge success and that talk of Frexit, Italexit, Swexit will return to Europe's front pages once again. Bells and bunting for Brexit, or shedding a tear?

Coronavirus patient is student at York University,"This video can not be played Matt Raw, who was flown out of Wuhan, shows the BBC his living quarters at Arrowe Park Hospital One of the two people to test positive for the new coronavirus in the UK is a student at the University of York. The pair - who are related - were confirmed as having coronavirus after being taken ill at a hotel in York. The university said the student was not on campus or in student accommodation before or after exposure to the virus. Public Health England (PHE) said it was making ""good progress"" in tracing people who have come into close contact with the two Chinese nationals. Social media tackles coronavirus fake news Countries close borders as coronavirus spreads UK pharmacies see sanitiser sales spike Vice-chancellor Prof Charlie Jeffery said the immediate concern was for the student and their family, along with the health and wellbeing of staff, students and visitors. He said the risk of the infection being passed on to other people on campus was low, adding the university is open and continuing to operate as normal. Prof Jeffery added: ""I want to reiterate to students, staff, parents and visitors that we're working with our partners across the city to ensure that York and the university remain a safe and welcoming place to live, work and visit."" The university's Samara Jones and Prof Charlie Jeffery made a statement on Saturday University of York Students' Union president Samara Jones said many students were likely to be worried by the news but would support one another. She encouraged students with any questions to keep an eye on theuniversity website for any developments,externaland key information. The University has set up a dedicated helpline on 01904 809571. UK man in Wuhan worried he will be 'forgotten' Wuhan lockdown: How people are still getting food Meanwhile, the University of Derby confirmed ""a very small number"" of students who came back from Wuhan before travel restrictions were put in place were self-isolating for 14 days. A spokeswoman said all the students were fit and well. The Department of Health said no further positive cases had been confirmed in the UK by 14:00 GMT on Saturday, with 201 people testing negative from 203 tests. PHE said those who have been in close contact - defined as being within two metres for 15 minutes or more - with the York pair would receive health advice. Professor Sharon Peacock, director of its National Infection Service said staff do not currently have ""any idea"" how many people that might be. Translators are on hand to make sure information from the patients about places they have visited and people they have spent time with is as accurate as possible, according to PHE. Those contacts thought to be at high risk are given daily health checks and asked to self-isolate. Anyone who does fall ill will be offered a test to see whether they too have contracted the virus - and, if they have, the process of tracing their close contacts would start again, PHE added. The death toll from the new virus, which is officially called 2019-nCov,now stands at 304. All the deaths occurred within China and the majority - 294 - were in Hubei province, where the virus originated. Hubei recorded 45 more deaths on Saturday. It comes as the 83 Britons evacuated from Wuhan, in Hubei province, on Friday began two weeks in quarantine. The two York patients, whose diagnosis was announced on Friday morning, were staying at the Staycity apartment-hotel when medics were called. The two people with coronavirus stayed at the Staycity apartment-hotel in York Staycity said that the hotel will stay open and the apartment used by the two patients disinfected. They are now being treated at a specialist infectious diseases unit at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle and residents of the city are being reassured they are not at risk. In China, cases of the virus have reached nearly 12,000 - with more than 100 cases reported in 22 other countries. On Friday, the Foreign Office said it would withdraw some non-essential embassy staff and their families from mainland China. The ambassador and staff who needed to continue ""critical work"" would remain, while British nationals in China would continue to have access to 24/7 consular assistance. Some 83 UK nationals and 27 others were flown into the UKon a chartered evacuation flightfrom the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak of coronavirus began. Before boarding the flight, passengers had to sign papers agreeing to an enforced period of isolation. The UK nationals were taken by coach to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral on Friday evening. Five coaches transported those evacuated from Wuhan to the north west of England on Friday They will spend 14 days in quarantine - but not solitary confinement - in two apartment blocks normally used to house nurses, who have been moved to local hotels. The UK evacuees are being put up in fully-furnished rooms, including kitchens, and provided with food and laundry facilities. Families are being kept together, with toys and baby equipment available. They will have access to a team of medical staff who will closely monitor their condition and any developing symptoms. How the plague taught us to fight coronavirus Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Matt Raw, one of those in quarantine, told BBC News that he and his family ""were extremely glad to be here"". He said he, his wife and his mother were staying in a four-bedroom apartment, along with another woman and her daughter. He stressed they were feeling fine and had ""an army"" of people looking after them. Mr Raw said there was an area outside where they were able to get some fresh air, adding they were ""allowed contact with anybody within the facility, as long as we're wearing face masks"". Horseman Coaches, which transported the evacuees to the hospital, said health officials advised its drivers did not need to wear protective clothing for the journey. Five drivers will enter a two-week period of isolation at home as a precaution and the vehicles used will be subject to a ""military-grade cleansing process"", the company added. Meanwhile, aBritish man staying in Wuhan to be with his family has expressed concernthe UK government will ""forget"" him. On Thursday, the UK's four chief medical officers raised the risk level of the illness from low to moderate and the World Health Organisation (WHO)declared an international public health emergency. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""There is a high chance that people will get better and end up with a relatively minor disease"" Virus experts said they were not surprised to see cases in the UK but there was no reason to panic. Meanwhile, the United States declared a public health emergency on Friday night, with President Donald Trump signing an orderwhich will temporarily bar entry for most foreign nationalswho have travelled in China within the last 14 days. On Saturday, Australia said it too would refuse entry to all non-citizens arriving from China. On Friday, it emerged that the number of new coronavirus cases worldwide had overtaken that of the 2003 Sars epidemic. Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ?

"Troubles victims praised after pension campaignJulian Smith says people injured during the Troubles ""fought hard for too long"" for compensation.Northern Ireland","Julian Smith said Troubles victims ""have fought hard for too long"" for financial support from the state Victims who led a long campaign for a pension for people injured during the Troubles have been praised for their ""fortitude"" by the secretary of state. Julian Smith paid tribute to the campaigners' determination, just hours after he signed new legislation which set up an annual payment scheme. It will provide life-long financial support to severely injured victims. But some campaigners are angry thatthe scheme is only open to people injured ""through no fault of their own"". It means that anyone convicted of taking part in an attack which caused them to be injured -  for example bombers who were caught up in their own explosion - would not qualify for the pension. Both Sinn FÃ©in and the campaign group Relatives for Justice accused the government of creating a ""hierarchy"" of victims and trying to impose its own version of the past. More than 3,500 people were killed during the Troubles and the Northern Ireland Office has estimated that a further 40,000 were injured during more than 30 years of violence. The pension campaign was beset by years of delays due to disagreements over whether former paramilitaries would be eligible for payments. Various victims groups have differed in their approach to the campaign over the years In a statement on Saturday, Mr Smith acknowledged that there were ""different views about how to proceed"" but added the ""discussions and delay of the past few years have gone on long enough"". ""This scheme is intended to provide much-needed acknowledgement, and a measure of additional financial support, to people injured through no fault of their own in a Troubles-related incident, some of whom are struggling to make ends meet,"" he said. The payments will range from about Â£2,000 toÂ£10,000 a yeardepending on the severity of disability. Mr Smith also commended victims' groups who persevered with their campaign for compensation for more than a decade. ""It is right that we recognise the bravery and fortitude of those people who have fought hard for too long to see such a scheme,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

""This is a moment to recognise those living with life-limiting injuries, and to acknowledge the harm they have suffered. ""We should pause and thank those who have helped us get to a place where we can provide a scheme like this."" Several victims of the Troubles were left with life-long disabilities, including paralysis Outlining the new regulations, the secretary of state said the government had ""listened carefully"" to those who took part in a recent public consultation and introduced ""new, more generous rules"". ""For the first time, we will also ensure that payments can transfer to partners and carers who look after those still living with their injuries,"" Mr Smith said. Referring to the scheme's restrictions, he added: ""An independent judge-led board will make decisions on whether payments should be made where there is compelling evidence that a payment would not be appropriate."" Eligible victims will have to apply for the payments, and the scheme will open for applications at the end of May 2020. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Troubles victims praised after pension campaign,"Julian Smith said Troubles victims ""have fought hard for too long"" for financial support from the state Victims who led a long campaign for a pension for people injured during the Troubles have been praised for their ""fortitude"" by the secretary of state. Julian Smith paid tribute to the campaigners' determination, just hours after he signed new legislation which set up an annual payment scheme. It will provide life-long financial support to severely injured victims. But some campaigners are angry thatthe scheme is only open to people injured ""through no fault of their own"". It means that anyone convicted of taking part in an attack which caused them to be injured -  for example bombers who were caught up in their own explosion - would not qualify for the pension. Both Sinn FÃ©in and the campaign group Relatives for Justice accused the government of creating a ""hierarchy"" of victims and trying to impose its own version of the past. More than 3,500 people were killed during the Troubles and the Northern Ireland Office has estimated that a further 40,000 were injured during more than 30 years of violence. The pension campaign was beset by years of delays due to disagreements over whether former paramilitaries would be eligible for payments. Various victims groups have differed in their approach to the campaign over the years In a statement on Saturday, Mr Smith acknowledged that there were ""different views about how to proceed"" but added the ""discussions and delay of the past few years have gone on long enough"". ""This scheme is intended to provide much-needed acknowledgement, and a measure of additional financial support, to people injured through no fault of their own in a Troubles-related incident, some of whom are struggling to make ends meet,"" he said. The payments will range from about Â£2,000 toÂ£10,000 a yeardepending on the severity of disability. Mr Smith also commended victims' groups who persevered with their campaign for compensation for more than a decade. ""It is right that we recognise the bravery and fortitude of those people who have fought hard for too long to see such a scheme,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

""This is a moment to recognise those living with life-limiting injuries, and to acknowledge the harm they have suffered. ""We should pause and thank those who have helped us get to a place where we can provide a scheme like this."" Several victims of the Troubles were left with life-long disabilities, including paralysis Outlining the new regulations, the secretary of state said the government had ""listened carefully"" to those who took part in a recent public consultation and introduced ""new, more generous rules"". ""For the first time, we will also ensure that payments can transfer to partners and carers who look after those still living with their injuries,"" Mr Smith said. Referring to the scheme's restrictions, he added: ""An independent judge-led board will make decisions on whether payments should be made where there is compelling evidence that a payment would not be appropriate."" Eligible victims will have to apply for the payments, and the scheme will open for applications at the end of May 2020. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Search for contacts of first UK coronavirus cases,"This video can not be played Matt Raw, who was flown out of Wuhan, shows the BBC his living quarters at Arrowe Park Hospital One of the two people to test positive for the new coronavirus in the UK is a student at the University of York. The pair - who are related - were confirmed as having coronavirus after being taken ill at a hotel in York. The university said the student was not on campus or in student accommodation before or after exposure to the virus. Public Health England (PHE) said it was making ""good progress"" in tracing people who have come into close contact with the two Chinese nationals. Social media tackles coronavirus fake news Countries close borders as coronavirus spreads UK pharmacies see sanitiser sales spike Vice-chancellor Prof Charlie Jeffery said the immediate concern was for the student and their family, along with the health and wellbeing of staff, students and visitors. He said the risk of the infection being passed on to other people on campus was low, adding the university is open and continuing to operate as normal. Prof Jeffery added: ""I want to reiterate to students, staff, parents and visitors that we're working with our partners across the city to ensure that York and the university remain a safe and welcoming place to live, work and visit."" The university's Samara Jones and Prof Charlie Jeffery made a statement on Saturday University of York Students' Union president Samara Jones said many students were likely to be worried by the news but would support one another. She encouraged students with any questions to keep an eye on theuniversity website for any developments,externaland key information. The University has set up a dedicated helpline on 01904 809571. UK man in Wuhan worried he will be 'forgotten' Wuhan lockdown: How people are still getting food Meanwhile, the University of Derby confirmed ""a very small number"" of students who came back from Wuhan before travel restrictions were put in place were self-isolating for 14 days. A spokeswoman said all the students were fit and well. The Department of Health said no further positive cases had been confirmed in the UK by 14:00 GMT on Saturday, with 201 people testing negative from 203 tests. PHE said those who have been in close contact - defined as being within two metres for 15 minutes or more - with the York pair would receive health advice. Professor Sharon Peacock, director of its National Infection Service said staff do not currently have ""any idea"" how many people that might be. Translators are on hand to make sure information from the patients about places they have visited and people they have spent time with is as accurate as possible, according to PHE. Those contacts thought to be at high risk are given daily health checks and asked to self-isolate. Anyone who does fall ill will be offered a test to see whether they too have contracted the virus - and, if they have, the process of tracing their close contacts would start again, PHE added. The death toll from the new virus, which is officially called 2019-nCov,now stands at 304. All the deaths occurred within China and the majority - 294 - were in Hubei province, where the virus originated. Hubei recorded 45 more deaths on Saturday. It comes as the 83 Britons evacuated from Wuhan, in Hubei province, on Friday began two weeks in quarantine. The two York patients, whose diagnosis was announced on Friday morning, were staying at the Staycity apartment-hotel when medics were called. The two people with coronavirus stayed at the Staycity apartment-hotel in York Staycity said that the hotel will stay open and the apartment used by the two patients disinfected. They are now being treated at a specialist infectious diseases unit at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle and residents of the city are being reassured they are not at risk. In China, cases of the virus have reached nearly 12,000 - with more than 100 cases reported in 22 other countries. On Friday, the Foreign Office said it would withdraw some non-essential embassy staff and their families from mainland China. The ambassador and staff who needed to continue ""critical work"" would remain, while British nationals in China would continue to have access to 24/7 consular assistance. Some 83 UK nationals and 27 others were flown into the UKon a chartered evacuation flightfrom the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak of coronavirus began. Before boarding the flight, passengers had to sign papers agreeing to an enforced period of isolation. The UK nationals were taken by coach to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral on Friday evening. Five coaches transported those evacuated from Wuhan to the north west of England on Friday They will spend 14 days in quarantine - but not solitary confinement - in two apartment blocks normally used to house nurses, who have been moved to local hotels. The UK evacuees are being put up in fully-furnished rooms, including kitchens, and provided with food and laundry facilities. Families are being kept together, with toys and baby equipment available. They will have access to a team of medical staff who will closely monitor their condition and any developing symptoms. How the plague taught us to fight coronavirus Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Matt Raw, one of those in quarantine, told BBC News that he and his family ""were extremely glad to be here"". He said he, his wife and his mother were staying in a four-bedroom apartment, along with another woman and her daughter. He stressed they were feeling fine and had ""an army"" of people looking after them. Mr Raw said there was an area outside where they were able to get some fresh air, adding they were ""allowed contact with anybody within the facility, as long as we're wearing face masks"". Horseman Coaches, which transported the evacuees to the hospital, said health officials advised its drivers did not need to wear protective clothing for the journey. Five drivers will enter a two-week period of isolation at home as a precaution and the vehicles used will be subject to a ""military-grade cleansing process"", the company added. Meanwhile, aBritish man staying in Wuhan to be with his family has expressed concernthe UK government will ""forget"" him. On Thursday, the UK's four chief medical officers raised the risk level of the illness from low to moderate and the World Health Organisation (WHO)declared an international public health emergency. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""There is a high chance that people will get better and end up with a relatively minor disease"" Virus experts said they were not surprised to see cases in the UK but there was no reason to panic. Meanwhile, the United States declared a public health emergency on Friday night, with President Donald Trump signing an orderwhich will temporarily bar entry for most foreign nationalswho have travelled in China within the last 14 days. On Saturday, Australia said it too would refuse entry to all non-citizens arriving from China. On Friday, it emerged that the number of new coronavirus cases worldwide had overtaken that of the 2003 Sars epidemic. Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? Wuhan lockdown: How people are still getting food However, the mortality rate is currently low, at 2% - less than Sars, at 10% and Ebola, at 70%, WHO's chief medical officer says.

'Obscene' 18-month delay for DWP complaintsThe government department responsible for child maintenance faces criticism for long delays.Business,"The most serious complaints about DWP agencies like the Child Maintenance Service can sometimes take years to be resolved People with the most serious complaints about the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have to wait 18 months before their cases are investigated. BBC Radio 4's Money Box has also learnt that nearly two-thirds of investigations miss their target of being cleared within 20 weeks. One man in dispute with one of its agencies called the delay ""obscene"". The DWP said it understands ""the impact that waiting for an investigation can have on people and their families."" The most common complaints to the DWP include things like a failure to follow proper procedures, excessive delays and poor customer service. Alan, who did not want his real name used, said he faces nearly a four-year wait in total before his case is resolved. He first complained to the government-run Child Maintenance Service (CMS) in November 2017. He says it took thousands of pounds of a redundancy payment directly from his bank account. The dispute has made his existing mental health problems worse and left him ""flatlining"", he says. He added that he is unable to motivate himself to work and is ""getting poorer by the day"". 'Exhausted' by procedure After 18 months, Alan's case still was not resolved. He was then given permission to take his complaint to the Independent Case Examiner (ICE). ICE acts as a free, independent referee for people with complaints about the DWP - and its contracted services, which include things like the CMS, pension payments and disability benefits. Alan was told his complaint had been accepted, but that it would be more than a year before someone was assigned to investigate it. Even after that, Money Box has seen figures which suggest two-thirds of cases take longer than the 20-week target, while half of them take six months or even longer. That means that hundreds of people face a wait of more than two years for their complaints to be resolved once they have been accepted by ICE. He said: ""I am just one of thousands of people in this situation. ""I think the delay in the complaints procedure is atrocious. It's symptomatic of a department that doesn't take its obligations to people it is dealing with seriously."" He added: ""It's a damning indictment of the modus operandi of the Department for Work and Pensions."" ICE only looks at the""most serious complaints"",externalabout services offered by the DWP. That includes organisations such as Jobcentre Plus, the Pension Service, the Disability and Carers Service and Pension Wise, as well as the CMS. ICE will only consider people's complaints if they have finished the complaints procedure with the original agency or organisation. It then decides whether or not it will ""accept"" someone's complaint. If it does, BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme has learnt through a freedom of information request there is a delay of about 18 months before it is opened. Once it is opened, most cases require a full investigation with a 20-week target. Money Box has seen figures which suggest that nearly two-thirds of cases miss this deadline. The Department for Work and Pensions said in a statement: ""We want to make sure people can get the support they are entitled to if they have been treated unfairly, and understand the impact that waiting for an investigation can have on people and their families. ""We are hiring and training new staff as quickly as we can, and cleared more complaints last year than in 2017-18. ""The vast majority of complainants are satisfied with the service they receive.""

"White supremacist US officer jailed for 13 yearsChristopher Hasson, a former lieutenant, was arrested last year after stockpiling weapons.","Christopher Hasson, 50, created an Excel spreadsheet with a list of targets - including liberal politicians and news broadcasters A former US Coast Guard officer has been jailed for 13 years for stockpiling weapons to carry out an alleged white supremacist attack. Officials said Christopher Hasson, 50, was planning to target liberal politicians and news broadcasters. Prosecutors said this was ""domestic terrorism"", but US law does not classify this as a distinct offence without an attack being carried out. Hasson pleaded guilty to firearms and drugs charges. When he was arrested last February, officers found a cache of 15 firearms - which, as a drug user, Hasson was banned from owning - and two illegal gun silencers. He was also in possession of the narcotic Tramadol without a prescription. US officer 'made kill list of Democrats' 'I stabbed someone to get into a white supremacy gang' Coast guard removed for 'white power sign' Before and during his sentencing hearing, prosecutors and defence attorneys sparred on whether or not Hasson would have gone on to commit mass murder. The former lieutenant from Silver Spring was inspired by racist mass murderers, including Anders Breivik, and ""intended to exact retribution on minorities and those he considered traitors"", prosecutors told the court. He created an Excel spreadsheet with a list of targets, which included 12 prominent Democrats in Congress and a number of CNN and MSNBC journalists. US Federal Attorney Robert Hur added that if he hadn't been arrested when he was, ""we now would be counting bodies of the defendant's victims instead of years of the defendant's prison time"". Hasson's lawyers, however, argued that prosecutors had overstated the threat he posed. Hasson was an aircraft mechanic with the Marine Corps in the first Gulf War, and later went on to serve in the Virginia National Guard before joining the Coast Guard in 1996. In the months leading up to his arrest last year, Hasson was stationed at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington. During this time he amassed the weapons in his apartment in Silver Spring. His arsenal included six handguns, seven rifles, two shotguns, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, knives, smoke grenades and tactical gear. According to the FBI, he also had 30 vials of a human growth hormone - a steroid that prosecutors said he took thinking it would ""increase his ability to conduct attacks"". Guns and ammunition were found at Hasson's home in Silver Spring, Maryland Hasson studied bomb-making and sniper manuals, as well as racist and anti-Semitic writings - including the manifesto of Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in 2011 in two terror attacks. He murdered eight people with a car bomb in central Oslo and then shot dead 69 others, many of them teenagers, at a Labour Party youth camp. Hasson's web searches, on mass shootings and biological warfare, triggered an investigation by the Coast Guard after they were flagged up by software on his work computer. In a lengthy memo to himself, US media report that he wrote: ""Please send me your violence that I may unleash it unto their heads. Guide my hate to make a lasting impression on this world."" Hasson's lawyers told the court he had developed an addiction to opioids and this had poisoned his mind against people of other ethnicities. This caused him to fantasise about carrying out violent attacks, they said.

Analysis: What now?,"What now? It's happened. A dreary night didn't discourage those celebrating in Parliament Square. We wake this morning out of the European Union. But we follow their rules until the end of the year, without a say. We are separate after more than 40 years, but remember much of the status quo will hold for now - the UK and the EU, the awkward couple, finally divorced - but still sharing a house and the bills. But what the prime minister hails as a new era, a bright new dawn, starts months of hard bargaining with our neighbours across the Channel. The UK's requests: a free trade agreement, cooperation on security, and new arrangements for fishing are just some of the vital arguments that lie ahead. Within days, Boris Johnson - and the EU too - will set out their opening positions. And at home, the government must hurry to adapt many of our systems that are plumbed into the EU. The prime minister is adamant that process must not run beyond the end of the year. UK leaves the European Union Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't It's a deadline that focuses minds, but raises eyebrows. Getting meaningful agreements in place at that pace is not impossible, but hard to do. That means while the biggest question is settled, particularly for business, uncertainty still hangs around. But the prime minister believes the opportunity of Brexit is seeing beyond the framework of the EU. He hopes for more ability for the government to pursue its priorities at home. More freedom to act abroad - a smaller, but perhaps nimbler, partner. And there will be fewer excuses for a British government if it fails to keep its huge promises. Departure has been so controversial there will be plenty of rival politicians looking for early proof of failure. In truth, the merits or mistakes of this decision will take years to show. The economy is expected to grow more slowly, but a country's value is not just measured in pounds and pence. Brexit in a complete sense has always been hard to define.

End of era as EU says goodbye to UK,"This video can not be played Brexit: How did we get here? As Brexit dawned, I found myself reporting for the BBC from outside the glass and concrete behemoth otherwise known as the European Commission building, in Brussels. It's the same place I've regularly stood over the past three-and-a-half years, attempting to explain the EU perspective on Brexit following our referendum and throughout the divorce negotiations. It struck me that the impersonal, impenetrable-looking monolith embodies the image so many in the UK have of the EU as a whole. But going through my mind on Friday night were all the ""ordinary"" Europeans I've met across the continent while covering the Brexit story: engineers, teachers, bakers and bus drivers who asked ""Why are you doing this?"" and insisted: ""Don't leave!"" Whilst never the most enthusiastic member, the UK was part of the European project for almost half a century. Behind closed doors and away from gaze of the UK's more eurosceptic media, we were known for playing a big part in launching some of the bloc's most ambitious projects: the single market, the single currency (though we then opted not to join the euro) and the EU's enlargement eastwards. Bells and bunting for Brexit, or shedding a tear? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't 12 moments in the UK-EU relationship On a personal level, EU leaders tell me they'll miss having the British sense of humour and no-nonsense attitude at their table. If they were to be brutally honest, they'd have admitted they'll mourn the loss of our not-insignificant contribution to the EU budget too. But now we've left the ""European family"" (as Brussels insiders sometimes like to call the EU) and as trade talks begin, how long will it take for warm words to turn into gritted teeth? On the eve of Brexit, the President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, pledged the EU would always act ""with a sense of brotherhood"" towards the UK. But familiarity can breed contempt. Whether family feuds or lovers' quarrels, aren't some of the deepest rifts between people who once shared the closest of bonds? Ministers in Boris Johnson's government wonder aloud why the EU demands they sign up to free trade agreement conditions the EU didn't impose on others like Canada or Japan. This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""It's a very emotional day"" But Canada and Japan aren't family for the EU. They don't share the same intimate history or geography. They don't pose the same threat of overnight, on-the-doorstep serious competition. So when EU leaders tell the freshly-Brexited UK that they love them but they'll do them no favours across the negotiating table, they mean it. And it's not just about business and economics. Brussels feels defensive about Brexit because some see it as a significant EU failure that the UK couldn't be persuaded to stay. In almost the same breath as telling me how emotional she felt about the UK's departure this week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told me that Brexit has also had a very positive effect on the EU. It's helped unify the member states, she told me. She argued it was clear Brexit could not solve big problems like climate change, so it was evidently better to stick together. The EU's lead Brexit negotiator and go-to man on EU-UK trade talks, Michel Barnier, told me that Brussels had lessons to learn from Brexit. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. He said the EU had many regions similar to the North East of England that felt underfunded and overlooked and believed, he said, that the EU did not protect them from the effects of globalisation. The EU must listen more to European voters, he concluded. Eurosceptism remains alive and well across the EU, though the temptation to leave the bloc evident in Italy, France, Sweden and elsewhere back in 2016 has all but disappeared. Eurosceptic politicians like Italy's Matteo Salvini and France's Marine Le Pen are watching the UK closely. They say they hope Brexit will be a huge success and that talk of Frexit, Italexit, Swexit will return to Europe's front pages once again. Bells and bunting for Brexit, or shedding a tear?

Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit,"It used to be a fringe obsession ignored by the political mainstream. So how did Euroscepticism conquer Britain? The word ""Eurosceptic"" was not coined until the 1980s, to describe a rebellious band of Tory MPs, but hostility to closer European integration dates back decades. Britain voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Economic Community in 1975, but never joined the currency or the passport-free area, and a substantial body of public opinion had always believed the country was better off out. They rarely had a voice at Westminster. The campaign to leave the European Union - via another referendum - took root outside of Parliament. It was pursued by mavericks, political outcasts and a fair few eccentrics. It was a long, and often thankless, battle - and it began before Britain had even joined. Many viewed EEC membership as a betrayal of the Commonwealth With World War II fresh in the memory, and the Empire rapidly disintegrating, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan decided Britain's future lay in Europe. His, in the end unsuccessful, application to join the six nation European Economic Community enraged many in his party, who saw it as a betrayal of the Commonwealth nations, which were Britain's biggest trading partners at the time. Many in Labour viewed the EEC as a business-led Tory con trick. Both sides fretted about the loss of independence and status it would seem to entail. Most opponents of membership tended to be on the far left and right fringes, but there were big, mainstream voices in both the Labour and Tory parties that were also firmly against it. ""I'm not very keen on the Common Market. After all, we beat Germany and we beat Italy and we saved France and Belgium and Holland. I never see why we should go crawling to them,"" said former Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee. The first substantial campaign against British membership - The Anti-Common Market League - was formed in June 1961, by a bunch of disgruntled Conservatives. It had broadened out into a cross-party effort by the following September, when it staged a mass anti-Common Market rally at London's Albert Hall. Major Smedley sets off for Rome, to campaign against Britain's second, failed, attempt to join the EEC Euroscepticism has always attracted colourful characters. Major Oliver Smedley was a decorated World War II veteran and pirate radio entrepreneur, who was cleared of murder in 1966 after he shot a business rival in a dispute over a transmitter. Keep Britain Out stage a mock funeral for democracy in Whitehall Maj Smedley, who quit the Liberal Partyafter being slow-handclapped at the party's conference,external, believed joining the ""protectionist"" EEC would lead to higher food prices and poverty. His Keep Britain Out campaign merged with the Anti-Common Market League in the late 1960s and is still going today, as Get Britain Out. The tabloids were cheerleaders for Britain's membership of the EEC On 1 January 1973, Britain officially joined the EEC, at the third attempt.Opinion polls suggested the nation was divided,externalover Tory Prime Minister Ted Heath's decision. Eurosceptics, on the left and right, stepped up their calls for a referendum. Enoch Powell (second left) shares a stage with future Labour leader Michael Foot (far right) There was widespread disbelief in Eurosceptic circles when voters opted by 67% to 33% to stay in the Common Market, in the UK's first nationwide referendum. The vote had been called by Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson largely as a way to paper over the huge divisions in his party over Europe. Margaret Thatcher was a leading voice in the campaign to stay in the EEC Some polls suggested the unlikely alliance of Tony Benn, from the Labour left, and Enoch Powell, Ulster Unionist and former Tory, who emerged as the chief spokesmen for the No campaign, was a turn-off for voters. Whatever the case, the defeat was a body blow to the Eurosceptics. Many lean years followed, with poorly attended meetings, lost election deposits and pamphlets few read, even if polls suggested Britain was turning against the EEC. Labour campaigned to leave the EEC at the 1983 general election but went down to a heavy defeat and the Eurosceptics in its ranks were pushed to the margins. Margaret Thatcher warned against 'dominance from Brussels' Margaret Thatcher's Bruges speech was the moment Euroscepticism in the UK was reborn and it arguably set Britain on the path to Brexit. She had travelled to the Belgian city to fire a warning shot across the EEC's bows, over its ambitions to move beyond the single market to create a ""social Europe"", with new employment rights and regulations on business, as well as a single currency. It all smacked of socialism by the backdoor to Mrs Thatcher, rather than the free trade area she had enthusiastically championed in 1975. Britain's ""destiny is in Europe"", she stressed, but added: ""We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels."" It was a riposte to a speech Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, had given to the Trades Union Congress 12 weeks earlier. Which brings us to... Jacques Delors sets out his vision of a ""social Europe"" at the TUC conference In 1975, Britain's best-selling newspaper, The Sun, had told its readers: ""We are all Europeans now."" In November 1990, it called on its front page for them to stick two fingers up to Jacques Delors - ""Up, Yours Delors"", said the headline - to ""tell the French fool where to stuff his ECU"" (the ECU was the forerunner of the euro). The rest of the right-wing tabloids were now just as Eurosceptic, if not as blunt. But calling for Britain to leave was still strictly off limits in the mainstream media and politics. Alan Sked came fourth in the 1993 Newbury by-election with 601 votes It began in a dusty office at the London School of Economics. European history lecturer Alan Sked founded the Anti-Federalist League to ""prevent the UK becoming a province of a united European superstate"". The tiny group, which included Nigel Farage among its early recruits, campaigned against the Maastricht Treaty, which would turn the EEC into the European Union, including a commitment to ""ever closer union"" and the free movement of people. The League soon changed its name to the more voter-friendly UK Independence Party and began calling for Britain's exit from the EU. But it was largely ignored, or ridiculed, by the media, and struggled to make an impact. Mr Sked, a former member of the Liberal Party, left in 1997, complaining that it had been taken over by right wingers and racists. Conservative MPs fought a guerrilla war against their own government's support for the Maastricht Treaty. Some of the Maastricht rebels would go on to play leading roles in the 2016 Brexit campaign (before receiving knighthoods), including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Bernard Jenkin. But even the most Eurosceptic among them never spoke publicly about leaving the EU at this stage, preferring instead to talk about ""reform"" or, if they were in a daring mood, ""fundamental reform"". Sir James Goldsmith injected cash and energy into the Eurosceptic cause The mercurial billionaire, and father of Conservative minister Zac, founded the Referendum Party to campaign for Britain to be given another say on Europe. He spent more than Â£7m on the party's 1997 general election campaign - including a glossy promotional video mailed to five million households - for a 2.6% share of the vote. Nigel Farage was one of three UKIP candidates to make a breakthrough In many ways, Nigel Farage owes his political career to a Belgian mathematician. In 1878, Victor D'Hondt devised the system of proportional representation adopted by the UK in 1999 for elections to the European Parliament. UKIP and other smaller parties, like the Greens, had stood no chance under first-past-the-post. Suddenly the door to a seat in Brussels was open, and Mr Farage and two other UKIP candidates were first through it, despite receiving virtually no national media coverage for their campaign. ""Brexit wouldn't have happened without proportional representation or, ironically, the European Parliament,""Mr Farage told Channel 4 News this week,external. ""It was actually getting elected to that place that gave us some kind of platform,"" he added, and UKIP used the ""wherewithal"" provided by the Brussels parliament to ""build a UK political movement"". The same year saw the arrival of Dominic Cummings, future mastermind of the Vote Leave campaign, on the Eurosceptic scene, as campaign director of anti-euro pressure group Business for Sterling. Robert Kilroy-Silk helped to put UKIP on the political map UKIP was still struggling for public recognition and credibility when, out of nowhere, Robert Kilroy-Silk joined it. A household name, due to his long-running daytime talk show, Kilroy, he had been fired by the BBC over comments he'd made in a newspaper column. Mr Kilroy-Silk's brief UKIP adventure - and the massive injection of cash that came with it, from self-made Yorkshire millionaire Paul Sykes - helped the party to the best results in its history in the 2004 European elections, gaining 2.6 million votes. UKIP - and its call for a referendum on leaving the EU - were now on the political map. UKIP used David Cameron's insult as a rallying cry It's possible to track the rise of UKIP in insults directed at its members by Conservative leaders, as they tried in vain to stem the flow of supporters to Nigel Farage's ""People's Army"". In 2004, Michael Howard - who would go on to be a Brexit supporter - called them ""extremists"" and ""cranks"". Two years later David Cameron refused to apologise for labelling them ""fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists"", handing UKIP a publicity coup and a rallying cry. This video can not be played The Commons Speaker John Bercow announced the result of the vote by MPs Some 81 Tory MPs defied Prime Minister David Cameron to vote in favour of an EU referendum in October 2011. Mr Cameron easily won the vote, with Labour support, but leaving the EU - as one of a range of options - was now firmly on the agenda at Westminster. Mr Cameron wouldannounce plans for a referendum just under two years later. UKIP's Suzanne Evans in the 2014 election campaign Nigel Farage had finally found a way to turn the latent Euroscepticism in large sections of the British public into electoral gold, as concerns about the flow of migrants from new EU states were added to the traditional cry for freedom from bossy Brussels bureaucracy. UKIP seemed unstoppable in 2014. It topped the poll in the European elections, with a massive 3.8 million votes - and made further gains in local elections to consolidate the breakthrough it had made in 2012. Then Mr Farage turned up the heat on David Cameron by unveiling two Tory defectors, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, in quick succession, with the threat of more to come. Boris Johnson was the biggest name to embrace the Eurosceptic cause David Cameron had been stunned by the number of Conservative MPs who had joined the Leave campaign, not realising the depth of Eurosceptic feeling in his party. But he had not expected Boris Johnson to join the cause. The official Leave campaign wanted nothing to do with Nigel Farage over fears he would scare off floating voters. Its recruitment of Mr Johnson - one of the biggest, and most popular, names in British politics - was a game changing moment. Euroscepticism had finally shaken off its reputation as an eccentric fringe movement. Recalling UKIP's early days in the European Parliament in 1999, at a farewell press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Farage said: ""We were considered pretty odd. Perhaps we were, I don't know, certainly very eccentric. ""And as those years went by I did begin to wonder whether I might become the patron saint of lost causes."" But now, he added, ""far from being a minority sport, Euroscepticism had become the mainstream, settled view in the United Kingdom"".

We are separate after more than 40 years, but remember much of the status quo will hold for now - the UK and the EU, the awkward couple, finally divorced - but still sharing a house and the bills. But what the prime minister hails as a new era, a bright new dawn, starts months of hard bargaining with our neighbours across the Channel. Read more from Laura here.

Pre-recorded bongs from Big Ben played out as the UK left the European Union. Richard MossPolitical Editor, BBC Look North A few hundred people walked down Newcastle's Northumberland Street to Monument as part of a vigil tonight. The symbolic nature of today - the fact Boris Johnson brought the cabinet to Sunderland - has emphasised the centrality of north-east England in this whole debate. And that won't go away because although we are leaving the European Union there is still to be settled our future trading relationship with our biggest trading partner in the region, the European Union. There will be pressure from businesses like Nissan to have as close a relationship as almost we have now to make it as easy as possible for them to sell their cars, pressure perhaps from Conservative MPS in the region that if we are leaving a club we don't like being members of we shouldn't necessarily stick with the rules afterwards. Boris Johnson's biggest challenge is to prove these people at the vigil wrong, that Brexit will not be an historic blunder that will leave us lagging behind, that it can be coupled with an opportunity to make life better and make us wealthier in places like the north-east of England and Cumbria. The SNP's Ian Blackford says there is ""sadness and anger"" across Scotland at the UK's exit and the Scottish public will not ""stand for it"". He says the Scottish people will demand a say in their future and suggests an independence referendum will provide a path ""back into Europe"". He argues that the UK that Scotland voted to remain a part of in 2014 ""no longer exists"". Chris DoidgeBBC Radio Derby, political reporter Remainers at a vigil held outside Derby's council house have renamed themselves ""rejoiners"" now we have left the European Union. The event was held just round the corner from a Brexit bash in a local bar. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor First of all itâs a long, long period of hard bargaining
between the UK and the EU. The UK government is determined to try to get a free-trade
deal done by the end of this year but that will not be straight forward â not least
because there are so many things that have to be sorted out. But also because the EU will drive a hard bargain. Yes, both
sides say they still want to be friends and partners and respectful neighbours
and people want to do lots of business with each other. But the UK government has already acknowledged that will mean
some friction. And also, until itâs all done and dusted thereâs still uncertainty for
businesses and people around the country who want to know exactly what is next. But although there is legions of details to be worked out, many
more political controversies along the way, be in no doubt â the fundamental
question which has been hanging over the country for more than three years has
been settled. And thatâs already completely changed the political dynamic â
and therefore the dynamic in the country too. Foreign Secretary tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Seven things Brexit changes and seven it doesn't,"Now that the UK has formally left the European Union, it immediately enters an 11-month transition period. During the transition the UK will continue to obey EU rules and pay money to the EU. Most things will stay the same but there will be some changes: The Brexit Party won the most UK seats in the May 2019 European elections Familiar faces such as Nigel Farage and Ann Widdecombe are among the UK's 73 MEPs who will automatically lose their seats in the European Parliament. That's because, at the moment of Brexit, the UK will leave all of the EU's political institutions and agencies. However, in addition to the UK following EU rules during the transition period, the European Court of Justice will continue to have the final say over legal disputes. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will have to be specially invited if he wants to join other leaders at EU Council summits in the future. British ministers will also no longer attend regular EU meetings that decide things such as fishing limits. The UK will be able to start talking to countries around the world about setting new rules for buying and selling goods and services. It has not been allowed to hold formal trade negotiations with countries like the US and Australia while it remained an EU member. Brexit supporters argue that having the freedom to set its own trade policy will boost the UK's economy. There's also a lot to be discussed with the EU. Agreeing a UK-EU trade deal is a top priority, so extra charges on goods and other trade barriers aren't needed when the transition ends. If any trade deals are reached, they won't be able to start until the transition period ends. Sir John Curtice: Do Britons now agree about Brexit? Brexit: What is a level playing field? Blue passports were replaced in 1988 with the burgundy design Blue passports will be making a return, more than 30 years after they were replaced by the current burgundy design. Announcing the change in 2017, then Immigration Minister, Brandon Lewis, praised thereturn to the ""iconic"" blue-and-gold design, first used in 1921. The new colour will be phased in over a number of months, with all new passports issued in blue by the middle of the year. Existing burgundy passports will continueto be valid. The coins had to be re-made after Brexit was delayed About three million commemorative 50p Brexit coins bearing the date ""31 January"" and the inscription: ""Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations"", will enter circulation on Friday. Thecoin has received a mixed reaction,with some Remain supporters saying they will refuse to accept it. The government had planned to introduce a similar coin on 31 October, the date Brexit was previously meant to happen. However, those coins had to be melted down and recycled after the deadline was extended. The team that handled the UK-EU negotiations andno-deal preparationswill disband on Brexit day. The Department for Exiting the European Union was set up by former Prime Minister Theresa May in 2016. For the upcoming talks, the UK's negotiating team will be based in Downing Street. It won't be possible for some suspected criminals to be brought back to the UK if they flee to Germany. Germany's constitution does not allow its citizens to be extradited, unless it's to another EU country. ""This exception cannot apply any more after the UK has left EU,"" a spokesman from the German Federal Ministry of Justice told BBC News. It's unclear if the same restrictions will apply to other countries. Slovenia, for example, says the situation is complicated, while the European Commission was unable to provide comment. The UK Home Office says the European Arrest Warrant will continue to apply during the transition period. (That means Germany will be able to extradite non-German citizens.) However, it adds that if a country's laws prevent extradition to the UK it ""will be expected to take over the trial or sentence of the person concerned"". A really simple guide to Brexit What is the transition period? Because thetransition periodbegins immediately after Brexit, the vast majority of other things remain the same - at least until 31 December 2020 including: UK nationals will still be treated the same as EU nationals during the transition Flights, boats and trains will operate as usual. When it comes to passport control, during the transition period, UK nationals will still be allowed to queue in the areas reserved for EU arrivals only. As long as they are valid, these will continue to be accepted. Driving after Brexit: What you need to know EHICs will still be valid during the transition These are the cards that provide UK nationals with state-provided medical treatment in case of illness or accident. They can be used in any EU country (as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and will continue to be valid during the transition period. Will the EHIC still be valid after Brexit? Freedom of movement will continue to apply during the transition, so UK nationals will still be able to live and work in the EU as they currently do. The same applies for EU nationals wanting to live and work in the UK. UK nationals living in the EU will continue to receive their state pension and will also receive the annual increase. How will Brexit affect UK pensioners in Europe? The UK will continue to pay into the EU budget during the transition. This means existing schemes, paid for by EU grants, will continue to be funded. UK-EU trade will continue without any extra charges or checks being introduced.

After 47 years of membership and three and a half years since the country voted to leave, the UK has left the EU. Thanks for following our live coverage of this historic day. But with negotiations on the UK's future relationship with Europe still to come, this won't be the last you hear of Brexit.... Katya AdlerEurope Editor As Brexit dawned, I found myself reporting for the BBC from outside the glass and concrete behemoth, otherwise known as the European Commission building, in Brussels. It's the same place I've regularly stood over the past three and a half years, attempting to explain the EU perspective on Brexit following our referendum and throughout the divorce negotiations. It struck me that the impersonal, impenetrable-looking monolith embodies the image so many back in the UK have of the EU as a whole. But going through my mind on Friday night were all the ""ordinary"" Europeans I've met across the continent while covering the Brexit story: engineers, teachers, bakers and bus drivers who asked ""Why are you doing this?"" and insisted: ""Don't leave!"" Read more from Katya Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor What now? It's happened. A dreary night didn't discourage those celebrating in Parliament Square. We wake this morning out of the European Union. But we follow their rules until the end of the year, without a say. We are separate after more than 40 years, but remember much of the status quo will hold for now - the UK and the EU, the awkward couple, finally divorced - but still sharing a house and the bills. But what the prime minister hails as a new era, a bright new dawn, starts months of hard bargaining with our neighbours across the Channel. Read more from Laura here. ""Make leave not war"", the Sun proclaims on its front page, which carries the prime minister's plea to bring the UK together. The Daily Express strikes a jubilant tone, with the headline: ""Rise and shine: It's a glorious new Britain"". ""The day we said goodbye,"" the Guardian says more sombrely. And now the UK is finally out - ""what next?"", asks the i's headline. Read more of the front pages here. BBC Europe reporter tweets...  Allow Twitter content?

Pre-recorded bongs from Big Ben played out as the UK left the European Union. Richard MossPolitical Editor, BBC Look North A few hundred people walked down Newcastle's Northumberland Street to Monument as part of a vigil tonight. The symbolic nature of today - the fact Boris Johnson brought the cabinet to Sunderland - has emphasised the centrality of north-east England in this whole debate. And that won't go away because although we are leaving the European Union there is still to be settled our future trading relationship with our biggest trading partner in the region, the European Union. There will be pressure from businesses like Nissan to have as close a relationship as almost we have now to make it as easy as possible for them to sell their cars, pressure perhaps from Conservative MPS in the region that if we are leaving a club we don't like being members of we shouldn't necessarily stick with the rules afterwards. Boris Johnson's biggest challenge is to prove these people at the vigil wrong, that Brexit will not be an historic blunder that will leave us lagging behind, that it can be coupled with an opportunity to make life better and make us wealthier in places like the north-east of England and Cumbria. The SNP's Ian Blackford says there is ""sadness and anger"" across Scotland at the UK's exit and the Scottish public will not ""stand for it"". He says the Scottish people will demand a say in their future and suggests an independence referendum will provide a path ""back into Europe"". He argues that the UK that Scotland voted to remain a part of in 2014 ""no longer exists"". Chris DoidgeBBC Radio Derby, political reporter Remainers at a vigil held outside Derby's council house have renamed themselves ""rejoiners"" now we have left the European Union. The event was held just round the corner from a Brexit bash in a local bar. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor First of all itâs a long, long period of hard bargaining
between the UK and the EU. The UK government is determined to try to get a free-trade
deal done by the end of this year but that will not be straight forward â not least
because there are so many things that have to be sorted out. But also because the EU will drive a hard bargain. Yes, both
sides say they still want to be friends and partners and respectful neighbours
and people want to do lots of business with each other. But the UK government has already acknowledged that will mean
some friction. And also, until itâs all done and dusted thereâs still uncertainty for
businesses and people around the country who want to know exactly what is next. But although there is legions of details to be worked out, many
more political controversies along the way, be in no doubt â the fundamental
question which has been hanging over the country for more than three years has
been settled. And thatâs already completely changed the political dynamic â
and therefore the dynamic in the country too. Foreign Secretary tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A few moments ago, it looks like a man tried to gatecrash the stage at the Brexit rally, catching the security detail off guard a little. After a brief kerfuffle, he was escorted off the premises. It's not clear if he was an anti-Brexit protester or had just got a little carried away by the occasion. At that point, all the speakers had left the stage but the crowd chants Nigel, Nigel, Nigel and the Brexit Party leader stages an encore.  Allow Twitter content?

Kate WhannelBBC News in Parliament Square The crowd join in with the countdown and a huge cheer fills the London sky as the (recorded) Big Ben bongs herald the UKâs official exit from the EU. The air in Westminster fills with smoke as flares are let off.  Some join in with a verse of God Save the Queen. And then? âThatâs that,â says one woman as the crowd head towards Westminster Tube station. âWeâre gone!â screams one jubilant man. âWe were there,â says another. But not everyone is delighted. âGross I feel like vomiting,â one man I pass mutters under his breath. As you would expect, there were scenes of jubilation in Parliament Square as the clock counted down to Brexit. The moment of departure was followed by an euphoric rendition of God Save The Queen. And with that the Brexit politician Richard Tice sends the crowd on its way home with the words ""believe it or not we are no longer a member of the European Union"".  Allow Twitter content?

Kate WhannelBBC News in Parliament Square The heart of Parliament Square is filled with hardcore Brexit fans - some of whom have waited half their lives for this moment. Some have tears in their eyes as they wave their Union flags. It looks not unlike the Last Night of the Proms. Rousing band music introduces each speaker. Round the edge of the event, though, the mood is less festive. Some are looking on, standing still, their expressions blank. Others, clearly dragged here by friends, just look bored. âI donât even want to be here,â says one teenager down the phone. âWho cares about Brexit anyway?"" Â© 2025 BBC.
