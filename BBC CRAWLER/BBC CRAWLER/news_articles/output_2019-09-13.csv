Psychedelic beauty gets the TK Maxx treatment âââââ,"The strangest thing happened to me at Tate Britain's William Blake exhibition; something I'd not encountered before, nor even considered possible. Nothing dramatic, like falling into a trippy hallucinogenic state brought on by seeing Blake's fearful painting The Ghost of a Flea (1819), a gothic, slithery depiction of a vile character who appeared before the artist as a vision. My experience was much more prosaic. Most un-Blakeian, in fact. I entered the exhibition as a lifelong fan, a fully signed-up Blake-head, but left some time later faintly irritated by the fellow. That's not his fault, nor mine, I think. It is down to the way his work has been displayed. There are some artists who can withstand the mega-blockbuster expo show with its department store aesthetics of huge interconnecting rooms for folks to wander through and browse. A David Hockney or a Bridget Riley can survive the TK Maxx treatment - their paintings are big and bold and colourful and can be enjoyed when seen from a distance. It is the largest exhibition of Blake's work for almost 20 years But there are other artists, and William Blake (1757-1827) is certainly one, whose detailed, intense images and poetry are not suited to being shown in warehouse-sized spaces. His work is all about atmosphere and otherness, delivered with a psychologically-charged flourish. There's an intimacy to Blake that is compromised when shown on the massive scale of the Tate show. It kills the mood. To the curators' credit they have attempted to create a Georgian aura in the vast modern rooms by dimming the lights and painting the walls in rich, dark colours. But covering the entrance foyer leading to the exhibition in a hideous bright red was a mistake: a block of vulgar, shouty colour setting completely the wrong tone for this most sensitive and ethereal of artists. William Blake's Albion Rose, circa 1793 The great beauty of Blake's paintings, prints, and coloured engravings are their exquisite intricacies and tonal subtlety. That is immediately obvious when you see the first image in the show, Albion Rose (1793). A naked young man stands atop a mottled rock, his arms outstretched in front of a glorious spectrum of colours heralding a new dawn. It is an optimistic, joyful picture: a jolly ""welcome to the show!"". Thereafter, the exhibition is laid out broadly chronologically, with abundant biographical detail. His family ran a hosiery shop and haberdashery in Soho selling ""all kinds of baizes, Flannels, etc etc"". They indulged young William's interest in art. He was apprenticed to an engraver before enrolling as a student at the Royal Academy of Arts. There's a lovely, delicate drawing of his wife, Catherine, who is given a Best Supporting Spouse role by the curators. She shared his artistic burden by colouring some of his work, helping with the printing and finishing off some drawings. Somebody had to. As she once said of her husband: ""I have very little of Mr Blake's company; he is always in Paradise."" The Ghost of a Flea c 1819, graphite on paper And that's where we want him. Away with the fairies, free to see his visions; letting his extraordinary mind and spirit roam at will. That is the essence of Blake, it's what makes reading his poetry alongside his fabulous illustrations so exciting. The good news is you'll see plenty of his illuminated books in this show, including his famous Songs of Innocence and of Experience (1794). They are all terrific. But the curators' desire to contextualise every last part of Blake's output by introducing his patrons, his business practices, the work of his contemporaries - because there's plenty of space in those big rooms to fill - means the mystical, magical nature of the work is usurped. A visitor to Tate Britain in front of a William Blake projection Blake is all about the possibilities of the human imagination. He offers us an escape from the dull realities of everyday life. He challenges us to think beyond the rational and the assumed with fantastical creations such as The First Book of Urizen (1794). We don't need to know what his bank account looked like at the time, or where he happened to be living. The work can speak for itself without a nagging commentary dragging into the mundane. BBC Culture - William Blake: The greatest visionary in 200 years There are moments when Blake is allowed to breathe. Most notably in the room in which 12 large colour prints hang, which the artist described as ""frescos"". They include some of his finest images, including the mesmerising God Judging Adam (1795), and grotesquely brilliant Nebuchadnezzar (1795). After that, things take a turn for the worse, with an unconvincing mock-up of his disastrous 1809 exhibition, to which almost nobody came, and those who did largely kept their hands firmly in their pockets. This is followed by a dreadful room in which massive digital images of Blake's paintings are projected onto the walls because, we are told, that is what he always wanted. Not like that, he didn't. He'd be appalled. Jerusalem, plate 28, proof impression, 1820, relief etching with pen and black ink and watercolour There is something of a recovery after the curatorial theatrics, with an excellent display of his illustrated book Jerusalem (1820). Nearby are his late watercolour illustrations of Dante's Divine Comedy (1824-27), which is a marriage made in heaven, not hell. By this time, you have seen and read so much Blake, and seen and read so much about Blake, that your head is spinning. It's too much, really. He is a very fine artist, like a very fine wine; not one to overdo. There's a danger of the palette becoming dulled, any sensational radiance diminished. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding my gripes, I would still urge you to go to this imperfect show. To have so much of William Blake's psychedelic imaginary world laid out before you is a once-in-a-generation occasion and not to be missed.

'Dirty secret' gas boosts climate warming,"The expansion of electrical grid connections has increased use of SF6 It's the most powerful greenhouse gas known to humanity, and emissions have risen rapidly in recent years, the BBC has learned. Sulphur hexafluoride, or SF6, is widely used in the electrical industry to prevent short circuits and accidents. But leaks of the little-known gas in the UK and the rest of the EU in 2017 were the equivalent of putting an extra 1.3 million cars on the road. Levels are rising as an unintended consequence of the green energy boom. Greenland's ice faces melting 'death sentence' China confirmed as source of rise in CFCs Manx public 'backs onshore wind turbines' Big lifestyle changes 'needed to cut emissions' Cheap and non-flammable, SF6 is a colourless, odourless, synthetic gas. It makes a hugely effective insulating material for medium and high-voltage electrical installations. It is widely used across the industry, from large power stations to wind turbines to electrical sub-stations in towns and cities. It prevents electrical accidents and fires. This video can not be played Technicians display the importance of preventing electrical overloads However, the significant downside to using the gas is that it has the highest global warming potential of any known substance. It is 23,500 times more warming than carbon dioxide (CO2). Just one kilogram of SF6 warms the Earth to the same extent as 24 people flying London to New York return. It also persists in the atmosphere for a long time, warming the Earth for at least 1,000 years. The way we make electricity around the world is changing rapidly. Where once large coal-fired power stations brought energy to millions, the drive to combat climate change means they are now being replaced by mixed sources of power including wind, solar and gas. This has resulted in many more connections to the electricity grid, and a rise in the number of electrical switches and circuit breakers that are needed to prevent serious accidents. Collectively, these safety devices are called switchgear. The vast majority use SF6 gas to quench arcs and stop short circuits. Gas-insulated, high-voltage switchgear almost always uses SF6 ""As renewable projects are getting bigger and bigger, we have had to use it within wind turbines specifically,"" said Costa Pirgousis, an engineer with Scottish Power Renewables on its new East Anglia wind farm, which doesn't use SF6 in turbines. ""As we are putting in more and more turbines, we need more and more switchgear and, as a result, more SF6 is being introduced into big turbines off shore. ""It's been proven for years and we know how it works, and as a result it is very reliable and very low maintenance for us offshore."" Across the entire UK network of power lines and substations, there are around one million kilograms of SF6 installed. Astudy from the University of Cardiff,externalfound that across all transmission and distribution networks, the amount used was increasing by 30-40 tonnes per year. This rise was also reflected across Europe with total emissions from the 28 member states in 2017 equivalent to 6.73 million tonnes of CO2. That's the same as the emissions from 1.3 million extra cars on the road for a year. Researchers at the University of Bristol who monitor concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere say they have seen significant rises in the last 20 years. ""We make measurements of SF6 in the background atmosphere,"" said Dr Matt Rigby, reader in atmospheric chemistry at Bristol. ""What we've seen is that the levels have increased substantially, and we've seen almost a doubling of the atmospheric concentration in the last two decades."" The most important means by which SF6 gets into the atmosphere is from leaks in the electricity industry. Electrical switchgear the world over often uses SF6 to prevent fires Electrical company Eaton, which manufactures switchgear without SF6, says its research indicates that for the full life-cycle of the product, leaks could be as high as 15% - much higher than many other estimates. Louis Shaffer, electrical business manager at Eaton, said: ""The newer gear has very low leak rates but the key question is do you have newer gear? ""We looked at all equipment and looked at the average of all those leak rates, and we didn't see people taking into account the filling of the gas. Plus, we looked at how you recycle it and return it and also included the catastrophic leaks."" Concentrations in the atmosphere are very small right now, just a fraction of the amount of CO2 in the air. However, the global installed base of SF6 is expected to grow by 75% by 2030. Another concern is that SF6 is a synthetic gas and isn't absorbed or destroyed naturally. It will all have to be replaced and destroyed to limit the impact on the climate. Developed countries are expected to report every year to the UN on how much SF6 they use, but developing countries do not face any restrictions on use. Right now, scientists are detecting concentrations in the atmosphere that are 10 times the amount declared by countries in their reports. Scientists say this is not all coming from countries like India, China and South Korea. Onestudy found,externalthat the methods used to calculate emissions in richer countries ""severely under-reported"" emissions over the past two decades. SF6 comes under a group of human-produced substances known as F-gases. The European Commission tried to prohibit a number of these environmentally harmful substances, including gases in refrigeration and air conditioning, back in 2014. But they faced strong opposition from industries across Europe. This video can not be played Farmer Adam Twine is concerned about SF6 ""In the end, the electrical industry lobby was too strong and we had to give in to them,"" said Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout, who was responsible for the attempt to regulate F-gases. ""The electric sector was very strong in arguing that if you want an energy transition, and you have to shift more to electricity, you will need more electric devices. And then you also will need more SF6. ""They used the argument that otherwise the energy transition would be slowed down."" Everyone is trying to reduce their dependence on the gas, as it is universally recognised as harmful to the climate. In the UK, energy regulator Ofgem says it is working with utilities to try to limit leaks of the gas. ""We are using a range of tools to make sure that companies limit their use of SF6, a potent greenhouse gas, where this is in the interest of energy consumers,"" an Ofgem spokesperson told BBC News. ""This includes funding innovation trials and rewarding companies to research and find alternatives, setting emissions targets, rewarding companies that beat those targets, and penalising those that miss them."" The question of alternatives to SF6 has been contentious over recent years. For high-voltage applications, experts say there are very few solutions that have been rigorously tested. ""There is no real alternative that is proven,"" said Prof Manu Haddad from the school of engineering at Cardiff University. ""There are some that are being proposed now but to prove their operation over a long period of time is a risk that many companies don't want to take."" However, for medium voltage operations there are several tried-and-tested materials. Some in the industry say that the conservative nature of the electrical industry is the key reason that few want to change to a less harmful alternative. ""I will tell you, everyone in this industry knows you can do this; there is not a technical reason not to do it,"" said Louis Shaffer from Eaton. ""It's not really economic; it's more a question that change takes effort and if you don't have to, you won't do it."" Sitting in the North Sea some 43km from the Suffolk coast, Scottish Power Renewables has installed one of world's biggest wind farms where the turbines will be free of SF6 gas. East Anglia One will see 102 of these towering generators erected, with the capacity to produce up to 714MW (megawatts) of power by 2020, enough to supply half a million homes. The turbines at East Anglia One are taller than the Elizabeth Tower at the Houses of Parliament which houses Big Ben Previously, an installation like this would have used switchgear supplied with SF6, to prevent the electrical accidents that can lead to fires. Each turbine would normally have contained around 5kg of SF6, which, if it leaked into the atmosphere, would add the equivalent of around 117 tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is roughly the same as the annual emissions from 25 cars. ""In this case we are using a combination of clean air and vacuum technology within the turbine. It allows us to still have a very efficient, reliable, high-voltage network but to also be environmentally friendly,"" said Costa Pirgousis from Scottish Power Renewables. ""Once there are viable alternatives on the market, there is no reason not to use them. In this case, we've got a viable alternative and that's why we are using it."" But even for companies that are trying to limit the use of SF6, there are still limitations. At the heart of East Anglia One sits a giant offshore substation to which all 102 turbines will connect. It still uses significant quantities of the highly warming gas. The EU will review the use of SF6 next year and will examine whether alternatives are available. However, even the most optimistic experts don't think that any ban is likely to be put in place before 2025. Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathBBC,external.

Actress Huffman given jail time over college scam,"This video can not be played Felicity Huffman leaves court after being sentenced to 14 days in prison US actress Felicity Huffman has been sentenced to 14 days in prison for her involvement in a college admissions scandal. The Desperate Housewives star admitted to paying $15,000 (Â£11,500) to have her daughter's exam answers secretly corrected in 2017. She must also do 250 hours of community service and pay a $30,000 fine. Parents and athletics coaches were among 50 people charged in the scheme, but none of the children were indicted. ""There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period,"" Huffman said in a statement after her sentencing. ""I would like to apologise again to my daughter, my husband, my family and the educational community for my actions. ""And I especially want to apologise to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices supporting their children."" Judge Indira Talwani said she believes Huffman has accepted full responsibility for her actions, but ""trying to be a good mother does not excuse"" what she did. She must report to prison in six weeks. Prosecutors had asked for a month in prison and a $20,000 fine. How much difference does going to a top US university make? Celebrity parents and the bizarre 'cheating' scandal Exams whizz at centre of US cheat scandal The parents charged in the college scam investigation allegedly paid bribes, had exams altered, and even had their children edited into stock photos to fake sporting talents on applications. Prosecutors say they managed to fraudulently secure spots for the teenagers at elite US universities including Yale, Georgetown and Stanford. Huffman pleaded guilty to mail and honest services fraud in May. She is the first parent sentenced in the scandal. This video can not be played Five things to know about the college admissions scandal Her legal team had asked for a year of probation in lieu of jail time, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine. But prosecutors wrote in a memo last week that ""neither probation nor home confinement (in a large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool) would constitute meaningful punishment or deter others from committing similar crimes"". Huffman worked with the scam's confessed mastermind, William Singer, to falsify a college entrance exam score for her oldest daughter, Sophia Macy. Singer arranged for Sophia to take her SAT test in a special location, an exam widely used for college admissions in the US. Her result was a major improvement on her previous score. In a letter to Judge Talwani, Huffman wrote: ""In my desperation to be a good mother I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot."" ""I see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair. I have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter and failed my family."" Huffman said in her letter to the judge that her daughter had been unaware of the fraud, and was devastated to learn of it. This video can not be played Students react to cheating scam: ""This is how we got into an elite college"" The actress wrote: ""When my daughter looked at me and asked me with tears streaming down her face, 'Why didn't you believe in me? Why didn't you think I could do it on my own?' I had no adequate answer for her. ""I could only say, 'I am sorry. I was frightened and I was stupid.' In my blind panic, I have done the exact thing that I was desperate to avoid. ""I have compromised my daughter's future, the wholeness of my family and my own integrity."" Prosecutors said Huffman made arrangements to have Singer cheat for her younger daughter as well before deciding against it. Huffman's husband - actor William H Macy - also had contact with Singer, though Mr Macy was spared charges. Though Huffman was among the most high-profile figures indicted, she paid among the smallest sums allegedly doled out by the parents charged in the scandal, according to court documents. Lori Loughlin, another Hollywood actress ensnared in the scandal along with her husband, has pleaded not guilty to paying $500,000 in bribes to have their daughters accepted to the University of Southern California as members of the rowing team.

US and Brazil agree to Amazon development,"Brazil Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo (L) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met on Friday The US and Brazil have agreed to promote private-sector development in the Amazon, during a meeting in Washington on Friday. They also pledged a $100m (Â£80m) biodiversity conservation fund for the Amazon led by the private sector. Brazil's foreign minister said opening the rainforest to economic development was the only way to protect it. Ernesto Araujo also hit back at criticism of Brazil's handling of the forest fires. He told reporters in Washington that claims the country is ""not able to cope with the challenges"" were false. Worker who protected indigenous tribes killed in Amazon Are forest fires as bad as they seem? On Friday, Finland urged EU countries to consider stopping importing beef and soybeans from Brazil in order to put pressure on Brazil to tackle the fires. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced criticism for failing to protect the region. More than 80,000 fires have broken out in the Amazon rainforest so far this year. Experts believe the majority of the fires across Brazil this year arecaused by human activity such as farmers and loggers clearing landfor crops or grazing. By Roger Harrabin, BBC Environment Analyst Environmentalists will say this scheme is a ruse to open up the Amazon for mining, logging and farming. When roads are driven into the forest it attracts more settlers, who clear land and hunt wildlife. The land clearance - even on a quite small basis - leads to changed weather patterns, which harm the forest. Environmentalists will argue the best way of saving the rainforest is to leave it in the hands of indigenous people. Environmentalists say Mr Bolsonaro's policies have led to an increase in fires this year and that he has encouraged cattle farmers to clear large areas of the rainforest since his election last October. Mr Araujo said: ""We want to be together in the endeavour to create development for the Amazon region which we are convinced is the only way to protect the forest. ""So we need new initiatives, new productive initiatives, that create jobs, that create revenue for people in the Amazon and that's where our partnership with the United States will be very important for us."" This video can not be played ""It's extremely upsetting... to see this kind of devastation"" - the BBC's Will Grant flew over northern Rondonia state US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the biodiversity investment fund would support businesses in hard to reach areas of the Amazon. He added: ""The Brazilians and the American teams will follow through on our commitment that our presidents made in March.  We're getting off the ground a 100 million dollar, 11-year Impact Investment Fund for Amazon biodiversity conservation and that project will be led by the private sector."" Last week seven South American countriesagreed on measures to protect the Amazon river basin.

Historic towns to benefit from Â£95m boost named,"Coventry will get Â£2m to restore buildings that survived World War Two Historic English shopping centres will benefit from a Â£95m regeneration fund, the government has said. In all, 69 towns and cities will receive money, with projects aimed at turning disused buildings into shops, houses and community centres. The largest share of money, Â£21.1m, will go to the Midlands, with Â£2m going to restore buildings in Coventry that survived World War Two bombing. The government said the move would ""breathe new life"" into High Streets. The government's Future High Street Fund is providing Â£52m of the money, while Â£40m will come from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). A further Â£3m is being provided by the National Lottery Heritage Fund. Towns and cities had to bid for the Â£95m funding, which was first announced in May. The announcement comes afterfigures showed that about 16 shops a dayclosed in the first half of the year as retailers restructure their businesses and more shopping moves online. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC which was behind the research, said retailers had to invest more in making stores ""relevant to today's consumers"", but added that ""new and different types of operators"" needed encouragement to fill vacant space. The government said the money would ""support wider regeneration"" in the 69 successful areas by attracting future commercial investment. ""Our nation's heritage is one of our great calling cards to the world, attracting millions of visitors to beautiful historic buildings that sit at the heart of our communities,"" said Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan. ""It is right that we ensure these buildings are preserved for future generations but it is important that we make them work for the modern world."" Other major projects include a Â£2m drive to restore historic shop-fronts in London's Tottenham area, which suffered extensive damage in the 2011 riots. By region, the funding breaks down as follows: London and the South East: Â£14.3m South West: Â£13.7m East of England: Â£7m Midlands: Â£21.1m North East and Yorkshire: Â£17.2m North West: Â£18.7m You can reada full list of the towns and cities that will benefit here. ""Increasing competition from online outlets is putting High Streets across the country under growing pressure,"" said the DCMS. ""As part of the government's drive to help High Streets adapt to changing consumer habits, the Â£95m funding will provide a welcome boost."" Responding to the move, shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said High Streets had been ""decimated"" by ""a decade of Tory austerity"". He added: ""This funding pales in comparison to the Â£1bn Cultural Capital fund that Labour is committed to, which will boost investment in culture, arts and heritage right across the country, not just a few lucky areas.""

New UK energy giant created in SSE-Ovo deal,"Ovo is set to become the UK's second largest energy supplier after it agreed to buy SSE's retail business for Â£500m. Ovo - which was created 10 years ago - is already the UK's largest independent energy supplier, with 1.5 million customers and about 2,000 employees. But it will now take on SSE's 3.5 million customers and 8,000 staff, making it second only to British Gas. SSE said,externalit would ""do all it can to ensure a smooth transition for customers and employees"". The deal is expected to be completed in late 2019 or early 2020. SSE - one of the Big Six energy suppliers - said there would be no immediate impact on customers after completion. It added that the SSE brand would be operated by Ovo under licence for a period, ""allowing time for a phased and carefully managed migration and continued high standards of customer service"". Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, said Ovo's deal to buy SSE's business ""will enhance the ever-growing competition for customers"". ""The likes of Ovo, Shell, Bulb and Octopus mean there's a base of emerging suppliers who are continuing to challenge the Big Six in the domestic energy market."" Ovo chief Stephen Fitzpatrick said the two business were a ""great fit"" SSE had announced in May that it planned to offload its energy services division after more than 500,000 households switched to a new supplier in the year to April. The company said it would sell or float its energy services arm by the second half of 2020. In November last year, a proposed merger of SSE's household supply arm with rival Npower was called off, with SSEblaming ""very challenging market conditions"". The introduction of the energy price cap by the government had led SSE and Npower to renegotiate their planned tie-up, but they failed to agree a deal. Announcing the sale of the business to Ovo, SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: ""We have long believed that a dedicated, focused and independent retailer will ultimately best serve customers, employees and other stakeholders - and this is an excellent opportunity to make that happen. ""I'm confident that this is the best outcome for the SSE Energy Services business."" The founder and chief executive of Ovo, Stephen Fitzpatrick, described the deal as a ""significant moment for the energy industry"". ""SSE and Ovo are a great fit. They share our values on sustainability and serving customers. They've built an excellent team that I'm really looking forward to working with.""

PM's resignation statement in full,"This video can not be played Prime Minister David Cameron says he will stand down Prime Minister David Cameron has said he is to step down from his post after the UK voted to leave the EU. Here is the statement he made outside Downing Street. Good morning everyone, the country has just taken part in a giant democratic exercise, perhaps the biggest in our history. Over 33 million people from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar have all had their say. We should be proud of the fact that in these islands we trust the people for these big decisions. We not only have a parliamentary democracy, but on questions about the arrangements for how we're governed there are times when it is right to ask the people themselves and that is what we have done. The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected. I want to thank everyone who took part in the campaign on my side of the argument, including all those who put aside party differences to speak in what they believe was the national interest and let me congratulate all those who took part in the Leave campaign for the spirited and passionate case that they made. The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered. It was not a decision that was taken lightly, not least because so many things were said by so many different organisations about the significance of this decision. So there can be no doubt about the result. Across the world people have been watching the choice that Britain has made. I would reassure those markets and investors that Britain's economy is fundamentally strong and I would also reassure Britons living in European countries and European citizens living here there will be no immediate changes in your circumstances. There will be no initial change in the way our people can travel, in the way our goods can move or the way our services can be sold. We must now prepare for a negotiation with the European Union. This will need to involve the full engagement of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments to ensure that the interests of all parts of our United Kingdom are protected and advanced. But above all this will require strong, determined and committed leadership. I'm very proud and very honoured to have been prime minister of this country for six years. I believe we've made great steps, with more people in work than ever before in our history, with reforms to welfare and education, increasing people's life chances, building a bigger and stronger society, keeping our promises to the poorest people in the world and enabling those who love each other to get married whatever their sexuality, but above all restoring Britain's economic strength. And I'm grateful to everyone who's helped to make that happen. I have also always believed that we have to confront big decisions, not duck them. That is why we delivered the first coalition government in 70 years, to bring our economy back from the brink. It's why we delivered a fair, legal and decisive referendum in Scotland. And it's why I made the pledge to renegotiate Britain's position in the European Union and to hold the referendum on our membership and have carried those things out. I fought this campaign in the only way I know how, which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel - head, heart and soul. I held nothing back, I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union and I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone - not the future of any single politician including myself. But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction. I will do everything I can as prime minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination. This is not a decision I've taken lightly but I do believe it's in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required. There is no need for a precise timetable today but in my view we should aim to have a new prime minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party conference in October. Delivering stability will be important and I will continue in post as prime minister with my cabinet for the next three months. The cabinet will meet on Monday, the governor of the Bank of England is making a statement about the steps that the Bank and the Treasury are taking to reassure financial markets. We will also continue taking forward the important legislation that we set before Parliament in the Queen's Speech. And I have spoken to Her Majesty the Queen this morning to advise her of the steps that I am taking. A negotiation with the European Union will need to begin under a new prime minister and I think it's right that this new prime minister takes the decision about when to trigger Article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU. I will attend the European Council next week to explain the decision the British people have taken and my own decision. The British people have made a choice, that not only needs to be respected but those on the losing side of the argument - myself included - should help to make it work. Britain is a special country - we have so many great advantages - a parliamentary democracy where we resolve great issues about our future through peaceful debate, a great trading nation with our science and arts, our engineering and our creativity, respected the world over. And while we are not perfect I do believe we can be a model for the multi-racial, multi-faith democracy, that people can come and make a contribution and rise to the very highest that their talent allows. Although leaving Europe was not the path I recommended, I am the first to praise our incredible strengths. I said before that Britain can survive outside the European Union and indeed that we could find a way. Now the decision has been made to leave, we need to find the best way and I will do everything I can to help. I love this country and I feel honoured to have served it and I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed. Thank you very much.

The David Cameron story,"Whatever else he achieved during his six years in power, David Cameron, who quit as prime minister in July and has now announced he is to step down as an MP, will forever be remembered as the man who took Britain out of the European Union. It is a strange epitaph for a political leader who once vowed to stop his party ""banging on about Europe"" and it is hardly the way he would have wanted to go down in history. He led the Conservative Party for nearly 11 years - only Stanley Baldwin, Lady Thatcher and Sir Winston Churchill spent longer in the job in modern times - returning them to power after more than a decade in the political wilderness. When he burst on to the scene in 2005, beating better-known rivals to the party leadership, he wanted to be seen as a new kind of Conservative, young, liberal-minded, socially concerned and, above all, modern. There would be no place in Cameron's Conservative Party for the toxic rows about the European Union that had brought the party to the brink of destruction under previous leaders. Instead, there would be a positive, upbeat, inclusive vision of Britain. He spoke of making the Conservatives the party of the NHS and the environment and of ""sharing the proceeds of growth"" with the less well-off. One of his proudest early achievements was to get a round of applause from a Conservative conference audience for civil partnerships. Mr Cameron attended Eton and Oxford University When the 2008 banking crisis hit, his tone changed - the social reforms were still there but they were accompanied by a more traditional Conservative focus on balancing the books through public spending cuts. He always refused to see a contradiction between the two goals, arguing that the country could do ""more with less"". A self-styled pragmatist, who claimed to be suspicious of ideology, Mr Cameron was always able to trim his positions to suit the times. It was this flexibility that enabled him to form alliances with political opponents, most notably with Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, in the first coalition government since the war, and later when he shared platforms with Labour figures during the referendum campaign. But it was a quality that bred suspicion and, in the end, outright hostility among his more ideologically pure Conservative colleagues, who wondered what, if anything, he stood for. His privileged background also became a source of resentment for some in his party, who preferred their leaders in the grammar-school educated, self-made mould of a Thatcher or Major. Mr Cameron was the first Conservative leader since the early 1960s to have attended one of Britain's top fee-paying schools, Eton, and he can trace his ancestry back to William IV, making him a distant relative of the Queen. His close alliance with George Osborne was key to his career He never made a secret of his privileged background, saying he wanted everyone in Britain to have the kind of advantages in life that he had had. It only became an issue earlier this year when his late father Ian was named as a one-time client of Mossack Fonseca, a Panama-based firm at the centre of a tax avoidance scandal. Mr Cameron was eventually forced to publish his tax returns, a first for a British prime minister, which showed he had received a Â£200,000 gift from his mother, which could potentially avoid inheritance tax. Seeing his beloved father traduced in the media was painful for Mr Cameron, who had always spoken with admiration of his fighting spirit. Ian Cameron, who died in 2010, was born with severely deformed legs, which he eventually had to have amputated. He also lost the sight in one eye, but David's father said he never considered himself ""disabled"" and rarely complained about anything. David Cameron has said he had a happy childhood, but one where ""whingeing was not on the menu"". ""I'm a practical person, and pragmatic. I know where I want to get to, but I am not ideologically attached to one particular method,"" December 2005. ""I'm going to be as radical a social reformer as Mrs Thatcher was an economic reformer,"" August 2008. ""I don't support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative,"" July 2013. ""I hope they'd say I'm optimistic, I enjoy life and that I'm fun. But also that I'm quite driven in doing what I believe in,"" on what his friends would say about him, February 2015. ""We will govern as a party of one nation, one United Kingdom. That means ensuring this recovery reaches all parts of our country, from north to south, to east to west,"" May 2015. The third of four children, he was born on 9 October 1966 in London and spent the first three years of his life in Kensington and Chelsea before the family moved to an old rectory near Newbury, in Berkshire. Mr Cameron's mother, Mary, served as a Justice of the Peace for 30 years. During her time on the bench she passed judgement on the Greenham Common protesters, including on one occasion her own sister and eco-warrior Swampy, who was protesting against the construction of the Newbury bypass. At the age of seven, the young Cameron was packed off to Heatherdown, an exclusive preparatory school, which counted Princes Edward and Andrew among its pupils. Then, following in the family tradition, came Eton. He has described his 12 O-levels as ""not very good"", but he gained three As at A-level, in history, history of art and economics with politics. His biggest mention in the Eton school magazine came when he sprained his ankle dancing to bagpipes on a school trip to Rome. Before going to Oxford to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics he took a gap year, working initially for Sussex Conservative MP Tim Rathbone, before spending three months in Hong Kong, working for a shipping agent, and then returning by rail via the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. At Oxford, he avoided student politics because, according to one friend from the time, Steve Rathbone, ""he wanted to have a good time"". He was captain of Brasenose College's tennis team and a member of the Bullingdon dining club, famed for its hard drinking and bad behaviour, a period Mr Cameron has always refused to talk about. He has also consistently dodged the question of whether he took drugs at university. ""He's not someone - and most Englishmen aren't - who talks freely and easily in the open-hearted Oprah-esque fashion that some do but he's extremely good company,"" friend and ministerial colleague Michael Gove in 2010 ""He's always been incredibly strong, and kind, and supportive,"" Samantha Cameron, wife ""In good times and in bad, he's just the kind of partner that you want at your side.  I trust him.  He says what he does, and he does what he says,"" US President Barack Obama. ""If there was an Olympic gold medal for chillaxing he would win it,"" Cameron ally quoted in Francis Elliott and James Hanning biography. ""Though possessed of a first-class mind, Cameron is not a reflective politician. He rarely agonises over a problem, preferring to resolve dilemmas as quickly and pragmatically as he can, generally with a group of close allies,"" political journalist Matthew D'Ancona. But he evidently did not let his extra-curricular activities get in the way of his studies. His tutor at Oxford, Prof Vernon Bogdanor, describes him as ""one of the ablest"" students he has taught, whose political views were ""moderate and sensible Conservative"". After gaining a first-class degree, he briefly considered a career in journalism or banking, before answering an advertisement for a job in the Conservative Research Department. Conservative Central Office is reported to have received a telephone call on the morning of his interview in June 1988, from an unnamed man at Buckingham Palace, who said: ""I understand you are to see David Cameron. ""I've tried everything I can to dissuade him from wasting his time on politics but I have failed. I am ringing to tell you that you are about to meet a truly remarkable young man."" Music:Bob Dylan and indie rock such as The Killers, The Smiths, Radiohead and Pulp. Books:Goodbye to All That by Robert Graves, Cider With Rosie, by Laurie Lee Films:Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather TV:Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Killing Leisure time:Karaoke, playing computer games Sport:Playing tennis, snooker, running, watching cricket. Supports Aston Villa football club, although he got mixed up during the general election campaign and said West Ham Mr Cameron says he did not know the call was being made or who made it, but it is sometimes held up by his opponents as an example of his gilded passage to the top. As a researcher, Mr Cameron was seen as hard-working and bright. He worked with future shadow home secretary David Davis on the team briefing John Major for Prime Minister's Questions, and also hooked up with George Osborne, who would go on to be his chancellor and closest political ally. Mr Cameron grabbed headlines in 2005 with a trip to the Arctic Circle Other colleagues, in what became known as the ""brat pack"" were Steve Hilton, who was one of Mr Cameron's closest strategy advisers during his early days in Downing Street, and future Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. These young researchers were credited with devising the attack on Labour's tax plans that unexpectedly swung the 1992 general election for John Major. But the remainder of Mr Cameron's time as a backroom boy in the Conservative government was more turbulent. He was poached by then Chancellor Norman Lamont as a political adviser, and was at Mr Lamont's side throughout Black Wednesday, which saw the pound crash out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. By the early 1990s, Mr Cameron had decided he wanted to be an MP himself, but he also knew it was vital to gain experience outside of politics. So after a brief spell as an adviser to then home secretary Michael Howard, he took a job in public relations with ITV television company Carlton. Mr Cameron spent seven years at Carlton, as head of corporate communications, travelling the world with the firm's boss Michael Green, who described him as ""board material"". He went part-time from his job at Carlton in 1997 to unsuccessfully contest Stafford at that year's general election. Four years later, in 2001, he won the safe Conservative seat of Witney, in Oxfordshire, recently vacated by Shaun Woodward, who had defected to Labour. Samantha Cameron, the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet, worked as the creative director of upmarket stationery firm Smythson of Bond Street, which counts Stella McCartney, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell among its clients. She has been credited with transforming her husband's staid ""Tory boy"" image. She has a tattoo on her ankle and went to art school in Bristol, where she says she was taught to play pool by rap star Tricky. The couple were introduced by Mr Cameron's sister Clare, Samantha's best friend, at a party at the Cameron family home. They were married in 1996. Mr Cameron was mocked for his 'hug a hoodie' speech They have three children, Nancy, Arthur, and Florence, who was born shortly after the family moved into Downing Street. Their first child, Ivan, who was born profoundly disabled and needed round-the-clock care, died in February 2009. The experience of caring for Ivan and witnessing at first hand the dedication of NHS hospital staff, is said by friends to have broadened Mr Cameron's horizons. He had, friends say, led an almost charmed life, to that point. On entering Parliament in 2001, Mr Cameron rose rapidly through the ranks, serving first on the Home Affairs Select Committee, which recommended the liberalisation of drug laws. He was taken under the wing of Michael Howard, who put him in charge of policy co-ordination and then made him shadow education secretary. He also had the key role of drafting the 2005 Conservative election manifesto. But when he entered the race to succeed Mr Howard as party leader in 2005 few initially gave him a chance. He was a distant fourth at the bookmakers behind Ken Clarke, Liam Fox and frontrunner David Davis. It took an eye-catching conference speech, delivered without notes, in what would become his trademark style, to change the minds of the party faithful. David Cameron and daughter Florence in 2010 A few may have had second thoughts, when in the early months of his leadership he spoke about how some young offenders just needed love (caricatured by his opponents as his ""hug a hoodie"" speech) and was pictured with huskies in the Arctic Circle on a trip to investigate climate change. The media, eager for a new story after years of Tory failure and with an increasingly unpopular Labour government, gave him the glowing coverage he craved, helping him to ""decontaminate"" the Tory brand and move the party back towards the centre ground, where, the conventional wisdom has it, British elections are won and lost. He was rewarded with big poll leads - but the financial crisis forced Mr Cameron to ditch much of his upbeat rhetoric, in favour of a more sober, even gloomy, approach, warning voters they faced tough times and spending cuts ahead. During the course of the 2010 general election campaign, he watched much of his poll lead evaporate, with the rise of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, a man with a similar background and smooth, telegenic manner. Mr Cameron agreed to a Scottish independence referendum in 2012 What's more, his big idea in 2010, the Big Society, the fruit of detailed policy work stretching back to the early days of his leadership, which envisaged parents setting up their own schools and groups of public sector workers forming co-operatives, failed to capture voters' imagination in the way he had hoped. Mr Clegg was the surprise victor in the first televised prime ministerial debate ever held in Britain - an innovation Mr Cameron had pushed hard for - and although the Lib Dem leader's advantage had largely disappeared by polling day, the election ended without a clear winner. Despite gaining 97 seats, the Conservatives' biggest increase in decades, Mr Cameron fell just short of the majority he needed to form a government and was forced into coalition talks with Mr Clegg's Liberal Democrats. At 43, Mr Cameron was the youngest prime minister since Robert Banks Jenkinson, the 2nd Earl of Liverpool in 1812. He was six months younger than Tony Blair when he entered Downing Street in 1997. His Chancellor George Osborne, was even younger - the two had formed a close bond from their early days as MPs and would govern very much as a team, like Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had done during the Labour years, but without the bitter rivalry and personal rancour. This video can not be played EU referendum: Boris v Dave - a rivalry with history Cameron and Osborne became so closely associated with each other, with the chancellor being groomed to succeed Mr Cameron when the time came, that they came to be known by the critics who were excluded from their tight inner circle by one word: Camborne. The coalition they formed with Mr Clegg functioned better than anyone expected, managing to complete a full five-year term and introduce sweeping changes to the education system, the NHS, the benefits system, pensions and much else besides. Mr Clegg and his party took a big hit in the opinion polls, and would eventually lose most of their MPs, over unpopular coalition policies such as the massive cuts to public spending aimed at paying off the deficit and increasing university tuition fees. Mr Cameron, on the other hand, earned praise for his statesmanlike handling of set-piece events, such as his Commons statement on the Bloody Sunday inquiry, and his ability to look and sound ""prime ministerial"" when the occasion demanded it. Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg formed a coalition government in 2010 To the surprise of many, possibly including himself, the greatest difficulties he encountered were not in managing the coalition with the Lib Dems but with keeping control of the increasingly vocal and rebellious right-wing of his own party, who hated their party's alliance with Mr Clegg and were beginning to agitate for a referendum on remaining in the EU. In August 2013, he suffered a major blow to his authority when he became the first prime minister in more than 100 years to lose a foreign policy vote, after dozens of Conservative MPs joined forces with Labour to block his plans for military intervention in Syria. But perhaps the biggest crisis of his premiership came in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014, when he cancelled Prime Minister's Questions to rush north of the border in an effort to save the Union, after a poll suggested the Yes campaign would win. He was later forced to issue an apology to the Queen, after he was overheard telling New York mayor Michael Bloomberg Her Majesty had ""purred down the line"" when he informed her that Scotland had rejected independence. Mr Cameron gets fired up on the campaign trail in the 2015 general election For some, his handling of the referendum issue, by offering last-minute concessions to the nationalists, added to the idea of Mr Cameron as an ""essay crisis"" prime minister, who only gets fully engaged with an issue when all seems lost. Mr Cameron had agreed to a referendum thinking it would settle the issue of Scottish independence once and for all - similar logic that led him to promise a referendum on Britain's continued membership of the EU, in January 2013. Both decisions, in their different ways, would prove to be spectacular misjudgements. When he made the EU referendum promise, the Conservatives were losing support to the UK Independence Party, a Eurosceptic outfit he had once airily dismissed as a collection of ""fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists"". Europe was not the issue it might have been at the 2015 general election had he not promised a referendum, and, in the end, UKIP only managed to win one seat. But it was Mr Cameron's warnings to voters not to put the economy at risk by voting Labour that appears to have had the biggest impact, despite critics carping that he was running a negative, fear-based campaign. The polls suggested another hung Parliament, but Mr Cameron proved the polls wrong and won a slender majority of his own - forming the first Conservative-only government since Sir John Major's in 1992. He moved quickly to exploit the disarray in the Labour Party, following the election of unknown and untested left winger Jeremy Corbyn as leader, to position the Conservatives as a moderate, ""one nation"" force and the ""party of working people"", with a view to securing it in government for a generation. This was starkly at odds, said critics, with his government's renewed commitment to austerity, but Mr Cameron was also keen to secure a legacy of social reform, with plans to improve the ""life chances"" of ethnic minorities and the socially disadvantaged. Mr Cameron led the campaign to keep Britain in the EU His honeymoon period was short-lived, however, as his government suffered a string of defeats at the hands of his own backbenchers, most notably over Chancellor George Osborne's plans to cut disability benefits. And his decision to go for an early referendum saw him pitched into a round of shuttle diplomacy with fellow European leaders, as he attempted to put together a new deal aimed at keeping Britain in the EU. He placed himself front and centre of the negotiations and the referendum campaign that followed - his use of the personal pronoun was striking, it was always ""my referendum"". The deal he returned was, predictably, dismissed by critics as falling far short of what he had promised, particularly on the issue of the free movement of people. But Mr Cameron insisted the curbs on welfare payments he had wrung out of the other EU leaders would help control immigration - and the man who had insisted he would ""rule nothing out"" if he did not get what he wanted from Brussels was now transformed into a passionate advocate for Britain's continued membership of the EU. It was a shift in position too far for many in his party, the majority of whom wanted Britain out of the EU. And despite returning them to power months earlier, they were in no mood to be told what to do by Mr Cameron. He was forced to suspend collective cabinet responsibility, allowing ministers to campaign for either side in the referendum, even though the government's official position was for Britain to remain in the EU. Former London Mayor Boris Johnson, a former schoolmate at Eton, who had long been seen as positioning himself to take over as leader and prime minister from Mr Cameron, dealt him an early blow by joining the Leave campaign. But what was more bruising for the prime minister was that Justice Secretary Michael Gove, one of his closest friends and allies, decided to campaign for Leave. Despite early promises that they would remain civil to each other, the campaign unleashed the kind of brutal civil war at the top of the Conservative Party that Mr Cameron had spent his entire career trying to prevent. And although he had promised during the campaign to stay on as prime minister whatever the result of the referendum, it turned out to be a forlorn hope. After leaving Downing Street, Mr Cameron initially suggested he was keen to remain as an MP until 2020 at least - noting that he had plenty of experience that he wanted to impart and Parliament was the poorer when senior figures took their leave. He even made a surprise appearance on the Commons backbenches to support his successor Theresa May in a vote on the Trident nuclear deterrent. However, after a ""period of reflection"" over the summer, he announced he would be standing down and leaving frontline politics for good - saying that for him to remain in Parliament would be an ""enormous distraction and diversion"" to Mrs May. He leaves Westminster having succeeded in changing the Conservative Party in many ways, recruiting more women and ethnic minority MPs, and having got the party back into government from what had looked a fairly hopeless position in 2005. But he never managed to win over its powerful right wing, who mistrusted his liberal brand of Conservatism and what they saw as his elitist, patrician style of government. It was this, allied to his fateful decision to try and settle the toxic issue of Europe by taking it head on, that proved to be his undoing in the end.

The FSA has recommended ministers adopt strict new rules, which include highlighting the 14 major allergens. The proposals followthe death in 2016 of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who had eaten a sandwich from Pret a Manger. Pret a Manger said it supported the FSA's recommendations. The government said it welcomed the agency's input, adding: ""We are working at pace to bring forward legislation that ensures food allergy suffers can feel safe and secure."" FSA chairwoman Heather Hancock said the FSA had chosen the strictest of the options they had under discussion because ""ultimately this is a life-threatening issue for a proportion of the population"". Does your dinner come from a 'dark kitchen'? Food allergy alert service begins in Scotland How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? However she acknowledged that there was a risk that business might find the new rules onerous and might consider not serving people with allergies altogether. ""We are balancing consumer protection, public health protection, with the ability of people being able to deliver good business service and choice for people with an allergy or intolerance,"" she said. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will have the final say over whether new rules are introduced. The FSA board discussed several options, ranging from light-touch intervention of promoting best practice in the food industry to requiring firms to list the 14 most common allergens. Supermarket sandwich:already has to list full ingredients including allergens Over-the-counter sandwich:if it's made to order in front of you, it doesn't currently need a label. This will not change under the new plans. Pre-prepared sandwich:if it is made on the premises, it doesn't currently need a label, just a sign nearby prompting customers to ask about allergens. But if these recommendations are adopted, any sandwich that is wrapped and picked from a shelf will need to carry a label listing all ingredients, and highlighting major allergens If ministers choose to proceed with the recommendation, food outlets will be required to provide a full list of ingredients on each product, highlighting nuts, eggs and dairy and other products that are frequent allergens. However sandwich shops that make up food at the point of sale will not have to provide the labelling, since it is assumed a conversation will take place between staff and customer. They will still need to display signage, telling the customer to ask for allergen information if they need it. Ms Hancock said businesses had voiced objections to the proposal, saying it would push up costs. She said the intention was to provide the food industry with the time to implement the changes, and to provide support for smaller businesses. While the new policy would improve customers' trust in the food they were buying, the FSA admitted it would also introduce a risk of ""mislabelling incidents, particularly in busy kitchen environments"". The FSA said it might also lead to businesses removing some foods from their menus and limiting changes to menus to avoid the costs of extra labelling. The proposed changes follow the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who had an allergy to sesame seeds and died after eating a sandwich from Pret a Manger. Natasha's family has welcomed the FSA's recommendations Natasha's parents, Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse described the FSA's recommendation to introduce stricter labelling as ""a momentous decision"". ""Business must always listen to its consumers particularly in matters of life and death. ""It is now for government ministers to implement legislation to save lives. We are now one step nearer to making Natasha's Law a reality. A label saves a life."" Ms Hancock said it was impossible to eliminate risk entirely and that food safety relied on a ""layering up"" of protection, by providing labelling, staff training and customers taking personal responsibility. Michelle Victor from law firm Leigh Day, who is representing Mr and Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, said: ""Business should now embrace change and work on how they are going to implement full ingredient labelling. ""We encourage the government to follow these recommendations from the FSA and implement Natasha's Law this year."" A Pret A Manger spokesperson said: ""After careful piloting, we have begun our nationwide roll-out of full ingredient labels on all our freshly made products, which will be complete this summer. ""It hasn't been an easy transition for our business so we remain committed to sharing what we have learnt so far with government, regulators and industry.""

10 key moments in Cameron's career,"David Cameron is stepping down after six years as Britain's prime minister and nearly 11 years as Conservative leader - here are 10 key moments Within weeks of beating better-known rival David Davis to the Conservative leadership in a December 2005 vote of party members, David Cameron was boarding a plane to the Arctic Circle for a fact-finding mission on global warming. It was a dramatic way of announcing himself as a new kind of Conservative - one who cared about the environment and didn't mind enduring freezing temperatures without a hat to prove it (predecessor William Hague had never recovered from being pictured with a baseball cap in the early days of his leadership so headgear was banned on Mr Cameron's Arctic trip). He never promised us a rose garden. But that's what we got when David Cameron stunned Westminster by making a ""big, open and comprehensive"" offer to the Liberal Democrats on the morning after a May 2010 general election that nobody won. The bloom-filled Downing Street garden was the venue for the first press conference with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg after four days of frantic deal-making and intrigue. The body language, as Mr Cameron joshed with Mr Clegg over the insults they had hurled at each other in the past, was good. Britain didn't do coalitions - it had never been tried since World War Two - but this looked like it might just work. Despite the doubters it did last all the way to the 2015 election. David Cameron's ability to look and sound prime ministerial when the occasion demanded it was one of his biggest strengths. It was never more evident than during his Commons statement on the Bloody Sunday inquiry in June 2010, which drew praise from across the political spectrum. He described the findings of the Saville Report into the shooting dead of 13 marchers on 30 January 1972 in Londonderry as ""shocking"" - an action that was ""unjustified"" and ""unjustifiable"", and for which he was ""deeply sorry"". His statement in 2012 on Hillsborough and his reaction after the April 2016 inquest verdicts earned similar plaudits. This video can not be played Cameron and Sarkozy were greeted as heroes as they visited a hospital in Libya Libya was David Cameron's first, and in terms of its long-lasting impact arguably most disastrous, foreign policy intervention. He had pushed a reluctant US President Barack Obama to come to the aid of rebel fighters attempting to topple Colonel Gaddafi and help impose a no-fly zone over Libya. Mr Cameron  was greeted as a hero when he visited Libya with then French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in September 2011, after Gaddafi had been ousted. He pledged not to allow Libya to turn into another Iraq, but critics say that is exactly what happened, as it it rapidly descended into violence. It was one of David Cameron's proudest achievements as prime minister. On 21 May, 2013, MPs voted to allow same-sex couples in England and Wales, who could already hold civil ceremonies, to marry. For Mr Cameron it sent a powerful signal of the kind of tolerant, inclusive country he said he wanted Britain to be - but it cost him dear in terms of lost support from grassroots Conservatives, many of whom could not accept it. After years of rejecting calls from his own MPs for a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, Mr Cameron dramatically announced, in a speech at financial wire service Bloomberg in January 2013, that he would hold one if he won the next election, after first renegotiating the UK's membership of the 28-nation bloc. It was the biggest gamble of his political career, made against the backdrop of Eurosceptic rebels in the Tory party demanding a vote and evidence that traditional Conservative voters were heading to the UK Independence Party. As they say in politics,  it kicked the can down the road and arguably helped him win the 2015 election. But it was also the vote that ended his career. This video can not be played David Cameron: ""It is clear to me that the British parliament...does not want to see British military action"" In August 2013, David Cameron became the first prime minister in more than 100 years to lose a Commons vote on military action. It seemed to be a devastating blow to his authority. He had failed to persuade enough MPs, including many on his own side, that Britain should take part in air strikes against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""I strongly believe in the need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons, but I also believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons,"" he said minutes after the result was announced. Mr Cameron held more referendums than any British prime minister. He easily won the first one in 2011, opposing his deputy PM's bid to change Britain's voting system, but the September 2014 Scottish independence referendum provoked the biggest panic of his first term in office. As polling day approached, he was forced to cancel Prime Minister's Questions and rush north of the border in an effort to save the Union, with an impassioned speech at the HQ of Scottish Widows in Edinburgh, when a poll suggested the Yes campaign would win. He was later forced to issue an apology to the Queen, after he was overheard telling New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg Her Majesty had ""purred down the line"" when he informed her that Scotland had rejected independence. In the space of two minutes everything changed. The BBC exit poll predicting the Conservatives would be close to gaining a majority of seats stunned everybody, including, we must assume, David Cameron, who the polls had been suggesting could lose to Labour or have to form another coalition with the Lib Dems. Mr Cameron had been criticised for running a negative, fear-based campaign, but it had succeeded. The pledge to hold an EU referendum if elected also helped gain votes. He formed the first majority Conservative government since 1992 - a personal triumph that would prove to be remarkably short-lived. This video can not be played EU vote: David Cameron says the UK ""needs fresh leadership"" Mr Cameron had staked everything on his ability to persuade the country to vote to remain in the EU, before realising at a late stage in the campaign that it might not be enough. His tone grew more desperate as he contemplated going down in history as the PM who took Britain out of the EU. Despite insisting he would stay on as PM whatever the result, he announced his departure in an emotional statement in Downing Street within hours of the result becoming clear, with wife Samantha at his side.

Felicity Huffman faces sentencing for college scam,"This video can not be played Felicity Huffman leaves court after being sentenced to 14 days in prison US actress Felicity Huffman has been sentenced to 14 days in prison for her involvement in a college admissions scandal. The Desperate Housewives star admitted to paying $15,000 (Â£11,500) to have her daughter's exam answers secretly corrected in 2017. She must also do 250 hours of community service and pay a $30,000 fine. Parents and athletics coaches were among 50 people charged in the scheme, but none of the children were indicted. ""There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period,"" Huffman said in a statement after her sentencing. ""I would like to apologise again to my daughter, my husband, my family and the educational community for my actions. ""And I especially want to apologise to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices supporting their children."" Judge Indira Talwani said she believes Huffman has accepted full responsibility for her actions, but ""trying to be a good mother does not excuse"" what she did. She must report to prison in six weeks. Prosecutors had asked for a month in prison and a $20,000 fine. How much difference does going to a top US university make? Celebrity parents and the bizarre 'cheating' scandal Exams whizz at centre of US cheat scandal The parents charged in the college scam investigation allegedly paid bribes, had exams altered, and even had their children edited into stock photos to fake sporting talents on applications. Prosecutors say they managed to fraudulently secure spots for the teenagers at elite US universities including Yale, Georgetown and Stanford. Huffman pleaded guilty to mail and honest services fraud in May. She is the first parent sentenced in the scandal. This video can not be played Five things to know about the college admissions scandal Her legal team had asked for a year of probation in lieu of jail time, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine. But prosecutors wrote in a memo last week that ""neither probation nor home confinement (in a large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool) would constitute meaningful punishment or deter others from committing similar crimes"". Huffman worked with the scam's confessed mastermind, William Singer, to falsify a college entrance exam score for her oldest daughter, Sophia Macy. Singer arranged for Sophia to take her SAT test in a special location, an exam widely used for college admissions in the US. Her result was a major improvement on her previous score. In a letter to Judge Talwani, Huffman wrote: ""In my desperation to be a good mother I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot."" ""I see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair. I have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter and failed my family."" Huffman said in her letter to the judge that her daughter had been unaware of the fraud, and was devastated to learn of it. This video can not be played Students react to cheating scam: ""This is how we got into an elite college"" The actress wrote: ""When my daughter looked at me and asked me with tears streaming down her face, 'Why didn't you believe in me? Why didn't you think I could do it on my own?' I had no adequate answer for her. ""I could only say, 'I am sorry. I was frightened and I was stupid.' In my blind panic, I have done the exact thing that I was desperate to avoid. ""I have compromised my daughter's future, the wholeness of my family and my own integrity."" Prosecutors said Huffman made arrangements to have Singer cheat for her younger daughter as well before deciding against it. Huffman's husband - actor William H Macy - also had contact with Singer, though Mr Macy was spared charges. Though Huffman was among the most high-profile figures indicted, she paid among the smallest sums allegedly doled out by the parents charged in the scandal, according to court documents. Lori Loughlin, another Hollywood actress ensnared in the scandal along with her husband, has pleaded not guilty to paying $500,000 in bribes to have their daughters accepted to the University of Southern California as members of the rowing team.

New UK energy giant created in SSE-Ovo dealThe transfer of 3.5 million SSE customers will make Ovo the UK's second largest energy firm.Business,"Ovo is set to become the UK's second largest energy supplier after it agreed to buy SSE's retail business for Â£500m. Ovo - which was created 10 years ago - is already the UK's largest independent energy supplier, with 1.5 million customers and about 2,000 employees. But it will now take on SSE's 3.5 million customers and 8,000 staff, making it second only to British Gas. SSE said,externalit would ""do all it can to ensure a smooth transition for customers and employees"". The deal is expected to be completed in late 2019 or early 2020. SSE - one of the Big Six energy suppliers - said there would be no immediate impact on customers after completion. It added that the SSE brand would be operated by Ovo under licence for a period, ""allowing time for a phased and carefully managed migration and continued high standards of customer service"". Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, said Ovo's deal to buy SSE's business ""will enhance the ever-growing competition for customers"". ""The likes of Ovo, Shell, Bulb and Octopus mean there's a base of emerging suppliers who are continuing to challenge the Big Six in the domestic energy market."" Ovo chief Stephen Fitzpatrick said the two business were a ""great fit"" SSE had announced in May that it planned to offload its energy services division after more than 500,000 households switched to a new supplier in the year to April. The company said it would sell or float its energy services arm by the second half of 2020. In November last year, a proposed merger of SSE's household supply arm with rival Npower was called off, with SSEblaming ""very challenging market conditions"". The introduction of the energy price cap by the government had led SSE and Npower to renegotiate their planned tie-up, but they failed to agree a deal. Announcing the sale of the business to Ovo, SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: ""We have long believed that a dedicated, focused and independent retailer will ultimately best serve customers, employees and other stakeholders - and this is an excellent opportunity to make that happen. ""I'm confident that this is the best outcome for the SSE Energy Services business."" The founder and chief executive of Ovo, Stephen Fitzpatrick, described the deal as a ""significant moment for the energy industry"". ""SSE and Ovo are a great fit. They share our values on sustainability and serving customers. They've built an excellent team that I'm really looking forward to working with.""

(Video from 2017) This would involve the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU for an indefinite period, keeping all of the UK in a ""temporary customs territory"" with the EU and seeing Northern Ireland also continuing to follow other EU rules. That means that goods coming into Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK would need to be checked to see if they meet EU standards. Those arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they were no longer necessary. The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. But MPs rejected that backstop when they voted down the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May. The DUP opposed it, saying it would create a border down the Irish Sea and risk the future of the union.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is committed to getting rid of the backstop, describing it as divisive and anti-democratic.

The backstop is intended to stop the need for checks on the Irish border after Brexit The EU has a strict rule that products from a non-member state must be checked at the point of entry. And many trade experts suggest the only way to prevent those checks at the Irish border would be for the two parts of the island to have the same standards. In effect, that would mean Northern Ireland would have to continue to follow EU standards. And that would mean some food products coming from elsewhere in the UK would be subject to new checks and controls at Northern Ireland ports. In fact, the island of Ireland is already a single zone for animal health, which means all livestock coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain is checked on entry. But the Irish government is sceptical about the proposal, with the Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar saying it was not enough on its own. ""We would need a single Irish economic zone, or whatever you would like to call it, to cover more than agriculture and food,"" he said. On Friday, Mr Varadkar said the gap between the UK and the European Union in Brexit talks was ""very wide"" and that British proposals for the Irish border fell ""very far short"" of what was needed. The DUP had been propping up the Conservatives in a confidence-and-supply pact since June 2017, with the votes of its 10 MPs giving the government a majority to get legislation passed in Parliament.

Customers in the dark over pawnbroker closures,"Customers of a High Street pawnbroker are being left in the dark after branches were closed and calls unanswered. A&B Pawnbrokers (Albemarle & Bond) and Herbert Brown stores have closed their doors, while its website says ""this store"" has ceased trading. Owner Speedloan Finance told the BBC all its 116 stores had been closed because of ""significant losses"". The firm said it was ""exploring options available to it"". These included finding a buyer for some or all of the stores, it said. ""Speedloan is due to enter into a period of consultation with employees concerning its proposal and has in the meantime offered its employees voluntary redundancy,"" it added. The pawnbrokers' trade body hit out at the firm's unanswered helpline. ""Their decision to downscale UK operations is a strategic matter for the company but [we have] expressed concern that the communication of their actions to their customers falls below the standards expected of its members,"" the National Pawnbrokers Association (NPA) said. ""In particular, we are most unhappy with the fact that customers cannot get through to the helpline. We have demanded that the management of the company resolve this as a matter of urgency."" Katie Prescott, business reporter Industry insiders are shocked at the way Albemarle & Bond has handled its abrupt closure. Many say that moving the pledges (the goods secured against the loan) to a central location is unfair, as most of their customers like to deal with things in their local branch. One said that many of these clients don't have easy access to standard forms of credit, explaining that one option offered by A&B, to pay their loan online using a debit card, was often not appropriate, although they can also use cash in a NatWest branch. The main concern now is what happens to those customers. The BBC understands from a source close to one of the UK's biggest pawnbroker chains, Harvey & Thompson, that they are talking to A&B about the situation and are making every effort to offer their support and help for customers and staff. However, what that support looks like is yet unclear. It's a sentiment echoed by the National Pawnbrokers Association. Albemarle & Bond has a chequered history. Business boomed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, but it fell victim to a plunging gold price. In 2013, it announced it was melting down gold in order to pay its debts. A few months later, it fell into administration. It changed hands twice, to be bought in 2015 by the Japanese pawnbroking company Daikokuya Holdings. In 2016, it was given a Â£10m cash injection from the investment firm Gordon Brothers. Four years on and it is once again on the market. Its latest set of accounts show that it lost Â£3.3m last year - as against Â£1.6m the year before. Pawnbrokers allow customers to offer something valuable as security for a loan, or buy items such as jewellery and antiques. They lend money quickly, but usually at a worse rate than banks. Stores also often offer other financial services such as currency exchange and buying gold. How much will you give me for my false teeth? The company said that any items pawned in A&B stores will be transferred to a central store, and can be redeemed or sold through this operation. ""If your items are expired or due to expire, please note we will not take any action with your items until we speak to you,""the website said,external. ""Unfortunately, we were unable to contact all customers prior to the closure date. We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused."" Letters have been sent by Albemarle & Bond, which was established in 1840, to customers as stores closed. The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said it was aware that companies operated by Speedloan had closed stores. ""We are engaging with the firm and asking them to ensure this process is carried out in an orderly manner and to minimise disruption to Speedloan's customers,"" the FCA said. Speedloan said it was keeping the FCA informed. The Financial Ombudsman Service said it had received calls from frustrated customers unable to get through to the company and were worried about their items. Customers can contact the company on 01865 798114, which is a dedicated hotline, or by email at info@albemarlebond.com. If customers are not happy with the response from the company, they can contact the Financial Ombudsman Service to complain on 0800 023 4567, or the FCA customer helpline on 0800 111 6768. Customer ""pledges"" an item, such as a gold ring for a set period of time, usually six months Pawnbroker gives 50% to 60% of the item's value as a cash loan Customer pays 7% to 8% interest every month An item can be redeemed during the loan period by paying back the original loan and any interest up to that point If the customer cannot repay the loan at the end of the deal the pawnbroker sells the item and returns any surplus to the customer More information is available from theNational Pawnbrokers Association,external.

Why your smart meter may not be so smart after allNearly a third of all energy companies fitting smart meters are still installing old technology.BusinessComments,"First-generation or second-generation technology? It may depend on where you live Nearly a third of all energy companies fitting smart meters are still installing old technology. Government guidance says that since the middle of March 2019 customers should only have been given second generation smart meters. However, eight companies still installing first generation smart meters say the network is not reliable enough to switch customers on to. They say this is particularly a problem in northern England and Scotland. The auto-switching service Look After My Bills has discovered that Bristol Energy, British Gas, Ecotricity, EON and Octopus are still installing some first generation meters in the North, and Nabuh Energy, Simplicity and Utilita are only installing the first generation after encountering difficulties with the new system. The second generation of meters is supposed to be able to connect remotely to a national network, which should make switching supplier possible, for the first time for many customers. When contacted by the BBC, the companies emphasised that the issues were industry-wide problems. ""We are not ignoring government guidance,"" said a spokesperson for Ecotricity. ""In fact it's clear that in documented instances where a SMETS2 meter cannot be used, or in areas where connection is not possible, we are encouraged to use SMETS1, or non-smart meters."" Two different contracts were given out by the government to install those networks. The Southern Communications Network is being run on pre-existing mobile technology, while the Northern Communications Network is being run via specialist radio signal. A number of the companies claim that problems with the signal in that Northern Communications Network mean that they cannot reliably connect customers to it. Therefore customers living in the South of England and Wales are much more likely to receive a second generation meter, than those living in the North of England and Scotland. Octopus energy said the priority was to ensure customers' needs were met. ""Where a second generation meter can be reliably installed and commissioned, we'll do that,"" the firm said. ""Otherwise we'll offer customers the choice between first generation or waiting until second generation is available."" Some firms also highlighted problems with the connection in high-rise flats and for those on pre-payment meters. The company responsible for the operation of the data networks across the UK, Smart DCC, said thousands of second generation meters were being installed in the North every day. ""DCC is supporting the energy industry as it rolls out second-generation smart meters across the country,"" it said. ""There are now more than two million operating on our smart, secure network,"" Smart DCC said. Utilita supplies energy almost exclusively to pre-payment customers. The firm said it is waiting for the result of a judicial review into government policy, as it says companies should not be compelled to install the new meters. Utilita believes the new system has significant connectivity problems and ""provides a vastly inferior service for pay-as-you-go customers, many of whom are vulnerable"". Bristol Energy said any installations of SMETS1 meters since March have been because customers are on pre-payment meters. ""As part of our social purpose, we have a fair proportion of customers who are in this payment category,"" it said. British Gas agrees, adding there ""have been some industry-wide delays with the infrastructure for SMETS2 pre-payment meters which means we're not yet installing SMETS2 to all of these customers."" Simplicity energy said it is waiting for the first generation meters to have an upgrade, rather than install the newer version, which it believes will happen shortly. The firm said: ""Our strategy is to complete our roll-out programme and run down our stocks of SMETS1 meters to avoid them becoming landfill."" Any first-generation meters installed after 15 March 2019 do not count towards the companies' smart meter roll-out obligations, and the regulator, Ofgem, could take enforcement action against any company not meeting those obligations. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said ""the network for the North is fully operational, with thousands of second generation meters being installed every day. ""Smart meters provide a much better service for customers over traditional meters. This is particularly the case for pre-payment customers by cutting costs,"" it added.

"YouTube adverts run next to fake cancer cure videosThe video site's algorithm promotes medical misinformation in a number of languages, the BBC finds.","This video can not be played Prof Justin Stebbing from Imperial College London looks at some of the cancer claims the BBC found in YouTube videos YouTube's algorithm promotes fake cancer cures in a number of languages and the site runs adverts for major brands and universities next to misleading videos, a BBC investigation has found. Searching YouTube across 10 languages, the BBC found more than 80 videos containing health misinformation - mainly bogus cancer cures. Ten of the videos found had more than a million views. Many were accompanied by adverts. The unproven ""cures"" often involved consuming specific substances, such as turmeric or baking soda. Juice diets or extreme fasting were also common themes. Some YouTubers advocated drinking donkey's milk or boiling water. None of the so-called cures offered are clinically proven to treat cancer. Appearing before the fake cancer cure videos were adverts for well-known brands including Samsung, Heinz and Clinique. YouTube's advertising system means that both the Google-owned company and the video makers are making money from the misleading clips. Khawla Aissane, speaking in Arabic on her YouTube channel, suggested donkey's milk could stop the activity of cancer cells In January, YouTube announced they would be ""reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful waysâsuch as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness."" But the company said the change would initially only affect recommendations of a very small set of videos in the United States, and does not apply in languages other than English. The BBC search covered English, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Persian, Hindi, German, Ukrainian, French and Italian. We found, for example, that in Russian, a simple search for ""cancer treatment"" leads to videos advocating drinking baking soda. Watching these videos in turn led to recommendations for other unproven ""treatments"" such as carrot juice or extreme fasting. Erin McAweeney, a research analyst at the Data & Society institute, explained that because YouTube's algorithm recommends similar videos to the ones you have just watched, it is continuously ""carving a path"" from one video to the next, regardless of the credibility of the advice offered within. ""Someone can start out on a credible video and be suggested to watch a juice cure video next. A recommendation system doesn't know credible from non-credible content."" McAweeney says. YouTube has stated that its recommendation system - which has been accused of leading users down rabbit holes ofconspiracy theoriesand radicalisation - would change, recommending videos that are credible and trustworthy to people that are watching videos that might not be. YouTube's Community Guidelines ban harmful content including: ""Promoting dangerous remedies or cures: content which claims that harmful substances or treatments can have health benefits."" Many of the fake cancer cures the BBC found, such as juicing, were not in themselves harmful, but could indirectly damage a cancer sufferer's health - for instance, if they neglect conventional medical approaches in favour of the so-called cures. Many Brazilian YouTubers, including Elizeu Correia, advocated eating exotic plants to treat cancer, such as bitter gourd. Researchers from BBC Monitoring and BBC News Brasil were served a range of adverts before the fake cure videos. In addition to Samsung, Heinz and Clinique, the BBC saw adverts for travel website Booking.com and writing app Grammarly, for Hollywood films, and for British universities including the University of East Anglia and the University of Gloucestershire. All of the ads appeared alongside potentially harmful misinformation. The companies and universities distanced themselves from the misleading content. Samsung said the campaign they were running had ""no connection or correlation"" with the fake cancer cure video that ran after it. ""Samsung follows and insists on the highest brand safety guidelines on all advertising platforms it uses,"" the company said in a statement. Kraft Heinz said that it ""has a number of both automated and human controls continuously in place to ensure we avoid our advertising running with inappropriate content. ""This particular instance is concerning to us and we have taken steps to block this channel."" YouTube: 'We don't take you down the rabbit hole' What happens when you get health advice on Instagram? US couple lose child custody over chemo refusal Grammarly, a company whose adverts appeared 20 times alongside fake cancer cure videos views by BBC researchers, said: ""Upon learning of this, we immediately contacted YouTube to pull our ads from any such channels and to ensure the ads will not appear alongside content promulgating misinformation."" Clinique owner Estee Lauder and Booking.com did not respond to requests for comment. The two universities said that their adverts appeared next to misleading videos just once each, and that the channels were blocked from their advertising campaigns after being contacted by the BBC. The University of East Anglia, which has its own cancer research programme, said: ""No payment was made by the university [specifically for the advert which ran next to the fake cure video] and we have contacted Google to ensure that placement does not happen again."" The University of Gloucestershire said: ""When advertising on YouTube, content changes quickly and even the most attentive human and technological effort can require constant diligence. As such we are continuously working with Google to ensure this type of placement doesn't occur again."" Adverts on YouTube can be targeted to particular regions or audiences. The systems that determine which ad to show to which person at which time are complicated, explains Tim Schmoyer, founder of the YouTube consultancy Video Creators. ""YouTube optimizes the experience to show the right ads to the right people at the right time in order to minimize abandonment from the platform and provide most value to the advertiser, creator, and to themselves, of course,"" he says. YouTube also has the power to ""demonetise"" certain channels - in other words, to prevent video makers from making any revenue from advertising. The site has made moves to demonetise channels which spread anti-vaccine misinformation, for example. Demonitising may prevent video makers from making money, but it does not necessarily prevent their videos from going viral, according to McAweeney from Data & Society, who says that ""no evidence shows that demonetising solves the issue of audience size and reach"". ""There are many motivations behind spreading health misinformation and disinformation, money is only one among them,"" she says. ""In most cases, getting attention and views on a video is more valuable for these actors than the money it generates."" Efimova Tatyana, who advocated a baking soda treatment, removed her video after the BBC contacted her The BBC passed on details of the fake cure videos to YouTube, and they have so far demonetised over 70 of the videos for breaching their monetisation policy. The BBC also contacted the creators of five of the videos. One Russian YouTuber, Tatyana Efimova, who advocated the baking soda ""cure"", made clear in her video that she is not a doctor. She said that she was telling a personal story of someone she knew and that it is up to viewers to decide whether to take baking soda or not. After being contacted by the BBC she removed the video and said: ""It is not that important for me."" Elizeu Correia, a Brazilian YouTuber, said his video claiming that bitter gourd tea can fight tumours ""is not about a dangerous or poisonous tea"". He then made the video private, so it is not available to view to the general public. Shunyakal, a Hindi-language media organisation, didn't respond directly to the BBC's request for comment, but their video about a non-medical cancer treatment centre was removed from their public channel after we contacted them. Before its removal, it had been viewed more than 1.4 million times. The BBC also contacted Khawla Aissane, who promoted donkey's milk as a cure, but she didn't respond. YouTube declined a request for an interview. In a statement the company said: ""Misinformation is a difficult challenge, and we have taken a number of steps to address this including showing more authoritative content on medical issues, showing information panels with credible sources, and removing ads from videos that promote harmful health claims.

YouTube adverts run next to fake cancer cure videos,"This video can not be played Prof Justin Stebbing from Imperial College London looks at some of the cancer claims the BBC found in YouTube videos YouTube's algorithm promotes fake cancer cures in a number of languages and the site runs adverts for major brands and universities next to misleading videos, a BBC investigation has found. Searching YouTube across 10 languages, the BBC found more than 80 videos containing health misinformation - mainly bogus cancer cures. Ten of the videos found had more than a million views. Many were accompanied by adverts. The unproven ""cures"" often involved consuming specific substances, such as turmeric or baking soda. Juice diets or extreme fasting were also common themes. Some YouTubers advocated drinking donkey's milk or boiling water. None of the so-called cures offered are clinically proven to treat cancer. Appearing before the fake cancer cure videos were adverts for well-known brands including Samsung, Heinz and Clinique. YouTube's advertising system means that both the Google-owned company and the video makers are making money from the misleading clips. Khawla Aissane, speaking in Arabic on her YouTube channel, suggested donkey's milk could stop the activity of cancer cells In January, YouTube announced they would be ""reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful waysâsuch as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness."" But the company said the change would initially only affect recommendations of a very small set of videos in the United States, and does not apply in languages other than English. The BBC search covered English, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Persian, Hindi, German, Ukrainian, French and Italian. We found, for example, that in Russian, a simple search for ""cancer treatment"" leads to videos advocating drinking baking soda. Watching these videos in turn led to recommendations for other unproven ""treatments"" such as carrot juice or extreme fasting. Erin McAweeney, a research analyst at the Data & Society institute, explained that because YouTube's algorithm recommends similar videos to the ones you have just watched, it is continuously ""carving a path"" from one video to the next, regardless of the credibility of the advice offered within. ""Someone can start out on a credible video and be suggested to watch a juice cure video next. A recommendation system doesn't know credible from non-credible content."" McAweeney says. YouTube has stated that its recommendation system - which has been accused of leading users down rabbit holes ofconspiracy theoriesand radicalisation - would change, recommending videos that are credible and trustworthy to people that are watching videos that might not be. YouTube's Community Guidelines ban harmful content including: ""Promoting dangerous remedies or cures: content which claims that harmful substances or treatments can have health benefits."" Many of the fake cancer cures the BBC found, such as juicing, were not in themselves harmful, but could indirectly damage a cancer sufferer's health - for instance, if they neglect conventional medical approaches in favour of the so-called cures. Many Brazilian YouTubers, including Elizeu Correia, advocated eating exotic plants to treat cancer, such as bitter gourd. Researchers from BBC Monitoring and BBC News Brasil were served a range of adverts before the fake cure videos. In addition to Samsung, Heinz and Clinique, the BBC saw adverts for travel website Booking.com and writing app Grammarly, for Hollywood films, and for British universities including the University of East Anglia and the University of Gloucestershire. All of the ads appeared alongside potentially harmful misinformation. The companies and universities distanced themselves from the misleading content. Samsung said the campaign they were running had ""no connection or correlation"" with the fake cancer cure video that ran after it. ""Samsung follows and insists on the highest brand safety guidelines on all advertising platforms it uses,"" the company said in a statement. Kraft Heinz said that it ""has a number of both automated and human controls continuously in place to ensure we avoid our advertising running with inappropriate content. ""This particular instance is concerning to us and we have taken steps to block this channel."" YouTube: 'We don't take you down the rabbit hole' What happens when you get health advice on Instagram? US couple lose child custody over chemo refusal Grammarly, a company whose adverts appeared 20 times alongside fake cancer cure videos views by BBC researchers, said: ""Upon learning of this, we immediately contacted YouTube to pull our ads from any such channels and to ensure the ads will not appear alongside content promulgating misinformation."" Clinique owner Estee Lauder and Booking.com did not respond to requests for comment. The two universities said that their adverts appeared next to misleading videos just once each, and that the channels were blocked from their advertising campaigns after being contacted by the BBC. The University of East Anglia, which has its own cancer research programme, said: ""No payment was made by the university [specifically for the advert which ran next to the fake cure video] and we have contacted Google to ensure that placement does not happen again."" The University of Gloucestershire said: ""When advertising on YouTube, content changes quickly and even the most attentive human and technological effort can require constant diligence. As such we are continuously working with Google to ensure this type of placement doesn't occur again."" Adverts on YouTube can be targeted to particular regions or audiences. The systems that determine which ad to show to which person at which time are complicated, explains Tim Schmoyer, founder of the YouTube consultancy Video Creators. ""YouTube optimizes the experience to show the right ads to the right people at the right time in order to minimize abandonment from the platform and provide most value to the advertiser, creator, and to themselves, of course,"" he says. YouTube also has the power to ""demonetise"" certain channels - in other words, to prevent video makers from making any revenue from advertising. The site has made moves to demonetise channels which spread anti-vaccine misinformation, for example. Demonitising may prevent video makers from making money, but it does not necessarily prevent their videos from going viral, according to McAweeney from Data & Society, who says that ""no evidence shows that demonetising solves the issue of audience size and reach"". ""There are many motivations behind spreading health misinformation and disinformation, money is only one among them,"" she says. ""In most cases, getting attention and views on a video is more valuable for these actors than the money it generates."" Efimova Tatyana, who advocated a baking soda treatment, removed her video after the BBC contacted her The BBC passed on details of the fake cure videos to YouTube, and they have so far demonetised over 70 of the videos for breaching their monetisation policy. The BBC also contacted the creators of five of the videos. One Russian YouTuber, Tatyana Efimova, who advocated the baking soda ""cure"", made clear in her video that she is not a doctor. She said that she was telling a personal story of someone she knew and that it is up to viewers to decide whether to take baking soda or not. After being contacted by the BBC she removed the video and said: ""It is not that important for me."" Elizeu Correia, a Brazilian YouTuber, said his video claiming that bitter gourd tea can fight tumours ""is not about a dangerous or poisonous tea"". He then made the video private, so it is not available to view to the general public. Shunyakal, a Hindi-language media organisation, didn't respond directly to the BBC's request for comment, but their video about a non-medical cancer treatment centre was removed from their public channel after we contacted them. Before its removal, it had been viewed more than 1.4 million times. The BBC also contacted Khawla Aissane, who promoted donkey's milk as a cure, but she didn't respond. YouTube declined a request for an interview. In a statement the company said: ""Misinformation is a difficult challenge, and we have taken a number of steps to address this including showing more authoritative content on medical issues, showing information panels with credible sources, and removing ads from videos that promote harmful health claims. ""Our systems are not perfect but we're constantly making improvements, and we remain committed to progress in this space."" Some YouTube videos found in the BBC's research included caveats about the need to seek professional medical advice, but many promoted their cures as an alternative to conventional cancer treatments.

Why your smart meter may not be so smart after all,"First-generation or second-generation technology? It may depend on where you live Nearly a third of all energy companies fitting smart meters are still installing old technology. Government guidance says that since the middle of March 2019 customers should only have been given second generation smart meters. However, eight companies still installing first generation smart meters say the network is not reliable enough to switch customers on to. They say this is particularly a problem in northern England and Scotland. The auto-switching service Look After My Bills has discovered that Bristol Energy, British Gas, Ecotricity, EON and Octopus are still installing some first generation meters in the North, and Nabuh Energy, Simplicity and Utilita are only installing the first generation after encountering difficulties with the new system. The second generation of meters is supposed to be able to connect remotely to a national network, which should make switching supplier possible, for the first time for many customers. When contacted by the BBC, the companies emphasised that the issues were industry-wide problems. ""We are not ignoring government guidance,"" said a spokesperson for Ecotricity. ""In fact it's clear that in documented instances where a SMETS2 meter cannot be used, or in areas where connection is not possible, we are encouraged to use SMETS1, or non-smart meters."" Two different contracts were given out by the government to install those networks. The Southern Communications Network is being run on pre-existing mobile technology, while the Northern Communications Network is being run via specialist radio signal. A number of the companies claim that problems with the signal in that Northern Communications Network mean that they cannot reliably connect customers to it. Therefore customers living in the South of England and Wales are much more likely to receive a second generation meter, than those living in the North of England and Scotland. Octopus energy said the priority was to ensure customers' needs were met. ""Where a second generation meter can be reliably installed and commissioned, we'll do that,"" the firm said. ""Otherwise we'll offer customers the choice between first generation or waiting until second generation is available."" Some firms also highlighted problems with the connection in high-rise flats and for those on pre-payment meters. The company responsible for the operation of the data networks across the UK, Smart DCC, said thousands of second generation meters were being installed in the North every day. ""DCC is supporting the energy industry as it rolls out second-generation smart meters across the country,"" it said. ""There are now more than two million operating on our smart, secure network,"" Smart DCC said. Utilita supplies energy almost exclusively to pre-payment customers. The firm said it is waiting for the result of a judicial review into government policy, as it says companies should not be compelled to install the new meters. Utilita believes the new system has significant connectivity problems and ""provides a vastly inferior service for pay-as-you-go customers, many of whom are vulnerable"". Bristol Energy said any installations of SMETS1 meters since March have been because customers are on pre-payment meters. ""As part of our social purpose, we have a fair proportion of customers who are in this payment category,"" it said. British Gas agrees, adding there ""have been some industry-wide delays with the infrastructure for SMETS2 pre-payment meters which means we're not yet installing SMETS2 to all of these customers."" Simplicity energy said it is waiting for the first generation meters to have an upgrade, rather than install the newer version, which it believes will happen shortly. The firm said: ""Our strategy is to complete our roll-out programme and run down our stocks of SMETS1 meters to avoid them becoming landfill."" Any first-generation meters installed after 15 March 2019 do not count towards the companies' smart meter roll-out obligations, and the regulator, Ofgem, could take enforcement action against any company not meeting those obligations. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said ""the network for the North is fully operational, with thousands of second generation meters being installed every day. ""Smart meters provide a much better service for customers over traditional meters. This is particularly the case for pre-payment customers by cutting costs,"" it added.

Sainsbury's pledges to halve plastic by 2025The supermarket is asking the public for ideas on how best to reduce its packaging.Business,"Sainsbury's has become the latest supermarket to target packaging waste, pledging to halve the amount of plastic used in its stores by 2025. Its customers will have to change their behaviour to achieve the ""bold ambition"" it said, for example by buying milk in plastic pouches. It is also inviting the public and business partners to submit new ideas. ""Reducing plastic and packaging is not easy,"" said Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive. ""We can't do this on our own and we will be asking our suppliers and our customers to work with us."" Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing? MPssaid this week,externalreducing packaging should be the priority for retailers, rather than replacing plastic with compostable or recyclable alternatives. The infrastructure is not in place in the UK to dispose of compostable or biodegradable materials effectively, parliament's committee for environment, food and rural affairs found. The committee said wider environmental considerations also needed to be taken into account when replacing plastic packaging, including its carbon footprint. On Friday, Sainsbury's is meeting with food manufacturers, packaging suppliers, material scientists and the waste and recycling industry to kick-start the process of identifying new solutions. However the supermarket said it was already rolling out some measures, including removing all plastic bags from its fruit and veg sections by the end of this month. Instead customers will be invited to bring their own bags, buy reusable bags made from recycled plastic bottles, or put a price sticker onto loose items. Sainsbury's will sell reusable bags for fresh produce The supermarket considered introducing paper bags, but spokeswoman, Rebecca Reilly said the net impact would have been worse for the environment. ""There's the deforestation link, and they are heavier and bulkier [than plastic]. They take up space in transport, so there are knock-on carbon emissions,"" she said. Sainsbury's will encourage customers to bring their own containers for products from shampoo to raw meat and fish, and will sell more products loose by weight, something Waitrose began trialling earlier this year. In many areas it was a question of reducing plastic rather than eliminating it, suggested Ms Reilly. For example milk might be sold in pouches, using less plastic than the current bottles. But Helen Bird from packaging campaign group, Wrap, said plastic milk bottles were one of the items being widely recycled in the UK. Plastic pouches aren't currently recyclable, she said, although they would probably produce lower carbon emissions. But she praised the scale of Sainsbury's ambition and said accepting that it did not yet have all the answers was a sensible approach to the challenge ahead. ""We need to not take decisions like this lightly,"" she said. ""To achieve this they'll need significant levels of innovation. ""They'll also require suppliers to come to them with fresh business models for how they can deliver products to customers in a way that will not have a significant effect on prices as well as carbon and food waste implications.""

DUP denies changing position on BrexitThe Times says the party has agreed to drop its objections to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea.Northern Ireland,"Arlene Foster said the DUP would not accept arrangements that create a barrier to east-west trade The DUP leader has rejectedreports the party is prepared to abide by some European rules,externalafter Brexit. The unionist party had agreed ""to shift its red lines"" as part of a new deal to replace the backstop, said The Times newspaper, citing unidentified sources. It added the party had said privately that it would drop its objections to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea. Arlene Foster tweeted the ""UK must leave as one nation"" and ""anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories"".

The party's Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson dismissed the story as ""bad journalism"", saying it went against ""all of what has been said in recent days"". The DUP had already said it might accept certain European regulations that were ""essential to the operation of industry in Northern Ireland and which don't impact with our relationship with our main market in Great Britain"" - if those were considered by the Northern Ireland Assembly. ""We're a unionist party - we're not going vote for any arrangement which makes us different than the rest of the United Kingdom and forms a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom,"" said Mr Wilson on Friday. There would be a need for checks at the Irish Sea if Northern Ireland remained aligned to some EU rules but the rest of the UK did not - the so-called ""Northern Ireland-only backstop"". These could take two forms: Customs- to make sure the right EU tariffs have been paid Regulatory- to make sure goods meet EU safety and quality standards The government has been adamant it would never accept Irish Sea customs checks. But it has also been careful not to completely close down the prospect of regulatory checks. Mrs Foster has said the DUP would not support a Brexit deal that could lead to any new checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK. However,the party has previously suggested it could be open to the idea of an all-Ireland food standards zone, which would require certain checks at ports and airports in Northern Ireland. The backstop is the insurance policy to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit, unless and until another solution is found. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue Early in the Brexit negotiations the idea of a backstop that only applied to Northern Ireland was suggested. That would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - which at the time propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to that. It said it would not accept any additional Northern Ireland-only checks because it was concerned any differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain could threaten the union. Instead, the idea of a backstop covering the whole UK was adopted. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) This would involve the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU for an indefinite period, keeping all of the UK in a ""temporary customs territory"" with the EU and seeing Northern Ireland also continuing to follow other EU rules. That means that goods coming into Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK would need to be checked to see if they meet EU standards. Those arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they were no longer necessary. The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. But MPs rejected that backstop when they voted down the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May. The DUP opposed it, saying it would create a border down the Irish Sea and risk the future of the union. On Thursday, the head of the European Parliament said he was willing torevisit the proposal of a Northern Ireland-only backstop to break the Brexit deadlock. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is committed to getting rid of the backstop, describing it as divisive and anti-democratic. The UK government has floated the idea of a single zone on the island of Ireland for food standards. The backstop is intended to stop the need for checks on the Irish border after Brexit The EU has a strict rule that products from a non-member state must be checked at the point of entry. And many trade experts suggest the only way to prevent those checks at the Irish border would be for the two parts of the island to have the same standards. In effect, that would mean Northern Ireland would have to continue to follow EU standards. And that would mean some food products coming from elsewhere in the UK would be subject to new checks and controls at Northern Ireland ports. In fact, the island of Ireland is already a single zone for animal health, which means all livestock coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain is checked on entry. But the Irish government is sceptical about the proposal, with the Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar saying it was not enough on its own. ""We would need a single Irish economic zone, or whatever you would like to call it, to cover more than agriculture and food,"" he said. On Friday, Mr Varadkar said the gap between the UK and the European Union in Brexit talks was ""very wide"" and that British proposals for the Irish border fell ""very far short"" of what was needed. The DUP had been propping up the Conservatives in a confidence-and-supply pact since June 2017, with the votes of its 10 MPs giving the government a majority to get legislation passed in Parliament. However, last week 21 Conservative rebels had the whip removed for voting against the party on Brexit legislation; that meant the DUP votes were no longer enough to give the government a majority. Please upgrade your browser Mrs Foster has denied her party's influence with the prime minister has waned as a result. After she and other DUP figures held talks with the prime minister on Wednesday,Boris Johnson ruled out an NI-only backstop. Mr Wilson said that if Mr Johnson changed his mind ""he has still got the arithmetic of the House of Commons to get through"". He added: ""Aside from us, there are a sizeable group within his party who will not sign up to the break-up of the UK or the tearing up of the Belfast Agreement, which is effectively what a backstop will do."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October without a deal unless both sides can reach a compromise. Last week, MPs passed a bill to force the prime minister to ask for an extension beyond the 31 October Brexit deadline if a deal is not reached with the EU, butthis does not completely rule out a no-deal Brexit.

The faces of 2019's 100 knife crime victims Analysis by Reality Check The number of people being taken to court for possessing a weapon has been rising. There's a bit of a time lag when it comes to getting figures from the criminal justice system, so the latest ones we have, published on Thursday, only take us up to the end of last year. In 2018, the Ministry of Justice recorded 21,587 cases of people in England Wales being prosecuted for possessing a weapon, of which 13,350 cases led to a conviction - compared with 17,669 cases in 2013 - with 10,026 leading to a conviction. This was mostly driven by a rise in the offence of ""having possession of a bladed article in a public place"". For adults, the maximum sentence for possessing a knife is four years. Knife possession is now making up a bigger share of all weapons offences - two-thirds compared with half 10 years ago. And a bigger proportion of knife and weapons possession offences now result in jail time - 36% compared with 20% in 2008. These figures cover both adults and children aged 10-17. For adults only, 42% of weapons offences resulted in an immediate custodial sentence last year. While knife possession offences have been rising since 2013, they are still lower than a decade ago. About these figures Information supplied by police forces in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Figures are correct at time of publication but may change as investigations progress and charges are brought or dropped. Â© 2025 BBC.

Murders of women a wake-up call,"Women hold up numbers to represent the 101 femicides in France this year On 1 September, a resident of Cagnes-sur-Mer in the south of France spotted a foot sticking out from a pile of rubbish, branches and an old quilt. It was the disfigured body of a woman, the victim of a brutal attack. Her partner denies her murder. SalomÃ©, 21, could be France's 100th victim this year of ""femicide"" - usually defined asthe murder of a woman by a partner, ex-partner or family member,external. The day after SalomÃ©'s body was found, a 92-year-old woman was caned to death by her 94-year-old husband. Within hours,the French government announced a raft of measures,externalto protect women from domestic violence. Other European countries have already reacted to a crime that knows no borders or social class, but the picture across the continent is mixed. Flowers were placed at the site where SalomÃ©'s body was found President Emmanuel Macron launched the French campaign at a national domestic violence hotline centre, but received a reality check when he listened in on a call. A woman, who had endured decades of abuse from her violent husband, had finally built up the courage to leave him. She had asked a police officer to accompany her home so she could collect some belongings, but the officer refused, insisting he needed a judicial order to intervene. He was wrong, but the helpline had no legal authority and the operator could only direct the victim to a support group. President Macron shook his head in frustration. ""Does that happen often?"" he asked the operator. ""Oh yes,"" she responded, ""More and more."" This video can not be played French women talk about their experiences of sexual harassment in public Homicides by intimate partners are overwhelmingly committed by men against women. According to the most recent figures of such murders, the French rate is far from the highest in the EU. But as Viviana Waisman from Women's Link Worldwide explains, violence against women cannot be simplified by numbers. ""Violence against women is an issue that transcends borders, class and socio-economic status. It impacts women and girls in all societies,"" she says. ""There may be more or less stigma about talking about it in certain societies but it is present in all societies."" Statistics may not tell the full story, but Romania and Northern Ireland clearly have a problem. According to Sonya McMullan from Woman's Aid Northern Ireland, ""domestic violence is not going away and many women lose their lives every year"". Incidents of domestic violence are rising and protections for women are weaker than the rest of the UK. In March,Giselle Marimon-Herrera and her daughter Allison were found strangledin their flat in County Down. They were believed to have been killed by Giselle's partner, who was also found dead at the scene. The murders of Giselle Marimon-Herrera and her daughter Allison were described as an ""unspeakable tragedy"" Connie Leonard was allegedly killed by an ex-partner in 2017 in front of her son with Down's-syndrome.The son also suffered stab wounds. Unlike the rest of the UK and Ireland, Northern Ireland does not have a law criminalising the use of ""coercive control"" on a partner. Funding for women's protection has decreased by 5% and proposals to improve women's safety have been stalled by the lack of a functioning government over the last two years. France announces anti-femicide measures The women killed on one day around the world Spain's female bodyguards who protect abused women Finland, held up as a beacon of gender equality, also has one of the EU's highest murder rates at the hands of an intimate partner. ""In Nordic countries, women's equal rights are protected in the public sphere but not in the private sphere,"" Paivi Naskali, a professor of Gender Studies at the University of Lapland, told Open Democracy in 2013. ""The welfare state has given many rights to women, but this policy has concentrated on the labour market... not equality in private life,"" she said. Finland has one of the highest rates of femicide in Europe The Baltic republics also have a high rate of femicide. Modesta Kairyte, a social activist for domestic violence who volunteers in victim support centres in Lithuania, said the ""Soviet era has left some kind of trauma,"" but mostly the problem is down to attitudes in society. ""Society still blames the woman,"" she told the BBC. ""It's a shaming process."" A woman was admonished if she did not leave an abusive relationship, but equally seen as a failure if she did. There was also a widely held belief that it was better for children if the woman stayed. ""Lithuanian society thinks that it's better for the kids to stay,"" explained Ms Kairyte. ""But all the research shows that they are more susceptible to health issues if they are in an abusive household."" Spain is often held up as an example to the rest of Europe for measures aimed at protecting women against gender-based violence. In 2004, it passed a law establishing a network of courts specialising in domestic violence and targeted extra money at programmes supporting survivors. But in June Spain recorded the 1,000th murder of a woman by a partner since records began in 2003. Beatriz Arroyo was 29 and decided in June to break up with her boyfriend and start a new life. When she went to their fifth-floor apartment near the eastern city of Valencia to tell him she was leaving him, he suffocated her. The next morning, he threw himself from the balcony and died. Identified as Spain's 1,000th victim of femicide, her death on 10 June was marked as a dark day in Spain's history of ""machista"" violence. Women in Spain dress up as corpses to protest against rising rates of femicide Of the 1,000 victims, 607 had been killed by their partner, 225 by an ex-partner and a further 168 had been in the process of separating from their partner, reports said. The number of women killed this year in Spain is already more than double the number recorded in 2018. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe this week announced â¬5m (Â£4.5m) to help fight femicide, which will provide 1,000 new places in domestic violence shelters and an audit of 400 police stations to examine how women's complaints are handled. Electronic tags are to be used to prevent offenders approaching their victims and family courts will be allowed to prevent fathers visiting the children of abused mothers. The hotline where President Macron chose to highlight the campaign saw a big spike in phone-calls on the day of the announcement. According to French TV, 1,661 women rangthe relaunched 3919 helpline,externalfor victims of domestic violence on Tuesday, compared with an average of 200-300 calls a day. Women's rights groups believe more money is needed to fight the scourge of domestic violence. For both Sonya McMullan and Modesta Kairyte, everything comes back to education. For victims in Lithuania, Ms Kairyte has helped produce a comic book designed to explain different forms of domestic violence: emotional and economical as well as physical. The comic used in Lithuania to help educate victims of domestic violence The books are small, discreet and not obviously an advice leaflet, so they don't get noticed by partners and can easily be slipped inside the cover of another book. But what if education began far earlier? In Northern Ireland, there is no post-primary curriculum on developing relationships. Ms Kairyte says teenagers don't understand the value of wording: ""Is he being passionate or aggressive?"" Both women used the same words: ""It's really important for teenagers to understand what a healthy relationship looks like.""

The BBC's Anthony Zurcher looks at strengths and weaknesses of all the candidates. Who?Former vice-president and veteran senator Keyissues:Rebuilding the middle class; investing in federal infrastructure; tuition-free public universities One policy:Similar to the Green New Deal, Biden's Clean Energy Revolution would make the US economy 100% clean energy based with net-zero emissions by 2050, as well as target polluters with fees and quotas Anthony's take:Joe Biden entered the Democratic presidential contest as a front-runner, if not the front-runner. He has near universal name recognition, high approval ratings within the party and among political independents, a close connection to the halcyon days (at least, for Democrats) of the Obama presidency, and the potential to raise vast amounts of campaign money through traditional Democratic donor networks. Of course, so did Hillary Clinton in 2015 - and we all know how that turned out. Like the former secretary of state, Mr Biden in his launch video seems to be defining himself as much by who he isn't - Donald Trump - as what he wants to do. It was an oft-criticised strategy for Mrs Clinton in 2016, but with two years of the Trump presidency in the books, Mr Biden seems to be betting that a majority of Americans who have now seen Trumpism in practice have had enough. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Mr Biden shares some of the political weaknesses demonstrated in Mrs Clinton's presidential race as well. Her lengthy time in the public eye left a long record for her opponents to pick apart, and bound her to a status quo establishment many Americans had come to distrust. Expect the former vice-president's position against school bussing to end segregation in the 1970s, his chairmanship of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1991, and his support for the 2003 Iraq War and stringent anti-crime and bankruptcy bills to be spotlighted by the diverse and talented primary field opposing him. Then there's his advanced age, propensity for verbal stumbles, allegations of inappropriate physical contact and status as a two-time loser in past White House bids. The former vice-president has a lot going for him. He also has a lot going against him. The durability of his campaign is one of the big questions hovering over the early days of the 2020 Democratic race. Those questions will soon be answered. What Trump has said:""Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign."" Who?The 2016 runner-up needs no introduction Key issues:Medicare-for-All universal healthcare coverage; raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans; upping the minimum wage One policy:Completely eliminating $1.6tn in existing student debt - regardless of income, unlike his rival Elizabeth Warren - and making public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free by taxing Wall Street Anthony's take:After building a grassroots political movement that roiled the Democratic Party in 2016, Bernie Sanders is making another run at the prize. This time, he won't be the rumpled underdog. He'll start the race near the front of the pack - with advantages in small-donor fundraising, name recognition and a 50-state organisation of loyalists. His front-runner status will come with a price, however. Unlike 2016, when Hillary Clinton largely avoided confronting the Vermont senator for fear of alienating his supporters, his opponents will have no such reluctance this time. In 2016, the self-proclaimed ""Democratic socialist"" staked out a progressive agenda in contrast with Ms Clinton's pragmatic centrism. Now, in part because of Mr Sanders' efforts, the party has moved left on issues like healthcare, education and income inequality. His message is no longer unique. The 77-year-old senator will keep his devoted base, but will some former supporters opt for a fresh face? That could lead to conflict with those who believe a Bernie ""revolution"" is the only way forward, inflaming Democratic wounds not fully healed from the last campaign. In a crowded field, Mr Sanders has a realistic shot - but it could be a bumpy ride. 17 things that Bernie Sanders believes Can Bernie Sanders overhaul US healthcare? What has Trump said?""Bernie is crazy, but Bernie has got a lot more energy than Biden, so you never know."" Who?Another senator, this time from Massachusetts, a thorn in the side of big banks Keyissues:Wealth tax; healthcare and abortion rights; criminalising corporate negligence One policy:Erasing college debt based on income level - households earning under $250,000 annually would receive varying levels of debt relief while those earning more would not - and making public college tuition-free, paid for by taxes on wealth Anthony's take:Elizabeth Warren has been a favourite of the progressive left since she emerged on the political scene to push for tougher regulation of the financial sector after the 2008 economic crash. During her time in the US Senate she became known for her hard-nosed interrogations of Wall Street executives and as an outspoken critic of income inequality. That loyal base may be enough to rise to the top of a fractured Democratic presidential field. The challenge for Warren will be expanding her appeal beyond the already converted. She's an academic by training, having spent much of her adult career as a professor. Her campaign, however, is already emphasising her working-class upbringing over her educational pedigree, as a means of connecting her personal story to the activist government policies she supports. Warren will face the challenge of having to define her candidacy while taking fire from Donald Trump, who has repeatedly disparaged her past claims of native American heritage. Although she hardly mentions the president in speeches these days, she'll have to convince Democrats she won't be only the latest politician the president has belittled - and then defeated. Can Elizabeth Warren go all the way? What has Trump said?""I think Pocahontas, she's finished. She's out. She's gone. When it was found that I had more Indian blood in me than she did, and then it was determined I had none, but I still had more, that was the end of her 32-year scam."" Who?Became a city mayor when still in his 20s and served in the Navy, first openly gay candidate Keyissues:Political reform; LGBTQ rights; college loan relief One policy:Buttigieg has proposed reshaping the Supreme Court to have five Democratic appointees, five Republican, and five selected by an agreement of the 10 appointed justices Anthony's take:Most stories published about Pete Buttigieg prominently mention that he is a Millennial - a member of the generation born between 1981 and 1996. That isn't by accident. The South Bend, Indiana, mayor isn't the only Millennial in the 2020 race - Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is also 37 - but Mr Buttigieg is positioning himself as a voice for the young. As he notes, his generation came of age in the aftermath of 9/11, were the ones who fought in subsequent US wars and struggled to establish a financial foothold amidst the wreckage of the 2008 economic collapse. Where their aging parents, the postwar Baby Boomers, may not be as concerned about long-term impact of US policies, Mr Buttigieg says Millennials will have to deal with the fallout from today's crises for decades. Mr Buttigieg enters the race with a unique resume. He's an openly gay veteran of the Afghanistan War and a Rhode Scholar. As mid-western mayor, he's shown he has voter appeal in a region that helped deliver the presidency to Donald Trump. The march of time ensures Millennials will run things someday. A Buttigieg presidency is a long shot for 2020, but his candidacy is a sign of things to come. What has Trump said?""Alfred E Neuman [Mad magazine cartoon] cannot become president of the United States."" Who?An entrepreneur, 44, born in New York to Taiwanese parents Keyissues:Universal basic income; social media; trickle-up economic reform One policy:Yang has proposed creating a new federal agency to oversee social media and tackle what he described as ""a huge surge in depression, anxiety and emotional issues"" Anthony's take:A technology entrepreneur who is proposing the US government pay a $1,000-a-month ""freedom dividend"" to all Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 as a form of universal basic income to cushion against fewer jobs due to increased automation. Who?Lawyer and current Minnesota senator Keyissues:Infrastructure investments; mental health programmes; lowering prescription drug prices One policy:A $100bn plan to tackle substance abuse and mental health - paid for in part by opioid manufacturers - by expanding state and local funding for mental health programmes Anthony's take:Amy Klobuchar may not be a household name, but the senator cruised to 2018 re-election in Midwestern-ish Minnesota. Another former prosecutor, she came off as coolly competent in the heated Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. What has Trump said?""Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!"" Who?Born in American Samoa, aged 37, represents Hawaiian district in Congress Keyissues:Ending interventionist foreign policy; climate change; gun control One policy:Gabbard's OFF Fuels for a Better Future Act would end subsidies and tax cuts for fossil fuels, ban fracking, require electric companies to use 80% renewable resources by 2027, as well as order zero car emissions by 2050 Anthony's take:Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu member of the US Congress, is a difficult candidate to characterise. Most of the Hawaii congresswoman's views fit firmly in the Democratic Party's progressive camp. She was an early and outspoken supporter of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign and has been an advocate of universal government-provided healthcare, raising the minimum wage and an anti-interventionist foreign policy. The Iraq War veteran has drawn criticism, however, for meeting with Bashar al-Assad in January 2017 - after the Syrian president had been accused of repeatedly using poison gas on civilian populations. The daughter of a socially conservative politician and activist, Ms Gabbard may also draw the ire of Democratic voters for her past criticism of ""homosexual extremists"" and opposition to abortion rights and gay marriage. She's also opposed the Iran nuclear deal and condemned ""Islamic extremism"" in language more reminiscent of a Republican candidate. If Democrats are looking for a young, charismatic iconoclast - even if it means supporting someone whose views don't always match their own - then Ms Gabbard might have a shot. As Republicans will attest, stranger things have happened. Who?Colorado senator, the former head of Denver's public school system Keyissues:Economic reform; agriculture; criminal justice reform One policy:Bennet is a co-sponsor of the American Family Act of 2019, which seeks to expand the child tax credit based on income level and pay it monthly rather than through tax refunds Anthony's take:Bennet styles himself as a moderate who has shown he can win elections in a battleground state - a pragmatist who can advance progressive priorities like healthcare, education and equitable economic growth through bipartisan consensus. As the surge in support for South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has shown, it's not impossible for a little-known politician to break out onto the 2020 national stage. That may give Bennet some hope. He had his own viral moment when he sharply disparaged perennial Democratic villain Ted Cruz from the Senate floor earlier this year. Bennet will have his work cut out for him, however, just to stand out in a rapidly settling field and be one of the 20 Democrats who make the first Democratic primary debate stage in late June. Who?Billionaire former New York mayor Key issues:Economy, immigration, gun control, climate change Anthony's take:Mr Bloomberg is a very data-driven businessman. But it doesn't take an advanced degree in quantitative analysis to realise that the Democratic field, even at this (relatively) late date is still in flux. There are four candidates at or near the top of early state and national primary polls - all with their strengths, of course, but also obvious weaknesses. His strategy appears to be to let the other candidates fight it out in the early voting states, then take on a diminished field later in the process, where his near unlimited resources will allow him to compete in the dozens of states that vote in March. It's a risky play that only someone of Mr Bloomberg's vast wealth can afford to make. Even so, it takes quite a leap of faith to imagine that Democrats these days are ready to jump over to a New York City plutocrat ex-Republican with a smorgasbord of a record that's business friendly, fiscally conservative and includes opposition to government-run health insurance and legalised marijuana, and past support for aggressive policing measures. At the very least, however, his entry will provide him a means to push a party that he sees drifting dangerous leftward back to the pro-business centre. What Trump has said?He taunted Mr Bloomberg just before he announced his presidential bid, saying there was ""nobody I'd rather run against than little Michael"". Who?California's billionaire financier Key issues:Climate change , healthcare One policy:Steyer's campaign launch video focused on ""pushing power down to the people"" and blaming corporations for most of the nation's ""intractable"" problems Anthony's take:Tom Steyer appeared to close the door on a presidential bid back in January, instead pledging to do whatever it takes to remove Donald Trump from office via the constitutionally outlined impeachment process. He has changed his mind, which is the kind of luxury afforded a billionaire. It's not exactly apparent what path someone like Mr Steyer, a hedge-fund tycoon who has a history of advocating for liberal causes, has to the Democratic nomination. With campaign budget limited only by his imagination, if there is even the smallest path he has the resources to bulldoze it clear. At the very least, he could be a disrupter in the electoral process, free to challenge his opponents to take a more aggressive stand on impeaching the president and push them on environmental issues. His largess has made political allies across the US, and his grass-roots impeachment organising efforts helped build a million-strong contact list of like-minded voters. What has Trump said?A few months before Steyer's announcement that he would run, Trump described him ""weirdo"". Who?Former Massachusetts governor Key issues:Healthcare, climate change Anthony's take:Just when it appeared the Democratic presidential field was shrinking in earnest, it starts expanding again. First, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg began motioning toward a campaign. Now Deval Patrick has jumped in with both feet. The former Massachusetts governor has a tall task ahead of him if he wants to seriously compete for his party's nomination. Unlike Mr Bloomberg, he does not have a seemingly bottomless personal fortune to draw on for campaign expenses. Fundraising is one of the most important components of a successful presidential bid, and Mr Patrick will start at zero with only a few months until the primaries begin. It appears Mr Patrick will count on his personal charisma and a focus on early voting New Hampshire, which borders his home state, to jump-start his campaign. He is pitching himself as an optimistic mainstream Democrat who can unite the country after the divisive Trump presidency. And he's a charismatic African-American candidate who counts the Obamas as close friends.
