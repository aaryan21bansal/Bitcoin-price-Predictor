Key Barcelona suspect confirmed dead,"Abouyaaqoub, 22, is believed to be on the run The driver in Thursday's van attack that killed 13 people in a tourist area of Barcelona may still be alive and on the run, Spanish police say. They are hunting for Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, now named by Spanish media as the suspected driver. A man previously reported as the key suspect, Moussa Oukabir, 17, was one of five men killed by police after a later attack in Cambrils, west of Barcelona. Police say the suspects had been planning more sophisticated attacks. They said blasts on Wednesday at a house in the town of Alcanar deprived plotters of bomb material, so they carried out simpler attacks using vehicles. Abouyaaqoub, 22, lived in the town of Ripoll to the north of Barcelona. Three people have been arrested in Ripoll and one person in Alcanar. What we know so far Barcelona tells world 'I'm not afraid' This video can not be played WATCH: What is the mood in Barcelona? Oukabir had previously been seen as the central figure, but police now think that Abouyaaqoub is the main suspect. Oukabir is suspected of using his brother's documents to rent the van used in the Barcelona attack and another found hours later in the town of Vic, north of Barcelona, that was intended as a getaway vehicle. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows the van speeding down Las Ramblas Another van, a Renault Kangoo, is also being sought, amid reports it may have been driven across the border into France. In the early hours of Friday police shot dead five attackers, including Oukabir, in Cambrils after the men drove a car into pedestrians, killing one woman and injuring six other people. The attackers' vehicle overturned and when the men got out they were quickly fired upon by police. One of the attackers was reportedly brandishing a knife. Barcelona rejects hate after attacks The men were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts but these proved to be fake. American honeymooner killed in Barcelona Spain attacks timeline Spain's long anti-terror experience Officials believe a cell of at least a dozen people was operating at the Alcanar house, which was being used as a bomb factory to prepare more devastating attacks than those in Barcelona and Cambrils. Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said on Saturday that the cell had been ""totally dismantled"", but that security measures around the country were being increased, particularly in tourist areas. However, the Catalan regional government suggested several more suspects were still at large. Special police controls are being introduced at Saturday's two La Liga football matches in Barcelona and Girona. The nation's security alert level is staying unchanged as there is no information suggesting an imminent attack. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it had carried out the Las Ramblas attack, though it is not clear whether any of the attackers were directly connected to the group or simply inspired by it.

Ex-BBC reporter Liz MacKean dies,"This video can not be played ""Fearless and fun"": Liz MacKean's former colleagues on Newsnight pay a moving tribute Ex-BBC News correspondent Liz MacKean has died after suffering a stroke. MacKean, 52, worked for the corporation for more than 20 years but left in 2013 amid a row over the decision to shelve her investigation for Newsnight about disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile. She began her career at BBC Hereford and Worcester, before presenting on Breakfast and reporting from Northern Ireland and Scotland. MacKean went on to make films for Channel 4's Dispatches programme. BBC director of news James Harding paid tribute to MacKean, saying she had earned a reputation as a ""remarkably tenacious and resourceful reporter"". ""In Northern Ireland, she won the trust of all sides and produced some of the most insightful and hard-hitting reporting of the conflict,"" he said. ""It was as an investigative reporter that she really shone, shining a light on issues from the dumping of toxic waste off the African coast to Jimmy Savile, the story for which she is probably best known."" The mother-of-two studied at Manchester University and gained a post-graduate diploma in broadcast journalism before joining the BBC. MacKean's story about the child abuse committed by Jimmy Savile was dropped by Newsnight in 2011. But the investigation with producer Meirion Jones was later recognised by the London Press Club with a scoop of the year award. She also shared the Daniel Pearl Award for Outstanding International Investigative Journalism for a series of Newsnight reports in 2010 about toxic dumping in West Africa. MacKeanannounced she was taking voluntary redundancyfrom the BBC in May 2013. Her Dispatches programme, Hunted, about the persecution of gay people in Russia, was among the winners at the Grierson British Documentary Awards in 2014.

Top White House aide Steve Bannon fired,"White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is the latest top aide of President Donald Trump to leave his post. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that Friday was his last day. His exit follows a review of his position by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. Mr Bannon, who helped shape Mr Trump's ""America First"" campaign message, is returning as head of Breitbart.com, and says he will remain loyal. Bye Bye Bannon, Washington's second most powerful man Who was Donald Trump's chief strategist? The White House revolving door The 63-year-old is executive chairman of the website, which has been accused of voicing anti-Semitic and white supremacist views. In another departure from Mr Trump's team, billionaire investor Carl Icahn announced he was ending his role as the president's special advisor on regulatory reform, after facing criticism that his advice could benefit his own businesses. This video can not be played Some of the people who have resigned or been fired under President Trump Mr Bannon is known to have competed for influence in the West Wing against more moderate factions, including members of the Trump family. He told the Bloomberg TV network: ""I'm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents - on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America."" Mr Trump raised eyebrows earlier this year when he elevated Mr Bannon to the National Security Council, the main group advising the president on national security and foreign affairs. But he was subsequently removed from the council in a move that was seen as a sign of National Security Adviser HR McMaster's growing influence over the president. Mr Bannon has reportedly feuded with Mr McMaster as well as Gary Cohn, the director of the president's National Economic Council and a former Goldman Sachs chief viewed as a globalist. Mr Cohn, along with President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and daughter, Ivanka Trump, were viewed as threats to Mr Bannon's White House agenda. Steve Bannon may be out as a senior White House adviser, but Bannonism - if that's what it can properly be called - is still firmly entrenched in the White House. Donald Trump has repeatedly boasted that the success of his presidential campaign should properly be attributed to him, not Mr Bannon. And, in the end, Mr Bannon's desire to take credit for that win may have been what did him in. It certainly wasn't because of any sharp ideological divides between the president and the former head of Breitbart News. Border security, aggressive trade protectionism, immigration reform and a certain kind of cultural nostalgia - all were themes that Mr Trump ran on from the start, which Mr Bannon only sharpened and focused. They're also issues Mr Trump has pushed in recent weeks, even as Mr Bannon has been increasingly marginalised. Mr Bannon's firing will be seen as a win for Chief of Staff John Kelly, whose attempts to instil discipline in the White House will get a boost without the free-wheeling Mr Bannon roaming the hallways. Trump was Trump before Mr Bannon came on the scene, however. And as the rollercoaster ride that was politics this week indicates, the president isn't changing anytime soon. Mr Trump fuelled speculation when asked last week about Mr Bannon's future as he replied: ""We'll see."" Mr Bannon's interview this week with the American Prospect, a liberal magazine, reportedly infuriated the president. The White House aide was quoted as dismissing the idea of a military solution in North Korea, undercutting Mr Trump. He told the magazine the US was ""at economic war with China"" and that he aimed to push out moderates whom he believed were soft on China. Mr Bannon told associates he thought it was an off-the-record chat and did not realise he would be quoted. He has pushed for imposing additional tariffs on China and other trade partners to reduce deficits with those countries. He also advocated for a travel ban on citizens of certain Muslim-majority countries. Ms Huckabee Sanders' statement said: ""White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. ""We are grateful for his service and wish him the best."" Source familiar with the decision said Mr Bannon had been given the chance to leave on his own terms.

He was formerly a US Navy officer, Goldman Sachs investment banker, Hollywood movie producer and head of Breitbart News. The right-wing outlet that has boisterously supported Mr Trumpannounced his return,externalwithin hours. Breitbart's senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak tweeted: ""#WAR"" before Bannon made it clear he was staying on the president's side.

McDonald's could face first UK strikes,"Global fast-food giant McDonald's could face its first UK worker strikes Fast-food company McDonald's could face its first staff strike in the UK, after workers at two stores backed a call for industrial action. Employees at McDonald's restaurants in Cambridge and Crayford, near London, voted overwhelmingly for a strike. The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) said staff wanted secure working hours and a Â£10 per hour wage. A spokesman for McDonald's said the fast-food company ""works hard to ensure teams are treated fairly"". ""We can confirm that, following a ballot process, the BFAWU have indicated that a small number of our employees representing less than 0.01% of our workforce are intending to strike in two of our restaurants. ""As per the terms of the ballot, the dispute is solely related to our internal grievance procedures."" Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow secretary for business, environment and industrial strategy, said: ""The strike at McDonald's is motivated by working people coming together to fight for decent pay and working conditions."" The company announced in April that staff would be offered a choice of flexible or fixed contracts with minimum guaranteed hours. McDonald's employs around 85,000 staff in the UK and one million worldwide.

Knife attacker kills two in Finnish city,"The attack was over in a matter of minutes Two people have been killed and at least six others wounded in a stabbing in the south-western Finnish city of Turku. Police shot the suspected attacker and arrested him. They say they know his identity, but have not disclosed it. One of the victims, a woman, was stabbed several times in the neck on Friday. The victims were adults and three are in intensive care. Police have raided a flat and made a number of arrests overnight. ""We are investigating what their role is in this. Whether they had something to do with this act, or if they were just involved with this person,"" detective superintendent Markus Laine told Finnish news agency SST. The raided flat is in the Varissuo area of Turku, home to a large immigrant population. Earlier, Interior Minister Paula Risikko described the suspect as ""foreign-looking"" and linked the attack to the murder of 14 people in Barcelona. Finnish authorities have said, however, that it is too early to describe the incident as terrorism. The attack happened in the Puutori-Market Square area of Turku. Police said the alarm was raised at 16:02 local time (13:02 GMT) on Friday, when a man was reported to have attacked passers-by with a knife. Witnesses said he then ran to a nearby square and stabbed more people before he was shot in the thigh. Police said he was arrested at 16:05. Eyewitness Jesse Brown told the BBC: ""I saw police shoot a person, a man I think. People were running and there was talk about a knife attack, possibly multiple perpetrators."" Later, a spokesman for Finland's National Bureau of Investigation said that while the authorities were trying to find out if there were others involved, it was likely that the suspect had been acting alone. Emergency vehicles cordoned off the scene Another witness, student Anttoni Numminen, said he had been playing pool in a bar when he heard gunshots. People began rushing into the bar, he said, and ""the place immediately went on lockdown"". This video can not be played ""We won't ever give in"": Defiant message from eyewitness Anttoni Numminen Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila said his government was monitoring the situation closely. The interior minister and national police commissioner also said they were travelling to the city. Security was also increased at key sites in the southern capital of Helsinki, where armed police could be seen at the central train station and the airport. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that while details were still emerging ""we strongly condemn this unprovoked attack which comes only 24 hours after the horror that unfolded in Spain"". Finland has no past experience of jihadist attacks but it has seen a number of fatal gun attacks: Three women were shot dead as they left a restaurant in south-east Finland in December 2016 A trainee chef shot dead 10 people at a college in 2008 A gunman killed eight people at a school in 2007 Is terror threat to Europe greater today?

The photo that highlights White House turmoil,"This image from January shows just how much Trump's inner circle has been depleted This is the photograph, taken under seven months ago, that shows just how much Donald Trump's administration has rapidly changed. Taken on 28 January, it shows Trump's inner circle as he received a congratulatory phone call from Russian President Vladimir Putin following his inauguration. On Friday, Steve Bannon became the latest casualty, added to agrowing list of departures. But where are Trump and his closest allies now? Almost seven months to the day since his 20 January inauguration, Donald Trump is under pressure on several fronts - but he's still president. His presidency continues to be overshadowed by theongoing Russia investigation. Key policies like the repeal of Obamacare and his travel ban have faltered. Trump has also faced renewed criticism from senior Democratic and Republican figures alike for his response to eventsinvolving white supremacists in Charlottesville. Priebus was ousted in late July after just six months, following a series of chaotic weeks at the White House. The new (and now former) communications director Anthony Scaramucciwas caught days before,externaldescribing Priebus as ""paranoid"" over alleged internal leaks.

Charlottesville victim's mum rebukes Trump,"The mother of a woman fatally run over by a car at a far-right rally in Virginia says she has ""no interest"" in speaking with President Donald Trump. Susan Bro said she refuses to speak to Mr Trump after hearing him equate counter-demonstrators, like her daughter, with white supremacists. Her daughter, Heather Heyer, was killed on Saturday after a car ploughed through a crowd in Charlottesville. She said she did not ""want to be used for political agendas"". Mrs Bro told ABC New's Good Morning America television programme she missed a call from the White House, which appeared to have been made during her daughter's public memorial on Wednesday. She added that she received three more ""frantic messages"" from Mr Trump's press team later in the day but was too exhausted from the funeral to talk. It was when she saw a news clip of Mr Trump again blaming both sides for the violence that she changed her mind about speaking to the president. Allow Twitter content?

""It's not that I saw somebody else's tweets about him, I saw an actual clip of him at a press conference equating the protesters... with the [Ku Klux Klan] and the white supremacists,"" she said on Friday. ""You can't wash this one away by shaking my hand and saying, 'I'm sorry.' I'm not forgiving that."" A day earlier Mrs Bro told MSNBC she had received death threats after speaking out about her daughter's death and the president's comments. America - diminished and dismissed What made Trump remarks so offensive? Also on Friday, the mayor of Charlottesville, Mike Signer, called for Confederate statues to be removed from the city in order ""to repudiate the pure evil that visited us here"". He called upon the state General Assembly to pass laws restricting openly carrying firearms during events, and upon the city to create a memorial to Ms Heyer. Mr Trump drew outrage this week after reversing his condemnation of Saturday's far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which was supported by white supremacists and neo-Nazis protesting against the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. This video can not be played Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's mother: 'They tried to kill my child to shut her up' Violent clashes between the rally's supporters and counter-protesters escalated when a car rammed into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators, killing Ms Heyer and injuring nearly 20 others. Mr Trump bowed to pressure on Monday to denounce far-right elements at the rally, but appeared to defend its organisers on Tuesday. He condemned the suspect in the car-ramming incident, but said those who marched in defence of the statue had included ""many fine people"". Mrs Bro said her daughter, a paralegal and Charlottesville resident, did not belong to any organised faction of demonstrators, but was ""part of a group of human beings who cared to protest"". The president appeared to further his support for the organisers on Thursday when he weighed into a national debate about the removal of controversial statues, including some to leaders of the pro-slavery rebellion defeated in the US Civil War. Critics say monuments to the Confederacy are racially offensive, but supporters say they are important symbols preserving Southern heritage. This video can not be played What Trump said versus what I saw - by the BBC's Joel Gunter In a series of tweets, Mr Trump said the ""history and culture of our great country"" was being ""ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments"". Cities across the country have accelerated planned removals of controversial statues in the wake of the violent protests in Charlottesville. A statue of Roger B Taney, the US Supreme Court justice who wrote the 1857 Dred Scott decision that upheld slavery and denied citizenship to African Americans, was quietly removed from the grounds of the Maryland State House early on Friday.

Medical student dies in Nepal landslide,"Lottie Fullerton was trekking in Nepal when she died Tributes have been paid to a medical student who died following a landslide in Nepal. Lottie Fullerton was trekking on 10 August when she was hit by falling rocks and suffered a fatal head injury. The 22-year-old, who was about to enter her fourth year at Jesus College, Oxford, has been described as ""the best of people"" by a friend. About 500 people have died in floods and landslides caused by heavy rain in Nepal, Bangladesh and India. Miss Fullerton was reportedly descending towards Tatopani in Nepal's Mustang region when the accident happened. Her family said her brother travelled with her to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead. Miss Fullerton went to Canford School in Canford Magna, Dorset. A service will be organised at Jesus College chapel in her memory. In a statement the college said: ""Lottie was a very popular member of the college and will be much missed by all at Jesus. ""A fellow student described her as 'a friend to everyone at college'. Her tutors say she was an outstanding student, an excellent contributor, and a pleasure to teach. ""As well as being a hardworking and enthusiastic student, she played real tennis, went on the college ski trips and took part in the charity town and gown run. ""Our condolences are with her family, friends and all who knew her."" Her friend Polly Lamming wrote an obituary to be published bythe Cherwell student newspaper,externaland said there was ""no one in Jesus who does not love and respect her"".

I'm worried about the NHS - Hawking,"This video can not be played Watch: How Hawking v Hunt unfolded Stephen Hawking has said he is worried about the future of the NHS, in a speech critical of government policy and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. The Cambridge University scientist, who publicly backed Labour in the election, accused Mr Hunt of ""cherry-picking"" evidence to support his policies. The 75-year-old also said he was concerned about the involvement of the private sector in the NHS in England. But Mr Hunt said some of Mr Hawking's comments were ""pernicious"". A statement released by the Department of Health after the text of the speech was given to the BBC in advance said extra money was being invested in the NHS and it had recently been ranked as a top-performing health system. Prof Hawking, who has had motor neurone disease for most of his adult life that has impaired his movement and ability to speak, delivered the speech at a conference at the Royal Society of Medicine in London, organised to air concerns about the future of the NHS. The author of A Brief History of Time, who is a Labour supporter, said he had been motivated to speak because of the role the health service has played in his life, saying if it was not for the NHS he ""wouldn't be here today"". A brief history of Stephen Hawking In the speech, Prof Hawking listed a number of occasions on which the NHS was there for him. This included an episode in 1985 when he caught pneumonia in Switzerland. Doctors there suggested his ventilator be turned off to end his life, but his wife refused and he was flown back to Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge where he received treatment and recovered. Fourteen years after that, he had pioneering throat reconstruction surgery in London after his condition worsened and he was struggling to eat and breathe. ""I have had a lot of experience of the NHS and the care I received has enabled me to live my life as I want and to contribute to major advances in our understanding of the universe,"" he said, referring to his theories on black holes and the origin of the Universe. His speech then listed some of the developments in the NHS that concerned him, including the move toward what he called a ""US-style insurance system"". He said he believed there had been an increase in private provision of care, including the use of agency staff, that was leading to profit being extracted from the health service. ""The more profit is extracted from the system, the more private monopolies grow and the more expensive healthcare becomes. The NHS must be preserved from commercial interests and protected from those who want to privatise it,"" he said. He said that a publicly provided, publicly run system was the ""most efficient"" and so those who say we cannot afford the NHS are wrong. ""We cannot afford not to have the NHS,"" he added. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was embroiled in a row over the use of data on seven-day services last year His speech also mentioned Mr Hunt by name. In a section about the move towards a seven-day NHS, Prof Hawking said that while he would like there to be more services available at weekends, the government has failed to carry out ""proper due diligence"", particularly with regard to whether there would be enough staff. He quoted from a letter he put his name to last year explaining how Mr Hunt ""cherry-picked"" research to put his case. The health secretary initially said on Twitter that Mr Hawking was a ""brilliant physicist but wrong on the lack of a weekend effect"" in the NHS. He also said thethe study into mortality rates,externalassociated with weekend NHS services was ""the most comprehensive ever"". But hours later he posted two further tweets, in which he said Mr Hawking's concerns, about the development in the UK of the type of insurance system seen in the United States, were a ""pernicious falsehood"". He also said the Conservatives had provided the NHS with more money and medical staff than ever before. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Department of Health responded to Mr Hawking's comments by pointing out that the numbers of staff working in the NHS were increasing and it ""makes no apology"" for tackling the weekend effect. The statement pointed out that only about 8% of NHS funding goes to the private sector. It also said that ""despite being busy"", the NHS had been ranked as the ""best, safest and most affordable healthcare system out of 11 wealthy nations"" in a recent study by the Commonwealth Fund. ""The government is fully committed to a world-class NHS, free at the point of use now and in the future - that's why we're backing it with an extra Â£8bn of investment over the next five years,"" the statement said.

Obituary: Sir Bruce Forsyth,"He made his stage debut aged just 14 as Boy Bruce, the Mighty Atom Veteran entertainer Sir Bruce Forsyth had a career spanning eight decades, in which he went from struggling variety performer to Saturday night TV stardom. On the way, he became one of the most recognisable entertainers in the business, driven by what appeared to be inexhaustible energy. He became synonymous with the plethora of game shows that seemed to dominate television light entertainment in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, although he often felt he had become typecast as the genial quizmaster. And at an age when most performers would have put their feet up, his career enjoyed a huge revival with the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing. Bruce Joseph Forsyth-Johnson was born in Edmonton, north London, on 22 February 1928. His father owned a local garage and both his parents were Salvation Army members who sang and played music at home. Beat the Clock was just one of many games he hosted The young Bruce was a direct descendant of William Forsyth, a founder of the Royal Horticultural Society, whose name was given to the plant forsythia. His interest in showbusiness was kindled at the age of eight and he was reportedly found tap-dancing on the flat roof after watching his first Fred Astaire film. ""As soon as I got home from school,"" he recalled, ""I'd take up the carpet, because there was lino underneath, and start tapping away."" He made his stage debut at the age of 14 as Boy Bruce, the Mighty Atom, appearing bottom of the bill at the Theatre Royal, Bilston. Live entertainment was a way of escaping the pressures and dangers of wartime Britain, and there was a huge demand for acts, no matter how bad they were. Many years later he explained his motivation on a BBC chat show.  ""I wanted to be famous and buy my mum a fur coat."" ""I'm in charge."" ""All right, my loves?"" ""Good game, good game!"" ""Nice to see you, to see you nice."" ""Give us a twirl!"" ""Cuddly toy, cuddly toy!"" ""OK, dollies do your dealing."" ""You get nothing for a pair!"" ""What do points make?"" ""Didn't he/she do well?"" ""You're my favourite."" ""Keeeeep dancing!"" But there was to be no fast track to success. For the next 16 years he performed in church halls and theatres across the country, sleeping in train luggage racks and waiting for the big break. It came in 1958, at a time when he had been unemployed for more than three months and was seriously considering giving up on showbusiness. He was asked to present Sunday Night at the London Palladium, a televised variety show, made by Lord Grade's ATV company for the ITV network. He'd finally found the fame he had always craved, appearing not in front of a couple of hundred people in a theatre, but the more than 10 million who regularly tuned in to the show. ""The pubs would empty when it came on,"" he told an interviewer.  ""We would get calls saying: 'Can't you start it later?'"" At one point, he was Britain's highest-paid entertainer Originally booked for two weeks, he stayed five years, by which time he was Britain's highest-paid entertainer, earning Â£1,000 a week (Â£18,700 in today's money). But he continued touring with his variety show and the strain of combining this with his Palladium appearances took a toll on his private life. He divorced his first wife, Penny Calvert, a dancer he'd met in the theatre, and she wrote an account of her husband's perpetual absence, called Darling, Your Dinner's in the Dustbin. A popular element in his Palladium show was a feature called Beat the Clock, in which contestants, egged on by Forsyth, had to complete quirky tasks as a huge clock ticked down. Sir Bruce Forsyth dies aged 89 Life in pictures Lord Grade recalls 'a very special man' Stars remember Brucie The segment gave a hint of his future television role and he went on to host some of the most popular television game shows of the 1970s and 80s. With his catchphrases of ""Nice to see you, to see you nice"" and ""Didn't he do well?"" he reigned supreme at the helm of the BBC's Generation Game for six years from 1971, and again at the beginning of the 1990s. At its peak, the programme attracted 20 million viewers, who tuned in to watch Forsyth seemingly having more fun than the competitors, enthusing over the mundane prizes on the conveyor belt. The presenter argued with his BBC managers about the show's early evening timeslot but he eventually accepted his role as the ""warm-up man"" for Saturday night television. The Beatles were among the stars he introduced at the London Palladium His co-host on the show, Anthea Redfern, was each week encouraged to ""give us a twirl"". The couple married in 1973 but divorced six years later. It was on the Generation Game that he introduced his famous ""thinker"" pose, appearing in silhouette at the beginning of each show. The idea came from the classic circus strongman pose, something he'd perfected during his days in variety. He repeated his success on ITV's Play Your Cards Right, where the audience joined in the cries of ""higher"" or ""lower"" as the contestants tried to guess the value of a series of playing cards. Michael Grade said of him: ""He knows how to get laughs out of people but it's never cruel and he leaves their dignity intact."" In 1995, a year after his final Generation Game appearance, he received a lifetime achievement award for variety at the British Comedy Awards and began hosting ITV's The Price is Right. The entertainer was, by this time, a Rolls-Royce-driving multimillionaire and married since 1983 to Wilnelia Merced, a former Miss World. He later claimed that he regretted becoming so associated with game shows and wished he'd done more variety work on TV. Forsyth with Anthea Redfern on the Generation Game Play Your Cards Right was axed in 1999 and, with changing tastes in entertainment, his TV career began to slide. He returned to the theatre - but experienced an unexpected revival after his wife watched an edition of the satirical quiz, Have I Got News For You, and suggested he could present the programme. After calling show regular Paul Merton, he landed the gig and offered to be ""a little bit deadpan"". ""But the team said, 'No, be Bruce Forsyth,'"" he said. He used the occasion to parody some of his old game shows, much to the ill-disguised disgust of team captain Ian Hislop. But the appearance led to Forsyth, an accomplished tap dancer, being offered the job of hosting Strictly Come Dancing, which began a year later. Viewed with scepticism when it launched, the celebrity dance show became one of the most-watched programmes on TV by the time it reached its fifth series in 2007. He brought his own brand of avuncular good humour to the proceedings - reassuring many of the contestants with the phrase ""you're my favourites"". He parodied some of his old game shows on Have I Got News For You ""His particular character and personality went a long way to making the show what it is,"" said former contestant Ann Widdecombe. But the presenter once revealed that Strictly ""was never the show that I thought it would be"". ""I thought it'd be a comedy show - me getting among the contestants and showing them how to dance, and them all falling over,"" he told ITV's This Morning. ""It was a different show."" After missing a handful of episodes because of illness, he decided to ""step down from the rigours"" of presenting Strictly in 2014. ""But I'm not retiring,"" he insisted. ""That's the last thing in the world I want to do. This isn't Brucie walking into the sunset."" He continued to host the Christmas and charity editions of Strictly until 2014 - all of which were taped, as opposed to live broadcasts. Away from entertainment, Forsyth's biggest passion was golf and he took part in many pro-celebrity tournaments. His house was next to the course at Wentworth, where he played with many of the world's best players, practising in the bunker in his own back garden. He presented Strictly Come Dancing with Tess Daly During his career, Forsyth's multiple talents and years of application sparked an enduring appeal. In 2011 he was knighted after years of campaigning by his fans and a parliamentary Early Day Motion signed by 73 MPs. But he suffered from ill health towards the end of his life, and in 2016 his wife revealed he still had ""a bit of a problem moving"", following major surgery a year earlier. Sir Bruce was one of the last entertainers from the tradition of music hall to be working on British television. In many ways his act barely changed. The same corny gags, the same toothy smile and, above all, the same manic enthusiasm. ""On stage I think I'm 35,"" he once said. ""Working takes over my whole body and I become a younger man - that's why I won't stop."" He will be particularly remembered for his ability to transform run-of-the-mill party games into glorious moments of mayhem that enthralled contestants and audiences alike.

Hungerford: The afternoon that changed a town forever," It was a good day to spend in the garden - hot and sunny.Trevor Wainwright, Hungerford’s usual bobby on the beat, was on a day off. He was making his way to a part-time gardening job in the nearby village of Inkpen. As he drove the three-and-a-half miles a news report came on the radio about a suspected armed robbery at a petrol station in Froxfield. Someone had shot at the cashier, Kakoub Dean. Luckily she hadn't been injured. The young policeman wondered whether he should see if he could do anything to help. After all, he was in the area and knew Mrs Dean. But, he reasoned, it was his day off. Later that day, his parents were driving up from their home in Kent to visit him. And strictly speaking, it was not his responsibility; Froxfield, though just outside Hungerford, was in Wiltshire rather than Berkshire and beyond the jurisdiction of Thames Valley Police. So he continued to Inkpen and Mrs Roland-Clarke's garden. I could smell cordite in the air."" About half an hour later, Mrs Roland-Clarke called him to the telephone. It was Jane, PC Wainwright's then-wife. She told him someone was shooting across the back gardens of their road. ""I put two and two together and assumed that the armed robbers from Froxfield had been cornered in Hungerford,"" he said. ""I rushed back to check on Jane and on the way I saw smoke coming up from South View [a nearby street]. People were sheltering in doorways and I pulled up and asked what was going on. ""'Some bloke’s gone mad with a gun', they said. I hurried home and got out of the car. I could smell cordite in the air. Sharp, acrid and smoky."" He told his wife to stay indoors with the little girl she was babysitting and headed off to Hungerford town centre, first to a newsagent to buy some maps and then to the police station. ""The station was locked, so I let myself in with a key. It was absolute panic stations. ""I effectively put myself on duty and thought because of my local knowledge I could show the armed response team the back routes around the town. Ambulances lined the main street. ""Members of the public were in the station with the police. I saw Robert Clements – he’d been walking the dog with his dad, Ken, and just witnessed him shot dead in South View. I knew I had to help."" When PC Wainwright, wearing his off-duty clothes of shorts and a Fred Perry polo shirt, was called into his superior's office, he thought he was going to be told to put his uniform on. Instead, Sgt Ryan said: ""I don’t know how to tell you this. Your dad's been shot. He's dead."" Trevor Wainwright still lives in Hungerford The elder Mr and Mrs Wainwright had been about 300 yards from their son's house when Douglas Wainwright was shot in the head and Kathleen Wainwright in the chest and the hand. Mrs Wainwright had the presence of mind to get out of the car and cower behind it. She knew her husband was dead. The gunman was reloading his weapon and Mrs Wainwright thought he would shoot at her again. This time, close-up. There was no way he would miss. Maybe he was distracted; maybe he enjoyed the power of sparing Mrs Wainwright's life. Either way, he turned away. Two more vehicles driving along the road were shot at. One man was injured. Another, Eric Vardy, was killed. Back at the police station, PC Wainwright was told his mother had been taken to hospital in Swindon. He headed straight there and was greeted by a nurse who said Kathleen was fine and Douglas was in the operating theatre. Over the moon at the news of his father's survival, PC Wainwright telephoned his brothers and sister. Then the nurse came back. ""She asked me what my dad looked like,"" he says. ""I told her he had tattoos, was about 6ft 1in and had grey hair. And she said ‘I'm really sorry. That's not him’. ""He was dead after all. That was possibly even worse than hearing it the first time."" By now, the name of the gunman was circulating. When PC Wainwright heard it was Michael Ryan from South View, he couldn't put a face to the name. ""In fact, I first thought it was another lad who lived there. A right little sod. Michael Ryan was just so, so insignificant. ""And then I remembered the name. I had been the one to carry out the checks for Ryan’s firearms licence."" The primary school where Marjorie Jackson was a caretaker had broken up for the summer holidays. She had been to check on the building, which was just the other side of the street from her South View home, and was returning to her house for lunch when a springer spaniel ran past. It was being chased up the road by Michael Ryan. The dog and its pursuer rounded a bend before disappearing from view. Mrs Jackson had known Ryan all of his life. They lived a few doors from each other and their families were friends. He was as good as gold."" Dorothy Ryan, Michael’s mother, was a lunchtime supervisor at the primary school where Mrs Jackson worked. Michael used to play at Mrs Jackson's home with one of her sons. She remembers Michael as quiet and polite. ""He was as good as gold. Wouldn't hurt a fly."" Having chased the spaniel away, Ryan returned. Mrs Jackson noticed he was holding a gun in each hand. He looked at her. His face, she says, was expressionless. ""I just started to run. I've never run so fast. He was shooting at me. The dust was flying up from the ground around my feet as the bullets hit. ""I was desperate to get into the house. He chased me all the way. ""I got into the house and slammed the door. I thought I was safe."" I didn't want to worry anyone."" But she wasn't. Ryan looked in through the kitchen window and pointed his gun at her. ""I turned to move away and he shot me. He got me in my lower back. ""I knew I’d been hit. There was a terrible burning pain. I couldn't walk. I couldn’t move my legs. I was on the floor. All I could think of was the dogs. I thought he'd come in and kill them."" Mrs Jackson, a bullet lodged in the base of her spine, crawled through the blood and glass on her linoleum and managed to lock Katie and Raffles, a Pekingese and a Tibetan spaniel, into a kitchen cupboard. Then she phoned the building firm where her husband Ivor was a bricklayer, and asked for a message to be passed on. ""I said I needed a bit of help at home but I didn't say what had happened. I should have said but I didn’t want to worry anyone. ""I didn’t know the Masons at No. 6 were already dead."" Their friend George White, who worked with Ivor, said he'd drive him home. ""I didn’t know by doing that, by asking him to come home, I was just leading them both into danger."" While Ryan roamed Hungerford, murdering and maiming people he'd known for years, a woman lay dead in Savernake Forest. The beauty spot near Marlborough is a popular place with dog walkers, picnickers and ramblers. It was one of the young Ryan's favourite places, where he enjoyed tracking wildlife through the undergrowth and practising survival skills. He also had a more sinister motivation for visiting the woodland. A former school friend remembers a teenage Ryan boasting of spying on and stalking people there. ""He used to say he could follow anyone and they wouldn’t notice,"" said the friend. ""I think he used to do it quite often, but then with him… he used to say lots of things. But this did actually ring true. ""He used to wear camouflage gear, that sort of thing. He took it seriously."" Prof Craig Jackson, a psychologist who specialises in spree killers, thinks there was also a sexual motive. He believes Ryan would get an illicit sexual thrill during his woodland trips and obtain pleasure and a sense of accomplishment from following and watching people unseen. It's not known whether Ryan spent a long time watching Sue Godfrey, a 35-year-old nurse who had stopped with her two young children for a picnic lunch. It is known that he made her put her son and daughter, aged two and four, in her car. He then shot her in the back with a Beretta pistol. Susan Godfrey was shot dead in Savernake Forest Pathologists determined she was killed by the first three bullets. Ryan hadn’t stopped there, though. He carried on, shooting Mrs Godfrey 13 times until he ran out of ammunition. Her children, who were 85 yards away from where her body was found, were later reunited with their father. The investigation into Mrs Godfrey's death found she had not been raped. However, Prof Jackson said it was likely Ryan had intended to do so. A groundsheet was found nearby, which could have been laid by Ryan in order to contain DNA evidence. ""I think she either refused to [have sex] or resisted,"" he said. ""Perhaps he killed her in panic when she attempted to run away."" Prof Jackson's colleague at Birmingham City University, Dr Elizabeth Yardley, has a different theory. Prof Craig Jackson believes Ryan had a sexual motive She thinks he saw Mrs Godfrey and her children having a picnic and enjoying themselves. ""It was a happy occasion and I think he felt resentful and victimised and wanted to seize control. ""If he did have a sexual crime in mind, then that would have been about control too."" What happened in the woods is the clue to why the shootings happened, Prof Jackson believes. ""I don't think he fully intended to commit a killing spree that day. I believe Ryan had probably been fantasising about it on a low level, but the events that day - and his personality type - led to it. ""He certainly had no 'manifesto' or message to the world."" Prof Jackson also considers Ryan was heavily influenced by a mass shooting occurring 10 days earlier in Melbourne, Australia, that was reported on television in the UK. Julian Knight killed seven people in Melbourne The Hoddle Street massacre was committed by a former soldier who wore combat fatigues. Having murdered Mrs Godfrey, Ryan headed back to Hungerford in his Vauxhall Astra GTE, stopping at Froxfield filling station. He put some petrol in his car and some in a canister. Then he shot at Mrs Dean and sped back to South View where he set fire to his home and shot dead his dog, Blackie. ""I think he fully intended to fake his own death at home and disappear at that point,"" says Prof Jackson. ""He was going to set fire to his mother's house and drive away, leaving the police to believe he'd died in the fire."" If this was his plan, it fell to pieces when his car would not restart. Prof Jackson says it was at this point Ryan changed his plans. ""He was trapped and didn't have a viable way out of his situation."" He left his shotguns in his broken-down car, grabbed a pistol and two automatic rifles and almost immediately shot dead Roland and Sheila Mason, who were in their garden at the back of 6 South View. What had led Ryan to this point? He had what appeared to be a normal upbringing, although he was perhaps overindulged by his mother. Ryan was a shy child with a keen interest in the military An investigation after the shootings found both Dorothy and Michael Ryan had been overdrawn on their bank accounts - in Dorothy's case largely because she bought her only child a new car every two years. Not academically gifted nor particularly driven, Ryan was unremarkable at school. Classmates remember he was quiet, seemed shy, ""kept himself to himself"" and was keen on the military. Leaving school he embarked on a series of casual labouring jobs and was often unemployed. His real passions were cars and guns. Semi-automatic rifles Ryan used during his rampage When he was 13 his mother bought him an air rifle. The boy enjoyed pointing his weapon at cows, birds and even other children, says Dr Yardley. He became a skilled shooter and member of two gun clubs. He legally owned several semi-automatic weapons and told people he had been in the SAS - just one strand of a fantasy life woven by him and apparently perpetuated by his mother. Mrs Jackson can remember Mrs Ryan telling her about a mysterious ""friend"" Michael had made. He claimed he had been taken under the wing of a retired colonel who was going to buy him a house and a Ferrari. There was also a made-up girlfriend - a delusion which went far enough for Mrs Ryan to invite people to the wedding. She'd just say she'd fallen over."" Whether Mrs Ryan truly believed her son's imaginings is impossible to tell. But it appears she never contradicted him in public. Alfred Ryan, Michael's father, had become a parent in his mid-50s and was about 20 years older than Dorothy. The Jacksons remember him as being a model-railway enthusiast and ""a lovely man who would help you with anything"". Although many neighbours described Mr Ryan as a pleasant man, there were rumours he was especially strict with his son. Ryan’s school friend remembers his mother would buy the boy whatever he wanted, but his father ""couldn’t be played"" and ""wore the trousers"" in the house. It was following Alfred's death in 1985 that Mrs Ryan began appearing at work with visible bruises, Mrs Jackson says. ""She'd just say she'd fallen over or something. It just seemed to happen quite a lot."" Dr Liz Yardley says Ryan felt victimised Dr Yardley says Ryan would have learned how to treat women from how his father treated his mother. ""[Mr Ryan] was quite the bully. Ryan's mother consistently pandered to her husband and son so Michael saw her as someone who was there to do things for him and essentially serve him - so he felt a sense of entitlement to treat her however he wanted."" Prof Jackson says violence towards his mother would fit in with Ryan's psychological profile as a narcissist who could not cope with being disobeyed, disagreed with or challenged. He adds that an overindulgent mother could also have led to Ryan never taking responsibility for his actions - a personality trait common to many spree killers. Despite his elaborate fantasies, however, Ryan was not mentally ill. Medical reports show he had no history of mental illness - in fact, his doctor had countersigned Ryan's gun applications. Ryan was a member of two gun clubs On 19 August 1987, the 27-year-old loner was in licensed possession of two shotguns, three pistols and two semi-automatic rifles. Dr Yardley and Prof Jackson both believe that Ryan did not ""snap"" and carry out the killings. Dr Yardley thinks he planned them well in advance. The speed with which he carried out his agenda indicates an element of forethought. Mrs Godfrey was killed at about 12:30 BST and Mrs Dean was shot at just five minutes later at the petrol station. Ryan was well-known for driving ""like a bat out of hell"" - the only time he had been in trouble with the police was for breaking the speed limit. He arrived back in South View in time to set fire to his home, shoot his dog, chase another dog, and take three guns from his car before killing Mr and Mrs Mason at 12:47. The final shooting took place at about 13:45. ""It's difficult to ascertain exactly how much he planned it, but I think it was well in advance and right down to minor details,"" says Dr Yardley. ""If it had happened today, there would probably be some sort of trail on a computer as perpetrators tend to do a lot of research."" Because Ryan burned down his home, any evidence of planning was destroyed. Dr Yardley believes Ryan was attempting to wrest some sort of control from society. A single man, unemployed and living with his mother, with no evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship in his life, he perhaps had precious little to be happy about. ""What he did was the ultimate taking back of control. He also knew the day would end in the loss of his own life, so in effect he was choosing when to die."" George White was driving Ivor Jackson back from work. It was about 10 minutes since Mrs Jackson had asked her husband to return home and the two men had no idea of the danger into which they were heading. Ryan was on the loose in South View. Armed with three guns, he had already murdered six people and seriously injured seven more. As Mr White turned his Toyota Crown into South View, he was shot in the head and died instantly. Next to him, in the passenger seat, Ivor Jackson was also shot in his arm, chest and head. Their car smashed into the back of another car. It was a police vehicle which had its blue lights flashing. Mr Jackson decided to play dead. Oh no Ivor, not you."" With blood running down his face, he could only watch through half-closed eyes as Dorothy Ryan, Michael’s mother, arrived home from the Wednesday market. ""Dorothy came past me, and she looked into the car and I remember it as clear as day. She said: 'Oh no Ivor, not you.'"" Ryan was holding one of his most prized possessions - a Chinese copy of a Kalashnikov semi-automatic rifle. Could she talk some sense into her son? Dorothy Ryan tried to reason with her son ""She tried to tell Michael to stop and he shot her at close range,"" Mr Jackson adds. ""She was dead on the ground, on her front just by the drive of our house. ""Then he shot her again, twice, in the back, from about four inches away."" As smoke filled the air from Ryan’s burning house, more people were hiding inside their homes. A few doors down, a 14-year-old girl was staring at her legs. She had started the day wearing yellow trousers, borrowed from her sister. They were turning red with blood. Lisa Mildenhall had been in the garden with her sister and two children from another house. The other three ducked down on the floor but Ryan fired at Lisa. She was hit in the legs and the hips. One of the boys she was with went to fetch his mother, Sylvia Pascoe, a qualified first-aider who lived at No 14. Sylvia Pascoe still lives in South View ""I assumed it had been some sort of accident with glass and that Lisa had been cut,"" she says. ""I went to help and she said Michael Ryan had shot her. ""I just thought she was delirious from blood loss."" Her training with St John Ambulance had led her to believe she could not have been shot, as bullets typically leave a large exit wound. ""There were no big wounds at the back of Lisa's legs. I later realised that was because the bullets were still in her. I could see her hip bone."" The teenager was still standing up when Mrs Pascoe arrived to help her. She seemed more concerned about her trousers than her wounds. Mrs Pascoe stemmed the bleeding and stayed with the girl until an ambulance arrived. Ambulance driver Hazel Haslett arrived minutes later. Ryan shot at her, making a hole in the side window. Hazel Haslett escaped with minor injuries Ms Haslett reversed rapidly and she and her partner escaped with only minor injuries. Still shooting, Ryan then walked to the end of the road, went along a footpath and made his way across some playing fields. He wasn't finished yet. 1 - Roland Mason2 - Sheila Mason3 - Kenneth Clements4 - PC Roger Brereton5 - Abdul Khan6 - George White7 - Dorothy Ryan8 - Francis Butler9 -  Marcus Barnard10 - Douglas Wainwright11 - Eric Vardy12 - Sandra Hill13 - Victor Gibbs14 - Myrtle Gibbs15 - Ian Playle ● Susan Godfrey was shot and killed in Savernake Forest Shortly after Ms Haslett escaped South View, her colleague Derek Whiting arrived in a second ambulance, completely unaware that a gunman was at large. He noticed the blue flashing light on the police car and decided to stroll up to ask the officer what was going on. Moving closer, he noticed the rear window of the police car had been shot out. Inside, PC Roger Brereton, a traffic officer who had volunteered to investigate, was slumped against the steering wheel, clearly dead. Mr Whiting did not understand. He was still labouring under the impression that there might have been a shooting accident. Gunshots were often heard from Hungerford Common, at one end of South View. Both recreational and agricultural shooting were normal occurrences in the area. Then he realised the policeman’s wounds had not been caused by a shotgun but by a semi-automatic rifle. Shell cases were littering the ground. He saw Mrs Ryan lying dead on the road. He saw the Masons, dead in their garden. He saw Mr White and Mr Jackson in the car and Mr Clements - who had been walking his dog with his family - lying dead on the footpath. George White and PC Roger Brereton were in their cars when they were shot Rather than getting away from the carnage in South View, he started to check the houses to find and help the injured. ""When you work for the ambulance service, you do your best to help people,"" Mr Whiting says. Because the road was blocked by PC Brereton and Mr White's car, he and his partner could not drive their ambulance up, so he went on foot. He pulled the wheeled stretcher with him and managed to load both Mr and Mrs Jackson and Lisa Mildenhall into the ambulance. But what he did not realise was he was personally affected by the shootings. As his wife, Mary, says: ""So many of our family were shot that day."" Several of Derek and Mary Whiting's relatives were shot She had been at work in Hungerford when the news about the shootings came on the radio. ""We were all told to lie down and not move. Then the radio announced the names of some of the people who’d been shot, but didn't say if they were dead or alive. ""My brother and sister-in-law were on the list."" Alan Lepetit, Mrs Whiting's brother, was a neighbour of Ryan's, living in South View. The week before the shootings he had helped Ryan bring a heavy cabinet down the stairs. It was his gun cupboard. Mr Lepetit said: ""I gave him a hand one week, and the next he shot me and set fire to my house."" Linda Chapman and her teenage daughter Alison - Mr Whiting's sister and niece - were hit. They survived, although Alison still has a bullet inside her. Then Ryan had shot and killed Abdul Khan, a hard-of-hearing 84-year-old who was gardening. It is thought he might not have heard the commotion. Ryan headed across the playing fields, still shooting. As he approached a playground near Bulpit Lane he shot and killed dog walker Francis Butler. The Whitings' son Matthew, who was 11 at the time, was with his childminder in the playground and saw Mr Butler being shot. Mrs Whiting remembers: ""He was very upset for weeks afterwards. He would insist on lying down on the back seat of the car if we ever went out, so he couldn't be seen. ""I always encouraged him to talk about what happened, and one day he whispered to me and asked if he could use a rude word. ""I said he could, and he said: 'When that man shot that man, all of the birds flew out of the trees and shat themselves'. ""You know, it's funny. Everyone remembers the silence. The birds didn't sing again for five days."" Helicopters were hovering over Hungerford. Ryan had murdered 16 people and seriously injured 15 more, but his whereabouts were unknown. The phone lines were inundated with people trying to call police - journalists were taking up many of the lines - and the police radio system, which only had three channels, was similarly overloaded. Typically, by the time people got through to the 999 system, Ryan had gone elsewhere. Some reports were inaccurate, giving the wrong location. The result was police were often up to 40 minutes behind his movements. Marcus Barnard, a local taxi driver, had been a father for just five weeks when he was shot dead. Sandra Hill, who'd moved away from the town, was visiting former school friends. With her window open and radio on in her Renault 5, she became Ryan’s 13th murder victim, dying from a single shot. Ryan had been targeting people he happened across in streets and gardens. Now, he added a new dimension. As he went along Priory Road, Ryan stopped at the home of Myrtle and Victor Gibbs, whose door was, as usual, locked. He used his semi-automatic rifle to strafe the front door and open it. Ryan broke into the Gibbs' house on Priory Road Mr Gibbs tried to protect his wife, who was a wheelchair user. He died instantly from chest wounds. Mrs Gibbs died several days later, in hospital. ""Breaking in or shooting into a house and killing the inhabitants and then holding the position for a while before moving on, would have appealed to his military ideals and fantasies,"" says Prof Jackson. Ian Playle, the last victim to be fatally shot, had in fact been warned of the danger in South View by police. Knowing his way around the streets, he had tried to drive home by another route. But Ryan had moved. As Mr Playle rounded a bend in Priory Street, Ryan fired a single shot. Two days later, Mr Playle died from his injuries. Mr Playle's blue Ford Sierra crashed after he was shot by Ryan His wife and children had been in the car but were unhurt. Police were still hunting for the gunman in their midst. Eventually, shots were heard coming from John O'Gaunt School. Ryan had holed himself up in a second-floor classroom and was shooting through the window at both police and press helicopters. Ryan fired at helicopters from this window At about 16:45, police entered the playground. Ryan was finally cornered and an armed officer trained his sights on him. At 17:25, Ryan threw a semi-automatic rifle from the classroom window. A police negotiator managed to engage him in conversation. Ryan intimated he might be prepared to give himself up. He expressed sorrow over shooting his mother and his dog, and then said: ""Hungerford must be a bit of a mess. ""It's funny, I've killed all those people but I don't have the guts to blow my own brains out."" Seven minutes after saying this, at 18:52, he shot himself in the head. For Michael Ryan, it was over. Later that night, the clear-up began. Fifteen vehicles were taken away for forensic examination. Seventy-eight bullet holes were found. Mrs Pascoe, safe with her neighbours in a community centre, was playing cards with the children to distract them from the horror outside. At about 02:00 she looked out of the window and saw the bodies from South View being collected and driven away. Later, police told her they believed her life had been saved by the fact she'd kept her curtains drawn as she pottered about, doing her housework in her nightgown. She was still wearing it, soaked now with Lisa Mildenhall's blood, when she was finally allowed back home. Four houses, including Ryan's home at the far right, were later demolished In the ambulance on the way to hospital in Swindon, Ivor Jackson's heart had twice stopped beating. He had lost lots of blood, had bullets in his head and chest, his lung had been shot through and his arm was barely attached to his body. He needed numerous operations and still suffers, both physically and mentally. His wife, who had a bullet in her spine, was not expected to walk again. It's testament to her own strength of mind that she did. Marjorie Jackson recuperating in hospital in 1987 ""I just thought to myself, I'm a mother. I need to get better and I will walk again. I knew I had to be the strong one of the family, I knew Ivor wouldn't cope."" Even now Mr Jackson has not been back to South View. He cannot even pass the end of the road. He can barely speak about his friend, George White. ""He was a good man. We were good friends,"" he says. ""I’ll never forget what I saw that day, what happened to him, but I can't tell you. ""Nothing's been right since."" South View became a popular haunt for tourists The Jacksons had loved their home on South View, with its large garden, and were in the process of buying it. But, although the house was cleaned and modernised and made available for them, they could not bear to return. The couple and their two grown-up sons now live in a two-bedroom council house a few streets away. ""After what happened, lots of people split up,"" says Ivor Jackson. ""They couldn’t cope. But we've stuck by each other."" The couple have been married for 60 years and celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary in January. ""We got a letter from the Queen,"" Mr Jackson adds. ""My daughter arranged it."" PC Roger Brereton's funeral was held near Newbury The letter, complete with golden tassel, is still in its recorded delivery envelope and is kept in a basket in the Jacksons' kitchen. They keep meaning to frame it and put it up on the wall. Their younger son Trevor, who had been 18 in 1987, is being treated for PTSD while his older brother Peter, who was in the same year as Ryan at school, refuses to talk about that day. If it comes up, he leaves the room or goes to sit in the greenhouse. Large crowds attended the funerals of Ryan's victims Trevor Jackson had first heard of the shootings when a colleague asked: ""What's happened to your parents?"" He returned to South View to find bodies on the ground and was asked by police to identify them. Then he and his brother Peter went into their home, released the dogs from the cupboard, and started to clean the blood and glass from their kitchen. As the brothers were cleaning up, a reporter burst in. There was a police guard on the front door so he had sneaked through the garden and into the house through the back door. Another reporter followed their sister home from the hospital. I just broke down in tears."" Press intrusion is something the Jacksons continue to feel very strongly about. They usually hang up if a journalist approaches them and refuse to have their photograph taken in connection with the shooting. Similarly the Whitings, for years, simply drew their curtains and refused to answer the door. When, in March 1996 Thomas Hamilton shot dead 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Stirling town of Dunblane, Trevor Wainwright decided to write to the Scottish police. Thomas Hamilton murdered 17 people in Dunblane in 1996 He explained who he was and his experience, and offered sympathy. Then he tore his heartfelt letter up. ""I just thought: 'They don’t want outsiders. They'll do what we did. The help will come from within the community'. ""Writing the letter did me good, but I don't think it would have helped the people of Dunblane."" A few days after the murders, Mr Wainwright - who had carried out the routine checks for Ryan's firearms licence - was astonished to see the Today newspaper’s front page splash. ""PC Signs Own Father’s Death Warrant"". Trevor Wainwright says he is ""haunted"" by his father's death ""I just broke down in tears,"" Mr Wainwright says. ""It hit at the heart of my professionalism, of everything I'd ever done for the town. I probably did three or four of these checks a week. ""It was just routine. Hungerford is a big shooting area, farmers and gun clubs and that sort of thing. I mean, there's no legitimate reason anyone would need to have a Kalashnikov - but it was legal. ""There was a picture of my dad, dead in a car with a blanket over him. ""And I kept thinking, if it was true that I'd signed my dad's death warrant, it meant I'd also signed all those other people's too. At the time,  the idea crucified me. ""At the hospital, where my mum was, everyone who'd been shot had been put into the same ward. I was due to go and visit her, but I thought I couldn't. ""I thought: 'How the hell can I go and see her if they're all blaming me?' ""She told me to get my arse straight down there. No-one blamed me."" Kathleen Wainwright later moved to Hungerford to be near her son He says he was helped by a discovery made at the post-mortem examination - that his father had developed lung cancer. ""If he had the choice - to die from a horrible disease like that, or be shot, I know he'd choose the bullet. Every single time."" He is still haunted, he says, by the photograph of his father dead in his car. If there is a shooting elsewhere in the world, he braces himself for his phone to ring. ""As soon as there's been a shooting, some journalist will call. ""And I hear the arguments of the gun lobby, who want to preserve the right to bear arms, and I think: 'You should come here and see what guns did to Hungerford.'"" Chief Inspector Laurie Fray and PC Colin Lilley hold Ryan's murder weapons The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 was passed in the wake of the massacre. It banned the ownership of semi-automatic firearms and pump-action weapons and made registration mandatory for shotgun owners. A Thames Valley Police report to the Home Office found that - given the limitations imposed by the remote location and the difficulties in radio and telephone communication - the force's response ""went well"". The local police station had only two working phone lines that day and the police helicopter was being repaired, delaying its deployment. Further delays were caused by the firearms squad being in training about 40 miles away. The report also said the operation was hampered by press helicopters making so much noise it was difficult for police on the ground to hear or relay instructions. Hungerford is a pretty canalside town famous for its antiques shops and upmarket boutiques. Its inhabitants refer to the shooting as ""The Tragedy"", almost as if it were a natural disaster. The names of the 16 people who were killed are listed on a stone set into the wall of the town's war memorial garden, with no mention of how they died. The town had long been a tourist destination. After the murders, though, visitors were less satisfied by remaining in the attractive main street. ""The tourist buses would just park where they usually did and then people used to come up here on foot,"" Trevor Jackson says. ""They were looking for bullet holes and spent shell cases to collect. Whenever they asked me where it all happened I'd say it was down the A4. Sent them away."" The description of the shootings as a ""tragedy"" doesn’t sit well with Mrs Jackson. ""It was a massacre,"" she says. ""There’s no two ways about it. ""We cope by taking every day as it comes. It's difficult. Healthwise, we're struggling. ""Ivor has very limited mobility, and his lungs are damaged from the bullet. I still get dreadful pain in my back. Trevor can't move out to his own place. ""It hasn't got any easier. We’re just waiting until life gets back to normal. ""It hasn't happened yet."" Built with Shorthand"
Should Washington and Jefferson monuments come down?,"This article contains language that some readers may find offensive. President Donald Trump's argument that the removal of Confederate statues is a slippery slope to changing history has recharged the perennial debate about America's tormented racial legacy. ""So this week it's Robert E Lee,"" he said on Tuesday of the rebel general's monument that was a flashpoint for last Saturday's violent rally in Virginia. ""I wonder, is it George Washington next week?"" he asked journalists at Trump Tower. ""And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?"" Let's put aside for a moment the irony that Lee may well have supported Charlottesville's plans to remove his bronze likeness, given that he urged the country to ""obliterate the marks of civil strife"" and refrain from erecting such monuments. As President Trump pointed out, George Washington was a slaveholder. So might the stone obelisk dedicated to the father of the nation, looming over the heart of his eponymous capital city, be the next battleground in the US culture wars? Or even Mount Rushmore? Washington conceded the system of human bondage that underpinned the economy of 18th Century Virginia was a ""wicked, cruel and unnatural trade"". He was the only founding father and commander-in-chief to liberate his slaves - he owned more than 300 - when he died. But as Ron Chernow's magisterial biography Washington: A Life makes clear, while he lived, the nation's first president extracted his pound of flesh from those whom he preferred to call his ""servants"", or ""family"". Washington saw himself as a benevolent master, but he did not tolerate suspected shirkers on his farm, even when they were pregnant, elderly or crippled. This 1851 painting portrays Washington as a simple farmer He once scolded a slave who pleaded that he could not work because his arm was in a sling. As Chernow writes, Washington picked up a rake and demonstrated how to use it with one arm. ""If you use your hand to eat,"" he said, ""why can't you use it to work?"" He was not averse to shipping refractory slaves to the West Indies, such as one man named Waggoner Jack, where the tropical climate and relentless toil in sugarcane brakes tended to abbreviate life expectancy. ""There are few Negroes who will work unless there be a constant eye on them,"" Washington advised one overseer, warning of their ""idleness and deceit"" unless treated firmly. Washington, Chernow notes, wholly approved in 1793 when one of his estate managers, Anthony Whitting, whipped a slave named Charlotte. Martha, the president's wife, had deemed her to be ""indolent"". ""Your treatment of Charlotte was very proper,"" Washington wrote, ""and if she or any other of the servants will not do their duty by fair means, or are impertinent, correction (as the only alternative) must be administered."" Washington badgered Whitting to keep another slave named Gunner hard at work to ""continue throwing up brick earth"". Gunner was 83 years old. With his Mount Vernon plantation creaking under financial pressure owing to his long absences serving the country, Washington would fire off angry letters to his overseers insisting on greater crop productivity. Given these reprimands it is perhaps hardly surprising that another of his estate managers, Hiland Crow, was notorious for brutally flogging slaves. In early 1788 the Potomac river froze over for five weeks, but even with nine inches of snow on the ground, Washington did not spare them from gruelling outdoor labour. He sent the female slaves to dig up tree stumps from a frozen swamp. During this Arctic snap, Washington ventured to ride out and inspect his farms, but noted in his diary that, ""finding the cold disagreeable I returned"". When some of his slaves absconded during the Revolutionary War to find protection - humiliatingly, for him - with the enemy, Washington did not let up in his efforts to reclaim what he saw as his property. Charlottesville victim's mum rebukes Trump A White House meltdown in the making What made Trump remarks so offensive? One internal British memo portrayed him after victory as demanding the runaways be returned ""with all the grossness and ferocity of a captain of banditti"". The British refused. Whenever George and Martha's bondmen and women did flee, the first couple seemed to regard them as disloyal ingrates. In one runaway notice Washington posted in a newspaper, he wrote that a slave named Caesar had escaped ""without any cause whatever"". That these enslaved human beings might thirst for freedom, or even the opportunity to learn to read and write, did not seem to occur to him. Professor Joseph Ellis, author of American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson, says of the founding fathers: ""They could imagine a nation-sized republic, which nobody else had ever done before. ""They could imagine the separation of church and state, which nobody else had ever done before. ""They could imagine a government based on checks and balances that prohibit any form of dictatorship at the presidential level. Nobody had ever done that before. The Jefferson Memorial is one Washington DC's main landmarks ""They could imagine power flowing from the people upwards, rather than from God downward. ""All those unbelievable acts of imagination. The most creative political group in American history. We'll never replicate that. ""But they could not imagine a biracial society."" Jefferson, as every American schoolchild knows, is the nation's third president, and a genius political theoretician who penned arguably the five most important words in modern history - ""all men are created equal"" - in the 1776 Declaration of Independence. He also owned up to 140 slaves. A bon vivant who lived in luxury at a palatial Virginia estate, Jefferson knew America's original sin was a ""depravity"", as he described it. But his statements about black people are rarely taught in classrooms today. Here are some Jefferson quotes that visitors will not find on his memorial, a Roman pantheon-style temple to liberty where the Sage of Monticello's graven image keeps vigil over the Tidal Basin in Washington DC. To his friend, French social reformer the Duc de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, Jefferson confided that he envisaged eventual manumission to entail ""exporting to a distance the whole black race"". The duke wrote: ""He [Jefferson] bases his opinion on the certain dangerâ¦ of seeing blood mixed without means of preventing it"". And yet Jefferson, historians say, fathered up to six children by one of his mixed-race slaves, Sally Hemings. In his book Notes on the State of Virginia, he prophesied a race war in America and ""convulsions which will probably never end but on the extermination of the one or the other race"". Jefferson also opined in this work that black people's ""unfortunate difference of color"" made them less beautiful than whites. ""They are more ardent after their female,"" he continued, ""but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. ""Their griefs are transientâ¦ in reason much inferior."" And so on. This video can not be played What Trump said versus what I saw - by the BBC's Joel Gunter Professor Ellis believes a plaque should be put up at the Jefferson Memorial to correct the record and admit some of the Declaration author's less savoury statements. ""Jefferson embodies the inherent contradictions, a kind of self-deception, that co-exists in us, too,"" the biographer said. ""Given the relationship with Hemings, the fact that he refused to take a leadership position on ending slavery because of his fear of miscegenation, it makes his hypocrisy even more dramatic. ""He's got slaves who are his children serving him at dinner. But he doesn't seem to find that troubling. It's mind-boggling."" ""Racism is a chromosome in the DNA of the United States,"" Professor Ellis added. ""It's like cancer. It ain't never gonna be cured."" 'They tried to kill my child to shut her up' The statues that divide the US Confederate statute pulled down in North Carolina Should Americans therefore disavow these founding fathers as scoundrels and national embarrassments, or accept them as men of their time, demigods with feet of clay, who bore their imperfections even as they sought to steer their country beyond them? What actually is the difference between monuments to the founding fathers and Confederate leaders? Dr Clarence Jones - the African-American speechwriter who helped civil rights legend Dr Martin Luther King Jr craft his 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" address, four words that shaped modern America - explains. He says: ""Sure, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. ""There was no question they were morally compromised in their effort to fashion together this new country, a republic, based on the principles and precepts enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. ""But neither of those two persons led the nation in treasonous insurrection to overthrow the government they had formed in order to preserve the institution of slavery. Period. ""On the contrary, they devoted their life to saving and founding this country."" He says that commemorating the valour of the Confederacy is just as wrong as celebrating the soldiers of the Third Reich. ""What Charlottesville tells us is, it's no longer possible for the United States to ignore this unresolved issue of reconciliation over slavery,"" said Dr Jones. ""Trump missed an extraordinary opportunity - and he still has it - of exercising the leadership of reconciler and healer-in-chief for the nation today."" Washington and Jefferson are not the only American historical titans who can seem diminished when viewed through the lens of present-day values. Take Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator and Civil War leader who destroyed the South's slavocracy. He is immortalised in another neo-classical shrine on the National Mall. But as Hofstra University history professor Alan Singer points out, the nation's 16th president espoused racist opinions as his political persona evolved. He is quoted as saying to applause at a debate at Charleston, Illinois, during an 1858 Senate election campaign: ""There is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality."" Donald Trump and wife Melania at the Lincoln Memorial in January The Republican leader is also recorded as having tried to persuade a black delegation in 1862 that African-Americans should self-deport and colonise somewhere like Central America, arguing that it would be ""extremely selfish"" if they refused. ""The United States needs to have a general evaluation of who we are as a nation, so we can come to terms with our present by understanding our past,"" says Professor Singer. ""Nations need heroes to define who we are, to help us see ourselves in a better light. ""And the United States has heroes. But we tend not to see the warts. ""We tend to try to erase the parts we don't want to see. And this is a time when we have to look."" Sometimes, though, it can be hard to look. President Lyndon Baines Johnson is lionised as the signer of the 1964 Civil Rights Act - one of the greatest legislative accomplishments of any US administration - which outlawed discrimination. However, LBJ is also known to have frequently tossed racial slurs around the cloakrooms of the US Senate, according to his biographer Robert Caro. Johnson nicknamed an earlier iteration of the landmark act for which he is known as ""the n***** bill"". In his memoir, Capitol Hill in Black and White, African-American chauffeur Robert Parker relates a disturbing interaction while he was driving for the Texan. Johnson, he recalls, asked him whether he objected to being called ""n*****"". President Johnson with civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King Jr When Parker replied that he would rather be addressed by his own name, Johnson allegedly retorted: ""As long as you are black, and you're gonna be black till the day you die, no one's gonna call you by your goddamn name. ""So no matter what you are called, n*****, you just let it roll off your back like water, and you'll make it. Just pretend you're a goddamn piece of furniture."" But Dr Jones believes that LBJ, for all his flaws, understood that his duty as chief magistrate of the United States was to lead his country towards sunlit uplands of a more perfect union, to achieve the unfulfilled promise of its founding. The University of San Francisco professor is in little doubt what his old friend, Dr Martin Luther King Jr, would say to the current White House incumbent. ""I have no question,"" says Dr Jones, ""that the pre-eminent apostle of love and non-violence in the 20th Century would remind President Trump he has a responsibility to indicate to the nation what is right and what is wrong. ""This is not a time to engage in moral relativity. ""I really believe that President Trump is not beyond redemption, that he still has an opportunity to rise to the majesty of the office.""

Bannonism lives on in the White House,"Steve Bannon may be out as a senior White House adviser, but Bannonism - if that's what it can properly be called - is still firmly entrenched in the White House. Donald Trump, in a series of tweets on Thursday, bashed his Republican opponents and the media and defended Confederate Civil War monuments - the cause for which white supremacists and neo-Nazis marched last weekend. The president appears to be forcing exactly the kind of fight with progressive groups that Mr Bannon, in an interview with Robert Kuttner, the co-founder of the progressive liberal magazine The American Prospect, said he welcomed. Perhaps Bannon could hear the executioner sharpening his axe - but he was remarkably candid. ""The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,"" Mr Bannonsaid,external. ""I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats."" On Tuesday and again on Thursday the president made a decided effort to shift the debate from one about the acceptability of white nationalism - a gentle way of describing the racists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klanners who marched with torches and fought with counter-demonstrators last weekend - and onto more stable footing. A recentMarist poll,externalshows that a majority of Americans support (62%) allowing ""statues honouring the leaders of the Confederacy"" to ""remain as historical symbols"". Bannon may be out of favour but not his ideology While the survey question was a bit loaded (the other option was to remove them ""because they are offensive to some people""), the bottom line is clear. While Americans overwhelming reject racism and white supremacists, a debate over weather-worn statues cuts much more in Mr Trump's favour. Liberals will point out that the ""historical"" nature of the statues includes that they were largely erected in the early 20th Century, when southern states were codifying government-sanctioned segregation; that some of these ""beautiful"" statues, in Mr Trump's words, are accompanied by exceedingly racist text; and that local governments, reflecting the will of their residents, are the ones opting to remove the statues. That is all well and good, but if that debate also means Democrats abandon bread-and-butter economic issues, Mr Bannon's side will welcome the exchange. Why the fuss over Confederate statues? A White House meltdown in the making America - diminished and dismissed More than an issue of race, Mr Trump set up his defence of the statues as an attempt to protect a way of life under attack. ""You are changing history and culture,"" the president said on Tuesday. And inhis tweet,externalon Thursday: ""Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart."" With his ""ripped apart"" imagery, Mr Trump is playing into the anxiety of Americans - explicitly about the anxiety over cultural change, but those sentiments go hand-in-hand with the financial uncertainty and upheaval that has wracked the nation since the Great Recession of 2008. That was a central theme of Mr Trump's winning presidential campaign, an appeal to lower-middle- and middle-class voters who, even if they weren't personally devastated by the economic freefall and slow rebound over the preceding eight years, could see the chasm from where they stood. ""These are men and women who are, in the main, still working, still attending church, still members of functioning families, but who often live in communities where neighbours, relatives, friends and children have been caught up in disordered lives,"" was how New York Times columnist Thomas Edsalldescribes them,external. ""The worry that this disorder has become contagious - that decent working or middle class lives can unravel quickly - stalks many voters, particularly in communities where jobs, industries and a whole way of life have slowly receded, the culminating effect of which can feel like a sudden blow."" Mr Trump railed against change - a return to when America was ""great"". And the statue debate, as he's constructing it, snugly fits that theme. In his interview, Mr Bannon dismissed what he called ""ethnonationalists"" as a ""collection of clowns"", but that view seems more an attempt to put his liberal interviewer at ease. Elsewhere, Mr Bannon has boasted that Breitbart, the publication he used to head, was a ""platform for the alt-right"" - the anodyne term for the collection of white nationalist groups that have seen a resurgence in power and numbers as Mr Trump campaign gathered strength. Mr Bannon needs nationalists of all stripes - white, economic, even left-leaning populists and anti-trade liberals like Kuttner - for the new political order he hopes to build that will be willing to wage an economic war against China. This video can not be played Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's mother: 'They tried to kill my child to shut her up' ""To me the economic war with China is everything,"" Mr Bannon said. ""And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover."" Standing between himself and a successful prosecution of this showdown are global elites, including establishment politicians, the mainstream media, financial conglomerates and even Trump administration officials like Goldman Sachs executive turned White House economic advisor Gary Cohn. If these themes sound familiar, it's because they were interwoven into Mr Trump's presidential campaign, particularly after Mr Bannon joined the team in August 2016. They were also a central focus of Mr Trump's combative inaugural address in January. If one squints the right way, all of Mr Trump's recent actions can be seen as part of this overarching strategy. There's the non-stop battles with the ""fake news"" mainstream press. The seemingly unnecessary fights with members of his own party, including Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell. And the recent announced administration probe of Chinese intellectual property practices, with promises of more trade actions to come. Squint another way, of course, and Mr Trump's strategy devolves into the fits and starts of a chief executive who reacts to perceived slights and counter-punches whenever he feels disparaged. The embrace of the Confederate statues is a response to liberal criticism of his handling of the Charlottesville unrest. The feuds with Republicans are because they won't do his bidding. The media-bashing is because reporters aren't treating him with appropriate respect. This video can not be played What Trump said versus what I saw - by the BBC's Joel Gunter ""I think the president enjoys a scrap with the press,"" says Ron Christie, a former adviser to President George W Bush. ""I think he believes this is about him and the press and how he's going to beat the press. What he doesn't recognise is that the importance of being the president of the United States is to unify the country, to bring people together and to heal divisive wounds."" As Nancy Cook and Josh Dawsey writein Politico,external, Mr Trump's behaviour can be boiled down to a collection of anger triggers. ""White House officials and informal advisers say the triggers for his temper are if he thinks someone is lying to him, if he's caught by surprise, if someone criticises him, or if someone stops him from trying to do something or seeks to control him,"" they write. If Mr Trump's actions are part of a larger strategy, and not a fit of pique, there is also the question of whether it's correct to attribute this to Mr Bannon at all. While he appears more than willing to take credit for the strategy, the larger themes of the Trump ""movement"" - border security, aggressive trade protectionism, immigration reform and a certain kind of cultural nostalgia - were well in place before his arrival, as Mr Trump himself likes to point out. Mr Bannon may have given ideological focus to what was a flailing Trump campaign last August, but the raw material was all Trump's. And this week - as always - the man at the lectern, the man with his finger on the Twitter trigger, is the president. The ""Make America Great Again"" slogan isn't Bannonism. It's Trumpism. But whatever you call it, that strain of politics is woven into the fabric of this presidency.

Reality Check: How much does a degree boost pay?,"The claim:Graduates in a lifetime earn more than non-graduates by Â£250,000 for women and Â£170,000 for men. Reality Check verdict:Modelling lifetime earnings clearly creates uncertainties but the analysis is basically reasonable. It is an average, so there will be people for whom going to university is not financially worthwhile and some who will benefit even more. On A-Level results day on Thursday, there was discussion onBBC Radio 4's Today programmeabout the value of going to university, with several figures being cited. Universities Minister Jo Johnson said: ""Universities continue to deliver extraordinary returns for people who go. ""On average, if you're a woman you're likely to have higher lifetime earnings than women who don't go to the tune of about Â£250,000; Â£170,000 if you're a man."" These figures come fromanalysis carried out by Prof Ian Walker and Prof Yu Zhu,externalfor the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in 2013. It estimated the value of a degree over a lifetime from the point of view of an 18-year-old, by comparing earnings for those with a degree with those for somebody with at least two A-Levels but no degree. The figures they came up with were Â£252,000 for women and Â£168,000 for men (at 2012 prices). Those figures are adjusted for loan repayments on Â£9,000 per year fees and tax. Prof Zhu told BBC News that the way the model was designed meant the increase in interest rates and fees since the research was done would be allowed for and the figures still stood. The model also takes account of the relative likelihood of periods of unemployment during a working life. In England, students considering university currently face tuition fees of Â£9,250 per year and an interest rate of 6.1% on student loans Predicting how much people will earn in a lifetime is clearly not a precise science and there are significant uncertainties (see our previous article on the challenges of economic modelling). Also, this is an average, so for some people it will not turn out to have been worth going to university based on the financial outcome. Research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies,externallast year found that at 23 institutions for men and nine for women, the median graduate was earning less after 10 years than the median non-graduate. It also found that people with degrees in the creative arts earned no more on average than non-graduates. Another figure on Today came from Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, who said: ""Somebody who goes to university will earn on average about Â£10,000 a year more than somebody that hasn't got a degree."" That is a figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) comparing median earnings for graduates with median earnings for non-graduates. The latest figures are for 2016,external, when the average graduate earned Â£9,500 more a year than the average non-graduate. It is a figure taken from the Labour Force Survey, which is the same place from where the monthly unemployment figures come. But here's why it is not a great deal of help for somebody whose A-level results have just come out and who is deciding whether the financial commitment of going to university is a good idea. For graduates aged between 21 and 30, the ONS figures show the earnings gap is less - at Â£6,000. Also, it is not necessarily helpful to compare the earnings of graduates with all non-graduates because many non-graduates do not have the qualifications that would allow them to go to university. And it does not take account of student loan repayments or taxes. Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter,external Boys help to raise A-level grades A-level agony?

'Upskirting': It happened to me,"When a man took an upskirt photograph of Gina Martin at a music festival last month, she went straight to the police. But she was amazed to discover that there is no specific law against ""upskirting"" in most of the UK - only in Scotland. After the police closed her case, Gina began a petition to get it reopened, and now she is lobbying for a change in the law. Martin'sarticle about her experiencestruck a chord with many of you. We asked readers to tell us if they had been the victim of upskirting, and whether the perpetrator was punished. Here are some of your stories - names have been changed. It happened four years ago, when I was 17. It was a warm spring day and I was wearing a floral dress. I was waiting for the bus to go to college at 09:00 in the morning on a busy main road. A man walked up to the bus stop and came and sat down next to me, and then started moving closer towards me. I was aware something wasn't quite right, but every time I turned around he pretended to be looking out towards the road where the bus was coming from. You don't always have the confidence to say something, so I stood up and walked away. But when I turned around to look at him he was holding up his mobile phone. It was a video of my bum - he had been trying to video up my dress. He was showing me, as if he was proud of it, and he was touching himself at the same time. My initial reaction was: ""That needs to be deleted, I need to get hold of that phone."" I got angry. I said: ""Give me that now, you need to delete that."" And he ran off. I chased him but he was too fast. Then it dawned on me what had just happened - the seriousness of it, and the intrusion of my personal space. I was very upset. A man who had been driving past in a van stopped and came over. Traffic was slow and he said he'd got a good look at the man running off. The police came and took a statement and I went home - I didn't make it into college that day. The police asked for the outfit that I was wearing on that day, and I went in to make a formal statement at the station. A female officer interviewed me, but I felt like it wasn't serious enough, and that I shouldn't be there. When I was asked to identify the man from pictures I really struggled - none of them looked like the image I had in my head. I thought: ""What if I don't recognise him and then he does it again?"" I was told afterwards that the witness had picked a different person to me. I don't know if he was arrested. I still live here but I've never gone back to that bus stop. I found different routes to college. I'm still incredibly cautious of people when I'm on my own. People tell you not to walk home alone at night - but this happened in broad daylight, so should we just never go anywhere on our own? That's ridiculous. But that's how it made me feel. I can't believe that upskirting doesn't fall into some sort of category like sexual harassment or sexual assault. It's a violation of personal space - they shouldn't be allowed to get away with it just because we don't have a law against it. Debbie, 21 I teach in a secondary school. A few years ago I was called to a meeting together with some of my female colleagues and we were told that some pupils were being kept out of class because they had been caught using phone cameras to look up teachers' skirts. They'd been working as a team - one pupil would call the teacher over to ask a question, and while she was leaning over the table or otherwise engaged in answering that question somebody else would kick the phone across the floor while it was filming - then they were taking stills from the film and uploading them on the internet. It was horrific and quite upsetting - as you can imagine we had a thousand questions, like: ""Can you see anything in these pictures?"" But we were not allowed to see them. I don't think you could, because most of us wear tights, but the point is that these 13-year-old kids thought that that was an acceptable thing to do. The boys were kept out of school for a couple of weeks, and when they came back we were expected to carry on teaching them. I wasn't remotely happy with the way the school handled it. I felt like I'd been a victim of a crime, and my main problem was that I didn't feel it had been recognised in that way, and I wasn't dealt with in the way that a victim would be. It wasn't taken as seriously as if someone had stolen my handbag. For me it's the little things - I haven't been able to dress the same. I feel I have to put trousers on rather than a skirt. I'm paranoid about pupils with their phones or when they are asking questions - the trust is gone. I think it affects your day-to-day job and you need to talk to pupils about that so that you're comfortable going back into the classroom. Olivia, 31 We were watching a film on his laptop - his phone was plugged in and when the film finished I saw hundreds of inappropriate pictures of different women. I said: ""What's that?"" And he immediately jumped over to the laptop and spun it around so I couldn't see. He said: ""Oh it's just some old pictures. I'll delete them."" I wasn't sure how to react, especially as this was my first ever relationship. I gave him the benefit of the doubt. But a year later, I found a lot more pictures on his phone. I could tell that they were from our local town centre and from his gym, and that he'd obviously taken them himself. I was absolutely horrified. Eventually I got the confidence to leave him. It has caused me to have years of therapy, and I find it hard to trust my current partner. Alice, 21 ""My daughter was the victim of an upskirter "" It was about three years ago and my two daughters went to the shopping centre - they were aged 18 and 15 and it was a particularly hot day. A man happened to notice that someone was following them and he suddenly saw the other chap go up to them and, without them noticing, take photographs up their skirt and shorts. He was very upset to see this and he called for security. They apprehended this man and looked on his phone and realised he had taken several photographs up different women's skirts. The police arrived and were very concerned because they thought that my 15-year-old daughter had had a photograph taken of her. As it turned there wasn't a picture of her, but there was of my 18-year-old. The difficulty was that the police couldn't really find much that they could charge him with because she was an adult and it was in a public place. First of all they wanted to charge him with voyeurism but apparently that can only happen if you're in your own home and someone's taking a picture through your window. So in the end I think they charged him with something like public nuisance. He pleaded guilty and got a fine, and my daughter got compensation. So that was it really. The police took it so seriously, but they just didn't have anything that they could charge him with. It's happened to me as well. I had a photograph taken up my skirt on the Piccadilly line. I probably didn't sit down in a particularly lady-like way. I was reading the newspaper and the woman next to me nudged me and said: ""The man opposite's just taken a photograph up your skirt."" I was quite annoyed, so I took a photograph of him and as soon as I got to the station I gave it to the British Transport Police. They again were brilliant, they really took time and trouble to try and trace that man, but unfortunately they couldn't. The police do take this seriously but the laws haven't yet caught up with technology.

Why finding large women's shoe sizes can be a problem,"Finding women's shoes that fit can be a challenge if you take a larger size The UK footwear chain Jones Bootmaker was saved from administration earlier this year but its new owners are still closing a number of its stores - which is a setback for women with larger feet and few options. And I should know: as Jones is one of the few High Street staples to offer a larger than average range of big sizes, my local branch was the first port of call to accommodate my own size nines. Now it lies empty, the latest instalment in a troubled footwear history that sentenced me to boy's lace-ups at school and overhanging toes in any sandal since. With independent shops rarely stocking shoes above size seven and larger brand outlets offering merely one or two options - if I'm lucky -  finding suitable shoes remains the Holy Grail. Since the 1970s, the average shoe size of men and women in the UK has increased by two sizes, from a size eight to 10 and four to six, respectively, according to research from the College of Podiatry. The footwear industry is not keeping up with changing demands, says Dr Jill Halstead-Rastrick ""When size five was average the industry would think providing two sizes above to a seven was just about the fringe of adequate for women, but now that it's a six, we should be seeing far more eights and even nines as standard,"" says the college's Dr Jill Halstead-Rastrick. She believes the footwear industry is not moving with the times to accommodate a nation that is taller and heavier and so by evolutionary logic, has larger feet, and warns this is an issue that could be a time bomb for the next generation. ""Increased weight splays the feet and we are seeing a lot of adults wearing shoes that are too narrow or small. This is only going to become more of a problem as we continue to grow in stature - we need a wider variety of larger sizes."" It's a familiar narrative to Laura West of the Society of Shoe Fitters. She estimates around 30% of inquiries she receives are from girls aged around 12 unable to find school shoes above a size eight, and who have to wear boys' shoes as a result. Irrespective of any aesthetics this has serious repercussions for girls' foot health, she argues. The lack of proper shoe sizes can lead to hip, knee and ankle and neck problems later in life ""Boys' shoes will fit differently, and ill-fitting footwear does change [girls'] physiology. ""If feet hurt you shift your weight unnaturally when you walk and this wears out other joints and tendons leading to hip, knee and ankle and neck problems later on."" West believes the problem stems from the demise of British manufacturing in the 1980s, when many UK brands shifted production overseas to cut costs. This has meant less research into foot development and a deeper disconnect between the manufacturer and consumer needs, she says. ""When we produced shoes here we could run short production lines including larger sizes at little extra cost, but in an overseas factory you have to order in far greater numbers, which becomes cost prohibitive. ""Independent shops can't compete with low cost imports - and they would have been the ones to feedback the inability to supply certain items like larger sizes to their manufacturers' representatives. The extra cost in making larger shoe sizes has also discouraged some manufacturers ""Now consumers trawl from High Street chain to supermarket and the staff have little involvement; it is a self-service mass market approach and an 'if we've got it you can have it - if not tough' mentality, so manufacturers don't have a clue."" A focus on fashion over quality has compounded the problem for many UK women's shoe makers. By contrast the men's market has benefitted from higher-priced items such as Goodyear welted shoes which enjoy a healthy export trade to Europe, Asia and US. ""The price commanded for them makes UK production profitable,"" says British Footwear Association chief executive John Saunders. By contrast ""most UK women's shoemakers were operating in the volume to mid-tier market,"" he says, and were hit hard in the late 20th Century by increasing Asian competition, retailers demanding a greater share of profits and consumers turning to cheaper shoes. Switching UK shoe production to Asia has led to smaller shoe sizes, says Naomi Braithwaite China now accounts for about 65% of shoes made worldwide, and with this production coming from a country where the average female shoe size is a UK three-and-half, this virtual monopoly has hit shoes sizes. Former luxury shoe buyer Naomi Braithwaite, now a fashion marketing and branding lecturer at Nottingham Trent University, recalls how standard sizes of shoes at the company she worked for reduced after it switched production from Italy to China. ""Sample sizes were based on Chinese feet which are smaller boned and narrower. As well as this, many of the designers at the luxury end simply didn't like to see their shoes in bigger sizes as they didn't think they looked as beautiful as the more petite sizes."" The additional cost involved in producing larger sizes to cover the extra material and increased shipment weight is another deterrent for a somewhat already reluctant industry, she concedes. Retailer Long Tall Sally says women's size 10 shoes now account for 30% of footwear sales It's a gap in the market that Long Tall Sally, a specialist in fashion and footwear for tall women, has successfully exploited. Its shoe range starts at size seven and goes up to 13. Making shoes above a size eight costs the firm about Â£5 extra a pair because of the extra material, and it also uses a bespoke 'last' - a three-dimensional foot shaped mould on which each shoe is made. Yet it seems to be paying off with footwear growing from a 5% to 15% share of the total business. Size 10 is now its most popular size, representing 30% of footwear sales. ""Demand for larger size women's shoes has risen steadily,"" says Long Tall Sally's shoe buyer, Chris O'Shea. The other option if you've larger feet, is to buy German. Technology could allow personalised fittings - without the prohibitive prices of handmade shoes ""Germany is very much an exception - it has always had much better selection in larger size footwear and what they do well is shoes with quality, comfort and longevity'"" says O'Shea. While Germany still outsources production to Asia, many of its footwear brands retain head office, marketing and design in the country - with a consistent focus on function and quality over fashion. It's why Dr Halstead-Rastrick often directs patients to German brands. But she says the industry could better use technology to provide more personalised fittings without the prohibitive prices that handmade shoes usually command. ""You can even scan and measure feet via a phone app now, so surely we can't be that far off a situation where we can send our measurements to companies and say, this is the shape of my foot can you make me something?""

How much will you give me for my false teeth?,"If pawning the family silver signals a desperate need for cash, then what does handing over your own teeth say about your financial situation? A set of gold false teeth was one of the more unlikely items offered to pawnbroker Nathan Finch. ""It wasn't the most pleasant of transactions but we did the loan,"" he says. Jewellery is most common pledge as security for a loan, but during 30 years in the pawnbroking trade he says he has witnessed some more creative propositions from customers. ""Everything from designer handbags to Mont Blanc pens, and a lot of signed memorabilia; we even had people offer a racehorse and a fishing trawler,"" says Mr Finch, managing director of Pickwick Pawnbrokers. ""You never know what is going to come through the door. It can be a very small diamond ring in someone's hand or it can be a great statue under their arm."" This video can not be played A pawnbroker reveals some of the unusual items in his vault Through the thick, alarmed doors, in the cramped vault under his High Street pawnbroking shop, Mr Finch pulls out works of art, designer handbags, and even a Louis Vuitton dog collar. His experience is not unique. Across the UK, various pawnbrokers are specialists in Rolex watches, luxury cars or antiques. So why does anyone in possession of an Aston Martin or an expensive timepiece need to walk into a pawnbrokers' shop to seek a loan? ""The typical reason that a customer might use a pawnbroker is almost exclusively cashflow. It is not that they don't have assets, or that they don't have wealth, it is just that they don't have that money at that particular time. ""It could be school fees, it could be extra spending money for a holiday, it could be a crisis loan, like getting your car back on the road. It is a cycle of the need being driven by a crisis or some luxury spending."" Reality Check: Has personal debt been growing? Student loan debt: Five things to know Lenders told to be vigilant over loans Research suggests that day-to-day spending, and a need to pay utility bills are high on the list of customers' need for quick cash. ""Pawnbrokers tend to get people through a short-term cashflow issue and then the item is redeemed. I am happy and they are happy,"" says Mr Finch. Customer ""pledges"" an item, such as a gold ring for a set period of time, usually six months Pawnbroker gives 50% to 60% of the item's value as a cash loan Customer pays 7% to 8% interest every month An item can be redeemed during the loan period by paying back the original loan and any interest up to that point If the customer cannot repay the loan at the end of the deal the pawnbroker sells the item and returns any surplus to the customer More information is available from theNational Pawnbrokers Association,external. Consumer advice on pawnbroking is available fromCitizens Advice,externaland theMoney Advice Service,external This happiness may, of course, be short-lived. Failing to pay back the loan, and the interest charged on top, means saying goodbye to the valuable possessions. Even if the item is redeemed - and in most cases it is - then using a pawnbroker can be a relatively expensive way to borrow, says the Money Advice Service. ""You can usually only borrow a percentage of the value of the item you want to pawn. So if, for example, you have some jewellery worth Â£200 you might only be able to borrow Â£100."" Interest is typically higher than a standard bank loan but normally less than a payday lender. But unlike those loans, anyone with a poor credit history can access pawnbroking services as long as they have an item to pledge. The Money Advice Service suggests people who want to pawn should shop around for the best deal, and also: Choose a company that is a member of the National Pawnbrokers' Association, which has a code of conduct for members Ensure the company is regulated by the FCA Understand the value of the item you are pawning Be aware that a complaint can be raised with the lender and, if unresolved, to the Financial Ombudsman Service There were only 44 new cases dealt with by the Financial Ombudsman about pawnbroking in the last financial year - and only 30% were upheld in the complainants' favour. In the three months from April, fewer than 30 cases were recorded, registered as a blank on theombudsman's latest data,external. That suggests either a high level of satisfaction among customers or a lack of awareness of the ombudsman - or both. It certainly compares favourably to the wider consumer credit market, which saw complaints rise by 89% in the year to April, following a 40% rise in the year before that. The industry has a rich history, as this image of a Georgian pawnbroker shows Complaints have not mushroomed but nor has the industry. While the unsecured credit market - including overdrafts and credit cards - has grown rapidly in the last few years, prompting fears about a consumer debt bubble, the pawnbroking sector remains relatively niche. Just 4% of the adult population use a pawnbroker, according to Ray Perry, chief executive of the National Pawnbrokers' Association (NPA). Customers are more likely to be women than men (it is a 60/40 split), aged 25 to 40-years-old and in a job. Stricter regulation has thinned the number of pawnbrokers. All businesses with a licence to offer credit to consumers have had to be reauthorised by the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority. The process was long and intense, and many pulled out of the industry as a result. The NPA had more than 200 members beforehand, now it has 150. The combined loan book of their 1,200 retail stores is Â£700m, having peaked at about Â£850m, although the falling price of gold has played a part in this reduction. Nathan Finch also points to challenges facing the industry from the new technology and convenience used by money-lending competitors. ""A lot of young people do not want to bring in an item. A lot of business and financing is done on apps nowadays. ""Pawnbrokers are developing technology to be able to try to keep up with that. The initial deposit of the item will always be physical, but the way in which we can transfer money and communicate with customers is modernising. ""I think we shall compete with lenders for another 3,000 years."" He says ""another"" 3,000 years, because the history of pawnbroking stretches back three millennia. The Chinese were pawning their goods back then for shipbuilding, the cost of war, and exploration. Modern pawnbroking began in northern Italy in the middle ages, with the split of the Medici and their family crest between the bankers and the pawnbrokers, with the latter taking the three balls sign - a symbol that survives to this day.

âWe took birth control for shorter jail term',"A White County inmate sits in Judge Sam Benningfield's courtroom In a small county in rural Tennessee, inmates were offered 30 days off their sentences in exchange for a vasectomy or a long-acting birth control implant. County officials say it was a tool in the fight against opiate abuse - opponents call it eugenics. This spring, Deonna Tollison found herself in Judge Sam Benningfield's courtroom in Sparta, Tennessee - a large, neon-lit room filled with wooden pews for the public. Tollison was accused of violating the conditions of her house arrest, the latest issue in a lifetime of trouble, which at its worst saw her living in her car, addicted to opiates. On the stand, Tollison testified she'd been trying to get her life on the right track - she was off the drugs and raising her two youngest daughters, as well as the daughter of a sister who died in a car wreck. Relapses and run-ins with the law, however, kept stalling her progress, and here she was again, accused of making unsanctioned trips to the grocery store and allowing the batteries on her ankle monitor to die. She faced the possibility of another stay in the local jail. ""I'm a single mother of three beautiful girls and a brand new grandson. My mother is disabled. My sister is disabled,"" Tollison pleaded on the stand. ""Each and every one of them depend on me because I'm the only one with a [driver's] license. I love my family very dearly...the last four years I've done everything in my power to get my life back."" Deonna Tollison The hearing did not go well for Tollison. Judge Benningfield ruled that her continued missteps and her lack of employment made her unfit for home arrest. He ordered her to serve out the rest of her sentence in the county jail. Shortly afterward, Benningfield made a surprising announcement to the entire courtroom: a new programme would allow inmates like Tollison to shave time off her sentence - 30 days - if she agreed to sign up for a free long-lasting form of birth control. For the male inmates, Benningfield's new order would offer free vasectomies. Not long after Tollison arrived to the jail, sign-up sheets started going around to have an implant called Nexplanon inserted, which prevents pregnancy for up to four years. Tollison signed up, along with at least 30 other women. Over on the men's side, 38 men signed up for vasectomies. With an average daily population of 221 inmates, that represented a sizeable portion of the jail. Tollison first had to attend a neonatal health class which focused on the effects of drug abuse during pregnancy can have on foetuses. Then, a nurse used a special, needle-like device to puncture her upper left arm, and slide the matchstick-sized vinyl implant under the skin. The male inmates were scheduled for appointments with a local urologist. About two months later, after the local media caught wind of the programme, tiny Sparta, Tennessee, became the subject of national and international interest. ""The unspeakable evil of the Tennessee eugenics program,""one headline read,external. ""Judge Benningfield's eugenics program is an outrage,"" opinedone blogger,external. ""He need not serve on the bench any longer, and he need not keep his law degree any longer."" The US has a long history of forced sterilisations on the poor, the mentally ill, and on minorities. In surprisingly recent history, Native Americans, Mexican Americans and African Americans have faced sterilisation by force or under deceptive practices by members of US state and local governments. Though the US eugenics movement - which was admired by Adolf Hitler and replicated by the Nazis - reached the zenith of its popularity in the 1920s, states forced sterilisations into the 1980s. At one time or another, thirty-two states had a federally funded sterilisation programme in their prisons or asylums. Gay men were compelled into sterilisation if mental institutions deemed them to be ""sexual deviants"", as were mothers receiving welfare. In some places, sterilisation was a condition of release from prison. Individual cases continue to crop up around the country. In 2014, the governor of California signed a ban on sterilisation in prisons, after dozens of women underwent tubal ligations while behind bars, without giving the proper consent. Deonna Tollison's niece catches frogs in their backyard Officials in Tennessee argued no-one was forced. All of the inmates signed up, and the programme was cancelled before any of the men could receive their vasectomies. But questions of whether or not an inmate can make informed consent to such a procedure if it is in exchange for a lesser sentence could be the crux of the forthcoming federal lawsuits over what occurred in White County. ""It doesn't meet the bar for autonomous decision-making. You have built into it a hierarchical relationship,"" says Alexandra Minna Stern, a historian at the University of Michigan and author of Eugenic Nation. ""You can say people made a choice but that's why sterilisations are not allowed in federal prisons - the asymmetry of the relationship."" Can this US city go 72 hours without a murder? Crowdfunding to witness son's execution Two brothers, same murder, but one goes free. Why? The arguments could lead all the way to the US Supreme Court, where the 1927 decision approving the forced sterilisation of ""mental defectives"" is still on the books, and has been cited in cases as recently as 2001. Adam Cohen, author of Imbeciles, a book on the 1927 Buck v Bell case, stopped short of calling the judge in Tennessee an eugenicist, but said the programme itself comes dangerously close. ""It may be that this judge really thinks he's doing something helpful,"" says Cohen. ""That said, I am sure that a lot of people who do support eugenics like what he is doing."" When Tollison made the decision to get the implant, she wasn't thinking about her reproductive health, or the health of any prospective children. She was thinking about the little house on a winding road in the rural countryside of White County, Tennessee, filled with ailing family members and her three young daughters. Tollison's daughters Areonna (centre), Aleecia (left) and niece Makayla Seated on the cement patio behind that house, the yard around her busy with butterflies and winged ants, Tollison says her only reason for getting the implant was so she could go home. Even though she is free, it is a decision she now regrets. ""I feel like we were guinea pigs,"" she says. ""People will do anything to get out of there."" Sparta sits in the bull's-eye of circular-shaped White County, a bucolic part of central Tennessee populated by cattle farmers and factory workers. Over 90% of the population is white, with a politically conservative, church-going majority. ""Salt of the earth kind of people,"" says Brandon Griffin, a local defence lawyer with two former clients who got an implant. ""They're not necessarily the most fond of outsiders getting involved in their stuff as a general rule."" The local newspaper publishes every White County arrestees' mugshot in the paper on Thursdays, and around town it's not difficult to find supporters of Judge Benningfield, who took the bench in 1998 and has won re-election twice. Christopher Sapp, the owner of a computer repair shop in Sparta, said he lost his wife to an opiate addiction. A woman he considers a daughter to him is currently behind bars in White County over drugs. He heard she opted into Benningfield's programme and got the implant. ""I thought that was pretty responsible of her,"" says Sapp. ""[Opiate addiction] is terrible in this area. There's not a family in this area that hasn't been touched by it in some way."" Down the street from Sapp's computer shop, Mike Gilbert, the owner of a local antiques store disagrees slightly. He doesn't approve of inmates getting an early release or government getting involved in reproductive rights. ""I think a lot of times the judges in this world, they go overboard with things,"" he says. ""They step above what they're supposed to be doing."" In his office one morning before court began, Sam Benningfield expressed bafflement by the amount of attention and condemnation he's received. ""It was a real, total surprise to me,"" he says. ""No-one lifted even an eyebrow until cameras got stuck in their face."" Judge Sam Benningfield says he was shocked by response to the programme The people who end up in Benningfield's courtroom are there for misdemeanour crimes - everything from drug possession and driving while intoxicated, to thefts of under $1,000 or failing to pay child support. The maximum sentence he can hand down is 11 months and 29 days. According to Benningfield, the programme began when the state health department approached him about a two-day class on effects of drug use on foetuses. To entice inmate participation, anyone who signed up received two days off of his or her sentence. America's legacy of sterilisation Man who won freedom 88 years early set for deportation Forced sterilisation haunts Peruvian women decades on (A spokeswoman for the department of health said its employees had partnered with White County for the classes, but denied involvement in developing any policy. The department declined to comment when asked if their employees administered the implants). Believing that the next logical step would be to incentivise inmates to get reproductive services, Benningfield says he decided to write the order. He compared it to getting time off for picking up litter on the side of the highway, or agreeing to become a confidential informant for law enforcement. ""It occurred to me that many of the same women I had incarcerated were the very same from whom I was having to remove their children in my role as the juvenile judge because they were born addicted to drugs,"" he wrote in a statement. When the story began blowing up, Benningfield says he was shocked by the thought that an inmate would have a vasectomy for the sole purpose to get 30 days off a jail sentence. Judge Sam Benningfield in court He drafted a new document for the inmates to sign certifying they were not signing up solely for the reduced sentence. But by then the condemnation had grown to include the ACLU of Tennessee, other local judges, the district attorney and state legislators. Six weeks in, the judge cancelled the order altogether. According to county officials, none of the vasectomies took place. He insists that his intent was not to control who is reproducing in White County, but to prevent babies being born sick. ""My number one concern was about children,"" he says. ""To me a lot of controversy got started when everybody used the word sterilisation. Because it was never about that - it was never forced."" At one point, he crossed over to his desk and picked up a small stack of letters he received about the programme, ""all but one positive"". ""You are my hero!"" wrote one person. ""We need more freebie contraception in this country. Help these poor kids get on the right track. Most of all saving these unwanted babies."" ""Rest assured that the majority of White Countians appreciate your effort but many are forced to wear a gag - ironic isn't it, we are the oppressed?"" wrote another. And another: ""Your very considerate practice of offering a reduced sentence to criminals is brilliant and ahead of its time. Criminals are the last people on earth that should be multiplying."" Kristi Seibers Kristi Seibers has neither children nor a long rap sheet of drugs charges. When she went to the White County jail in February on a probation violation, it was the first time she'd been locked up. She usually got a free shot of Depo-Provera at the county health department every six months as her means of birth control, but when she heard she could go home a month early if she got the implant, she jumped at the opportunity. The side effects, she said, started almost immediately. A two month-long period. A vaginal infection. Cramping and weight gain. And Seibers said she never got her 30-day credit. ""The only reason I did it was they promised me days off so I could go home,"" she said. ""I don't think it's right."" Of the six inmates BBC News spoke to who signed up for the programme, only one expressed some interest in the potential health and family planning benefits of the free services - in her case, to help with her endometriosis, a painful uterine condition that can cause infertility. The rest said their only concern was getting out as soon as possible. The facility is on the brink of being decertified by the state for its chronic overcrowding, and multiple people described it as a dirty and unpleasant place. ""Voluntary consent is no consent at all if it's tainted with coercion from the government,"" said Mario Williams, a civil rights lawyer for the former inmates. ""You're really preying on vulnerable people."" David Stoll signed up to have a vasectomy, but ultimately decided against it. He believed that ""99%"" of the men he spoke to in the jail were motivated only by the time off their sentences. ""I don't want to say play God but they was trying to control something that wasn't none of their business really,"" said Stoll. Three women told BBC News that they wanted their implants removed, but were told either they had to wait 60 days or that removal would cost $250. There were other problems, including women too old to get pregnant signing up. Judge Benningfield confirmed that he heard one account of an inmate who'd had a hysterectomy getting the implant. Inmates also signed up for services even if they had no history of drug abuse, which Williams says proves the county was interested in preventing former inmates from procreating, not just protecting babies from neonatal conditions. Seibers was also not the only former inmate to say she did not receive her reduced sentence. Lawyers for former inmate Christel Ward wrote she also was not given her 30-day credit because her case originated in criminal court, not Judge Benningfield's general sessions court. Regardless of the fact Ward and Seibers were ineligible for early release, the lawsuit alleges, the programme - which the complaint calls out as ""eugenics"" - was offered anyway. In front of the Nashville federal courthouse building on Thursday, Williams and Ward appeared for a short press conference. The view from the White County Justice Center ""We're not going to stop until a judge declares this unconstitutional,"" Williams said. He said he currently represents 16 former inmates, and that the total number could double. There is a twist to Ward's lawsuit - she showed BBC News a copy of a wallet-sized card she said was given to the inmates after the Nexplanon implant was inserted, showing the date of insertion: 5 May, a full ten days before Judge Benningfield's order dated the 15th of May. It isn't clear if county employees were running some type of ad hoc version of the programme before the judge's order, and if so, for how long. The suit claims that White County Sheriff Oddie Shoupe, not Judge Benningfield, is the true creator of the programme, and that Benningfield created his order at Shoupe's request. Sheriff Shoupe did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The judge declined to comment further after the lawsuit was filed. Downtown Sparta, Tennessee Ward's case is just the first in what lawyer Williams said will be a string of lawsuits against the county, including those who were ""punished"" by not signing up for birth control. Williams argued that bringing down the legal hammer on White County is the only way to prevent a slippery-slope effect where the programme expands to other jails and prisons. ""People just have a negative perception of incarcerated people, regardless of the reason. 'These are bad people for society - who cares about these people?'"" says Williams. ""With all the racial tension going on in the country, those are real thoughts in people. If you don't kill it as soon as it raises its head, then it just festers and grows into something much larger."" Seibers wants her implant out as soon as possible, though it's not clear how she'll pay for it. As soon as she does, she should theoretically be able to have children, barring other medical issues. Since coming home, the 30-year-old got a job as a home healthcare worker, and was able to again help her boyfriend make the rent on their home and pay bills. But she feels different - she said her sex drive is gone. Her relationship with her boyfriend has suffered. She feels tricked by the county. ""I'm just depressed,"" she said. ""I don't want nothing to do with my old man."" Still, she holds hope the media spotlight on ""little bitty"" White County will bring about changes to the way the inmates are treated. ""I got high hopes that it will. I feel like it's going to be something big,"" she said. ""I think things will be done differently after this.""

"Reality Check: 15,000 trans people in US military","A new Pentagon policy that effectively bans transgender people from joining the US military and serving in their preferred gender has come into effect. There's no precise figure for the total number with estimates ranging from 2,150 to 15,000. So, what should we make of these figures? When President Trump made the announcement in July 2017, thattransgender people would be banned from serving in the US military ""in any capacity""a figure of 15,000 serving in the military quickly gained traction on social media, with high-profile celebrities such as Caitlyn Jenner and Barbara Streisand quoting this number.

The figure appears to come from a2014 study from UCLA Law School's Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy,external. It estimated that 15,500 transgender individuals were on active duty or serving in the guard or reserve forces. The report was based on surveys of transgender individuals, one of which collected data as far back as 2008, and suggested ""transgender individuals are more likely than the general population to serve in the US military"". A more recent study was carried out by the Rand Corporation in 2016,external. This research was commissioned by the US Department of Defense to help estimate the cost implications of allowing transgender individuals to serve openly, and its findings have been quoted in recent US government reports. The report concludes that in 2016 there were a maximum of 10,790 transgender people serving in the US military and the reserves. But the report also gives a wide possible range, with 2,150 as the minimum figure. To reach their conclusions, the researchers looked at all the available sources (including the UCLA study). But they say they faced a number of problems in compiling the data. Significantly, there were no official or scientific studies that gave an estimate of the number of transgender individuals in the country as a whole. They looked at social security data to look for changes of name and gender. Sgt Ken Ochoa has served as a man for more than a year Using the limited available information, they created an estimate suggesting that there could be between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender individuals in the military, out of about 1.3 million personnel. On top of that, they calculated that there could be between 830 and 4,160 in the reserves. So, that would make a maximum estimate of 10,790 and a minimum of 2,150, Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external James Corden hits out at Trump's trans ban 'My stomach dropped': Transgender troops hit hard by Trump ban Trump bans transgender people in military The secret life of a transgender airman At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Fears for child missing in Spain attacks,"The UK is urgently looking into reports that a child thought to have British nationality is missing after the Barcelona attack, Theresa May has said. It is thought the boy could be Julian Alessandro Cadman, whose grandfather has appealed for information. Tony Cadman said the seven-year-old had become separated from his mother during the van attack in Las Ramblas on Thursday, in which 13 people died. Mr Cadman, who lives in Sydney, has posted an appeal on Facebook. In addition to the 13 people killed in Barcelona, a woman died in a second vehicle attack in Cambrils, a popular seaside resort 110km (68 miles) south-west of Barcelona. Five suspected terrorists were also shot dead in the town. A ""small number"" of Britons were hurt in the attacks, the Foreign Office has said. Tony Cadman posted a photograph of Julian on Facebook and appealed for him to be found. He added: ""We have found Jom (my daughter-in-law) and she is [in a] serious but stable condition in hospital. ""Julian is seven years old and was out with Jom when they were separated, due to the recent terrorist activity."" According to his Facebook profile, Mr Cadman is from Gillingham in Dorset but lives in Sydney.

Spanish officer shot four suspects dead,"This video can not be played An eyewitness to the Cambrils shooting described what happened to Radio 4's Today programme A lone police officer shot dead four of the five suspects who were in a car that was driven into pedestrians in the Spanish seaside town of Cambrils, it has emerged. The occupants of the car had been wearing fake suicide vests and had knives and an axe, officials said. Seven people were injured in the attack, one of whom later died. It came hours after a van was driven into crowds in Barcelona, leaving 13 people dead and scores injured. Police say the van driver, who fled the scene, could be among those killed in Cambrils, but this has not yet been confirmed. ""The investigation points in this direction,"" said Catalonian police official Josep Lluis Trapero, but there was no ""concrete proof"". He added that, despite police training, it was ""not easy"" for the officer who had shot dead four of the five suspects. The car used in the Cambrils attack overturned The attack in Cambrils unfolded when an Audi A3 was driven at people walking along the seafront in the early hours of Friday. The car overturned and those inside then attacked people with knives. Police said four were shot dead at the scene and the fifth was killed a few hundred metres away. Waiter Joan Marc Serra Salinas heard the shots that rang out on Cambrils promenade. ""It was bang, bang, bang. Shouting, more shouting. I threw myself on to the ground on the beach,"" he said. The Mayor of Cambrils, Cami Mendoza, praised the ""speed and efficiency"" of the police response.

'Bigger' Barcelona attacks were prepared,"Spanish police have released pictures of four wanted suspects The suspects in the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils were planning one or more bigger attacks than those that were carried out, police say. They said blasts on Wednesday in a town south of Barcelona deprived plotters of bomb material, so they executed simpler attacks using vehicles to ram crowds. Police are seekingMoussa Oukabir,thought to be 17, and three others. Oukabir is suspected of carrying out Thursday's attack on Barcelona's Ramblas, where 13 people died. Scores of others were injured as a van driver zig-zagged along the famous tourist street. Moussa Oukabir, a Spanish citizen from the northern Catalan city of Girona, is suspected of using his brother's documents to rent the van that mowed down people on the famous boulevard. Hours later, police killed five suspected jihadists in a second vehicle attack in the town of Cambrils. A woman injured in that attack died later. Police said the men killed in Cambrils were linked to the Barcelona attack, which the Islamic State (IS) group said it had carried out. Spanish media, quoting unnamed police sources, said Oukabir was among those killed in Cambrils but there has been no official confirmation. Read the latest updates What we know so far Barcelona tells world 'I'm not afraid' Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has condemned what he called a ""jihadist attack"" in Barcelona. He has announced three days of national mourning and a minute's silence was held at noon (10:00 GMT) on Friday. Police say they are investigating the theory that the attacks were being prepared over a substantial period of time in a private house in Alcanar, a small town south of Barcelona. Explosions ripped through the building on Wednesday evening, apparently caused by exploding gas canisters. One person was killed. Some 20 gas cylinders were found by firefighters in the debris of the house in Alcanar The explosives were being prepared for use in one or more attacks in Barcelona, police said. Catalan Police Chief Josep Lluis Trapero said the actual attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils were ""rudimentary"" by comparison. The driver of the van fled on foot after mowing down tourists and locals on Las Ramblas. Catalonia's Interior Minister Joaquim Forn, quoted by the Associated Press, said: ""We had local police on the scene, but we were unable to shoot him, as the Ramblas were packed with people."" Two images of the suspect Moussa Oukabir have been published, and police later issued a composite photo showing him and three other men - Said Aallaa, 18, Mohamed Hychami, 24, and Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22. All are Moroccan-born. This video can not be played Footage shows police surrounding a white van moments after the attack Later Police Chief Trapero said it was suspected that the driver of the Barcelona van was one of the five killed in Cambrils, though it was not clear that Moussa Oukabir was behind the wheel. Spanish media say Oukabir rented two vans, the one used in the attack and another found hours later in the town of Vic, north of Barcelona, that was intended as a getaway vehicle. Spain attacks timeline Spain's long anti-terror experience His brother, Driss Oukabir, was arrested after reportedly turning himself in on Thursday. Reports suggest Driss, who is in his 20s and was born in Morocco, told police he was not involved and that his documents had been stolen. Three other arrests have been made. Two of the men are Moroccan, and the third was born in Melilla, the autonomous Spanish city on the north coast of Africa. How Barcelona rejects hate Police said three of the arrests were made in the Catalan town of Ripoll and one in Alcanar after Wednesday's explosions. They gave the ages of the arrested men as 21, 27, 28 and 34. A Fiat van was driven down the pedestrianised avenue on Thursday afternoon, deliberately targeting people. This video can not be played What was it like to be caught up in the Barcelona attack? Las Ramblas is a central boulevard that runs 1.2km (0.75 miles) through the centre of Barcelona from the city's PlaÃ§a de Catalunya (Catalonia Square) to the Christopher Columbus monument at the seafront. Aftermath in pictures 'It was very frightening' An American businessman who was just arriving in a taxi in Las Ramblas, said the van was ""weaving left and right, trying to hit people as fast as possible. There were people lying on the ground"". The vehicle overturned in the attack Seven people, including a police officer, were hit when a car was driven into them early on Friday in the popular seaside resort 110km (68 miles) south-west of Barcelona. A woman victim later died in hospital. The attackers' vehicle overturned and when the men got out they were quickly fired upon by police, media say. One was reportedly brandishing a knife. Police Chief Trapero saidone officer killed four of the attackers single-handedly. The men were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts, police said, and a series of controlled explosions was carried out. The belts proved to be fake, Catalan regional head Carles Puigdemont later told local radio. This video can not be played Footage captures people using a shop as an escape route on Las Ramblas Citizens of some 34 countries were killed or injured in the Las Ramblas attack, the Catalan government has said. One woman died in Cambrils. Confirmed dead: Spaniard Francisco LÃ³pez RodrÃ­guez, in his 60s Italian Bruno Gulotta, 35 Italian Luca Russo, 25 Unnamed Belgian Unnamed US citizen France's foreign ministry said on Friday that 26 French nationals were injured, with at least 11 in a serious condition. Thirteen German citizens were wounded, some seriously. A five-year-old Irish boy suffered a broken leg. Seven-year-old Julian Cadman has been missing since the attack Seven-year-old Julian Cadman, a dual British-Australian national who was separated from his mother during the attack, is missing,ABC Australia reports,external. His mother was reportedly among the seriously injured. Taiwan and Greece are among those saying their citizens were injured. Pakistani, Philippine, Venezuelan, Romanian, Peruvian, Dutch, Danish, Algerian and Chinese nationals were also among the casualties, officials said. What do we know about the victims? Alcanar, Wednesday evening:An explosion rips through a house in the small town, 200km south of Barcelona. One person dies. Police chief Josep Lluis Trapero said it appeared the residents at the house had been ""preparing an explosive device"".

A man is found dead in the car but the interior ministry denies earlier reports he was killed by police gunfire. The dead man is not believed to be linked to the Las Ramblas attack, officials say, but investigations are ongoing Cambrils, Friday 01:00:A second vehicle attack takes place in the resort south of Barcelona. Police kill five terrorist suspects said to be linked to the Las Ramblas attack Trump pushes debunked 'pig's blood' myth, hours after Barcelona attack Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent What looked at first to be a lone-wolf attack by just one - or possibly two - individuals, has now emerged as a complex plot involving at least eight suspects, armed with knives and explosives. That's an unusually large network for this day and age, where so-called Islamic State cautions its followers to avoid big groups so as to escape detection. It suggests both an element of careful planning by the perpetrators and also a failure of intelligence by the normally-vigilant Spanish authorities. Spain has not experienced anything like this since al-Qaeda staged multiple bombings in Madrid in 2004. But Spanish police, working closely with their Moroccan counterparts, have arrested dozens of suspected plotters in recent years, many with connections to the two Spanish enclaves on Morocco's north coast. Melilla and Ceuta have a reputation of being hotbeds of extremist activity and both have provided jihadists with a gateway into the Spanish mainland. Throughout the day online supporters of IS have been celebrating the Barcelona attack. Some have even expressed their hope it will change the course of Spanish politics, forcing the government to pull out of the US-led Global Coalition that is rapidly degrading what's left of IS's self-styled caliphate in the Middle East.

Police 'ignored singer abuse claim',"Ian Watkins was jailed for 35 years in 2013 after admitting 13 child sex offences. A failure to act by police examining allegations of child abuse against Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins may have put a child at risk of further abuse for months, a report has found. The IPCC said South Yorkshire Police did not take seriously claims Watkins had been sharing indecent images. It said three officers would have faced misconduct hearings over their inaction but that all three had since retired. Watkins wasjailed for 35 yearsin 2013 after admitting 13 child sex offences. More stories from across Yorkshire South Yorkshire Police said it accepted the findings and admitted its handling of the matter was ""far below the standard the public or we as a service would expect"". The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said South Yorkshire Police were asked in March 2012 by colleagues in South Wales to meet Watkins' ex-girlfriend Joanne Mjadzelics after she made allegations that he had sent her an indecent image. It said the request was initially wrongly allocated to its Safer Neighbourhoods team rather than the Public Protection Unit and, when Ms Mjadzelics produced her computer, the untrained officer neither viewed the image nor seized the device. Two months later, on 3 May, Ms Mjadzelics took her computer to Doncaster police station again and again it was not seized. Officers did not view the image until 11 May but concluded it was of an adult female and destroyed the laptop before Watkins was eventually arrested. Joanne Mjadzelics was cleared of child sex abuse image offences The IPCC launched an investigation into the force's handling of the allegations after Ms Mjadzelics complained officers had not examined her laptop properly, and that an officer had used inappropriate language towards her. IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: ""Having taken into consideration the nature and seriousness of Ms Mjadzelics' allegations against Watkins, the inaction of some South Yorkshire police officers involved may have placed a child at risk of further abuse for several months. ""The evidence suggests there was a general view among officers at Doncaster that Ms Mjadzelics was not to be taken seriously, and consequently inquiries were not progressed as they should have been."" Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police David Hartley said: ""Our handling of this matter fell far below the standard the public or we as a service would expect, and I would like to offer my sincere apologies to Ms Mjadzelics as she received a service that was unacceptable with no support."" Watkins, from Pontypridd, pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court to 13 child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby. Ms Mjadzelics, from Doncaster, was cleared of child sex abuse image charges.

Top White House aide Steve Bannon out,"White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is the latest top aide of President Donald Trump to leave his post. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that Friday was his last day. His exit follows a review of his position by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. Mr Bannon, who helped shape Mr Trump's ""America First"" campaign message, is returning as head of Breitbart.com, and says he will remain loyal. Bye Bye Bannon, Washington's second most powerful man Who was Donald Trump's chief strategist? The White House revolving door The 63-year-old is executive chairman of the website, which has been accused of voicing anti-Semitic and white supremacist views. In another departure from Mr Trump's team, billionaire investor Carl Icahn announced he was ending his role as the president's special advisor on regulatory reform, after facing criticism that his advice could benefit his own businesses. This video can not be played Some of the people who have resigned or been fired under President Trump Mr Bannon is known to have competed for influence in the West Wing against more moderate factions, including members of the Trump family. He told the Bloomberg TV network: ""I'm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents - on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America."" Mr Trump raised eyebrows earlier this year when he elevated Mr Bannon to the National Security Council, the main group advising the president on national security and foreign affairs. But he was subsequently removed from the council in a move that was seen as a sign of National Security Adviser HR McMaster's growing influence over the president. Mr Bannon has reportedly feuded with Mr McMaster as well as Gary Cohn, the director of the president's National Economic Council and a former Goldman Sachs chief viewed as a globalist. Mr Cohn, along with President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and daughter, Ivanka Trump, were viewed as threats to Mr Bannon's White House agenda. Steve Bannon may be out as a senior White House adviser, but Bannonism - if that's what it can properly be called - is still firmly entrenched in the White House. Donald Trump has repeatedly boasted that the success of his presidential campaign should properly be attributed to him, not Mr Bannon. And, in the end, Mr Bannon's desire to take credit for that win may have been what did him in. It certainly wasn't because of any sharp ideological divides between the president and the former head of Breitbart News. Border security, aggressive trade protectionism, immigration reform and a certain kind of cultural nostalgia - all were themes that Mr Trump ran on from the start, which Mr Bannon only sharpened and focused. They're also issues Mr Trump has pushed in recent weeks, even as Mr Bannon has been increasingly marginalised. Mr Bannon's firing will be seen as a win for Chief of Staff John Kelly, whose attempts to instil discipline in the White House will get a boost without the free-wheeling Mr Bannon roaming the hallways. Trump was Trump before Mr Bannon came on the scene, however. And as the rollercoaster ride that was politics this week indicates, the president isn't changing anytime soon. Mr Trump fuelled speculation when asked last week about Mr Bannon's future as he replied: ""We'll see."" Mr Bannon's interview this week with the American Prospect, a liberal magazine, reportedly infuriated the president. The White House aide was quoted as dismissing the idea of a military solution in North Korea, undercutting Mr Trump. He told the magazine the US was ""at economic war with China"" and that he aimed to push out moderates whom he believed were soft on China. Mr Bannon told associates he thought it was an off-the-record chat and did not realise he would be quoted. He has pushed for imposing additional tariffs on China and other trade partners to reduce deficits with those countries. He also advocated for a travel ban on citizens of certain Muslim-majority countries. Ms Huckabee Sanders' statement said: ""White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. ""We are grateful for his service and wish him the best."" Source familiar with the decision said Mr Bannon had been given the chance to leave on his own terms. Anthony Scaramucci, communications director - 31 July Reince Priebus, chief of staff - 28 July Sean Spicer, press secretary - 21 July Mike Dubke, communications director, 30 May Michael Flynn, national security adviser - 14 February This photo sums up White House turmoil Mr Bannon took over as chief of Trump's presidential campaign in August 2016. He was formerly a US Navy officer, Goldman Sachs investment banker, Hollywood movie producer and head of Breitbart News. The right-wing outlet that has boisterously supported Mr Trumpannounced his return,externalwithin hours. Breitbart's senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak tweeted: ""#WAR"" before Bannon made it clear he was staying on the president's side.

Two dead in stabbings in Finnish city,"The attack was over in a matter of minutes Two people have been killed and at least six others wounded in a stabbing in the south-western Finnish city of Turku. Police shot the suspected attacker and arrested him. They say they know his identity, but have not disclosed it. One of the victims, a woman, was stabbed several times in the neck on Friday. The victims were adults and three are in intensive care. Police have raided a flat and made a number of arrests overnight. ""We are investigating what their role is in this. Whether they had something to do with this act, or if they were just involved with this person,"" detective superintendent Markus Laine told Finnish news agency SST. The raided flat is in the Varissuo area of Turku, home to a large immigrant population. Earlier, Interior Minister Paula Risikko described the suspect as ""foreign-looking"" and linked the attack to the murder of 14 people in Barcelona. Finnish authorities have said, however, that it is too early to describe the incident as terrorism. The attack happened in the Puutori-Market Square area of Turku. Police said the alarm was raised at 16:02 local time (13:02 GMT) on Friday, when a man was reported to have attacked passers-by with a knife.

Why Trump thinks he can win on race,"Steve Bannon may be out as a senior White House adviser, but Bannonism - if that's what it can properly be called - is still firmly entrenched in the White House. Donald Trump, in a series of tweets on Thursday, bashed his Republican opponents and the media and defended Confederate Civil War monuments - the cause for which white supremacists and neo-Nazis marched last weekend. The president appears to be forcing exactly the kind of fight with progressive groups that Mr Bannon, in an interview with Robert Kuttner, the co-founder of the progressive liberal magazine The American Prospect, said he welcomed. Perhaps Bannon could hear the executioner sharpening his axe - but he was remarkably candid. ""The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,"" Mr Bannonsaid,external. ""I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats."" On Tuesday and again on Thursday the president made a decided effort to shift the debate from one about the acceptability of white nationalism - a gentle way of describing the racists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klanners who marched with torches and fought with counter-demonstrators last weekend - and onto more stable footing. A recentMarist poll,externalshows that a majority of Americans support (62%) allowing ""statues honouring the leaders of the Confederacy"" to ""remain as historical symbols"". Bannon may be out of favour but not his ideology While the survey question was a bit loaded (the other option was to remove them ""because they are offensive to some people""), the bottom line is clear. While Americans overwhelming reject racism and white supremacists, a debate over weather-worn statues cuts much more in Mr Trump's favour. Liberals will point out that the ""historical"" nature of the statues includes that they were largely erected in the early 20th Century, when southern states were codifying government-sanctioned segregation; that some of these ""beautiful"" statues, in Mr Trump's words, are accompanied by exceedingly racist text; and that local governments, reflecting the will of their residents, are the ones opting to remove the statues. That is all well and good, but if that debate also means Democrats abandon bread-and-butter economic issues, Mr Bannon's side will welcome the exchange. Why the fuss over Confederate statues? A White House meltdown in the making America - diminished and dismissed More than an issue of race, Mr Trump set up his defence of the statues as an attempt to protect a way of life under attack. ""You are changing history and culture,"" the president said on Tuesday. And inhis tweet,externalon Thursday: ""Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart."" With his ""ripped apart"" imagery, Mr Trump is playing into the anxiety of Americans - explicitly about the anxiety over cultural change, but those sentiments go hand-in-hand with the financial uncertainty and upheaval that has wracked the nation since the Great Recession of 2008. That was a central theme of Mr Trump's winning presidential campaign, an appeal to lower-middle- and middle-class voters who, even if they weren't personally devastated by the economic freefall and slow rebound over the preceding eight years, could see the chasm from where they stood. ""These are men and women who are, in the main, still working, still attending church, still members of functioning families, but who often live in communities where neighbours, relatives, friends and children have been caught up in disordered lives,"" was how New York Times columnist Thomas Edsalldescribes them,external. ""The worry that this disorder has become contagious - that decent working or middle class lives can unravel quickly - stalks many voters, particularly in communities where jobs, industries and a whole way of life have slowly receded, the culminating effect of which can feel like a sudden blow."" Mr Trump railed against change - a return to when America was ""great"". And the statue debate, as he's constructing it, snugly fits that theme. In his interview, Mr Bannon dismissed what he called ""ethnonationalists"" as a ""collection of clowns"", but that view seems more an attempt to put his liberal interviewer at ease. Elsewhere, Mr Bannon has boasted that Breitbart, the publication he used to head, was a ""platform for the alt-right"" - the anodyne term for the collection of white nationalist groups that have seen a resurgence in power and numbers as Mr Trump campaign gathered strength. Mr Bannon needs nationalists of all stripes - white, economic, even left-leaning populists and anti-trade liberals like Kuttner - for the new political order he hopes to build that will be willing to wage an economic war against China. This video can not be played Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's mother: 'They tried to kill my child to shut her up' ""To me the economic war with China is everything,"" Mr Bannon said. ""And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover."" Standing between himself and a successful prosecution of this showdown are global elites, including establishment politicians, the mainstream media, financial conglomerates and even Trump administration officials like Goldman Sachs executive turned White House economic advisor Gary Cohn. If these themes sound familiar, it's because they were interwoven into Mr Trump's presidential campaign, particularly after Mr Bannon joined the team in August 2016. They were also a central focus of Mr Trump's combative inaugural address in January. If one squints the right way, all of Mr Trump's recent actions can be seen as part of this overarching strategy. There's the non-stop battles with the ""fake news"" mainstream press. The seemingly unnecessary fights with members of his own party, including Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell. And the recent announced administration probe of Chinese intellectual property practices, with promises of more trade actions to come. Squint another way, of course, and Mr Trump's strategy devolves into the fits and starts of a chief executive who reacts to perceived slights and counter-punches whenever he feels disparaged. The embrace of the Confederate statues is a response to liberal criticism of his handling of the Charlottesville unrest. The feuds with Republicans are because they won't do his bidding. The media-bashing is because reporters aren't treating him with appropriate respect. This video can not be played What Trump said versus what I saw - by the BBC's Joel Gunter ""I think the president enjoys a scrap with the press,"" says Ron Christie, a former adviser to President George W Bush. ""I think he believes this is about him and the press and how he's going to beat the press. What he doesn't recognise is that the importance of being the president of the United States is to unify the country, to bring people together and to heal divisive wounds."" As Nancy Cook and Josh Dawsey writein Politico,external, Mr Trump's behaviour can be boiled down to a collection of anger triggers. ""White House officials and informal advisers say the triggers for his temper are if he thinks someone is lying to him, if he's caught by surprise, if someone criticises him, or if someone stops him from trying to do something or seeks to control him,"" they write. If Mr Trump's actions are part of a larger strategy, and not a fit of pique, there is also the question of whether it's correct to attribute this to Mr Bannon at all. While he appears more than willing to take credit for the strategy, the larger themes of the Trump ""movement"" - border security, aggressive trade protectionism, immigration reform and a certain kind of cultural nostalgia - were well in place before his arrival, as Mr Trump himself likes to point out. Mr Bannon may have given ideological focus to what was a flailing Trump campaign last August, but the raw material was all Trump's. And this week - as always - the man at the lectern, the man with his finger on the Twitter trigger, is the president. The ""Make America Great Again"" slogan isn't Bannonism. It's Trumpism. But whatever you call it, that strain of politics is woven into the fabric of this presidency.

Why the fuss over Confederate statues?,"Statues of generals Lee and Jackson in Baltimore were removed earlier this week It's been over 150 years since the last shots were fired in the US Civil War, but a debate still rages over how history will remember the losing side. Hundreds of statues dedicated to the Confederacy - the southern states which revolted against the US government - exist all throughout the United States, and often serve as an offensive reminder of America's history of slavery and racial oppression. Recent decisions by local governments to remove those memorials has triggered a backlash from a vocal group of Americans who see their removal as an attempt to subvert US history and southern culture. President Donald Trump waded into the debate on Thursday, tweeting that the controversial monuments are ""beautiful"" and bemoaning that their beauty would be ""greatly missed"" from cities. Most Confederate monuments were not built until nearly a generation after the war ended in 1865, mostly due to a lack of funds during the Reconstruction era. It was not until the turn of the century, as southern states began to enact so-called Jim Crow laws designed to deprive recently freed slaves of equal rights, that the monuments began to go up in public spaces. Why do people still fly the Confederate flag? When is it right to remove a statue? Democrats have called for Confederate monuments to be removed from Capitol Hill in Washington The second wave came in the 1950-1960s, as civil rights campaigners demanded desegregation and equal rights for African-Americans. ""The civil rights movement led to a backlash among segregationists,"" according to a report by the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate groups and civil rights movements. To date, there are over 700 monuments to the Confederacy - most, but not all, located in the South. This video can not be played New Orleans mayor on why Confederate monuments have to go Some memorials are dedicated to the foot soldiers of the Confederacy, and many depict famous generals such as Robert E Lee or Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. Descendents of Jackson on Wednesday called for depictions of their relative to come down in the Virginia state capitol, saying that the white supremacist protest in Charlottesville ""showed us unequivocally that Confederate statues offer pre-existing iconography for racists"". The phrase ""Monuments Must Go""began trending on Twitter,externalin the US, as users shared the descendants' open letter to Richmond officials. After the Unite the Right rally, which was comprised of Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi supporters, Robert Lee's great-great grandson condemned ""the misuse of his memory by those advancing a message of intolerance and hate"". The far-right marchers had nominally come to the university town to protest against the city council's decision to remove a statue of Lee. This video can not be played Critics see Confederate monuments as racially offensive Most defenders of Confederate symbols say they are not meant to memorialise slavery, which the South fought to preserve. They say that the war was fought for ""state's rights"" and against the federal system, adding that symbols such as the Confederate ""battle flag"" commemorate the region's history and culture. But most historians agree it was about slavery. Racial minorities, especially black Americans, feel that their presence in public life is offensive. Maine Governor Paul LePage said on Thursday that removing them would serve simply to whitewash history. ""How can future generations learn if we're going to erase history? That's disgusting,"" Mr LePage told WGAN radio, adding that removing them is ""just like"" removing monuments to the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. ""To me, it's just like going to New York City right now and taking down the monument of those who perished in 9/11. It will come to that,"" he described. Why do people still fly the Confederate flag? When is it right to remove a statue? Mr Trump has also applied this argument, saying that it will only be a matter of time before liberal activists suggest removing monuments to Thomas Jefferson or George Washington, because they owned slaves. This video can not be played Racism in the US: Is there a single step that can bring equality? In 2015, only days after the 150th anniversary of the Civil War was commemorated, a white man killed nine parishioners in an African-American church in South Carolina. Photos of the man posing with Confederate flags changed how many Americans viewed the emblems. No longer were they considered harmless symbols of culture, commemorating a rebellious spirit. After the South Carolina government chose to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol, many local governments followed suit by removing their own images. Now a second wave of removals are happening, sparked by the violent events in Charlottesville. Just this week, vandals have targeted them in Ohio, North Carolina, and Maryland. But some states such as North Carolina, where this week angry crowds tore down a bronze statue of a soldier, have laws preventing local governments from removing the monuments without higher approval. In a Marist pollconducted this week,external, 62% of Americans believe they should remain ""as a historical symbol"", and somewhat surprisingly, 44% of African-American respondents agreed.

Barrymore wins payout over wrongful arrest,"Former TV presenter Michael Barrymore has faced a lengthy court battle for damages The entertainer Michael Barrymore is to get ""more than nominal damages"" after claiming his wrongful arrest by police destroyed his career. The 65-year-old was detained 10 years ago on suspicion of the rape and murder of Stuart Lubbock in Essex. Mr Barrymore, who was not present for the High Court decision, values his claim at more than Â£2.4m. Essex Police said there were still ""unanswered"" questions over Mr Lubbock's death. Michael Barrymore: How the British TV king lost his crown A figure for the damages to be paid to Mr Barrymore - whose real name is Michael Parker - is yet to be set. Stuart Lubbock was found dead in Michael Barrymore's swimming pool in 2001 Stuart Lubbock's body was found in the swimming pool after a party at Mr Barrymore's home in Roydon, Essex, in 2001 Drugs and alcohol had been consumed at the party A post-mortem examination later revealed Mr Lubbock had suffered serious internal injuries, indicating a sexual assualt In 2002, an open verdict was recorded at the inquest into his death Mr Barrymore was arrested in 2007 in connection with the 31-year-old's death. Mr Justice Stuart-Smith, sitting in London on Friday, ruled against the force, which had argued Mr Barrymore should only receive a nominal payout. The judge did not decide on the sum to be awarded, as his ruling dealt only with the preliminary issue of the level of damages to be awarded to Mr Barrymore. Mr Barrymore's Essex home became the centre of inquiries into how Stuart Lubbock died The case centred on whether Essex Police had reasonable grounds to lawfully arrest Mr Barrymore. While Mr Justice Stuart-Smith found there was ""information available to the police that could have provided an arresting officer with reasonable grounds for a lawful arrest"" the one officer with sufficient information to carry it out was not there at the time the entertainer was arrested. That officer was stuck in traffic at the time, Essex Police said. As a result, said Mr Justice Stuart-Smith, the arrest was unlawful and Mr Barrymore was therefore ""entitled to recover more than nominal damages"". Michael Barrymore hosted a number of successful shows, including Michael Barrymore's Saturday Night Out Michael Barrymore was never charged with any offence in connection with Mr Lubbock's death During a previous hearing, a lawyer for Mr Barrymore told how the arrest had affected his client. Hugh Tomlinson QC said Mr Barrymore, the former host ofMy Kind Of PeopleandStrike it Lucky, was never charged with any offence and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) later made it ""crystal clear"" there was no basis for any charges. He said Mr Barrymore remained convinced that Mr Lubbock's injuries were not caused at his home but he did not know what happened. He added: ""This arrest was made without any proper evidential foundation. ""However, the fact that it had happened, and the worldwide publicity it received, destroyed the claimant's career."" In a statement issued after the High Court hearing, Essex Police said: ""Today's judgement must not overshadow the questions which are still unanswered for Mr Lubbock's family and friends. ""Sixteen years on they still need to know what happened to Stuart on that night, how he was injured, and who is responsible for his death. ""A small number of people know the answers to those questions and over the years loyalties change and somebody may want to help us at this time.""

Police ignored singer abuse claim,"Ian Watkins was jailed for 35 years in 2013 after admitting 13 child sex offences. A failure to act by police examining allegations of child abuse against Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins may have put a child at risk of further abuse for months, a report has found. The IPCC said South Yorkshire Police did not take seriously claims Watkins had been sharing indecent images. It said three officers would have faced misconduct hearings over their inaction but that all three had since retired. Watkins wasjailed for 35 yearsin 2013 after admitting 13 child sex offences. More stories from across Yorkshire South Yorkshire Police said it accepted the findings and admitted its handling of the matter was ""far below the standard the public or we as a service would expect"". The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said South Yorkshire Police were asked in March 2012 by colleagues in South Wales to meet Watkins' ex-girlfriend Joanne Mjadzelics after she made allegations that he had sent her an indecent image. It said the request was initially wrongly allocated to its Safer Neighbourhoods team rather than the Public Protection Unit and, when Ms Mjadzelics produced her computer, the untrained officer neither viewed the image nor seized the device. Two months later, on 3 May, Ms Mjadzelics took her computer to Doncaster police station again and again it was not seized. Officers did not view the image until 11 May but concluded it was of an adult female and destroyed the laptop before Watkins was eventually arrested. Joanne Mjadzelics was cleared of child sex abuse image offences The IPCC launched an investigation into the force's handling of the allegations after Ms Mjadzelics complained officers had not examined her laptop properly, and that an officer had used inappropriate language towards her. IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: ""Having taken into consideration the nature and seriousness of Ms Mjadzelics' allegations against Watkins, the inaction of some South Yorkshire police officers involved may have placed a child at risk of further abuse for several months. ""The evidence suggests there was a general view among officers at Doncaster that Ms Mjadzelics was not to be taken seriously, and consequently inquiries were not progressed as they should have been."" Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police David Hartley said: ""Our handling of this matter fell far below the standard the public or we as a service would expect, and I would like to offer my sincere apologies to Ms Mjadzelics as she received a service that was unacceptable with no support."" Watkins, from Pontypridd, pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court to 13 child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby. Ms Mjadzelics, from Doncaster, was cleared of child sex abuse image charges.

Man shot after stabbings in Finnish city,"The attack was over in a matter of minutes Two people have been killed and at least six others wounded in a stabbing in the south-western Finnish city of Turku. Police shot the suspected attacker and arrested him. They say they know his identity, but have not disclosed it. One of the victims, a woman, was stabbed several times in the neck on Friday. The victims were adults and three are in intensive care. Police have raided a flat and made a number of arrests overnight. ""We are investigating what their role is in this. Whether they had something to do with this act, or if they were just involved with this person,"" detective superintendent Markus Laine told Finnish news agency SST. The raided flat is in the Varissuo area of Turku, home to a large immigrant population. Earlier, Interior Minister Paula Risikko described the suspect as ""foreign-looking"" and linked the attack to the murder of 14 people in Barcelona. Finnish authorities have said, however, that it is too early to describe the incident as terrorism. The attack happened in the Puutori-Market Square area of Turku. Police said the alarm was raised at 16:02 local time (13:02 GMT) on Friday, when a man was reported to have attacked passers-by with a knife. Witnesses said he then ran to a nearby square and stabbed more people before he was shot in the thigh. Police said he was arrested at 16:05. Eyewitness Jesse Brown told the BBC: ""I saw police shoot a person, a man I think. People were running and there was talk about a knife attack, possibly multiple perpetrators.""

Nicola Sturgeon would change SNP name,"This video can not be played The first minister would like her party to have a name which reflects its civic nationalism Nicola Sturgeon has said she wishes she could turn the clock back and change the Scottish National Party's name. The SNP leader admitted the word ""national"" could be ""hugely problematic"" during a debate at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. She was speaking with Turkish author Elif Shafak, who said the word had a ""negative meaning"" to her. However, the first minister insisted her party was about self government and was not insular. Ms Shafak, who was wrongly accused of public denigration of Turkishness for her novel The Bastard Of Istanbul, told the audience at the sold-out event: ""Coming from Turkey, seeing the experiences there, not only in Turkey, across the Middle East, the Balkans, for us for instance the word nationalism is, for me personally, has a very negative meaning because I've seen how ugly it can get, how destructive it can become, how violent it can become and how it can divide people into imaginary categories and make them lose that cultural coexistence. ""Whereas when I come here, I hear the word nationalism being used in a different way and I felt that, can nationalism ever be benign? Can it ever be a benevolent thing? So there is a part of me that doubts that very much."" In response, Ms Sturgeon admitted: ""The word is difficult."" She said: ""If I could turn the clock back, what 90 years, to the establishment of my party, and choose its name all over again, I wouldn't choose the name it has got just now, I would call it something other than the Scottish National Party. Nicola Sturgeon was attending an event with Elif Shafak and publisher Heather McDaid ""Now people say why don't you change its name now? Well that would be far too complicated. Because what those of us who do support Scottish independence are all about could not be further removed from some of what you would recognise as nationalism in other parts of the world. ""Two things I believe that I think run so strongly through the Scottish independence movement are firstly that it doesn't matter where you come from, if Scotland is your home and you live here and you feel you have a stake in the country, you are Scottish and you have as much say over the future of the country as I do. And that is a civic, open, inclusive view of the world that is so far removed from what you would rightly fear. ""Secondly one of the great motivators for those of us who support Scottish independence is wanting to have a bigger voice in the world, it's about being outward looking and internationalist, not inward looking and insular. ""So the word is hugely, hugely problematic sometimes for those of us who ...but Scottish independence is about self-government, it's about running your own affairs and making your own mark in the world. ""So yes words do matter but I think we can't change the connotations that the word has in other parts of the world, what we have to do is just demonstrate through words of our own, through deeds, through actions, through how we carry ourselves, that we stand for something completely different to all of that.""

A-level agony? We answer your questions,"Catherine Sezen of the Association of Colleges and Kelly Fenn of Which? University answer your questions If you woke up on Thursday to A-level results that are not what you want or were expecting, we have experts on hand to answer your questions. With a lot of competition around, time is of the essence to get into university through clearing or decide on a different path into a career, so good advice is crucial. Catherine Sezen, a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges, and Kelly Fenn, manager of Which? University are offering personalised advice on what to do if you missed your grades - or, perhaps, got much better results than predicted. Well done on receiving some good results - but commiserations on your chemistry and maths results. You don't mention if you were holding a university offer or not but if that is the case, checkUCAS Track,externalto see the status of that offer. From there, you do have a number of options open to you. Would you consider retakes or repeating a year? Talk to your school or college about how they can support you with this route or consider whether you'd need (or prefer) to do your retakes somewhere else. Many universities will consider applicants who have retaken a subject and it pays to be up front and honest about whether something significant had an impact on your performance this year. Mention any mitigating factors in your future applications. Of course, there are other options entirely and the Which?guide on starting to devise a Plan B,externalmight be a useful read. Kelly Hello, well done on ICT and Biology. I would suggest that you speak to your school or college about your chemistry and maths results. They may suggest that it is worth asking for those papers to be remarked.  If not, you might want to consider resitting. Your local college will be able to advise on other options for you at this stage too. An advanced or higher apprenticeship in an ICT related company might be an option for you. I am sure that with your good grade in ICT and a D in Biology you will be able to find a suitable course or job.  Good luck! Catherine Well done on achieving the B grade. If you were expecting higher grades in the other two subjects it may be worth speaking to your school or college to ask whether they think you should ask to have your papers remarked. Otherwise you have plenty of options. You could consider retaking the two other subjects or your local Further Education college will be able to give you information on apprenticeships for example. Catherine Sorting the results, the wait is over Congratulations on a good set of results today. If you definitely have missed out on your top two choices today (find out if you still have a chance by checking onUcas Track,,externalor speaking directly to the universities), then you'll be eligible to enter clearing. This is the system that matches students not holding any offers with universities with available places on courses. I've had a quick look at the live clearing vacancies on Ucas and can see there are law courses featured. So, if you're willing to keep an open mind and consider some alternative universities, there are options available to you. Clearing places get snapped up quickly, so you'll need to act fast - but try to research courses first, to check the course available is what you're looking for, ahead of jumping to take up an offer. If you truly have your heart set on one of those original choices, it might be worth considering resits. Think carefully about this first - remember, a C is a good pass. I would also recommend contacting your original university choices directly to find out if they will accept retakes. Kelly Congratulations, that's excellent news. You can look for a different university of course throughclearing on the Ucas website,,externalbut you need to start doing that today.  Alternatively, you could try contacting universities directly. Remember that universities will be busy, so make sure that you have key information available and spend some time looking at websites to see what might be on offer at the universities of your choice. Catherine Hello, and well done on your results. Have you looked at theUcas website,externalfor more information about clearing options? As I am sure you are aware, medicine is a very popular subject. If you can't find a place this year, it might pay you to get some relevant work experience over the next year and apply for a place for 2018. This would mean you would be able to apply with confirmed grades and perhaps secure the place that you really want. One way or another, I am sure that with those grades, you will find a course that suits you. Oh dear,  I am sorry to hear that. First of all, you might want to speak to teachers at your school or college. If you were expecting high grades but have not achieved them, they will be able to give you advice on whether you should ask for a re-mark. You might also want to consider resitting your exams or alternatively looking at different options. Your local Further Education college will be able to advise you on the options available in your area. Some colleges run access course that enable students to work towards going on to university. College will also be able to give you advice on apprenticeship options. The important thing is to keep calm and take positive action. There will be an option out there for you. Good luck. Catherine If you're not happy with an exam result and think it might be incorrect, talk first to your school or college and discuss this option with your tutors. Any queries to examining boards will need to go through them. It isn't something you can do directly yourself (apart from in very specific scenarios). It's also worth discussing with other people in your year who took the same exam, to see if the marking overall was lower than expected for a particular subject or paper. You can read more about appealing against grades inthis Which? guide.,external New rules on re-marking were introduced last year that state marks can be changed only if an examiner has made an error in applying the mark scheme or adding up the marks, not for differences in academic judgement between examiners. Kelly Changes to the structure of A-levels have been rolling out subject-by-subject over the past couple of years in England. These changes effectively ""decouple"" the two qualifications. So in certain subjects (such as English, history and sciences) your final grade will be decided by exams taken at the end of Year 13 only. Students taking A-levels in subjects including maths and media studies are still following the ""old"" system, where AS results count for 50% of your overall A-level mark. So, it's fair to say that the changes have presented can be confusing and that's why we've summarised the A-level reforms in thisWhich? University guide.,external That said, your AS-level grades are still important for a couple of reasons. Firstly, any universities you're applying to in the year ahead will be able to see your grades and these may have a bearing on any offer they make. After all, your AS grades will be the most recent hard and fast, exam-based evidence an admissions tutor will have to go on. Secondly, your results will probably shape the predicted A-level grades your teachers set, which in turn will also impact the university courses you consider. Best of luck if you're receiving AS results! Kelly The results are a source of celebration for many and of misery for others Hi Rhian, First of all, congratulations on getting your results. The good news is that A-level grades are stable year-on-year as the exam boards use a process called comparative outcomes to ensure students taking new qualifications are not disadvantaged, so this year's outcomes should look similar to previous years' outcomes to employers. Good luck! Catherine I hope your son has received a good set of A-level results. You don't mention what grades he was hoping for, but in the event he's missed the requirements of his university offer, there are still options open to him. His first port of call is to checkUCAS Track,externalto see the status of his application. Boys help A-level grades edge upwards What's new about this year's A-levels? Malala Yousafzai gets into University of Oxford Grenfell Tower pupils enjoy 'good day' If he's only narrowly missed his grades, then he might still have been accepted on to his first choice course or on to that of his back-up insurance offer. If that's not the case, the UCAS clearing system will offer the potential for him to find an alternative course - and there are plenty of alternative university places up for grabs this year. Which? University has set up asurvivor's guide to clearing,externalwith step-by-step help to navigate this process. Kelly Hi Jonathan, Technical qualifications and apprenticeships are very important. The government is reviewing the whole technical education landscape so I think you will find an increasing emphasis on these qualifications and skills. However, some occupations require more academic qualifications than others and so university remains extremely important for many young people.

Lawmaker deletes Trump assassination post,"Maria Chappelle-Nadal said she posted the comment in frustration and anger A Missouri lawmaker is being investigated by the US Secret Service for saying she hopes President Donald Trump will be assassinated. Democratic state senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal posted the comment on Facebook but later deleted it. The Secret Service has confirmed they are ""looking into the comments"" and say ""all threats against the President"" will be investigated. The senator says she was wrong to write the post but that she will not resign. She had written ""No. I will. I hope Trump is assassinated!"" in response to a comment on Facebook. She told theSt Louis Post-Dispatch:,external""I didn't mean what I put up. Absolutely not. ""I have deleted it, and it should have been deleted. ""I am not resigning. What I said was wrong, but I am not going to stop talking about what led to that, which is the frustration and anger that many people across America are feeling right now."" Members of her own party were quick to condemn the comment with some calling for her resignation. The leader of the Democratic Caucus in the Missouri senate, Gina Walsh, said her colleague ""should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment."" US Senator Claire McCaskill, also a Missouri Democrat, said: ""I condemn it. It's outrageous. And she should resign."" The Republican Governor of Missouri Eric Greitens added his voice to calls for her to step down. He said: ""We can have differences in our country, but no one should encourage political violence. The senator should resign."" However, Ms Chappelle-Nadal insists she was exercising her right to free speech. ""I refuse to resign for exercising my First Amendment rights, even though what I said was wrong,"" she said.

Teen golfer scores two holes-in-one,"Rising star Joe Rooney hopes to fulfil his dream of becoming a professional golfer An Armagh teenager has scored an amazing two holes-in-one in the same round of golf. Joe Rooney, 16, managed the feat at a tournament at County Armagh Golf Club on Tuesday. It's hard to calculate the odds of hitting two holes-in-one but experts agree it is extremely rare. Joe said he went ""crazy"" after hitting his second hole-in-one of the round But even though the feat helped him finish his round three under par, it was not enough to win him the Open event. Joe, who has a handicap of two, told the BBC it was the first time he had ever hit a hole-in-one, let alone two. ""On the third hole I hit a great shot,"" he said. ""The ball bounced in the middle of the green, then spun out to the left and went straight in."" Sixteen year-old Joe finished the round at County Armagh Golf Club three under par ""I played on and was four under par at the seventh hole. ""The green is elevated a bit, but I hit the ball well - it only bounced once. ""You can't see the pin very well from the seventh, but it smacked the bottom of it and you just knew by the sound that it had gone in. ""We just all went crazy and began hugging each other and jumping around."" His remarkable feat of two holes-in-one was not enough to win the tournament Joe said his achievement was almost too good to be true. ""I got a bit nervous after that - I bogied the 10th and 11th, but birdied the 12th, finishing three under par,"" he said. Joe hopes to follow in the footsteps of other Northern Ireland golf stars like Rory McIlroy. ""Obviously it's every young golfer's dream to be professional, but I know it's very hard, so right now I'm just working hard and focusing on tournaments,"" he said. An earlier version of this story suggested that the odds of hitting two holes-in-one in the same round are 67 million to one. Experts disagree on what the odds might be; one mathematician suggested a figure of approximately a million to one, while other experts in sport science suggested that due to the number of variables and the lack of historical data (which, in itself, may indicate the huge odds against it), it was almost impossible to make a prediction.

Kit Kat accused of copying Atari game,"Kit Kat's maker Nestle has been accused of copying Breakout, the 1970s computer game, in a marketing campaign. Atari, the company behind some of the most popular early video games, has filed a suit alleging Nestle knowingly exploited the game's look and feel. The advert showed,externala game similar to Breakout but where the bricks were replaced with single Kit Kat bars. Nestle said it was aware of the lawsuit and would defend itself ""strongly"" against the allegations. Breakout was created as a successor to ""Pong"" by Apple founders, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. In the advert, which is titled ""Kit Kat: Breakout"", a row of people, of varying ages and appearance, share a sofa and play a video game during their work break. In the game depicted, a primitive paddle moves side-to-side to bounce a ball into a collision with the horizontal bars ranged across the top of the screen. Atari alleges that the similarity with its original game ""is so plain and blatant that Nestle cannot claim to be an 'innocent' infringer"". The legal complaint against Nestle, filed in a San Francisco court on Thursday, claims that the Swiss chocolate maker had hoped to exploit ""the special place [Breakout] holds among nostalgic Baby Boomers, Generation X, and even today's Millennial and post-Millennial 'gamers'"". Nestle's spokesperson said: ""This is a UK TV advert that ran in 2016. The ad no longer runs and we have no current plans to re-run it.

Massive manhunt for Spain attacker,"Spanish police have released pictures of four wanted suspects The suspects in the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils were planning one or more bigger attacks than those that were carried out, police say. They said blasts on Wednesday in a town south of Barcelona deprived plotters of bomb material, so they executed simpler attacks using vehicles to ram crowds. Police are seekingMoussa Oukabir,thought to be 17, and three others. Oukabir is suspected of carrying out Thursday's attack on Barcelona's Ramblas, where 13 people died. Scores of others were injured as a van driver zig-zagged along the famous tourist street. Moussa Oukabir, a Spanish citizen from the northern Catalan city of Girona, is suspected of using his brother's documents to rent the van that mowed down people on the famous boulevard. Hours later, police killed five suspected jihadists in a second vehicle attack in the town of Cambrils. A woman injured in that attack died later. Police said the men killed in Cambrils were linked to the Barcelona attack, which the Islamic State (IS) group said it had carried out. Spanish media, quoting unnamed police sources, said Oukabir was among those killed in Cambrils but there has been no official confirmation. Read the latest updates What we know so far Barcelona tells world 'I'm not afraid' Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has condemned what he called a ""jihadist attack"" in Barcelona. He has announced three days of national mourning and a minute's silence was held at noon (10:00 GMT) on Friday. Police say they are investigating the theory that the attacks were being prepared over a substantial period of time in a private house in Alcanar, a small town south of Barcelona. Explosions ripped through the building on Wednesday evening, apparently caused by exploding gas canisters. One person was killed. Some 20 gas cylinders were found by firefighters in the debris of the house in Alcanar The explosives were being prepared for use in one or more attacks in Barcelona, police said. Catalan Police Chief Josep Lluis Trapero said the actual attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils were ""rudimentary"" by comparison. The driver of the van fled on foot after mowing down tourists and locals on Las Ramblas. Catalonia's Interior Minister Joaquim Forn, quoted by the Associated Press, said: ""We had local police on the scene, but we were unable to shoot him, as the Ramblas were packed with people."" Two images of the suspect Moussa Oukabir have been published, and police later issued a composite photo showing him and three other men - Said Aallaa, 18, Mohamed Hychami, 24, and Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22. All are Moroccan-born. This video can not be played Footage shows police surrounding a white van moments after the attack Later Police Chief Trapero said it was suspected that the driver of the Barcelona van was one of the five killed in Cambrils, though it was not clear that Moussa Oukabir was behind the wheel. Spanish media say Oukabir rented two vans, the one used in the attack and another found hours later in the town of Vic, north of Barcelona, that was intended as a getaway vehicle. Spain attacks timeline Spain's long anti-terror experience His brother, Driss Oukabir, was arrested after reportedly turning himself in on Thursday. Reports suggest Driss, who is in his 20s and was born in Morocco, told police he was not involved and that his documents had been stolen. Three other arrests have been made. Two of the men are Moroccan, and the third was born in Melilla, the autonomous Spanish city on the north coast of Africa. How Barcelona rejects hate Police said three of the arrests were made in the Catalan town of Ripoll and one in Alcanar after Wednesday's explosions. They gave the ages of the arrested men as 21, 27, 28 and 34. A Fiat van was driven down the pedestrianised avenue on Thursday afternoon, deliberately targeting people. This video can not be played What was it like to be caught up in the Barcelona attack? Las Ramblas is a central boulevard that runs 1.2km (0.75 miles) through the centre of Barcelona from the city's PlaÃ§a de Catalunya (Catalonia Square) to the Christopher Columbus monument at the seafront. Aftermath in pictures 'It was very frightening' An American businessman who was just arriving in a taxi in Las Ramblas, said the van was ""weaving left and right, trying to hit people as fast as possible. There were people lying on the ground"". The vehicle overturned in the attack Seven people, including a police officer, were hit when a car was driven into them early on Friday in the popular seaside resort 110km (68 miles) south-west of Barcelona. A woman victim later died in hospital. The attackers' vehicle overturned and when the men got out they were quickly fired upon by police, media say. One was reportedly brandishing a knife. Police Chief Trapero saidone officer killed four of the attackers single-handedly. The men were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts, police said, and a series of controlled explosions was carried out. The belts proved to be fake, Catalan regional head Carles Puigdemont later told local radio. This video can not be played Footage captures people using a shop as an escape route on Las Ramblas Citizens of some 34 countries were killed or injured in the Las Ramblas attack, the Catalan government has said. One woman died in Cambrils. Confirmed dead: Spaniard Francisco LÃ³pez RodrÃ­guez, in his 60s Italian Bruno Gulotta, 35 Italian Luca Russo, 25 Unnamed Belgian Unnamed US citizen France's foreign ministry said on Friday that 26 French nationals were injured, with at least 11 in a serious condition. Thirteen German citizens were wounded, some seriously. A five-year-old Irish boy suffered a broken leg. Seven-year-old Julian Cadman has been missing since the attack Seven-year-old Julian Cadman, a dual British-Australian national who was separated from his mother during the attack, is missing,ABC Australia reports,external. His mother was reportedly among the seriously injured. Taiwan and Greece are among those saying their citizens were injured. Pakistani, Philippine, Venezuelan, Romanian, Peruvian, Dutch, Danish, Algerian and Chinese nationals were also among the casualties, officials said. What do we know about the victims? Alcanar, Wednesday evening:An explosion rips through a house in the small town, 200km south of Barcelona. One person dies. Police chief Josep Lluis Trapero said it appeared the residents at the house had been ""preparing an explosive device"". A Catalan government official says a cell may have intended to use gas canisters in the Las Ramblas attack Barcelona, Thursday 16:50 (14:50 GMT): A white Fiat van drives down Las Ramblas in central Barcelona, killing 13 people and injuring scores. The driver flees on foot Vic, Thursday 18:30:Police find a second van, thought to be a getaway vehicle, in the town, 80km north of Barcelona Sant Just Desvern, Thursday 19:30:A car is driven into officers at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Barcelona. A man is found dead in the car but the interior ministry denies earlier reports he was killed by police gunfire. The dead man is not believed to be linked to the Las Ramblas attack, officials say, but investigations are ongoing Cambrils, Friday 01:00:A second vehicle attack takes place in the resort south of Barcelona. Police kill five terrorist suspects said to be linked to the Las Ramblas attack Trump pushes debunked 'pig's blood' myth, hours after Barcelona attack Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent What looked at first to be a lone-wolf attack by just one - or possibly two - individuals, has now emerged as a complex plot involving at least eight suspects, armed with knives and explosives. That's an unusually large network for this day and age, where so-called Islamic State cautions its followers to avoid big groups so as to escape detection. It suggests both an element of careful planning by the perpetrators and also a failure of intelligence by the normally-vigilant Spanish authorities. Spain has not experienced anything like this since al-Qaeda staged multiple bombings in Madrid in 2004. But Spanish police, working closely with their Moroccan counterparts, have arrested dozens of suspected plotters in recent years, many with connections to the two Spanish enclaves on Morocco's north coast. Melilla and Ceuta have a reputation of being hotbeds of extremist activity and both have provided jihadists with a gateway into the Spanish mainland. Throughout the day online supporters of IS have been celebrating the Barcelona attack. Some have even expressed their hope it will change the course of Spanish politics, forcing the government to pull out of the US-led Global Coalition that is rapidly degrading what's left of IS's self-styled caliphate in the Middle East.

Spain attacks: What we know so far,"A group of 12 jihadists has been blamed for a series of attacks in and around the Spanish city of Barcelona, killing 16 people. Four men have been arrested in connection with the attack. A van mowed down tourists and residents on Barcelona's famous Las Ramblas boulevard on 17 August. Then a car was driven into pedestrians in the popular seaside resort of Cambrils. For days, suspected Ramblas attacker Younes Abouyaaqoub was on the run before police shot him dead. At 16:50 (14:50 GMT) on 17 August a white van zig-zagged down Las Ramblas at high speed, while the pedestrian avenue - 1.2km (0.75 miles) long - was packed with tourists. Witnesses said the driver tried to hit as many people as possible. Many were knocked to the ground while others fled for cover in nearby shops and cafes. The driver killed 14 people and injured more than 100, then fled on foot. The speeding van left more than 100 casualties in its wake along Las Ramblas Catalan police and medics were quickly on the scene. The police described it as a terror attack and later said one man had carried it out. They named him as Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22. Eight hours later, a black Audi A3 car ploughed into pedestrians at Cambrils, 100km (62 miles) down the coast from Barcelona. A Spanish woman was killed. The Audi overturned and five people got out, some wearing fake suicide belts. Four were shot dead by a policeman at the scene. A fifth escaped but was later shot dead. Aftermath of Barcelona attack in pictures Spanish police stop second attack It has since become clear the attacks on Las Ramblas and at Cambrils were among several linked events that began the night before at Alcanar, further down the coast from Cambrils. Two of the suspected jihadists were killed in an explosion at a house there shortly after 23:00 on Wednesday night. One was imam Abdelbaki Es Satty, a Moroccan believed to have been the ringleader. The other was believed to be Youssef Aallaa. A third - Mohamed Houli Chemlal - was injured, and is among the arrested. He is being held by Spanish authorities on suspicion of terrorism-related offences. The blast destroyed the house. Police found 120 gas canisters in the wreckage and now believe the house was being used as a bomb factory and headquarters by the jihadists. Butane and propane gas canisters were found at the scene of an explosion in Alcanar Catalan police reckoned that the jihadists had been preparing bigger attacks, and that the accidental blast forced them to adopt a more rudimentary plan - the van rampage. Houli Chemlal confirmed that that was the case, judicial sources said. He told the Madrid court on 22 August that Barcelona's iconic Sagrada Familia church was among the targets, the sources said. All four suspects have reportedly said the ringleader of the group was the imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty. He and most of the suspects lived in Ripoll, a picturesque small town north of Barcelona. CCTV footage showed suspected Las Ramblas attacker Younes Abouyaaqoub leaving the scene of the van murders and walking through La Boqueria market. CCTV footage appears to show Abouyaaqoub fleeing the attack on foot Reports suggest he then headed to the city's university area where he hijacked a white Ford Focus car at knifepoint and killed the driver, Pau PÃ©rez. He then crashed through a police checkpoint, breaking a policewoman's leg, as he tried to leave Barcelona. The car was found abandoned a few kilometres to the south, at Sant Just Desvern, with the body of Mr PÃ©rez on the back seat. He had been stabbed - the 15th victim of the Barcelona and Cambrils attacks. Abouyaaqoub went on the run. On 21 August, police were tipped off by members of the public who had seen a man of his description in the rural Subirats area, 40km west of Barcelona. Police were on the scene and within minutes the suspect, wearing a fake explosives belt, had been shot dead. Younes Abouyaaqoub,the suspected van driver, born in Morocco. He was among the jihadists who lived in Ripoll, 100km north of Barcelona. Abouyaaqoub, 22, was on the run for four days until police shot him ImamAbdelbaki Es Satty,45, died in the Alcanar blast. He lived in a modest flat in Ripoll. Belgian officials say he spent three months living in Machelen, a suburb of Brussels, before the March 2016 suicide bombings that killed 32 people in the Belgian capital. In 2010-2014 he was in jail in eastern Spain for drug trafficking, police said. Satty was described by locals in Ripoll as a reclusive, devout Muslim who was close to the Moroccan youths. The father of two of the Cambrils attackers has accused him of radicalising them. This video can not be played Inside the pretty town hiding terror suspects Driss Oukabir,28, is among the men charged in relation to the attack. He denied being in the jihadist cell but admitted having hired two vans, one of which was used in the Barcelona attack. He said he hired them thinking his friends would use them for a house move. Police found his passport in the Barcelona van - he claimed that his brotherMoussa Oukabir, 17, had stolen his ID. The younger brother was among the five killed by police in Cambrils. The other van was later found in the town of Vic and believed to be a getaway vehicle. An image of Moussa Oukabir, circulated in Spanish press and taken from social media Driss turned himself in in Ripoll on 17 August, with a judge ordering him detained on suspicion of terrorism-related offences on 22 August. The Oukabir brothers had Moroccan as well as Spanish nationality. The other four attackers killed at Cambrils wereSaid Aallaa,18; Mohamed Hychami,24; Omar HychamiandHoussaine Abouyaaqoub. Said Aallaa is said to have left a note in his room apologising for the harm he was about to cause. Two other men were detained in Ripoll -Salah el-Karib, 34, andMohammed Aallaa, 27. The latter is believed to be the owner of Audi car used by the jihadists in Cambrils. He has been released on conditional bail as there is not enough evidence to hold him, court papers revealed. A judge ordered el-Karib to be held for a further 72 hours to allow investigators more time. French police say the Audi was driven to Paris by Younes Abouyaaqoub and another jihadist on a short weekend trip before the Barcelona attack. Their motive for that is not clear, but they are known to have gone shopping. More details of the Barcelona suspects They come from all over the world, with at least 34 nationalities represented. People from Ireland, the UK, France, Australia, Pakistan, Venezuela, Algeria, Peru, Germany, the Netherlands, Greece, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Ecuador, the US, Argentina, Romania, Cuba, Austria and the Philippines are all reported to be among those hurt.

A three-year-old relative with him also died Italian Bruno Gulotta, 35 Italian Luca Russo, 25 British-Australian national Julian Cadman, 7 Spaniard Ana MarÃ­a SuÃ¡rez. Died in the Cambrils attack Pau PÃ©rez, 34, found fatally stabbed in car at Sant Just Desvern Two Portuguese nationals are also confirmed dead, a woman aged 74 and her 20-year-old granddaughter. An unnamed German woman, 51, died in hospital on 27 August. Jared Tucker, a father-of-three,was on honeymoonwith his wife of one year, Heidi Nunes, when he died, his father said. Mr Tucker had been enjoying drinks on Las Ramblas when the van struck him. Ian Moore Wilson was the father of a Vancouver police officer. His wife, Valerie, was injured. The mother of Julian Cadman, the seven year old killed on Las Ramblas, was also injured in the attack and is in a serious but stable condition in hospital. So-called Islamic State (IS) has said it was behind both the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks and that IS ""soldiers"" carried them out. But it did not provide any evidence or details to back up the claim. Spain is one of Europe's most popular tourist destinations, but in recent years has not seen the kind of jihadist violence that has rocked France, the UK, Belgium and Germany. Spain's long anti-terror experience Still, Spain has been targeted before - several trains in Madrid, the capital, were bombed by al-Qaeda inspired militants in 2004, killing 191 people and injuring hundreds of others. It remains Europe's bloodiest terror attack this century. This video can not be played What was it like to be caught up in the Barcelona attack? IS news outlet Amaq said the attack was carried out as part of efforts to target states fighting in the US-led anti-IS coalition. A few hundred Spanish soldiers are in Iraq, training local forces fighting IS. The number of operations carried out against jihadists in the country has increased significantly since Spain raised its terror alert level to four out of five in June 2015, meaning there was a ""high risk"" of a terror attack. Security was stepped up in the wake of truck attacks in the French city of Nice in July 2016 and the German capital Berlin in December. On Twitter, the Spanish royal household posted: ""They are murderers, nothing more than criminals who are not going to terrorise us. All of Spain is Barcelona.""

Police kill five suspects said to be linked to the Las Ramblas attack Trump pushes debunked 'pig's blood' myth, hours after Barcelona attack Gordon Corera, BBC News security correspondent Barcelona is just the latest European city to witness the terrible effects of a vehicle attack on an iconic or ""soft"" target. In Nice a year ago, Bastille Day celebrations were targeted, then a Christmas market in Berlin. In London, Westminster and London Bridge, as well as Finsbury Park, saw cars and vans used as weapons. In the UK, new barriers have been put in place to mitigate some of the risks at key locations and there is discussion of imposing checks on those renting vans, but security services in Britain - as well as across Europe - are all too aware that there are limits to what they can do to spot and stop those planning murder in this way. The weapons employed are readily available and there is little or no training, co-ordination or planning required. This means there are  few points where individuals can be spotted by the intelligence services. Although so-called Islamic State has released a statement saying what it calls its ""soldiers"" had carried out the Barcelona attack, it is not yet clear whether there was any direct link to the group or if they were simply inspired by its call to act. The language used often indicates the latter. Either way, authorities will be bracing themselves for the possibility of further attacks of a similar nature.

US Navy to discipline USS Fitzgerald crew,"The USS Fitzgerald sustained considerable damage The US Navy has announced that about a dozen sailors are to be disciplined after seven crew on the USS Fitzgerald were killed in a collision. The destroyer collided with a Philippines container ship in Japanese waters in June. The deputy chief of naval operations, Admiral Bill Moran, said the commanding officer and two other senior crew would no longer serve aboard the ship. He said the Navy had lost trust and confidence in their ability to lead. The Filipino-flagged ACX Crystal collided with the USS Fitzgerald in the early hours of 17 June in Tokyo Bay, causing a large gash below the water line of the destroyer and flooding lower decks. ""The collision was avoidable,"" the US 7th Fleet said in a statement, adding that ""both ships demonstrated poor seamanship"". The dead sailors, aged 19 to 37, were later found in their bunks, after divers gained access to damaged areas of the ship. The commanding officer was trapped in his cabin by the force of the collision and five sailors had to use a sledgehammer to break down the door. ""Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,""  a report into the incident said. The ACX Crystal sustained lighter damage to its port bow. There were no injuries among the 20 Filipino crew members on board the container ship. USS Fitzgerald crash: In pictures This video can not be played USS Fitzgerald damaged by the crash Investigations into the cause of the crash continue. According to maritime rules, vessels are supposed to give way to ships on their starboard side which is where the destroyer sustained damage, sparking questions over whether the US ship could have been at fault.

Where pensioners should go to be happy,"Its pleasures range from a visit to the stately Arundel Castle to flight delays at Gatwick airport. Yet it seems West Sussex offers retirees the best possible lifestyle. In a quality of retirement index, the county has overtaken Dorset as the top place for pensioners to live. The research, from Prudential insurance, is based on a range of criteria including access to healthcare, crime and the weather. The study looked at the 55 counties in England and Wales, but excluded Scotland and Northern Ireland. The south coast county is already so popular with the over-65s that it has the second-highest inflow of pensioners, after Devon. It also scores well for ongoing health, high pensioner incomes, and relatively sunny weather. West Sussex has beautiful countryside Wales happiest place to live in UK People in Fife are the happiest in Scotland Dorset was in second place, with East Sussex and Devon next in the rankings. Pensioners in Surrey enjoy the highest income, those in Gwynedd have the best access to healthcare, while residents of Essex get the nicest weather.

Mother wins MoD apology for Iraq death,"This video can not be played Pte Phillip Hewett, of the Staffordshire Regiment, was killed on 16 July, 2005 In July 2005, Sue Smith's son, Pte Phillip Hewett, was killed by a roadside bomb while travelling in a lightly armoured ""snatch"" Land Rover in Iraq. He was the ninth of 37 service personnel to be killed in the vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan, which came to be known as ""mobile coffins"". Following a legal battle that reached the Supreme Court, Sue has finally got her apology from the MoD. ""He didn't die for nothing,"" she says. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Sue has recalled her journey from the inquest process, to a victory at the Supreme Court, to the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War. It has resulted in a settlement of her case and an apology from Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon for failures that ""could have saved lives"". Sue remembered how Phillip had become worried about travelling in the Snatch. ""He wrote to his uncle saying that he was concerned that so many of his friends had lost their driving licences so they didn't have to drive in Iraq. ""One of his friends said, 'It's better to be judged by 12 than carried by six,' because that's how dangerous the vehicles were. But he wouldn't have refused. He would have done as he was told."" Sue, from Tamworth in Staffordshire, said that when Phillip, a fitness fanatic, came home on leave, he was a shadow of his former self. ""He spoke to his sisters and discussed his funeral and said what he wanted. He wasn't the same. His character was different. ""He wouldn't tell me. I think he was trying to protect me so I didn't worry. But I was worrying anyway. Had I known, I think I would have run over his foot or something to stop him having to go back."" The day Phillip died, Sue had a premonition. ""I got up to go to work and there was a breaking news story about three soldiers from the Staffordshire battle group that had been killed in Al Amarah by a roadside bomb. ""I can't explain it but I just knew before I went out the door.  And we were sorting out his birthday presents to send to him.  It's like something inside me.  I can't really explain it better than that."" Sue recalled that waiting for the body to be repatriated was the worst time, because no-one would tell her what had happened. The inquest into Phillip's death was due to last five days and Sue hoped it would provide answers, but it was completed in three hours. ""Quite honestly it was like a smack in the face. It was almost as if those three lives were worth an hour each.  It shocked me that it was so dismissive. ""Because by then I knew that (the vehicle) was what had to be questioned,"" she said. ""And it was almost like I was something under someone's foot and they just wanted to get rid of me, and it made me feel more determined because I knew there was more to be answered than what I got at the inquest."" Sue Smith (pictured third from the right) at a Stop the War Coalition march in London in September 2005 Desperate for answers about the Snatch, Sue founded a group called the Military Families Support Group with other families of service personnel. She was initially told by the MoD that the people in a position to decide, had decided that the Snatch was the correct vehicle for the job. She found the inability to get answers from the MoD maddening. ""Sometimes I felt like they just wanted me to go away or die,"" she said. But after yet another death things changed and armoured personnel carriers (APCs) were deployed on the same roads in Iraq that had been deemed too narrow for them prior to Phillip's death. Sue decided that the only really effective way to try and get answers was legal action. Sue Smith after the ruling in her favour at the Supreme Court in 2013 In June 2013 she and the families of two other soldiers, Pte Lee Ellis and L/Cpl Kirk Redpath, killed in Snatch Land Roverswon a landmark rulingat the Supreme Court. It gave them the right to sue the MoD under the Human Rights Act because it was deemed the soldiers were within the UK's jurisdiction at the time of their deaths, and so were subject to human rights law. The MoD had wanted to strike their claims out. Sue recalled: ""I was really, really happy that at last, soldiers had got the right to life, and they had to make things right, and yet I suppose it was a bitter-sweet moment, because I did it for Phillip because I didn't want his death to be for nothing."" Snatch Land Rover's replacement is revealed by MoD Killed soldier's dad says compensation plans are 'wrong' Chilcot report: Findings at-a-glance Even after the Supreme Court case, the MoD continued to contest her case. It was thepublication of the reportinto the inquiry into the Iraq War by Sir John Chilcot in July 2016 that changed everything. Sue had been to see the inquiry team and was instrumental in it considering the Snatch deaths. The report's criticisms were stark. The MoD had known about the vehicle's vulnerability and for years had failed to provide more heavily armoured vehicles. Sue believes that if the MoD had listened to her earlier, the lives of some of the 37 soldiers could have been saved. But even after Chilcot, Sue's solicitor Jocelyn Cockburn, from the firm Hodge, Jones and Allen, was frustrated by the MoD. ""It was clear that Chilcot had been provided with the very information about Snatch Land Rovers which we'd been asking for all those years - and which we'd been told was not available, was too difficult to provide,"" she said. Finally, Sue's case and that brought by the families of Pte Ellis and L/Cpl Redpath have been settled, and each has received a letter of apology from the defence secretary. In the one written to Sue and seen by the BBC, Sir Michael expresses his regret at Phillip's death. ""I am fully aware of the struggle you have had to bring this matter to court over the last decade and I recognise that this has had a significant impact on you and your family,"" he writes. ""The government entirely accepts the findings of Sir John Chilcot in the Iraq Inquiry in relation to Snatch Land Rover. ""I would like to express directly to you my deepest sympathies and apologise for the delay, resulting in decisions taken at the time in bringing into service alternative protected vehicles which could have saved lives."" He goes on to say that lessons have been learnt, and ends: ""The government must and will ensure that our armed forces are always properly equipped and resourced."" Sue said the apology was ""bitter sweet"". Her 12-year legal battle has taken a heavy toll on her and her family, but she feels that Phillip's death now leaves a legacy. ""I'd like it to be that his death made a difference. He's not just a casualty of Iraq. ""Iraq is almost forgotten now. It's almost Britain's Vietnam. People don't want to remember. But at least at the end of it, it's worth it. Not his death, but for people to remember what I've done in his name.""

Who are BBC Radio 1's new DJs?,"L-R: Abbie McCarthy, Yasser and Katie Thistleton New voices are coming to Radio 1 as the station continues its search for the next generation of on-air talent. For the month of September, the station will rotate the presenter on the 10:00 to 13:00 slot on Saturdays and Sundays. Abbie McCarthy, Katie Thistleton, Jordan North and Yasser will present two shows each while Matt Edmondson is away because of TV commitments. Controller Ben Cooper told BBC News it was ""a great way to celebrate Radio 1's 50th birthday"". Where does Radio 1 find new DJs? Radio 1 to launch pop-up station for 50th birthday ""You can think of a radio schedule as a football team,"" Cooper said, ""What you want is a great subs bench. ""It's up to Radio 1 to get that next generation of broadcasting talent."" The new presenters will stand in for Matt Edmondson He said he was not planning any permanent schedule changes, but added that it was ""a chance for some new presenters to demonstrate how good they are"". ""Can they knock at the door when the right opportunity comes along and say 'We want a show on Radio 1'? I like that enthusiasm, that energy."" He described the new batch of presenters as ""people that we have discovered and nurtured"". Earlier this year,Cooper said it was getting harderfor the station to find new radio talent. Katie Thistleton and Jordan North will present on Radio 1 in September Traditionally, Radio 1 has hired presenters from music and youth TV shows such as CD:UK and T4, but with fewer of those around, the station has been looking more and more to student and community radio. Cooper said: ""Yes it's hard, but we're not struggling and we want to demonstrate around our 50th birthday that actually we've got this next generation of new presenters waiting in the wings."" So, who are the new DJs? Cooper said: ""Katie comes with all that energy and passion we've seen on screen"" Katie is taking the Fearne-and-Reggie route to Radio 1 - having built up experience as a presenter on CBBC. She's also a mental health ambassador, journalist and author (her first book Real Problems, Real Advice will be published next year). But perhaps most importantly, she's been on Celebrity Mastermind, which bodes well for her future career. (Once you've faced John Humphrys you're basically ready for anything life has to throw at you.) ""BBC Children's and Radio 1 need to work harder together in future to make sure there's a journey from one to the other,"" Cooper said. ""Young children have grown up with CBeebies and CBBC, so when they're ready to move from the Night Garden and Tracy Beaker, you want them to move on to Radio 1, so it makes sense to have some of those familiar faces they've grown up with."" Having honed his craft on student and community stations like Preston FM and Spark FM, Jordan is precisely the kind of upcoming radio star Cooper has been looking to recruit. You also might have heard Jordan if you're a regular visitor to the dodgems at Blackpool Pleasure Beach - as hepresented,externalon the theme park's own station. He's since risen through the commercial ranks of Rock FM, The Hits and Capital Manchester (among others) and has covered shows every now and again on Radio 1. ""You look at Jordan, he's got that great northern wit, that ability to tell a great story, and he's down to earth in talking about it,"" Cooper said. Jordan also supports Burnley, and if he starts his Radio 1 career the way they started the Premier League season he won't go too far wrong. Having already presented on the BBC's Asian Network and 1Xtra, Yasser shouldn't need to ask for directions to Broadcasting House when he joins the station next month. He actually started his career on a hospital radio station and went on to present on Fever FM, a community radio station in Leeds. ""Yasser is very good at being self-deprecating and has a gentle sort of humour I think people relate to,"" Cooper said. He's also a successful club DJ (Yasser, not Ben Cooper), and is a popularYouTuber,externalin his spare time. Abbie's radio CV includes working as a producer at BBC 6 Music and winning best newcomer at the Student Radio Awards in 2012. You may have already heard her on Radio 1 when she stood in for Huw Stephens earlier this year. She now frontsBBC Introducingin Kent every Saturday evening - which champions new and unsigned acts. ""Abbie is so passionate about her music, about telling you about new artists and new bands, and that's a key part of Radio 1,"" Cooper said. So when can you hear these shiny new presenters on Radio 1?

Sixth Australian MP in eligibility trouble,"Fiona Nash has asked a court to rule on her eligibility A sixth Australian MP will have their eligibility for office decided by the nation's High Court over the issue of dual citizenship. Government Senator Fiona Nash revealed she is a UK citizen by descent because of her Scottish-born father. Australian politicians are not allowed to hold dual citizenship. The saga has gripped Australian politics for five weeks, forcing dozens of MPs to make statements about their citizenship status. How a dual citizen crisis befell Australia Ms Nash is deputy leader of the National Party, the junior partner in Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's governing coalition. Like Deputy Prime MinisterBarnaby Joyce, who is a New Zealand dual citizen, Ms Nash said she would continue in her position until the High Court clarifies a section of Australia's constitution. She said she had legal advice that she had not breached rules. Four other politicians will also have their eligibility tested in court as early as next week: Minister for Resources and Northern AustraliaMatt Canavan, a possible citizen of Italy Far-right SenatorMalcolm Roberts, who claims he renounced his UK citizenship Scott Ludlam, who resigned as co-deputy leader of the left-wing Greens over his New Zealand status Another Greens co-deputy leader and Canadian dual national,Larissa Waters, who has also resigned. Mr Joyce sits in the lower House of Representatives, where Mr Turnbull's government has only a one-seat majority. If any government MPs in the lower house were to be ruled ineligible, it would trigger a complex process that could threaten Mr Turnbull's hold on power. On Thursday, Australian Justice MinisterMichael Keenanwas forced to deny he was a British citizen, but his case will not go before court.

Spanish police stop second attack,"This video can not be played An eyewitness to the Cambrils shooting described what happened to Radio 4's Today programme Spanish police say they have shot dead five suspected terrorists in the town of Cambrils in a second vehicle attack, hours after another in Barcelona killed 13 people and injured dozens. Police said the men were linked to the Barcelona attack, which so-called Islamic State said it had carried out. Police are still hunting the man who drove his van into crowds on Las Ramblas in Barcelona on Thursday. Spanish media have named Moussa Oukabir, 18, as the suspect. He is the brother of Driss Oukabir, whose documentation was allegedly used to rent the van involved in the attack. Read the latest updates on the Spanish attacks Spanish attacks: What we know so far Aftermath of Barcelona attack in pictures Spain's long anti-terror experience Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy has condemned what he called a ""jihadist attack"". He has announced three days of national mourning and a minute's silence was held at noon (10:00 GMT) on Friday. The vehicle overturned in the attack Seven people, including a police officer, were wounded when a car was driven into them early on Friday, Catalan emergency services said. One later died in hospital. The attackers' vehicle overturned and when the men got out they were quickly fired upon by police, media say. One was reportedly brandishing a knife. The men were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts, police said, and a series of controlled explosions was carried out. The belts proved to be fake, Catalan regional head Carles Puigdemont later told local radio. Police say the situation in Cambrils - a popular seaside resort 110km (70 miles) south-west of Barcelona - is now under control. A rented van was driven down Las Ramblas, a popular street in the centre of the city on Thursday afternoon, mowing down tourists and locals. This video can not be played What was it like to be caught up in the Barcelona attack? Witnesses said the van deliberately targeted people, weaving from side to side. The driver of the van, believed to be the sole attacker, fled on foot and is still being hunted by police. Las Ramblas is a central boulevard that runs 1.2km (0.75 miles) through the centre of Barcelona from the city's PlaÃ§a de Catalunya (Catalonia Square) to the Christopher Columbus monument at the seafront. A businessman from New Orleans, who was just arriving in a taxi in Las Ramblas, said: ""I heard a crowd screaming. It sounded like they were screaming for a movie star. This video can not be played Footage shows police surrounding a white van moments after the attack ""I saw the van. It had already been busted on the front. It was weaving left and right, trying to hit people as fast as possible. There were people lying on the ground."" Kevin Kwast, who is on holiday in Barcelona with his family, said: ""I was eating with my family in La Boqueria market very near where the crash occurred. ""Hundreds of people started stampeding through the market... we started running with them going outside right into where casualties were already on the ground. ""Police pushed us into a money transfer shop and we've been sheltering there for over an hour."" This video can not be played Footage captures people using a shop as an escape route on Las Ramblas Citizens of some 24 countries were killed or injured in the Las Ramblas attack, the Catalan government has said. Confirmed dead: Spaniard Francisco LÃ³pez RodrÃ­guez, who was in his 60s Italian Bruno Gulotta, 35 Unnamed Italian Unnamed Belgian What do we know about the victims? France's foreign ministry said on Friday that 26 French nationals were injured, with at least 11 in a serious condition. Thirteen German citizens were wounded, some seriously. A five-year-old Irish boy suffered a broken leg. Hong Kong, Taiwan and Greece are among those saying their citizens were injured. Pakistani, Philippine, Venezuelan, Australian, Romanian, Peruvian, Dutch, Danish, Algerian and Chinese nationals were also among the casualties, officials said. Police released this photo of Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van Two people were detained on Thursday over the Las Ramblas attack, but not the driver of the van. One of those held is Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van, local media say. They say he is in his 20s, and was born in Morocco. However, latest reports suggest he has told police he was not involved, and that his documents were stolen. Spanish media report that his younger brother, Moussa, rented two vans, the one used in the attack and another found hours later in the town of Vic, north of Barcelona, and intended as a getaway vehicle. The second man arrested was born in Melilla, the autonomous Spanish city on the north coast of Africa. He has not been named. On Friday, police announced a third arrest had been made in the Catalan town of Ripoll. So-called Islamic State has said it was behind the Las Ramblas attack, saying in a brief statement carried by its Amaq news outlet that it was carried out by ""Islamic State soldiers"". The group gave no further evidence or details to back this claim. Alcanar, Wednesday evening:An explosion rips through a house in the small town, 200km south of Barcelona. One person dies. Police chief Josep Lluis Trapero said it appeared the residents at the house had been ""preparing an explosive device"". A Catalan government official says a cell may have intended to use gas canisters in the Las Ramblas attack Barcelona, Thursday 16:50 (14:50 GMT): A white Fiat van drives down Las Ramblas in central Barcelona, killing 13 people and injuring scores.

A man is found dead in the car but the interior ministry denies earlier reports he was killed by police gunfire. The dead man is not believed to be linked to the Las Ramblas attack, officials say, but investigations are ongoing Cambrils, Friday 01:00:A second vehicle attack takes place in the resort south of Barcelona. Police kill five suspects said to be linked to the Las Ramblas attack Trump pushes debunked 'pig's blood' myth, hours after Barcelona attack Gordon Corera, BBC News security correspondent Barcelona is just the latest European city to witness the terrible effects of a vehicle attack on an iconic or ""soft"" target. In Nice a year ago, Bastille Day celebrations were targeted, then a Christmas market in Berlin. In London, Westminster and London Bridge, as well as Finsbury Park, saw cars and vans used as weapons. In the UK, new barriers have been put in place to mitigate some of the risks at key locations and there is discussion of imposing checks on those renting vans, but security services in Britain - as well as across Europe - are all too aware that there are limits to what they can do to spot and stop those planning murder in this way. The weapons employed are readily available and there is little or no training, co-ordination or planning required. This means there are  few points where individuals can be spotted by the intelligence services. Although so-called Islamic State has released a statement saying what it calls its ""soldiers"" had carried out the Barcelona attack, it is not yet clear whether there was any direct link to the group or if they were simply inspired by its call to act. The language used often indicates the latter. Either way, authorities will be bracing themselves for the possibility of further attacks of a similar nature.

'Terror strikes the heart of Barcelona',"The Barcelona attack took place in the famous Las Ramblas tourist area The papers are dominated by the Barcelona van attack in which 13 people died. The Daily Mail, the Sun and the Daily Telegraph all use the same image on their front pages - of an injured man, holding his head and being helped by police officers. The Mail calls it a ""massacre of holiday families"",externaland the paper has eyewitness accounts from Britons who had to run for their lives as a van sped through crowds in Las Ramblas. It describes abandoned prams, toys and tourists' selfie sticks among the carnage. Pictures on a double-page spread inside the paper capture the fear and panic on people's faces. The word ""massacre"" alsoappears in the Daily Mirror headline,external. Its front page shows people lying in the street, with some of them pixelated because the images are too graphic. Inside the paper it calls Las Ramblas ""the street of blood and tears"", and carries more powerful photos of people caught up in the violence and armed police sweeping the streets. The Sun devotes two pages to a Moroccan suspect,externalnamed by Spanish police as the man who hired the van. The paper calls Driss Oubakir a Muslim ""party boy"" who likes ""dope, rap and booze"" - but adds that he has denied any involvement. The Telegraph's report includes a claim,externalthat the CIA warned Spanish authorities two months ago that the tourist area in Barcelona was a potential terrorist target. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Thursday's A-level results also get widespread coverage. The news that boys got more top marks than girls for the first time in 17 years prompts theMirror's,externalheadline ""alpha males"". The Times notes that fewer pupils,externalare choosing English and History in favour of science subjects. The paper's analysis says the results are the first product of ""sweeping changes"" by former Education Secretary Michael Gove and it broadly believes they are working to help restore the prestige of the A-level exam. The Mail's editorial suggests,externalthat reforms to prevent ""rampant grade inflation"" have been undermined as pass marks are lowered. The Guardian argues,externalthat the government has given a low priority to alternatives to university education which is failing to meet the needs of the economy. It concludes that Mr Gove's focus on the academic was ""misdirected"". The Times and the Telegraph both feature the discovery of an 18th Century Dutch merchant ship off the Kent coast along with its lost crew. The Times explains how the vessel,external, thought to have been carrying silver coins, was first located 20 years ago on Goodwin Sands but is now being excavated after concerns that it was being destroyed by shifting currents. The Telegraph says the discovery of human remains,externalwill yield clues as to how the crew lived and died.

The belts proved to be fake, Catalan regional head Carles Puigdemont later told local radio. Police say the situation in Cambrils - a popular seaside resort 110km (70 miles) south-west of Barcelona - is now under control. A rented van was driven down Las Ramblas, a popular street in the centre of the city on Thursday afternoon, mowing down tourists and locals.

The driver of the van, believed to be the sole attacker, fled on foot and is still being hunted by police. Las Ramblas is a central boulevard that runs 1.2km (0.75 miles) through the centre of Barcelona from the city's PlaÃ§a de Catalunya (Catalonia Square) to the Christopher Columbus monument at the seafront. A businessman from New Orleans, who was just arriving in a taxi in Las Ramblas, said: ""I heard a crowd screaming. It sounded like they were screaming for a movie star. This video can not be played Footage shows police surrounding a white van moments after the attack ""I saw the van. It had already been busted on the front. It was weaving left and right, trying to hit people as fast as possible. There were people lying on the ground."" Kevin Kwast, who is on holiday in Barcelona with his family, said: ""I was eating with my family in La Boqueria market very near where the crash occurred. ""Hundreds of people started stampeding through the market... we started running with them going outside right into where casualties were already on the ground. ""Police pushed us into a money transfer shop and we've been sheltering there for over an hour.""

Police released this photo of Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van Two people were detained on Thursday over the Las Ramblas attack, but not the driver of the van. One of those held is Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van, local media say. They say he is in his 20s, and was born in Morocco. However, latest reports suggest he has told police he was not involved, and that his documents were stolen. Spanish media report that his younger brother, Moussa, rented two vans, the one used in the attack and another found hours later in the town of Vic, north of Barcelona, and intended as a getaway vehicle. The second man arrested was born in Melilla, the autonomous Spanish city on the north coast of Africa. He has not been named. On Friday, police announced a third arrest had been made in the Catalan town of Ripoll. So-called Islamic State has said it was behind the Las Ramblas attack, saying in a brief statement carried by its Amaq news outlet that it was carried out by ""Islamic State soldiers"". The group gave no further evidence or details to back this claim. Alcanar, Wednesday evening:An explosion rips through a house in the small town, 200km south of Barcelona. One person dies.

Police kill five suspects said to be linked to the Las Ramblas attack Trump pushes debunked 'pig's blood' myth, hours after Barcelona attack Gordon Corera, BBC News security correspondent Barcelona is just the latest European city to witness the terrible effects of a vehicle attack on an iconic or ""soft"" target. In Nice a year ago, Bastille Day celebrations were targeted, then a Christmas market in Berlin. In London, Westminster and London Bridge, as well as Finsbury Park, saw cars and vans used as weapons. In the UK, new barriers have been put in place to mitigate some of the risks at key locations and there is discussion of imposing checks on those renting vans, but security services in Britain - as well as across Europe - are all too aware that there are limits to what they can do to spot and stop those planning murder in this way. The weapons employed are readily available and there is little or no training, co-ordination or planning required. This means there are  few points where individuals can be spotted by the intelligence services. Although so-called Islamic State has released a statement saying what it calls its ""soldiers"" had carried out the Barcelona attack, it is not yet clear whether there was any direct link to the group or if they were simply inspired by its call to act. The language used often indicates the latter. Either way, authorities will be bracing themselves for the possibility of further attacks of a similar nature.

Trump scraps infrastructure council plan,"Donald Trump talked about expediting infrastructure projects earlier this week President Trump is dropping plans to create an advisory group on infrastructure, a day after two other business panels were dissolved. The president has faced a backlash from business leaders over his remarks this week on white supremacists. A White House official said the infrastructure council, which was still being formed, ""will not move forward"". Mr Trump signed an executive order last month to create the group as he looks to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. He has made updating US roads, bridges and airports a key part of his legislative agenda. However, on Wednesday he was forced to disband two other White House business panels amid an exodus of chief executives. Business leaders quit over Mr Trump's response to a far-right rally in Virginia, which left a woman dead and dozens hurt. Business mutiny leaves Trump isolated America - diminished and dismissed The rally, supported by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, was in protest of the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. On Thursday, Mr Trump re-opened the heated debate by denouncing the removal of ""beautiful"" Confederate statues. Apple boss Tim Cook joined the condemnation of Mr Trump The decision to drop his infrastructure panel comes as the bosses of some of the biggest US companies have criticised Mr Trump's handling of far-right groups. On Monday, Mr Trump belatedly condemned the white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups that rallied in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Sunday. But in a rancorous news conference on Tuesday he backtracked and again blamed left-wing counter-protesters for the violence too. That prompted business leaders to quit his manufacturing and policy councils, and drew criticism from the bosses of firms including Apple and JP Morgan. Mr Trump had originally planned to draw members of the Advisory Council on Infrastructure from real estate, construction and other parts of the economy. At the start of the year he said he was planning the panel and named two well known New York property developers to lead it. Representatives for the developers, Steve Roth of Vornado Realty Trust and Richard LeFrak of LeFrak, could not be reached immediately.
