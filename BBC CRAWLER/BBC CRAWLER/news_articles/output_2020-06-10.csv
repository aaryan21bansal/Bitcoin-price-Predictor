Eddo-Lodge breaks book record amid BLM protests,"Reni Eddo-Lodge's book was originally published in 2017 Reni Eddo-Lodge has become the first black British author to top UK's best-seller list since the official book chart was launched in 1998. Last week, Eddo-Lodge's book Why I'm No Longer Talking To White People About Race topped the paperback non-fiction chart, following protests about racism. The 2017 work has now become the best-selling title in the UK overall, according to Nielsen BookScan. The author said it felt ""absolutely wild to have broken this record"". Allow Twitter content?

""My work stands on the shoulders of so many Black British literary giants,""Eddo-Lodge wrote on Twitter.,external""Bernadine Evaristo, Benjamin Zephaniah, Zadie Smith, Andrea Levy, Stella Dadzie, Stuart Hall, Linton K Johnson, Jackie Kay, Gary Younge - to name a few."" Fellow authorNikesh Shukla congratulated her, adding:,external""Bewildering it's taken so long for this to happen but it couldn't happen to a better writer and person."" After she topped the paperback non-fiction chart last week, Eddo-Lodge criticised the UK publishing industry for the fact it had taken so long for a black author to achieve the feat. She said she was ""dismayed"" that the achievement only came about under ""tragic circumstances"" - referring to the death of George Floyd. Renewed interest in the title was sparked following protests around the death of Mr Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. After her book topped the non-fiction chart, Eddo-Lodge said: ""The fact that it's 2020 and I'm the first. Let's be honest. Reader demand aside, that it took this long is a horrible indictment of the publishing industry."" Since 1998, only one other black author, former US first lady Michelle Obama, has scored the overall best-selling book in the UK, with her 2018 memoir Becoming. Bernardine Evaristo jointly won the Booker Prize last year Eddo-Lodge's book explores the links between gender, class and race in the UK and around the world. Last month, the writerposted online,externalthat she had noticed an upsurge in sales, which she found unsettling. ""This book financially transformed my life and I really don't like the idea of personally profiting every time a video of a black person's death goes viral,"" she wrote, urging readers to offer a donation to the Minnesota Freedom Fund. On Monday, the newly-formedBlack Writers' Guild sent an open letter,externalto publishers raising concerns that the companies were ""raising awareness of racial inequality without significantly addressing their own"". The letter was signed by authors including Evaristo, Zephaniah and Malorie Blackman. Last week, fellow author Dorothy Koomsonposted an open letter,externalto the publishing industry, in which she called it an ""extremely damaging"" environment for black authors. Also last week, Evaristo became the first female writer of colour to top the mass market fiction chart with Girl, Woman, Other. Her novel jointly won the Booker Prize last year, together with Margaret Atwood's The Testaments. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

As we near the end of today's live coverage, here is a round-up of developments. US President Donald Trump has said he will begin holding campaign rallies in at least four states after they were paused for three months due to the pandemic. He told reporters at the White House today that rallies would restart in Oklahoma, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. He added that the first one would probably take place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, next Friday. But he did not provide details on what precautions would be taken to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading at the events. Mr Trump will face Democrat Joe Biden in November. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher notes that the majority of the chosen states are electoral battlegrounds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As former hotspots like New York and New Jersey see declining infection rates, new coronavirus cases are climbing in 21 US states, as the country marches forward with its economic reopening. And nationwide, total Covid-19 infections are creeping towards the 2 million mark, with more than 112,500 deaths. Of these 21 states, 12 of them - including South Carolina, Texas and Utah - have reported increased hospitalisation rates since the Memorial Day holiday weekend last month. In Arizona, which has seen an especially pronounced spike in both Covid infections and hospitalisations, local health officials are starting to sound the alarm. Banner Health, the state's largest hospital system, warned this week that its intensive care units were filling up, and ventilator use was rising, while the state health director told Arizona hospitals to ""fully activate"" emergency plans. As of Wednesday, Arizona had confirmed 29,852 cases and 1,101 deaths.  Global coffee chain Starbucks says it expects revenue this quarter to have plummeted by more than $3bn (Â£2.3bn) because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company also projected an adjusted loss of about 55 to 70 cents per share for its third quarter ending in June. In further bad news it said its current-quarter operating income was expected to plunge by up to $2.2bn Like other cafe and restaurant chains, Starbucks had to close thousands of outlets around the world as part of coronavirus lockdowns or convert them to drive-through or take-away only. The company says it expects to permanently close about 400 stores
in the Americas over the next 18 months. The former US ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman, has announced he has tested positive for Covid-19.

Mr Huntsman, a Republican, is currently running to be governor of Utah. He served in that role from 2005 to 2009, and most recently spent two years as ambassador to Russia under President Donald Trump. He also ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. On Tuesday, he said he had received the ""wrong results"" from an earlier test. ""Very illuminating to see the process firsthand,"" he wrote on Twitter. BBC OS Queues of people with virus symptoms have formed outside hospitals in Delhi Infections in India are rising. In the capital, Delhi, images have emerged of patients queuing outside hospitals, waiting to be treated for Covid-19. Dr Parv Mittal, who works in Delhi's Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, spoke to BBC Outside Source. ""It's really difficult to say how we will be able to cope,"" he said. ""I'm not sure if we have the beds. Even if you create the beds, there will be a shortage of manpower."" Delhi is seeing more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases every day, stretching hospital resources. Dr Mittal says his hospital initially struggled to get personal protective equipment (PPE).  Now it has enough but working in PPE is ""exhausting"", he says. ""Wearing it even for one hour, you start sweating a lot. You start getting dehydrated. Initially we had to work for six to eight hours non-stop. There's a persistent fear of contracting the infection."" Chester Zoo - home to these elephants - says the lockdown has threatened its survival Some zoos and safari parks in England are preparing to throw open their doors to visitors from Monday, bringing in some much-needed revenue. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced that the outdoor attractions can reopenat today's daily briefing. Dominic Jermey, head of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) which runs London and Whipsnade Zoos, said they were ""raring to go"". ""We expect to have tickets ready to book by Friday and everyone will need to book so we can manage capacity,"" he said. Last month London Zoo said it faced an ""uncertain future"" without immediate financial support. Jamie Christon from Chester Zoo in north-west England said a week ago they had been ""in despair"", not knowing when the zoo would reopen or if it would even survive. ""The zoo has suffered severe financial damage over the past three months and the road to recovery will be long and uncertain,"" he added. Some other zoos have said they are still putting in place social distancing and hygiene measures and won't be able to open until July. This lion at London Zoo was more interested in a nap... The penguins, however, appeared ready to welcome back the public Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The lockdown may have led more individuals to become radicalised as they spend more time online, a British police chief has warned. The Metropolitan Police's Lucy D'Orsi said the precise impact of the lockdown on the terrorism threat was not yet known. She urged the public to remain alert as people return to crowded places closed in March. The current UK threat level is ""substantial"", meaning an attack is likely. ""The reality is that the threat has not gone away,"" Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner D'Orsi told the BBC. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves has welcomed the latest government guidance that adults living alone in England can form a ""support bubble"" with one other household. In a further easing of coronavirus restrictions, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that, from Saturday,single adults could spend the night at another house. Ms Reeves, Labour MP for Leeds West, said she hoped the measure would ""ease some of the loneliness that we see in society"", but qualified her support by saying that people were ""anxious about the easing of restrictions and of good work being undone"" if it wasn't backed up by the science. She said the government had ""got to get this right and needs to make sure the test, trace and isolate policy is in place to ensure that further easing of the restrictions can work"". Read more on how social bubbles work. People living alone in England will soon be able to stay at another household (of any size) to form a ""support bubble"".  The move was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as part of further easing of coronavirus restrictions. A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close contact. For example:  Read more here on how social bubbles work. A man leaves a temporary shower trailer in Manhattan for the homeless and other vulnerable communities in May New Yorkers experiencing homelessness and sleeping in shelters during the coronavirus outbreak were disproportionately vulnerable to death or illness, a report from the Coalition for the Homeless has found. As of 1 June, the Covid mortality rate in New York City overall was 200 deaths per 100,000 people. Among those sleeping in shelters, this figure was 321 deaths per 100,000 people. And according to the coalition, the number of coronavirus-related deaths among homeless New Yorkers sleeping in shelters in April 2020 was 157% higher than the number of deaths from all causes among this same group during an average month in 2019. As of 31 May, there were 926 confirmed Covid-19 cases across some 179 shelters. Places of worship have now opened in India as the country eases its lockdown measure. These images from Koltata show priests wearing protective gear, preparing to enter the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. Restrictions on shops, market places and transport services were eased on Monday. It comes despite a surge of infections in the country, which now has 266,598 confirmed cases. However experts say there was no other option but to lift the lockdown, which had a massive economic impact on the country. There is little evidence that a change in the seasons will affect the spread of Covid-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. ""We cannot rely on an expectation that the season or the temperature will be the answer to this,"" Mike Ryan, the head of the organisation's emergency programme, told reporters. ""Right now, we have no
data to suggest that the virus will behave more aggressively or
transmit more efficiently or not"" when the seasons change, he said. In the initial stages of the pandemic, some suggested that warmer weather might slow the spread of Covid-19. But this idea faded as the virus took hold during springtime in the northern hemisphere. Separately, Mr Ryan also said that a lack of personal protective equipment remained a major issue globally. ""Health systems in some countries are struggling and are under huge strain,"" he added. Chelsea are to donate their prize money for winning the Women's Super League to a charity that supports women and children experiencing domestic abuse. UK charities say there has been a huge spike in reports of domestic abuseduring the coronavirus lockdown. Chelsea Womenwere named champions on Friday, when final places in the curtailed 2019-20 WSL season were decided on a points-per-game basis. The Â£100,000 first prize will be given to Refuge.

Team manager Emma Hayes said the charity was ""close to the hearts and minds of the women's team"".

Here are some of the latest updates: Reality Check Earlier on Wednesday, Professor Chris Whitty â the chief medical officer for England  â was asked what his
biggest regret was in the handling of the pandemic He said he wished that testing
could have been speeded up âvery early onâ in the outbreak, and mentioned
Germany as an example. In the week ending 4 April, Germany
was using 132 laboratories to carrying out an average of
116,655 diagnostic tests for Covid-19 per day. The total number of tests done
by that date was over 1.3 million. The UK, by contrast, had carried
out a total of 316,836 tests by 10 April and didn't hit its target of
100,000 daily tests until the end of that month. Prince Joachim has already apologisedfor breaching Spain's quarantine rules when he travelled to the southern city of CÃ³rdoba last month. Now he will be up to â¬10,400 (Â£9,200; $11,800) out of pocket too. The 28-year-old prince, a nephew of King Philippe of Belgium, travelled to Spain last month for what the palace had described as an internship and a ""family event"". He later tested positive for Covid-19 and health officials had to get in touch with people he had been in contact with. According to local reports, the prince has been fined for failing to observe the necessary 14-day quarantine and attending two meetings or parties. If he pays up within 15 days, he only needs to pay half the fine.  Several members of the National Guard in Washington DC have tested positive for Covid-19 If you're just joining us, here are the latest coronavirus headlines from around the world:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The pandemic has, effectively,
become a game of risk management â thatâs because, as UK chief medical adviser Chris Witty says, nothing is ârisk freeâ. We could continue to suppress
the virus by not easing lockdown any further. That would further reduce the
spread of coronavirus â and no doubt save lives. But it would come at a huge cost
â economically, socially, to childrenâs education and also to peopleâs health, whether it is from mental or physical illness linked to continued strict curbs. So instead, the government and its advisers are treading a fine fine, and trying to navigate a way through this
(whether they are doing a good job or not is a different question). The aim is to keep the spread of the
virus low, while re-opening society. Whatever is done there will be
losers. After all, there is a new virus circulating, which for some is deadly. In the end it will come down to
both political judgements, in terms of how quickly restrictions continue to be
lifted, and also individual judgements in terms of how quickly we each embrace
the new freedoms. That, unfortunately, is the way life is in this pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
JK Rowling responds to trans tweets criticism,"JK Rowling has said she spoke out about transgender issues in part due to her personal experience of domestic abuse and sexual assault. The Harry Potter author addressed criticism of her response to an article that described ""people who menstruate"". In alengthy blog,external, she wrote her interest in trans issues stemmed from being a survivor of abuse and having concerns around single-sex spaces. Actor Daniel Radcliffe was among those critical of Ms Rowling's comments. In the blog post published on Wednesday, Rowling, 54, detailed what she said were the five reasons why she felt the need to talk about the issue. These included her interest in ""both education and safeguarding"" and ""freedom of speech"". Explaining her final reason, she wrote: ""I've been in the public eye now for over 20 years and have never talked publicly about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor. School renames Rowling house over trans tweets ""This isn't because I'm ashamed those things happened to me, but because they're traumatic to revisit and remember. ""I also feel protective of my daughter from my first marriage. I didn't want to claim sole ownership of a story that belongs to her, too. ""However, a short while ago, I asked her how she'd feel if I were publicly honest about that part of my life and she encouraged me to go ahead. ""I'm mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy, but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine, who've been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces."" Radcliffe, the star of the Harry Potter film series, and Eddie Redmayne, who leads the cast of the Fantastic Beasts movies,have both criticised Rowlingfor her comments about transgender issues. Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the Potter franchise,said,external: ""Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren't who they say they are."" Eddie Redmayne has played Newt Scamander in two Fantastic Beasts films so far The row began last weekend, after Rowling responded to a headline on an online article discussing ""people who menstruate"" by writing in a tweet: ""I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?"" Critics accused her of being transphobic, but Rowling said she stood by her comments, saying it ""isn't hate to speak the truth"".

In December last year, the author voiced her support for a researcher who was sacked after tweeting that transgender people cannot change their biological sex. In the blog post on Wednesday, Rowling said she was motivated to address transgender issues through her Twitter account because of what she sees as an increasingly misogynistic society. ""We're living through the most misogynistic period I've experienced,"" she continued. ""Back in the 80s, I imagined that my future daughters, should I have any, would have it far better than I ever did, but between the backlash against feminism and a porn-saturated online culture, I believe things have got significantly worse for girls.

Tasering of rapper Wretch 32's dad to be assessed,"Wretch 32 posted a video on Twitter of his father falling downstairs after being Tasered by officers in Haringey The Tasering of rapper Wretch 32's father will be assessed by the police watchdog after the Met was instructed to refer it. Wretch 32 posted a video on Twitter of Millard Scott falling downstairs after being Tasered by officers in Haringey, north London, in April. The force previously said a review had found ""no indication of misconduct"". But the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) used its powers to require the force to refer it. It will now assess what happened to decide if it needs to be investigated. This video can not be played Millard Scott was Tasered by officers after they entered his home in April The 35-year-old rapper, whose real name is Jermaine Scott, shared the 36-second clip on his Twitter account with the caption: ""This is how the police think they can treat a 62 year old black man in Tottenham but this 1 happens to be my dad."" He later spoke about the lack of progression on ""police brutality"" in the UK. His 62-year-old father toldITV News,externalhe believed he would not have been Tasered if he were white and he was ""lucky to be alive"". The video shows Mr Scott falling down the stairs after an officer is heard to warn: ""Police officer with a Taser. Stay where you are."" Scotland Yard said officers had gone to the property as part of ""a long-running operation to tackle drugs supply linked to serious violence"". A spokesman said: ""As officers entered the premises, a man came downstairs and started moving towards an officer suddenly. ""He was ordered to remain where he was but continued towards officers who, after several warnings, deployed a Taser. ""The man was not arrested, but was assessed by the London Ambulance Service at the scene. He did not require further medical treatment. ""Officers from the North Area Command Unit have liaised with the family to discuss any concerns they have about the incident. ""The incident, including body-worn footage, has been reviewed by the Met's directorate of professional standards and no indication of misconduct has been identified."" Police said a 22-year-old man found in the house was arrested and charged with encouraging another to commit an offence, while a 52-year-old woman was charged with obstructing police after being interviewed under caution at a later date. The force said in a further statement that, following examination of the body-worn footage, it believed the incident ""does not meet the criteria for a referral to the IOPC"".

UK economy virus hit among worst of leading nations,"The UK is likely to be the hardest hit by Covid-19 among major economies, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned. Britain's economy is likely to slump by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, it said. If there were a second peak in the pandemic, the UK economy could contract by as much as 14%. ""The crisis will cast a long shadow over the world,"" the OECD added. It said that in what it called a ""single-hit scenario"", with no second peak, there could be contractions of 11.4% in France, 11.1% in Spain, 11.3% in Italy and 6.6% in Germany. In its latest assessment, the OECD found that the UK's largely service-based economy meant that it had been particularly badly hit by the government's lockdown restrictions. The services sector, including financial services, hospitality and tourism, makes up about three-quarters of the UK's GDP. In response to the think tank's report, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not the only one to suffer: ""In common with many other economies around the world, we're seeing the significant impact of coronavirus on our country and our economy. ""The unprecedented action we've taken to provide lifelines that help people and businesses through the economic disruption will ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""Today's evidence from the OECD is deeply worrying, showing the UK was particularly exposed when the coronavirus crisis hit. ""The government's failure to get on top of the health crisis, delay going into lockdown and chaotic mismanagement of the exit from lockdown are making the economic impact of this crisis worse."" The central finding of the OECD forecasts is that the expectations or hopes of a rapid bounceback in the economy - a so-called V-shaped chart - is not now happening. As Secretary General Angel Gurria put it to me, it will be ""U-shaped"", the question is how long will be the period at the bottom of this ""U"". This pattern is not affecting all countries equally. And in the event of there being no further peak, the prediction is that the UK is the worst hit this year, though just a little bit worse than Italy and France. For those who like a glass half full, it also predicts the strongest growth in the UK at 9% for 2021. But that is a rather hollow prize. The reason why is that the UK economy is peculiarly exposed as a trading economy with significant service and tourist sectors. But it is also a nation that has been among the hardest hit by the underlying pandemic. This hit comes despite a much-praised rapid response deploying tens of billions to keep millions of workers on payrolls. The OECD also mentions the pandemic economic impact being ""compounded"" by the looming plausible failure to sign a trade deal with the EU and new trade barriers with the European Union at the end of the year. It recommends temporarily extending the UK's stay in the single market. That is advice that the government has shown no inclination to follow so far. The bigger point is that the OECD is subtly pointing to the fact that one rescue package is not enough. Late last week the Germans announced a massive 4% stimulus to the economy, including a thumping cut to VAT, and significant subsidies for the purchase of cars. The league table is an invitation to do more. And we will soon enough get actual hard economic data, as opposed to forecasts such as this, when the monthly GDP figure for April - entirely locked down - is published on Friday. The OECD said the pandemic had started to recede in many countries and activity had begun to pick up, but it does not expect a convincing recovery. It sees the outlook for public health as extremely uncertain. OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said the pandemic would have ""dire and long-lasting consequences for people, firms and governments"". She added: ""Extraordinary policies will be required to walk the tightrope towards recovery. Even if growth does surge in some sectors, overall activity will remain muted for a while."" The OECD looked at two scenarios for how the pandemic might unfold, depending on whether there is a second wave of contagion or not before the end of this year. If that does happen, two countries - France and Spain - would suffer even deeper declines in economic activity than the UK this year. The report describes both outlooks as sobering, but either way, the deep recession now unfolding will be followed by a slow recovery. In the more severe case, the global economy could shrink by 7.6% over this year, the OECD says. That figure is significantly worse than predictions put forward by other agencies, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which have warned about the high level of uncertainty attached to their forecasts. By the end of 2021, the report says that five or more years of income growth could be lost in many countries. It says the impact on livelihoods will be especially severe among the most vulnerable groups. The OECD also says the pandemic has accelerated the shift from what it calls ""great integration"" to ""great fragmentation"". That is essentially a setback for globalisation, reflected in additional trade and investment restrictions and many borders that are closed at least while the health crisis persists.

Jenrick urged to release documents in planning row,"The development would have built 1,500 new homes on Westferry Road, the Isle of Dogs Labour has urged Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick to publish all correspondence relating to his approval of a Â£1bn property scheme. The call came after it emerged the developer of the scheme has since given money to the Conservative Party. Richard Desmond donated Â£12,000 to the party two weeks after Mr Jenrick gave planning permission for his company to build 1,500 homes in east London. The Conservatives said policies were ""in no way influenced by donations"". Labour has criticised Mr Jenrick for ""refusing"" to answer an Urgent Question in the House of Commons on the matter. Chris Pincher - a junior housing minister - is answering the question instead. Sources close to Mr Jenrick say he will be taking MPs' questions on Monday, at his regular Commons question time. Mr Jenrick granted planning permission on 14 January for Mr Desmond's company Northern & Shell to build on the Westferry Printworks site on the Isle of Dogs. It has emerged that Mr Desmond made a personal donation to the Conservatives on 28 January. Labour said Mr Jenrick must show the process was ""fair and transparent"" and a local councillor said the donation ""raised questions"" for the minister. The property development was approved the day before the introduction of a new council community levy which would have meant the company paying an additional Â£40m. Mr Jenrick has insisted he did not show any bias In giving the project the green light, Mr Jenrick overruled the government's planning inspectorate whch said the development needed to deliver more affordable housing in London's poorest borough. The council has since challenged the decision, forcing the secretary of state to back down and to admit what he did was ""unlawful by reason of apparent bias"". Local councillors asked the High Court last month to order the government to disclose emails and memos around the deal. Rather than doing this, Mr Jenrick's lawyers conceded the timing of his decision ""would lead the fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility"" that he had been biased. The Â£12,000 figure was included inTuesday's Electoral Commission audit of party donations,externalfor the first three months of the year andfirst reported by the Daily Mail,external. Mr Jenrick has come under growing political pressure in recent weeks after it emerged he sat at the same table as Mr Desmond, the former owner of the Daily Express, at a Conservative Party fundraiser last November. A spokesman for Mr Jenrick told the Daily Mail ""the developers did raise their application, but Mr Jenrick informed them that it would not be appropriate for them to discuss the matter with him, or for him to pass comment on it"". But Labour said Mr Jenrick must now make clear whether he told officials at his department about the meeting and disclose whether he or members of his team had any other contacts with the developer. Unless the Housing Secretary published all documents about the application and any correspondence with Mr Desmond in the run-up to the decision, the opposition said ""the public will be entitled to think it's one rule for the Conservatives and their wealthy friends, and another rule for everyone else"". Mr Desmond is one of the UK's most high-profile businessmen ""Communities must have confidence that the planning process is fair and transparent, but the unanswered questions around Robert Jenrick's unlawful decision have weakened that trust,"" said Labour's shadow communities secretary Steve Reed. ""It's time for Mr Jenrick to come clean and answer these crucial questions about why he over-ruled his own inspector to grant planning permission for a billionaire Conservative Party donor to build a luxury development."" Andrew Wood, who resigned as leader of the Conservative group on Tower Hamlets Council because of his concerns over the property deal, has called for the Cabinet Office to launch an investigation. He told the BBC details of Mr Desmond's donation raised ""more questions about what was going on"", adding that although Â£12,000 was ""not a lot of money,"" it did not look good. ""The optics are terrible,"" he added. A Conservative Party spokesperson said Mr Desmond's donation was properly declared to the Electoral Commission and fully complied with the law.

Scottish tourism sector could reopen on 15 JulyTourism Secretary Fergus Ewing says the date is conditional on continued progress in tackling the coronavirus.Scotland,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Tourism in Scotland could reopen by mid-July Scotland's tourism businesses, including pubs, hotels and restaurants, have been told to prepare to reopen on 15 July. Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing said the date was conditional on moving to the third phase of the route map for easing lockdown restrictions. Announcing a new taskforce, he said businesses needed clarity to be able to plan for reopening. But he warned the date may change if the evidence on Covid-19 requires it. Mr Ewing told MSPs the pandemic had left the industry facing unprecedented challenges. But he said a new taskforce would focus on the sector's recovery needs, actions being taken by the UK government and the development of a new domestic visitor marketing campaign. Mr Ewing said this was in addition to a Â£2.3bn package of support for businesses which included measures specific to the tourism and hospitality sector, such as a full year of non-domestic rates relief and specific grant schemes. Mr Ewing said: ""The coronavirus pandemic has presented challenges across the entirety of the Scottish economy, but it is very clear there are exceptional circumstances facing this sector that must be recognised. ""We have acted as quickly as we can to address the significant financial challenges faced by businesses and provide a comprehensive package of support."" Tom Ponton, owner of the Oz Bar in Edinburgh, said the lockdown had left him in debt for the first time in his life Tom Ponton, owner of the Oz Bar in Edinburgh, said the news was ""very welcome and long overdue"" after a ""very anxious period"" for the industry. ""We really need to know what the guidelines are before we get too excited, but this is still very, very welcome,"" he said. ""This is the toughest adversity I've ever faced in the 40 years I've been in the trade. ""I've felt very anxious during the lockdown and I have had to borrow Â£70,000 to get me through. I've never had debt in my life before and now I do. ""Maybe we shouldn't have been so quick to cancel everything in the summer. We treble our turnover during the four weeks of the Edinburgh Festivals, which now we won't have."" Mr Ewing also said the Scottish government was asking the UK government to do more, including a review of VAT rates and to consider extensions to schemes such as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. ""I've been engaging with businesses since the beginning of the outbreak and I have heard their calls for more clarity, which today I can provide,"" he said. ""Businesses should start to prepare for a provisional return to trading - with appropriate safety guidelines - on the 15th July 2020. ""This date cannot be definitive and is conditional on public health advice and progression to phase three of the route map. Businesses must now use this time to satisfy the necessary regulations and adapt to the new way of living."" The Scottish government confirmed the tourism and hospitality announcement applies to pubs, hotels and restaurants. Phase three of theroute-map out of lockdowncovers accommodation providers, visitor attractions, indoor areas of pubs and restaurants and the wider aspects of tourism. A review of the lockdown restructions is due on 9 July, and the reopening of the tourism sector has tentatively been scheduled for six days after that to allow services like transport to prepare. Phase four of the route map includes events and no possible dates have yet been given for this stage. Marc Crothall, chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, said the announcement was ""a hugely positive milestone in our road to recovery"". He said they had been pushing for a date so that accommodation providers, visitor attractions, pubs and restaurants could plan effectively. He said this would include accepting bookings, arranging for staff to return from furlough, and ensuring that safety measures are in place for both employees and customers. Mr Crothall said ""urgent solutions or alternative measures"" were needed to ""overcome"" the current two metre distancing restrictions. He also called for some parts of the tourism sector, such as self-catering, caravan and camping parks, to be allowed to reopen earlier. But he added: ""The reassurance that there is a summer season for tourism in Scotland will offer a huge comfort and relief to many thousands of businesses.""

Falkirk fans have saved their club Â£90,000 by declining refunds for matches missed last season. Just 2% of season ticket holders took up the offer of compensation for cancelled home games after the season was brought to an early close in April because of the Covid-19 crisis. The club offered refunds hoping some fans could afford not to claim them. Had everyone entitled to a refund claimed one, it would have cost the League One outfit around Â£90,000. Read more here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The UK and Scottish governments should act to help businesses exploit opportunities presented by new methods of working required as the lockdown eases, the founder and chief executive of Scottish tech company G-Hold tells BBC Scotland. Alison Grieve says her own business has been able to combine working from home with ""a work space that has allowed for social distancing"" while producing goods that have helped frontline workers. She realises that many businesses will find it more difficult, even impossible, to work under restrictions even as they are relaxed. But she adds: ""For some industries, there are opportunities to tap into supporting these hybrid ways of working."" In particular, office-based companies require software, cyber security and devices and Ms Grieve would like government to help fund such developments. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Restaurants in Italy have re-opened with social distancing rules A metre goes a long way in deciding whether a catering business will be viable as lockdown measures are eased, Edinburgh restaurateur Gino Stornaiuolo tells BBC Radio Scotland. He was reacting to words from Prime Minister Boris Johnson at his media briefing suggesting the present two-metre social distancing rule could be reviewed. ""A metre is not that great, but in this industry a metre is a big thing and if we can get the two metre down to one metre then I really think it will be the difference between businesses going under and businesses surviving,"" he suggests. ""I've got two restaurants. If we are open with these restrictions in place, the 100-cover restaurant could probably do quite well, but the 40-cover restaurant is going to be in trouble. I have gone to my landlord and they are shrugging their shoulders.""  The rearranged Olympic Games will ""not be done with grand splendour"" but will be simplified, Tokyo 2020 chief executive Toshiro Muto has said. The Games, originally scheduled to start next month, werepostponed for a year in Marchbecause of the pandemic. Speaking after an executive board meeting for the International Olympic Committee, Muto added that more than 200 areas had been identified ""where Olympics simplification was possible"" but that ""we are not at the stage where we have concrete ideas on how to simplify the Games"". Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. The Scottish government has confirmed the tourism and hospitality announcement applies to pubs and restaurants. A spokeswoman said: ""It is conditional on the scientific and public health evidence
being in the right place, that restrictions on travel have been eased, and that
the route-map is progressing as planned. âIt must be emphasised this is not guaranteed
and that it may be necessary to change it if sufficient progress has not been
made - but we hope the sector can begin to make its comeback on 15 July.â The tourism and hospitality sector includes
all parts under phase three of the route-map out of lockdown. This covers accommodation providers, visitor
attractions, indoor areas of pubs and restaurants and the wider aspects of
tourism. Phase four of the route map includes events. 1.Coronavirus (COVID-) Phase 1: staying at home and away
from others (physical distancing),external This is the guidance for the
first phase of easing the lockdown. We are still currently in phase one.. 2.Test and Protect,external If you have Covid-19 symptoms go
immediately to NHS Inform online or phone 0800 028 2816 to book a test 3.NHS Inform,external The latest from NHS Scotland and the Scottish
government, including social distancing, face covering and stay at home advice. 4.Coronavirus (COVID-19): shielding support and contacts,external 5.Support for those at high COVID-19 risk:,external  Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's tourism businesses, including pubs, hotels and restaurants, have been told to prepare to reopen on 15 July. The move has been welcomed by the sector, with Fiona Campbell of the Association of Scottish Self Caterers telling Drivetime it provided some hope of a tourist season. However, she also calls for a public messaging campaign to emphasise to the public that holidaying domestically will be safe, as the strength of the stay at home message may put people off. ""Communities need to be able to welcome people knowing that it is safe to do so,"" she says. Crieff Hydro is the flagship hotel in the group Meanwhile, the owner of the Crieff Hydro hotel group -which gave notice that 241 staff face redundancy- continues to warn the sector will still be in danger if the 2m rule remains in place. Stephen Leckie says he was ""delighted"" by today's news but warns businesses will continue to lose money until they are able to reach 70% occupancy. He also suggests severely limiting passenger numbers on ferries would ""throttle"" tourism on Scotland's islands. It is worth stressing the 'support bubbles' announced by Boris Johnson are for England only. Here in Scotland the rules remain that people from two households are only allowed to meet outdoors in small groups of no more than eight. You can check out the Scottish government guidelines here:Coronavirus (COVID-19) Phase 1:
staying at home and away from others (physical distancing),external. The first minister has warned  people thatmeeting up with other households indoors is a ""surefire way"" of allowing coronavirus to spread. Boris Johnson announces that from Saturday 13 June, single adult households in England can form one âsupport bubbleâ with one other household of any size. This means they can go to each otherâs houses, stay the night and donât have to maintain social distancing. The prime minister  says all those in a support bubble will be able to act as if they live in the same household. As such, if any member of the bubble develops symptoms all members of the bubble have to follow guidelines. ""We're making this change to support those who are particularly lonely,"" he says. ""It is not designed for those who do not qualify to start meeting inside people's homes, because that remains against the law."" Those who are shielding cannot take part. The rules in Scotland remain unchanged, with people from two households only allowed to meet outdoors in small groups of no more than eight. Nicola Sturgeon has warned people thatmeeting up with other households indoors is a ""surefire way"" of allowing coronavirus to spread. Allow Twitter content?

Marc Crothall says the UK's 14-day requirement for visitors from abroad, and the 2m social distancing rule, would still present ""a challenge"". But he tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""The 'staycation' market is our immediate opportunity and our hope is that Scots look to holiday in Scotland and get out there and spend money in local economies."" Mr Crothall thinks that there are ""a good range of businesses"" that will be able to open - self-catering, caravan parks, many hotels, visitor attractions, marine tourism and the adventure sector. ""But there will also be a number who will be having to work out whether the viability is there to trade with the distancing regulations as they stand - marine tourism and the adventure sector is well,"" he says.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Professor
Sir David Spiegelhalter explains the risk of dying from Covid-19 very much depends on age and the likelihood of dying within the next year anyway. The average 60 year old has a 1% chance of dying within the next year - and that roughly doubles every seven years after than, the Cambridge University statistician says. This risk doubles if an older person catches coronavirus, he adds. These risks are not the same for younger people, he says. Regarding other impacts of Covid-19, Sir David says there have been lots of extra deaths from people not going to hospital when they need it. But he also says we do not yet know the full impact on mental health, nor the health impacts of the forthcoming economic issues which will affect young people. A further 245 people have died with Covid-19 in UK across all settings, the latestdaily government figures show.,external It takes the total number to have died after testing positive for coronavirus to 41,128.

Philonise Floyd told a House hearing that his brother George could not become ""another name on a list"". ""Be the leaders that this country, this world, needs,"" Mr Floyd said. George Floyd died in Minneapolis in May as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The final moments were filmed on phones.Four police officers involved have been sacked and chargedover his death. Seven solutions to US police problems What Trump states make of unrest Why US protests are so powerful this time Separately, President Donald Trump has signalled his administration's plans to tackle the issues of protests and police brutality are reaching ""final edits"" and they could be made public in the ""coming days"". Lawmakers in the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee have been listening to testimony from civil rights activists and law enforcement officials, a day after the funeral service of George Floyd, 46, in Houston. The committee plans to send a bill to the floor of the Democratic-led House by 4 July on combating police violence and racial injustice. It comes amid a nationwide - and in many cases international - debate on police practices and accountability, and more generally on racial inequity. This video can not be played The hearing comes a day after the funeral of George Floyd in Houston ""I'm here to ask you to make it stop. Stop the pain,"" an emotional Philonise Floyd, 42, told lawmakers. ""George called for help and he was ignored. Please listen to the call I'm making to you now, to the calls of our family and the calls ringing on the streets of all the world. ""The people marching in the streets are telling you enough is enough."" In tears, Mr Floyd later added: ""His kids had to watch that video. It just hurt... you don't do that to a human being... His life mattered. All our lives matter. Black lives matter. I just wish I could get him back. Those officers, they get to live."" This video can not be played Protester Shantania Love, blinded in one eye,  says she has ""no regrets"" Democratic committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said: ""We must remember that [George Floyd] is not just a cause, a name to be chanted in the streets. He was a man. He had a family... we mourn his loss."" The Democratic-proposed bill would make so-called police chokeholds illegal, enforce anti-racism training, bar sacked officers from switching to another force and make it easier to prosecute abuse. Republican committee representative Matt Gaetz said that although elements needed to be ""fine-tuned"", ""you will be able to count on Republican co-operation as we hone these ideas and hopefully pass them and get them to the president's desk"". Timeline of US police killings Signalling that the Trump administration's proposals on the issue would be made public soon, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany insisted the plans would not include any reduction in immunity for police officers, which she called a ""non-starter"". She said that Mr Trump's concern was that police officers should not be vilified. Earlier she said that the president would have ""proactive policy prescriptions, whether that means legislation or an executive order"". As the House hearing was taking place, the police chief in Minneapolis said that his department ""absolutely"" could be reformed and vowed not to let George Floyd's death be in vain. This video can not be played The Minneapolis community at the heart of the protests is rebuilding after destruction caused by rioting Medaria Arradondo said one reform would be to introduce a new early warning system to identify the conduct of police officers. On Sunday, a majority of the city council's members vowed to disband the police department and replace it with a new model of public safety. ""Defund the police"" has been a rallying call for many protesters nationwide. It has been opposed by both President Trump and his Democratic challenger in November's election, Joe Biden. In New Jersey, a FedEx employee and a corrections officer have been suspended from their jobs after a video emerged of two men appearing to re-enact the death of George Floyd in an attempt to taunt people protesting against police brutality A New York police officer has been charged with assault after a woman protester was allegedly thrown to the ground during a rally on 29 May in Brooklyn Police in Minneapolis are investigating Facebook posts reportedly from an active officer that mocked protesters and encouraged looters to target a neighbourhood popular with Somali immigrants More than 1,200 former US justice department employees have urged an internal inquiry into Attorney-General William Barr's role in forcefully dispersing demonstrators from Lafayette Square near the White House on 1 June to clear a path for President Trump to stage a photo op.

England's back-to-school plans 'lie in tatters',"Chemistry experiments are difficult to replicate at home Government plans for schooling during the pandemic ""lie in tatters"", with England's pupils set to miss six months of lessons, Sir Keir Starmer has said. Calling for a national task force to tackle the issue, the Labour leader said the consequences for inequality and children's education were stark. Boris Johnson defended the plan during Prime Minister's Questions, pledging extra support for vulnerable families. Plans for all primary pupils to go back this term were ditched on Tuesday. And although some secondary students, most of whom have been out of school since the end of March, are expected to be invited back for some face-to-face time with their teachers, their lessons are not expected to resume until September at the earliest. Speaking during Wednesday's coronavirus briefing, Mr Johnson said the government ""fully intends"" to bring all children in England back to school in September ""provided the progress we are making continues"". ""What we'll be doing is a huge amount of catch-up for pupils over the summer months,"" he said, adding that the education secretary will announce more on a catch-up programme next week. At PMQs, Sir Keir said Mr Johnson had announced his plan to reopen primaries on 1 June, without consulting head teachers or having convincing scientific evidence on safety. And he said parents had lost confidence in the government's schools plan. He accused the prime minister of ""flailing around trying to blame others"" for what had been a completely avoidable ""mess"". Mr Johnson retaliated, during a series of testy exchanges, saying Sir Keir should ask ""his friends in the left-wing trade unions"", meaning the teachers' unions, to help schools prepare. He also accused the Labour leader of changing his mind over whether schools should be open. Sir Keir said England was an ""outlier"" compared with other countries in Europe, which had re-opened some of their schools. And his attempts to set up a cross-party task force to tackle the issue had been ignored. Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said the government's decision not to require all primary school pupils in England to return to the classroom before the summer holidays was ""disappointing"". She told a House of Lords Committee she was ""saddened"" that people may have become ""more frightened than they actually need to be"". Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield called for a national strategy to return pupils to classes, warning children risked being forgotten as the lockdown lifted. And concerns were raised at the Commons Education Committee about the impact of school closures on children's life chances. Prof Lee Elliot Major, former chief executive of the Sutton Trust education equality charity, said he was ""really worried"" about the eight million children currently out of school. He said: ""There is a tsunami of anxiety hitting schools about the one million children who are going to be taking their GCSEs and A-levels next year."" And there needed to be clarity about how public exams would be handled next year, adding that he preferred a combination of exams and teacher assessment. Sally Collier, chief executive of England's exams watchdog, told the committee contingency plans were being drawn up but gave no details. Reports have suggested Ofqual might be considering delaying exams or using a system involving predictive grades. When are children going back to school? Will universities reopen in September? Ms Collier suggested the government may be re-thinking the content of exams for next year and that schools would need to know at the earliest opportunity what they were going to need to teach next year. Ofqual would be publishing a consultation in the coming weeks on possible measures to ameliorate the impact of educational disruption on next year's exam candidates, she told MPs. National Education Union joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said it was increasingly clear disruption to schooling was going to continue. ""Looking at the exams system, we could face some of this, a very similar situation, next year, we have got to learn from this year,"" he said. Dr  Zubaida Haque, of the Runnymede Trust, said there needed to be an urgent look at what could be done for pupils who were not going back to school this summer. She said there were lots of venues available out of school, which could be utilised because of Covid-19 restrictions - such as football stadiums, private schools and golf fields. She urged ministers to think creatively and urgently about how such facilities could be used, with a view to setting up summer schools to help pupils catch up and support them with pastoral and emotional needs. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Meanwhile,the Welsh government has published new guidance on the measures schools should consider when reopening, including outside learning, teaching in small groups and pupils eating at their desks. Schools in Wales will reopen to all age groups from 29 June but only a third of pupils will be in classes at any one time. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schoolswill reopen from 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. In Northern Ireland,ministers have set a target date for some pupils to go back on 17 August, with a phased return for the rest in September.

"Thousands of UK jobs go in sweeping retail closuresThe owners of Frankie and Benny's, Monsoon Accessorize and Quiz are restructuring their businesses.BusinessComments","The coronavirus pandemic has claimed another 3,600 UK jobs after the Restaurant Group, Monsoon Accessorize and Quiz announced major restructures. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie and Benny's, expects to cut up to 3,000 workers after confirming plans to shut 125 sites. Monsoon Accessorize has announced 545 job losses and the closure of 35 shops. And fashion chain Quiz has put its stores into administration because they are not currently ""financially viable"". Some 93 jobs will be lost through the reorganisation. The Restaurant Group said the closures would fall mainly on its Frankie and Benny's restaurants, but other chains such as Garfunkel's and Chiquito will also be affected. Meanwhile, Monsoon Accessorize said its current structure was ""unviable"" following the lockdown. Monsoon Accessorize assets have been put into administration and sold to a business controlled by Peter Simon, the founder and owner of the chain. It will now attempt to renegotiate the terms of its remaining 162 shops with its landlords and aims to safeguard up to 2,300 jobs. The restructurings are coming thick and fast. And it's no surprise. Retail and hospitality businesses have taken a massive hit in this pandemic. Sales have disappeared. Even when they're able to re-open, many firms will struggle, or be unable, to pay their rent bills for many months to come. These household names were already having challenges before coronavirus. And they're all now hoping to survive in a leaner, slimmed down, form by securing better deals with their landlords. Expect to see a lot more of this in the weeks and months to come. The Restaurant Group is restructuring part of its business through an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). As well as the closures of some of its eateries, the company said it would attempt to renegotiate rents and terms on a further 85 sites. Going into administration: What does it mean? Jobs go as Debenhams shuts more stores Job losses 'just the tip of the iceberg' When will shops open and what will the rules be? The Restaurant Group's chief executive, Andy Hornby, said: ""The proposed CVA will deliver an appropriately-sized estate for our Leisure business to ensure we are well positioned despite the very challenging market conditions facing the casual dining sector."" The Restaurant Group also owns the Wagamama restaurant chain, but this will not be affected by the restructuring. Some of the company's brands were struggling before the pandemic hit as conditions in the so-called fast casual dining sector in which it operates were already tough. The shift to online shopping has meant fewer visitors to its outlets on High Streets and in shopping centres. That, together with rising rent and wage costs, has prompted a wave of site closures. Last year, Restaurant Group said it would close a number of its sites, and in February said it would close a further 90 restaurants by the end of 2021. Monsoon Accessorize will try to renegotiate rental terms on 162 of its remaining shops Quiz said it would put its 82 outlets in the UK and Ireland into administration before buying them back so it can negotiate better rental terms with its landlords. It said some 822 employees out of a total of 915 would transfer to the new company. Quiz chief executive Tarak Ramzan said the company's shops were already facing challenges before the coronavirus outbreak as fewer people were shopping in store. However, he said that ""the significant economic uncertainty we now face as consumers and businesses emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic"" meant that the group had to be restructured. The coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown has prompted thousands of job cuts across the UK economy. On Tuesday, Debenhams said a further 300 jobs would go and in recent weeks Rolls-Royce, British Airways, EasyJet and car dealership Lookers have announced extensive cuts.

Eddo-Lodge breaks book record amid BLM protestsReni Eddo-Lodge becomes the first black British author to top the paperback non-fiction chart.Entertainment & Arts,"Reni Eddo-Lodge's book was originally published in 2017 Reni Eddo-Lodge has become the first black British author to top UK's best-seller list since the official book chart was launched in 1998. Last week, Eddo-Lodge's book Why I'm No Longer Talking To White People About Race topped the paperback non-fiction chart, following protests about racism. The 2017 work has now become the best-selling title in the UK overall, according to Nielsen BookScan. The author said it felt ""absolutely wild to have broken this record"". Allow Twitter content?

Fellow authorNikesh Shukla congratulated her, adding:,external""Bewildering it's taken so long for this to happen but it couldn't happen to a better writer and person."" After she topped the paperback non-fiction chart last week, Eddo-Lodge criticised the UK publishing industry for the fact it had taken so long for a black author to achieve the feat. She said she was ""dismayed"" that the achievement only came about under ""tragic circumstances"" - referring to the death of George Floyd. Renewed interest in the title was sparked following protests around the death of Mr Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. After her book topped the non-fiction chart, Eddo-Lodge said: ""The fact that it's 2020 and I'm the first. Let's be honest. Reader demand aside, that it took this long is a horrible indictment of the publishing industry."" Since 1998, only one other black author, former US first lady Michelle Obama, has scored the overall best-selling book in the UK, with her 2018 memoir Becoming.

Last month, the writerposted online,externalthat she had noticed an upsurge in sales, which she found unsettling. ""This book financially transformed my life and I really don't like the idea of personally profiting every time a video of a black person's death goes viral,"" she wrote, urging readers to offer a donation to the Minnesota Freedom Fund. On Monday, the newly-formedBlack Writers' Guild sent an open letter,externalto publishers raising concerns that the companies were ""raising awareness of racial inequality without significantly addressing their own"". The letter was signed by authors including Evaristo, Zephaniah and Malorie Blackman. Last week, fellow author Dorothy Koomsonposted an open letter,externalto the publishing industry, in which she called it an ""extremely damaging"" environment for black authors.

Regular testing for 'high contact' workers - PMBoris Johnson vows action to mitigate higher coronavirus risks for black and minority ethnic people.,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says black and minority ethnic workers are at the âforefront of the of the struggle against the coronavirusâ Workers in close contact with the public will get coronavirus tests even if they are not showing symptoms, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. The PM said the move would help mitigate higher risks faced by black and minority ethnic workers in ""frontline"" transport and health roles. ""High contact professions"" would now get expanded and targeted testing, he told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions. It followed criticism from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. Virus death risk is higher for ethnic minorities Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Sir Keir referenced aPublic Health England report, saying: ""That report concluded that death rates are highest among black and Asian ethnic groups and it went on to say, and this was the important bit, that it is already clear that relevant guidance and key policies should be adapted to mitigate the risk, already clear. ""If it is already clear that guidance and policy need to be changed, why has the government not already acted?"" The report did not include any recommendations, and the government said it was carrying out more work to find out why risks were higher for certain groups, including whether housing density or profession played a role. Sir Keir Starmer accused the PM of failing to take action But Mr Johnson said the government was ""already acting"" to mitigate coronavirus risks for black and minority ethnic groups, after Sir Keir accused him of failing to take action. He said: ""We are looking at the particular exposure of black and minority ethnic groups to coronavirus and be in no doubt they have been at the forefront of the struggle against coronavirus whether it is in the NHS or public transport."" He said he had reached an agreement with Dido Harding, head of the NHS England's test and trace system, to implement the new measures. Mr Johnson said: ""What we are doing first and most directly is to ensure that those high-contact professions get expanded and targeted testing now."" He said 44% of the NHS workforce in London were from black and minority ethnic groups. The prime minister also announced a Â£63m fund aimed at helping vulnerable families, after Sir Keir called for free school meals to be extended over the summer holiday. The prime minister announced money for local authorities to aid families ""We are announcing a further Â£63m of local welfare assistance to be used by local authorities at their discretion to help the most vulnerable families,"" Mr Johnson told MPs. ""This government has put its arms around the people of this country throughout this crisis and has done its absolute best to help."" The extra money was welcomed by the Local Government Association, but it added: ""Many households are likely to be economically vulnerable for some time to come and it is vital that the government puts local welfare funding on a long-term, sustainable footing. ""The ability of councils to provide preventative support to all households who need it is vital if they are to ensure households can be financially secure and can benefit from council efforts to reboot local economies once the virus is defeated."" Downing Street said the government was looking at whether to extend furlough scheme eligibility for workers who are shielding for health reasons, after it was raised at PMQs. Answering a question from Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft, the prime minister said: ""Clearly newly-shielded people may be asking themselves whether they are entitled to furlough funds. ""I've been made aware of the issue very recently and I can assure her that we will be addressing it forthwith.""

Speaking toITV News,external, Mr Scott, 62, said he believed he would not have been Tasered if he were white. The Met Police said a review had found ""no indication of misconduct"". A spokesman for the force said officers went to the property as part of ""a long-running operation to tackle drugs supply linked to serious violence"". The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for an urgent investigation by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Describing the incident as ""distressing"", Mr Khan said: ""It is absolutely vital that our police service retains the trust of the communities it serves."" Scotland Yard later said it would not refer the incident to the IOPC. It comes amid global protests against racism, inequality and police brutality, following the death ofGeorge Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis, in the US, after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck. Thousands of people have attended largely peaceful demonstrations across the UK in recent days to mark Mr Floyd's death, and highlight racial inequality in Britain. More work needed to tackle racism - Met chief London slavery statue removed from outside museum PM urges peaceful struggle against racism Wretch 32, whose real name is Jermaine Scott, shared the 36-second clip on his Twitter account with the caption: ""This is how the police think they can treat a 62 year old black man in Tottenham but this 1 happens to be my dad."" This video can not be played Millard Scott was Tasered by officers after they entered his home in April It shows Mr Scott falling down the stairs after an officer is heard to warn: ""Police officer with a Taser. Stay where you are."" As officers ask if he is OK and tell him to keep still, a distressed woman can be heard saying: ""They've Tasered him."" Mr Scott told ITV News he was ""lucky to be alive"". He said: ""The only people who have invaded our space are the Metropolitan Police. The only people who seem to ignore the guidelines put out there are the Metropolitan Police. ""It seems at this moment in time we are being singled out and targeted."" Last year, police forces in England and Wales used Tasers on 22,059 occasions - but in only 2,473 occasions were they actually fired. On most occasions, the Tasers were drawn and aimed, but not actually discharged. Proportionally, black people have the weapons used against them eight times more often than white people. The use of Tasers has more than doubled in the five years to 2018-19, as more police forces are equipped with them. The College of Policing says that police officers must clearly communicate their intention to use the weapon and any use must be ""proportionate, lawful, accountable and absolutely necessary"". Wretch 32 told the broadcaster that there has been ""no progression"" and he now warns his own children to be wary of the police. He said: ""I've grown up in a household with a dad and uncle and I've watched them fight against police brutality. ""I'm 35 now and I have to have the same conversation with my children that my father and grandfather had with me. ""That means there's no progression."" A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: ""As officers entered the premises, a man came downstairs and started moving towards an officer suddenly. ""He was ordered to remain where he was but continued towards officers who, after several warnings, deployed a Taser. ""The man was not arrested, but was assessed by the London Ambulance Service at the scene. He did not require further medical treatment. ""Officers from the North Area Command Unit have liaised with the family to discuss any concerns they have about the incident. ""The incident, including body-worn footage, has been reviewed by the Met's directorate of professional standards and no indication of misconduct has been identified."" Police said a 22-year-old man found in the house was arrested and charged with encouraging another to commit an offence, while a 52-year-old woman was charged with obstructing police after being interviewed under caution at a later date. The force said in a further statement that, following examination of the body-worn footage, it believed the incident ""does not meet the criteria for a referral to the IOPC"".

"Single people can stay the night with loved onesThe PM says people living alone in England can form a ""bubble"" with one other household from Saturday.","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: New measure is ""to support those who are particularly lonely as result of lockdown measures"" People living alone in England will be able to stay at one other household as part of a further easing of coronavirus restrictions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that, from Saturday, single adults can spend the night at another house in a ""support bubble"". No 10 said the change aims to help combat loneliness and that people are being trusted to observe the rules. The relaxation does not apply to those who are shielding, or other UK nations. The PM also announced a new national ""catch-up programme"" for school pupils in England, after it was confirmedmost children will not returnto classrooms until September. Mr Johnson told the daily Downing Street briefing the new ""support bubbles"" apply to single adult households or single parents with children under 18. ""All those in a support bubble will be able to act as if they live in the same household, meaning they can spend time together inside each others' homes and do not need to stay two metres apart,"" he said. What am I allowed to do now? What are social bubbles? Coronavirus came to UK 'at least 1,300 times' He added: ""I want to stress that support bubbles must be exclusive, meaning you can't switch the household you are in a bubble with or connect with multiple households. ""And if any member of the support bubble develops symptoms, all members of the bubble will need to follow the normal advice on household isolation."" In addition to the new ""support bubbles"", the PM also confirmednon-essential shopscan reopen on 15 June alongsideoutdoor zoos, safari parksand drive-in cinemas. The government gave examples for how the new ""support bubbles"" might work for single adults in England: A grandparent who lives alone would be able to form a bubble with one of their children, which means they could go to see them and interact with their grandchildren as normal A single parent could form a bubble with a parent or friend so they can interact as normal Two single people who both live on their own could form a bubble And a couple who do not live together could form a bubble, but only if they both live alone No 10 also said that if a person lives alone but their partner has a flatmate, for example, then they can form a bubble but the flatmate cannot then form their own with another household. If anyone within a bubble develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone within the bubble must self-isolate for 14 days. There were 8.2 million people living alone in the UK last year,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, with just under half aged 65-and-over. There were also 2.9 million single-parent households. Mr Johnson said the new rule is ""not designed for people who don't qualify to start meeting inside because that remains against the law"". One part of the bubble has to be a single household, or be a single parent to children aged under 18. It does not apply to grandparents who live together, people living in houses of multiple occupancy, such as flat shares, or to couples who already live together. Those who are shielding cannot be advised to form a bubble, the PM said. He added: ""However, I want to say I know how hard it is for those of you who are shielding and we will say more next week about the arrangements that will be in place for you beyond the end of June."" Boris Johnson is keen to emphasise the government is moving slowly in easing the lockdown. The ""support bubble"" plan is very limited - designed to help the loneliest in England. It's the government dipping another very tentative toe into the water when it comes to easing distancing restrictions. But just as lockdown is eased further, questions are increasing about the decisions we've seen so far. Comments from Prof Neil Ferguson on lockdown coming too late will be very uncomfortable reading for those in power, even if they can say they were acting on the advice they were getting. Likewise, England's chief medical officer saying testing could have been ramped up earlier will be seized upon by the government's critics. The government doesn't want to talk about its early decisions yet - but many others already are. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asked why children will soon be able to go and look at lions in a zoo but may not be able to return to the classroom until September. Mr Johnson said the government had wanted to get the remainder of primary pupils back before the summer holidays. But the circulation of coronavirus was ""not quite down far enough to change the social distancing measures that we have in our schools"". ""What we'll be doing is a huge amount of catch-up for pupils over the summer months,"" he pledged, adding that Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ""will be setting out a lot more next week about the catch-up programme"". He defended the approach on schooling by comparing England's policy to other European countries. And he said a return for all pupils in September depended on progress continuing in controlling the virus. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? Earlier, Prof Neil Ferguson, a former government science adviser, told MPsdeaths in the UK would have halvedhad the country entered lockdown a week earlier. Asked about the comments at the government briefing alongside the PM, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said people would have different views on when the lockdown should have been introduced. He said there was ""very limited"" information about the virus at that stage and we now know more. The PM said: ""It's too early to judge ourselves. We know a lot more about the virus than we did in January, February or even March. ""You have to proceed with caution, that is what we are doing."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Lockdown decisions should be assessed 'in fullness of time' The UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the R number - the number of people an infected person passes the virus on to - remains ""just below one"". ""The epidemic is shrinking, but not fast,"" he said. ""Numbers are coming down but are not yet very low."" Mr Johnson also confirmed there have been a further 245 coronavirus deaths across all settings in the UK, taking the UK death toll to 41,128. The pandemic has, effectively, become a game of risk management - that's because, as Prof Witty says, nothing is ""risk free"". We could continue to suppress the virus by not easing lockdown any further. That would further reduce the spread of coronavirus - and no doubt save lives. But it would come at a huge cost economically, socially, to children's education and also to people's health, whether it is from mental or physical illness linked to continued strict curbs. Instead, the fine line being trod by the government and its advisers is to navigate a way through this (whether they are doing a good job or not is a whole other question). The aim is to keep the spread of the virus low, while reopening society. Whatever is done, there will be victims. In the end it will come down to both political judgements, in terms of how quickly restrictions continue to be lifted, and also individual judgements, in terms of how quickly we each embrace the new freedoms. That, unfortunately, is the way life is in this pandemic. What are the social distancing rules? Who can you have in your bubble?

"'Stop the pain', Floyd's brother tells US CongressPhilonise Floyd, whose brother's killing by a white police officer led to global protests, urges reform.US & Canada","This video can not be played Philonise Floyd: ""Is that what a black man's life is worth? $20?"" The brother of the African American man whose death in police custody has sparked global protests, has urged the US Congress to pass reforms on police brutality and ""stop the pain"". Philonise Floyd told a House hearing that his brother George could not become ""another name on a list"". ""Be the leaders that this country, this world, needs,"" Mr Floyd said. George Floyd died in Minneapolis in May as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

Seven solutions to US police problems What Trump states make of unrest Why US protests are so powerful this time Separately, President Donald Trump has signalled his administration's plans to tackle the issues of protests and police brutality are reaching ""final edits"" and they could be made public in the ""coming days"". Lawmakers in the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee have been listening to testimony from civil rights activists and law enforcement officials, a day after the funeral service of George Floyd, 46, in Houston. The committee plans to send a bill to the floor of the Democratic-led House by 4 July on combating police violence and racial injustice. It comes amid a nationwide - and in many cases international - debate on police practices and accountability, and more generally on racial inequity. This video can not be played The hearing comes a day after the funeral of George Floyd in Houston ""I'm here to ask you to make it stop. Stop the pain,"" an emotional Philonise Floyd, 42, told lawmakers. ""George called for help and he was ignored. Please listen to the call I'm making to you now, to the calls of our family and the calls ringing on the streets of all the world. ""The people marching in the streets are telling you enough is enough."" In tears, Mr Floyd later added: ""His kids had to watch that video. It just hurt... you don't do that to a human being...

The Democratic-proposed bill would make so-called police chokeholds illegal, enforce anti-racism training, bar sacked officers from switching to another force and make it easier to prosecute abuse. Republican committee representative Matt Gaetz said that although elements needed to be ""fine-tuned"", ""you will be able to count on Republican co-operation as we hone these ideas and hopefully pass them and get them to the president's desk"". Timeline of US police killings Signalling that the Trump administration's proposals on the issue would be made public soon, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany insisted the plans would not include any reduction in immunity for police officers, which she called a ""non-starter"". She said that Mr Trump's concern was that police officers should not be vilified. Earlier she said that the president would have ""proactive policy prescriptions, whether that means legislation or an executive order"". As the House hearing was taking place, the police chief in Minneapolis said that his department ""absolutely"" could be reformed and vowed not to let George Floyd's death be in vain. This video can not be played The Minneapolis community at the heart of the protests is rebuilding after destruction caused by rioting Medaria Arradondo said one reform would be to introduce a new early warning system to identify the conduct of police officers. On Sunday, a majority of the city council's members vowed to disband the police department and replace it with a new model of public safety. ""Defund the police"" has been a rallying call for many protesters nationwide. It has been opposed by both President Trump and his Democratic challenger in November's election, Joe Biden.

"Sweden: We know who killed PM PalmeProsecutors say Stig Engstrom, who killed himself in 2000, was the man who shot Olof Palme in 1986.Europe","Olof Palme was assassinated on a Friday night walking down Sweden's busiest street Swedish prosecutors have named the man who they say killed former Swedish prime minister Olof Palme in 1986, ending years of mystery. They said it was Stig Engstrom, a graphic designer known as ""Skandia Man"" who killed himself in 2000. As a result they were closing the investigation into Palme's death, Chief Prosecutor Krister Petersson said. Palme was shot in the back as he walked home from the cinema with his wife in Stockholm. He had already dismissed his security team for the day. The assassination took place on Sweden's busiest road, Sveavagen, and more than a dozen witnesses saw a man fire the shots before fleeing the scene. Palme's son Marten told Swedish radio that he believed prosecutors had reached the right conclusion and were right to close the case. ""However, it was of course a bit disappointing that they didn't have more conclusive evidence, like DNA or a weapon that they could trace to the crime,"" he told the BBC. Thousands of people have been interviewed over Palme's death. A petty criminal was convicted of the killing but the verdict was later dismissed. ""The person is Stig Engstrom,"" Mr Petersson told a news conference. ""Because the person is dead, I cannot bring charges against him and have decided to close the investigation."" The murder weapon has not been found and no new forensic evidence has been uncovered, but prosecutors examining Engstrom's statements to police concluded that his version of events did not add up. Stig Engstrom had weapons training and disliked Palme's policies, investigators say ""How he acted was how we believe the murderer would have acted,"" Mr Petersson added. Stig Engstrom had not initially been a focus for the investigation, the prosecutor said, but when investigators looked into his background they found he was accustomed to using weapons, having been in the army, and was a member of a shooting club. In his local area he was also part of a circle of critics of Palme's policies and relatives said he had a negative view of the prime minister. Engstrom also had long running financial problems and a growing problem with alcohol. However investigators still did not have a ""clear picture"" of Engstrom's motive for killing Palme, Mr Petersson said. Stig Engstrom became known as Skandia Man as he had worked for the Skandia insurance company. He had been working late on the evening of the murder at the the firm's HQ close to the crime scene. Engstrom was known to have been present at the scene of the murder. He was questioned by police several times but was quickly dismissed as a suspect. Mr Petersson said witness descriptions of the gunman correlated with Engstrom's appearance and witnesses also contradicted Engstrom's own account of his movements at the scene. Engstrom lied about the moments after the murder, even claiming he had tried to resuscitate Palme. He eventually killed himself in 2000. He was first identified as a suspect by journalist Thomas Pettersson, and police started looking into Engstrom 18 years after his death. Who assassinated this prime minister and why? 'New lead' in unsolved murder of Swedish PM Stig Engstrom's ex-wife told Expressen newspaper in 2018 that she had been questioned by detectives in 2017. At the time she said the suspicion of his guilt was out of the question. ""He was too much of a coward. He wouldn't harm a fly,"" she said. By Maddy Savage, BBC News, Stockholm Sweden's current Prime Minister Stefan Lofven once described the failure to determine who killed Olof Palme as an ""open wound"" in Swedish society. But the announcement that prosecutors believe they've identified the killer might not be enough to heal decades of uncertainty surrounding the death of one of the country's most influential and globally recognised leaders. With no new forensic evidence or links to a gun, many are asking why it took investigators so long to reach their conclusion, which was largely the result of combing through witness statements taken from Stig Engstrom and others at the scene. Others are angry that the suspect, who died in 2000, will never be brought to justice. For journalists following the story, the long, dry, news conference to announce the findings came as a flat ending to decades of wide-ranging theories about the assassination and claims in one Swedish tabloid this week that the killer's weapon had been traced. But the chief prosecutor told one reporter he wasn't ""stupid enough"" to believe that their conclusions would put an end to the conspiracies. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said it had been ""a day full of emotions"" and underlined that it was ""not the government's place to judge prosecutors' conclusions"". ""The shots on Sveavagen on that February night in 1986 turned into a crisis, a wound, a riddle without an answer,"" he said, adding: ""It is my sincerest wish that the wound can now begin to heal."" He said Swedish governments had taken responsibility for failures in the investigation by setting up an inquiry. ""The best way to bring this matter to a close would of course have been a curt decision. It is undoubtedly true that mistakes have been made during the decades the matter has been investigated,"" he said. The assassination shocked Sweden, and spawned countless conspiracy theories Meanwhile diplomat and politician Pierre Schori, a former adviser to Palme, told the BBC the investigation had come to a credible conclusion. ""I think the prosecutor has made a good job. He is a serious person. I have been interviewed myself by his team and he is also extremely critical of his predecessors who spent over 30 years ignoring important witnesses and evident information. So I think this is as good as it gets,"" he said. The Swedish prime minister had discharged his guards on a Friday night on 28 February 1986 and had gone to the cinema with his wife Lisbet, their son Marten and his girlfriend. Walking with his wife after the film on busy Sveavagen, they were attacked by a gunman from behind. Palme, 59, was shot in the back and died instantly. Bullets were recovered at the scene from a .357 Magnum handgun, but the gun was never found. Police did not cordon off the murder scene properly, enabling onlookers to walk around and destroy potential forensic evidence. One man did go to jail. Convicted criminal Christer Pettersson - who has no connection to the prosecutor - was identified in a line-up by Lisbet Palme and jailed for life in 1989. Palme was shot on Sweden's busiest street But he was quickly released on appeal as no motive had been established and no weapon retrieved. Pettersson died in 2004. More than 130 people have confessed to the murder, the head of the investigation Hans Melander said. A charismatic prime minister who led Sweden's Social Democratic party, Palme was also outspoken on several international issues. At home he had infuriated business owners with reforms and spoken out against nuclear power. He was critical of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the US bombing of North Vietnam and had attacked South Africa's ""gruesome"" regime of apartheid. The case has dogged Swedish police for decades. For years it obsessed renowned author Stieg Larsson, who wrote The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Among the theories put forward over the years, Palme might have been assassinated because: He stood up against apartheid and funded the African National Congress (ANC) - Swedish police travelled to South Africa in 1996 to investigate the claim Palme had discovered that Swedish arms firm Bofors had used bribery to set up an Indian weapons deal Palme's government had declared the Kurdish militant PKK group terrorists Lisbet Palme died in 2018 without knowing conclusively who murdered her husband.

Scottish tourism sector could reopen on 15 July,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Tourism in Scotland could reopen by mid-July Scotland's tourism businesses, including pubs, hotels and restaurants, have been told to prepare to reopen on 15 July. Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing said the date was conditional on moving to the third phase of the route map for easing lockdown restrictions. Announcing a new taskforce, he said businesses needed clarity to be able to plan for reopening. But he warned the date may change if the evidence on Covid-19 requires it. Mr Ewing told MSPs the pandemic had left the industry facing unprecedented challenges. But he said a new taskforce would focus on the sector's recovery needs, actions being taken by the UK government and the development of a new domestic visitor marketing campaign. Mr Ewing said this was in addition to a Â£2.3bn package of support for businesses which included measures specific to the tourism and hospitality sector, such as a full year of non-domestic rates relief and specific grant schemes. Mr Ewing said: ""The coronavirus pandemic has presented challenges across the entirety of the Scottish economy, but it is very clear there are exceptional circumstances facing this sector that must be recognised. ""We have acted as quickly as we can to address the significant financial challenges faced by businesses and provide a comprehensive package of support."" Tom Ponton, owner of the Oz Bar in Edinburgh, said the lockdown had left him in debt for the first time in his life Tom Ponton, owner of the Oz Bar in Edinburgh, said the news was ""very welcome and long overdue"" after a ""very anxious period"" for the industry. ""We really need to know what the guidelines are before we get too excited, but this is still very, very welcome,"" he said. ""This is the toughest adversity I've ever faced in the 40 years I've been in the trade. ""I've felt very anxious during the lockdown and I have had to borrow Â£70,000 to get me through. I've never had debt in my life before and now I do. ""Maybe we shouldn't have been so quick to cancel everything in the summer. We treble our turnover during the four weeks of the Edinburgh Festivals, which now we won't have."" Mr Ewing also said the Scottish government was asking the UK government to do more, including a review of VAT rates and to consider extensions to schemes such as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. ""I've been engaging with businesses since the beginning of the outbreak and I have heard their calls for more clarity, which today I can provide,"" he said. ""Businesses should start to prepare for a provisional return to trading - with appropriate safety guidelines - on the 15th July 2020. ""This date cannot be definitive and is conditional on public health advice and progression to phase three of the route map. Businesses must now use this time to satisfy the necessary regulations and adapt to the new way of living."" The Scottish government confirmed the tourism and hospitality announcement applies to pubs, hotels and restaurants. Phase three of theroute-map out of lockdowncovers accommodation providers, visitor attractions, indoor areas of pubs and restaurants and the wider aspects of tourism. A review of the lockdown restructions is due on 9 July, and the reopening of the tourism sector has tentatively been scheduled for six days after that to allow services like transport to prepare. Phase four of the route map includes events and no possible dates have yet been given for this stage. Marc Crothall, chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, said the announcement was ""a hugely positive milestone in our road to recovery"". He said they had been pushing for a date so that accommodation providers, visitor attractions, pubs and restaurants could plan effectively. He said this would include accepting bookings, arranging for staff to return from furlough, and ensuring that safety measures are in place for both employees and customers. Mr Crothall said ""urgent solutions or alternative measures"" were needed to ""overcome"" the current two metre distancing restrictions.

"Sweden: We know who killed PM PalmeProsecutors say Stig Engstrom, who killed himself in 2000, was the man who shot Olof Palme in 1986.","Olof Palme was assassinated on a Friday night walking down Sweden's busiest street Swedish prosecutors have named the man who they say killed former Swedish prime minister Olof Palme in 1986, ending years of mystery. They said it was Stig Engstrom, a graphic designer known as ""Skandia Man"" who killed himself in 2000. As a result they were closing the investigation into Palme's death, Chief Prosecutor Krister Petersson said. Palme was shot in the back as he walked home from the cinema with his wife in Stockholm. He had already dismissed his security team for the day. The assassination took place on Sweden's busiest road, Sveavagen, and more than a dozen witnesses saw a man fire the shots before fleeing the scene. Palme's son Marten told Swedish radio that he believed prosecutors had reached the right conclusion and were right to close the case. ""However, it was of course a bit disappointing that they didn't have more conclusive evidence, like DNA or a weapon that they could trace to the crime,"" he told the BBC. Thousands of people have been interviewed over Palme's death. A petty criminal was convicted of the killing but the verdict was later dismissed. ""The person is Stig Engstrom,"" Mr Petersson told a news conference. ""Because the person is dead, I cannot bring charges against him and have decided to close the investigation."" The murder weapon has not been found and no new forensic evidence has been uncovered, but prosecutors examining Engstrom's statements to police concluded that his version of events did not add up. Stig Engstrom had weapons training and disliked Palme's policies, investigators say ""How he acted was how we believe the murderer would have acted,"" Mr Petersson added. Stig Engstrom had not initially been a focus for the investigation, the prosecutor said, but when investigators looked into his background they found he was accustomed to using weapons, having been in the army, and was a member of a shooting club. In his local area he was also part of a circle of critics of Palme's policies and relatives said he had a negative view of the prime minister. Engstrom also had long running financial problems and a growing problem with alcohol. However investigators still did not have a ""clear picture"" of Engstrom's motive for killing Palme, Mr Petersson said. Stig Engstrom became known as Skandia Man as he had worked for the Skandia insurance company. He had been working late on the evening of the murder at the the firm's HQ close to the crime scene. Engstrom was known to have been present at the scene of the murder. He was questioned by police several times but was quickly dismissed as a suspect. Mr Petersson said witness descriptions of the gunman correlated with Engstrom's appearance and witnesses also contradicted Engstrom's own account of his movements at the scene. Engstrom lied about the moments after the murder, even claiming he had tried to resuscitate Palme. He eventually killed himself in 2000. He was first identified as a suspect by journalist Thomas Pettersson, and police started looking into Engstrom 18 years after his death. Who assassinated this prime minister and why? 'New lead' in unsolved murder of Swedish PM Stig Engstrom's ex-wife told Expressen newspaper in 2018 that she had been questioned by detectives in 2017. At the time she said the suspicion of his guilt was out of the question. ""He was too much of a coward. He wouldn't harm a fly,"" she said. By Maddy Savage, BBC News, Stockholm Sweden's current Prime Minister Stefan Lofven once described the failure to determine who killed Olof Palme as an ""open wound"" in Swedish society. But the announcement that prosecutors believe they've identified the killer might not be enough to heal decades of uncertainty surrounding the death of one of the country's most influential and globally recognised leaders. With no new forensic evidence or links to a gun, many are asking why it took investigators so long to reach their conclusion, which was largely the result of combing through witness statements taken from Stig Engstrom and others at the scene. Others are angry that the suspect, who died in 2000, will never be brought to justice. For journalists following the story, the long, dry, news conference to announce the findings came as a flat ending to decades of wide-ranging theories about the assassination and claims in one Swedish tabloid this week that the killer's weapon had been traced. But the chief prosecutor told one reporter he wasn't ""stupid enough"" to believe that their conclusions would put an end to the conspiracies. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said it had been ""a day full of emotions"" and underlined that it was ""not the government's place to judge prosecutors' conclusions"". ""The shots on Sveavagen on that February night in 1986 turned into a crisis, a wound, a riddle without an answer,"" he said, adding: ""It is my sincerest wish that the wound can now begin to heal."" He said Swedish governments had taken responsibility for failures in the investigation by setting up an inquiry. ""The best way to bring this matter to a close would of course have been a curt decision. It is undoubtedly true that mistakes have been made during the decades the matter has been investigated,"" he said. The assassination shocked Sweden, and spawned countless conspiracy theories Meanwhile diplomat and politician Pierre Schori, a former adviser to Palme, told the BBC the investigation had come to a credible conclusion. ""I think the prosecutor has made a good job. He is a serious person. I have been interviewed myself by his team and he is also extremely critical of his predecessors who spent over 30 years ignoring important witnesses and evident information. So I think this is as good as it gets,"" he said. The Swedish prime minister had discharged his guards on a Friday night on 28 February 1986 and had gone to the cinema with his wife Lisbet, their son Marten and his girlfriend. Walking with his wife after the film on busy Sveavagen, they were attacked by a gunman from behind. Palme, 59, was shot in the back and died instantly. Bullets were recovered at the scene from a .357 Magnum handgun, but the gun was never found. Police did not cordon off the murder scene properly, enabling onlookers to walk around and destroy potential forensic evidence. One man did go to jail. Convicted criminal Christer Pettersson - who has no connection to the prosecutor - was identified in a line-up by Lisbet Palme and jailed for life in 1989. Palme was shot on Sweden's busiest street But he was quickly released on appeal as no motive had been established and no weapon retrieved. Pettersson died in 2004. More than 130 people have confessed to the murder, the head of the investigation Hans Melander said. A charismatic prime minister who led Sweden's Social Democratic party, Palme was also outspoken on several international issues. At home he had infuriated business owners with reforms and spoken out against nuclear power. He was critical of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the US bombing of North Vietnam and had attacked South Africa's ""gruesome"" regime of apartheid. The case has dogged Swedish police for decades. For years it obsessed renowned author Stieg Larsson, who wrote The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Among the theories put forward over the years, Palme might have been assassinated because: He stood up against apartheid and funded the African National Congress (ANC) - Swedish police travelled to South Africa in 1996 to investigate the claim Palme had discovered that Swedish arms firm Bofors had used bribery to set up an Indian weapons deal Palme's government had declared the Kurdish militant PKK group terrorists Lisbet Palme died in 2018 without knowing conclusively who murdered her husband.

Thousands of UK jobs go in sweeping retail closures,"The coronavirus pandemic has claimed another 3,600 UK jobs after the Restaurant Group, Monsoon Accessorize and Quiz announced major restructures. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie and Benny's, expects to cut up to 3,000 workers after confirming plans to shut 125 sites. Monsoon Accessorize has announced 545 job losses and the closure of 35 shops. And fashion chain Quiz has put its stores into administration because they are not currently ""financially viable"". Some 93 jobs will be lost through the reorganisation. The Restaurant Group said the closures would fall mainly on its Frankie and Benny's restaurants, but other chains such as Garfunkel's and Chiquito will also be affected. Meanwhile, Monsoon Accessorize said its current structure was ""unviable"" following the lockdown. Monsoon Accessorize assets have been put into administration and sold to a business controlled by Peter Simon, the founder and owner of the chain. It will now attempt to renegotiate the terms of its remaining 162 shops with its landlords and aims to safeguard up to 2,300 jobs. The restructurings are coming thick and fast. And it's no surprise. Retail and hospitality businesses have taken a massive hit in this pandemic. Sales have disappeared. Even when they're able to re-open, many firms will struggle, or be unable, to pay their rent bills for many months to come. These household names were already having challenges before coronavirus. And they're all now hoping to survive in a leaner, slimmed down, form by securing better deals with their landlords. Expect to see a lot more of this in the weeks and months to come. The Restaurant Group is restructuring part of its business through an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). As well as the closures of some of its eateries, the company said it would attempt to renegotiate rents and terms on a further 85 sites. Going into administration: What does it mean? Jobs go as Debenhams shuts more stores Job losses 'just the tip of the iceberg' When will shops open and what will the rules be? The Restaurant Group's chief executive, Andy Hornby, said: ""The proposed CVA will deliver an appropriately-sized estate for our Leisure business to ensure we are well positioned despite the very challenging market conditions facing the casual dining sector."" The Restaurant Group also owns the Wagamama restaurant chain, but this will not be affected by the restructuring. Some of the company's brands were struggling before the pandemic hit as conditions in the so-called fast casual dining sector in which it operates were already tough. The shift to online shopping has meant fewer visitors to its outlets on High Streets and in shopping centres. That, together with rising rent and wage costs, has prompted a wave of site closures. Last year, Restaurant Group said it would close a number of its sites, and in February said it would close a further 90 restaurants by the end of 2021. Monsoon Accessorize will try to renegotiate rental terms on 162 of its remaining shops Quiz said it would put its 82 outlets in the UK and Ireland into administration before buying them back so it can negotiate better rental terms with its landlords. It said some 822 employees out of a total of 915 would transfer to the new company. Quiz chief executive Tarak Ramzan said the company's shops were already facing challenges before the coronavirus outbreak as fewer people were shopping in store. However, he said that ""the significant economic uncertainty we now face as consumers and businesses emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic"" meant that the group had to be restructured. The coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown has prompted thousands of job cuts across the UK economy. On Tuesday, Debenhams said a further 300 jobs would go and in recent weeks Rolls-Royce, British Airways, EasyJet and car dealership Lookers have announced extensive cuts.

Single people can stay the night with loved onesThe PM says people living alone in England can form a bubble with one other household from Saturday.UK,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: New measure is ""to support those who are particularly lonely as result of lockdown measures"" People living alone in England will be able to stay at one other household as part of a further easing of coronavirus restrictions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that, from Saturday, single adults can spend the night at another house in a ""support bubble"". No 10 said the change aims to help combat loneliness and that people are being trusted to observe the rules. The relaxation does not apply to those who are shielding, or other UK nations. The PM also announced a new national ""catch-up programme"" for school pupils in England, after it was confirmedmost children will not returnto classrooms until September. Mr Johnson told the daily Downing Street briefing the new ""support bubbles"" apply to single adult households or single parents with children under 18. ""All those in a support bubble will be able to act as if they live in the same household, meaning they can spend time together inside each others' homes and do not need to stay two metres apart,"" he said. What am I allowed to do now? What are social bubbles? Coronavirus came to UK 'at least 1,300 times' He added: ""I want to stress that support bubbles must be exclusive, meaning you can't switch the household you are in a bubble with or connect with multiple households. ""And if any member of the support bubble develops symptoms, all members of the bubble will need to follow the normal advice on household isolation."" In addition to the new ""support bubbles"", the PM also confirmednon-essential shopscan reopen on 15 June alongsideoutdoor zoos, safari parksand drive-in cinemas. The government gave examples for how the new ""support bubbles"" might work for single adults in England: A grandparent who lives alone would be able to form a bubble with one of their children, which means they could go to see them and interact with their grandchildren as normal A single parent could form a bubble with a parent or friend so they can interact as normal Two single people who both live on their own could form a bubble And a couple who do not live together could form a bubble, but only if they both live alone No 10 also said that if a person lives alone but their partner has a flatmate, for example, then they can form a bubble but the flatmate cannot then form their own with another household. If anyone within a bubble develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone within the bubble must self-isolate for 14 days. There were 8.2 million people living alone in the UK last year,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, with just under half aged 65-and-over. There were also 2.9 million single-parent households. Mr Johnson said the new rule is ""not designed for people who don't qualify to start meeting inside because that remains against the law"". One part of the bubble has to be a single household, or be a single parent to children aged under 18. It does not apply to grandparents who live together, people living in houses of multiple occupancy, such as flat shares, or to couples who already live together. Those who are shielding cannot be advised to form a bubble, the PM said. He added: ""However, I want to say I know how hard it is for those of you who are shielding and we will say more next week about the arrangements that will be in place for you beyond the end of June."" Boris Johnson is keen to emphasise the government is moving slowly in easing the lockdown. The ""support bubble"" plan is very limited - designed to help the loneliest in England. It's the government dipping another very tentative toe into the water when it comes to easing distancing restrictions. But just as lockdown is eased further, questions are increasing about the decisions we've seen so far. Comments from Prof Neil Ferguson on lockdown coming too late will be very uncomfortable reading for those in power, even if they can say they were acting on the advice they were getting. Likewise, England's chief medical officer saying testing could have been ramped up earlier will be seized upon by the government's critics. The government doesn't want to talk about its early decisions yet - but many others already are. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asked why children will soon be able to go and look at lions in a zoo but may not be able to return to the classroom until September. Mr Johnson said the government had wanted to get the remainder of primary pupils back before the summer holidays. But the circulation of coronavirus was ""not quite down far enough to change the social distancing measures that we have in our schools"". ""What we'll be doing is a huge amount of catch-up for pupils over the summer months,"" he pledged, adding that Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ""will be setting out a lot more next week about the catch-up programme"". He defended the approach on schooling by comparing England's policy to other European countries. And he said a return for all pupils in September depended on progress continuing in controlling the virus. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? Earlier, Prof Neil Ferguson, a former government science adviser, told MPsdeaths in the UK would have halvedhad the country entered lockdown a week earlier. Asked about the comments at the government briefing alongside the PM, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said people would have different views on when the lockdown should have been introduced. He said there was ""very limited"" information about the virus at that stage and we now know more. The PM said: ""It's too early to judge ourselves. We know a lot more about the virus than we did in January, February or even March. ""You have to proceed with caution, that is what we are doing."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Lockdown decisions should be assessed 'in fullness of time' The UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the R number - the number of people an infected person passes the virus on to - remains ""just below one"". ""The epidemic is shrinking, but not fast,"" he said. ""Numbers are coming down but are not yet very low."" Mr Johnson also confirmed there have been a further 245 coronavirus deaths across all settings in the UK, taking the UK death toll to 41,128. The pandemic has, effectively, become a game of risk management - that's because, as Prof Witty says, nothing is ""risk free"". We could continue to suppress the virus by not easing lockdown any further. That would further reduce the spread of coronavirus - and no doubt save lives. But it would come at a huge cost economically, socially, to children's education and also to people's health, whether it is from mental or physical illness linked to continued strict curbs. Instead, the fine line being trod by the government and its advisers is to navigate a way through this (whether they are doing a good job or not is a whole other question). The aim is to keep the spread of the virus low, while reopening society. Whatever is done, there will be victims. In the end it will come down to both political judgements, in terms of how quickly restrictions continue to be lifted, and also individual judgements, in terms of how quickly we each embrace the new freedoms. That, unfortunately, is the way life is in this pandemic. What are the social distancing rules? Who can you have in your bubble?

Coronavirus came to UK 'at least 1,300 times' He added: ""I want to stress that support bubbles must be exclusive, meaning you can't switch the household you are in a bubble with or connect with multiple households. ""And if any member of the support bubble develops symptoms, all members of the bubble will need to follow the normal advice on household isolation."" In addition to the new ""support bubbles"", the PM also confirmednon-essential shopscan reopen on 15 June alongsideoutdoor zoos, safari parksand drive-in cinemas. The government gave examples for how the new ""support bubbles"" might work for single adults in England: A grandparent who lives alone would be able to form a bubble with one of their children, which means they could go to see them and interact with their grandchildren as normal A single parent could form a bubble with a parent or friend so they can interact as normal Two single people who both live on their own could form a bubble And a couple who do not live together could form a bubble, but only if they both live alone No 10 also said that if a person lives alone but their partner has a flatmate, for example, then they can form a bubble but the flatmate cannot then form their own with another household. If anyone within a bubble develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone within the bubble must self-isolate for 14 days. There were 8.2 million people living alone in the UK last year,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, with just under half aged 65-and-over. There were also 2.9 million single-parent households. Mr Johnson said the new rule is ""not designed for people who don't qualify to start meeting inside because that remains against the law"". One part of the bubble has to be a single household, or be a single parent to children aged under 18. It does not apply to grandparents who live together, people living in houses of multiple occupancy, such as flat shares, or to couples who already live together. Those who are shielding cannot be advised to form a bubble, the PM said. He added: ""However, I want to say I know how hard it is for those of you who are shielding and we will say more next week about the arrangements that will be in place for you beyond the end of June."" Boris Johnson is keen to emphasise the government is moving slowly in easing the lockdown. The ""support bubble"" plan is very limited - designed to help the loneliest in England. It's the government dipping another very tentative toe into the water when it comes to easing distancing restrictions. But just as lockdown is eased further, questions are increasing about the decisions we've seen so far. Comments from Prof Neil Ferguson on lockdown coming too late will be very uncomfortable reading for those in power, even if they can say they were acting on the advice they were getting. Likewise, England's chief medical officer saying testing could have been ramped up earlier will be seized upon by the government's critics. The government doesn't want to talk about its early decisions yet - but many others already are. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asked why children will soon be able to go and look at lions in a zoo but may not be able to return to the classroom until September. Mr Johnson said the government had wanted to get the remainder of primary pupils back before the summer holidays. But the circulation of coronavirus was ""not quite down far enough to change the social distancing measures that we have in our schools"". ""What we'll be doing is a huge amount of catch-up for pupils over the summer months,"" he pledged, adding that Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ""will be setting out a lot more next week about the catch-up programme"". He defended the approach on schooling by comparing England's policy to other European countries. And he said a return for all pupils in September depended on progress continuing in controlling the virus. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? Earlier, Prof Neil Ferguson, a former government science adviser, told MPsdeaths in the UK would have halvedhad the country entered lockdown a week earlier. Asked about the comments at the government briefing alongside the PM, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said people would have different views on when the lockdown should have been introduced. He said there was ""very limited"" information about the virus at that stage and we now know more. The PM said: ""It's too early to judge ourselves. We know a lot more about the virus than we did in January, February or even March. ""You have to proceed with caution, that is what we are doing."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Lockdown decisions should be assessed 'in fullness of time' The UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the R number - the number of people an infected person passes the virus on to - remains ""just below one"". ""The epidemic is shrinking, but not fast,"" he said. ""Numbers are coming down but are not yet very low."" Mr Johnson also confirmed there have been a further 245 coronavirus deaths across all settings in the UK, taking the UK death toll to 41,128. The pandemic has, effectively, become a game of risk management - that's because, as Prof Witty says, nothing is ""risk free"". We could continue to suppress the virus by not easing lockdown any further. That would further reduce the spread of coronavirus - and no doubt save lives. But it would come at a huge cost economically, socially, to children's education and also to people's health, whether it is from mental or physical illness linked to continued strict curbs. Instead, the fine line being trod by the government and its advisers is to navigate a way through this (whether they are doing a good job or not is a whole other question). The aim is to keep the spread of the virus low, while reopening society. Whatever is done, there will be victims. In the end it will come down to both political judgements, in terms of how quickly restrictions continue to be lifted, and also individual judgements, in terms of how quickly we each embrace the new freedoms. That, unfortunately, is the way life is in this pandemic. What are the social distancing rules? Who can you have in your bubble?

'Tsunami of anxiety' over next year's exams,"Chemistry experiments are difficult to replicate at home Government plans for schooling during the pandemic ""lie in tatters"", with England's pupils set to miss six months of lessons, Sir Keir Starmer has said. Calling for a national task force to tackle the issue, the Labour leader said the consequences for inequality and children's education were stark. Boris Johnson defended the plan during Prime Minister's Questions, pledging extra support for vulnerable families. Plans for all primary pupils to go back this term were ditched on Tuesday. And although some secondary students, most of whom have been out of school since the end of March, are expected to be invited back for some face-to-face time with their teachers, their lessons are not expected to resume until September at the earliest. Speaking during Wednesday's coronavirus briefing, Mr Johnson said the government ""fully intends"" to bring all children in England back to school in September ""provided the progress we are making continues"". ""What we'll be doing is a huge amount of catch-up for pupils over the summer months,"" he said, adding that the education secretary will announce more on a catch-up programme next week. At PMQs, Sir Keir said Mr Johnson had announced his plan to reopen primaries on 1 June, without consulting head teachers or having convincing scientific evidence on safety. And he said parents had lost confidence in the government's schools plan. He accused the prime minister of ""flailing around trying to blame others"" for what had been a completely avoidable ""mess"". Mr Johnson retaliated, during a series of testy exchanges, saying Sir Keir should ask ""his friends in the left-wing trade unions"", meaning the teachers' unions, to help schools prepare. He also accused the Labour leader of changing his mind over whether schools should be open. Sir Keir said England was an ""outlier"" compared with other countries in Europe, which had re-opened some of their schools. And his attempts to set up a cross-party task force to tackle the issue had been ignored. Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said the government's decision not to require all primary school pupils in England to return to the classroom before the summer holidays was ""disappointing"". She told a House of Lords Committee she was ""saddened"" that people may have become ""more frightened than they actually need to be"". Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield called for a national strategy to return pupils to classes, warning children risked being forgotten as the lockdown lifted. And concerns were raised at the Commons Education Committee about the impact of school closures on children's life chances. Prof Lee Elliot Major, former chief executive of the Sutton Trust education equality charity, said he was ""really worried"" about the eight million children currently out of school. He said: ""There is a tsunami of anxiety hitting schools about the one million children who are going to be taking their GCSEs and A-levels next year."" And there needed to be clarity about how public exams would be handled next year, adding that he preferred a combination of exams and teacher assessment. Sally Collier, chief executive of England's exams watchdog, told the committee contingency plans were being drawn up but gave no details. Reports have suggested Ofqual might be considering delaying exams or using a system involving predictive grades. When are children going back to school? Will universities reopen in September? Ms Collier suggested the government may be re-thinking the content of exams for next year and that schools would need to know at the earliest opportunity what they were going to need to teach next year. Ofqual would be publishing a consultation in the coming weeks on possible measures to ameliorate the impact of educational disruption on next year's exam candidates, she told MPs. National Education Union joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said it was increasingly clear disruption to schooling was going to continue. ""Looking at the exams system, we could face some of this, a very similar situation, next year, we have got to learn from this year,"" he said. Dr  Zubaida Haque, of the Runnymede Trust, said there needed to be an urgent look at what could be done for pupils who were not going back to school this summer. She said there were lots of venues available out of school, which could be utilised because of Covid-19 restrictions - such as football stadiums, private schools and golf fields. She urged ministers to think creatively and urgently about how such facilities could be used, with a view to setting up summer schools to help pupils catch up and support them with pastoral and emotional needs. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Meanwhile,the Welsh government has published new guidance on the measures schools should consider when reopening, including outside learning, teaching in small groups and pupils eating at their desks. Schools in Wales will reopen to all age groups from 29 June but only a third of pupils will be in classes at any one time. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schoolswill reopen from 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. In Northern Ireland,ministers have set a target date for some pupils to go back on 17 August, with a phased return for the rest in September.

Regular testing for 'high contact' workers - PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says black and minority ethnic workers are at the âforefront of the of the struggle against the coronavirusâ Workers in close contact with the public will get coronavirus tests even if they are not showing symptoms, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. The PM said the move would help mitigate higher risks faced by black and minority ethnic workers in ""frontline"" transport and health roles. ""High contact professions"" would now get expanded and targeted testing, he told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions. It followed criticism from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. Virus death risk is higher for ethnic minorities Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Sir Keir referenced aPublic Health England report, saying: ""That report concluded that death rates are highest among black and Asian ethnic groups and it went on to say, and this was the important bit, that it is already clear that relevant guidance and key policies should be adapted to mitigate the risk, already clear. ""If it is already clear that guidance and policy need to be changed, why has the government not already acted?"" The report did not include any recommendations, and the government said it was carrying out more work to find out why risks were higher for certain groups, including whether housing density or profession played a role. Sir Keir Starmer accused the PM of failing to take action But Mr Johnson said the government was ""already acting"" to mitigate coronavirus risks for black and minority ethnic groups, after Sir Keir accused him of failing to take action. He said: ""We are looking at the particular exposure of black and minority ethnic groups to coronavirus and be in no doubt they have been at the forefront of the struggle against coronavirus whether it is in the NHS or public transport."" He said he had reached an agreement with Dido Harding, head of the NHS England's test and trace system, to implement the new measures. Mr Johnson said: ""What we are doing first and most directly is to ensure that those high-contact professions get expanded and targeted testing now."" He said 44% of the NHS workforce in London were from black and minority ethnic groups. The prime minister also announced a Â£63m fund aimed at helping vulnerable families, after Sir Keir called for free school meals to be extended over the summer holiday. The prime minister announced money for local authorities to aid families ""We are announcing a further Â£63m of local welfare assistance to be used by local authorities at their discretion to help the most vulnerable families,"" Mr Johnson told MPs. ""This government has put its arms around the people of this country throughout this crisis and has done its absolute best to help."" The extra money was welcomed by the Local Government Association, but it added: ""Many households are likely to be economically vulnerable for some time to come and it is vital that the government puts local welfare funding on a long-term, sustainable footing. ""The ability of councils to provide preventative support to all households who need it is vital if they are to ensure households can be financially secure and can benefit from council efforts to reboot local economies once the virus is defeated."" Downing Street said the government was looking at whether to extend furlough scheme eligibility for workers who are shielding for health reasons, after it was raised at PMQs. Answering a question from Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft, the prime minister said: ""Clearly newly-shielded people may be asking themselves whether they are entitled to furlough funds. ""I've been made aware of the issue very recently and I can assure her that we will be addressing it forthwith.""

University to rename Gladstone site after campaign,"William Ewart Gladstone argued against the abolition of slavery The University of Liverpool has agreed to rename a building named after former prime minister William Gladstone due to his links to the slave trade. Gladstonespoke out against abolition in Parliament,externalbecause his family had slaves on plantations in the Caribbean. Students wrote an open letter,externalsaying the move would ""show solidarity in the rejection of Black oppression"". The university said it will work with students and staff ""to agree an appropriate alternative name"". Gladstone Hall in the Greenbank Student Village was recently rebuilt but the name was kept Students have beencampaigning over the issue for several years, arguing that the university should not be honouring people who benefited from slavery. The move follows Black Lives Matter protests in the city in response to the death of American George Floyd andthe tearing down of a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. Thousands of people have also beendemanding a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes be removed from Oxford University's Oriel College. Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstonewas born in Liverpool in 1809 and is the only person to have been prime minister on four separate occasions. He is described as having ""ultra-conservative"" views and used his maiden speech in the House of Commons to support his father's interests, arguing against abolition. While that argument failed, his finances did not - when slavery was abolished in the 1830s, the Gladstones received more than Â£90,000, about Â£9.5m in today's terms, as compensation for the slaves they were forced to free. Campaigners said William Gladstone shared the views on slavery of his father, ""who was one of the largest slave owners in the British West Indies"" In an open letter to university vice chancellor Professor Janet Beer, student campaigners urged the university to ""qualify your words"" about combating racism on campus ""with some real action"". The letter said Liverpool is ""entrenched in the history of Black oppression"" with buildings ""built with bricks that were bartered for by slaves"". It said Gladstone ""used his position to defend the interest of those who, like his father, owned West Indian slave-ran plantations."" ""Whilst we cannot possibly expect that the entire architecture of Liverpool is torn down and replaced, renaming Gladstone Hall and removing this reminder of William Gladstone is one small and simple act that the university can enact to show solidarity in the rejection of Black oppression. ""We can not facilitate normalising people like William Gladstone by naming our campus after them."" A University of Liverpool spokeswoman said: ""We share in the shame that our city feels because its prosperity was significantly based upon a slave economy."" She said the institution has ""an important opportunity to send a clear message about the commitments we have made to our Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic staff and student community"" and ""will work with the Guild of Students and with staff and student groups to agree an appropriate alternative name for the hall."" Gladstone became Tory MP for Newark in 1832, aged 23, he then joined the Liberal party in 1859 before becoming its leader in 1867 He started his mission of ""rescue and rehabilitation"" of London's prostitutes in 1840 He first became prime minister in 1868, resigning in his fourth stint at the helm in 1894 Gladstone made major reforms in the justice system and the civil service He increased the number of men eligible to vote in an election under the Representation of the People Act 1884 Gladstone disestablished the Irish Protestant Church and passed an Irish Land Act to rein-in unfair landlords He also campaigned for home rule in Ireland but twice failed to get the Irish Home Rule Bill through Gladstone died on 19 May 1898 from cancer and is buried at Westminster Abbey Liverpool 'not doing enough' over slavery links London slavery statue removed from outside museum Thousands demand Cecil Rhodes statue removal Torn down slave trader statue 'was an affront' Should university remove Gladstone's name?

Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact,"The coronavirus pandemic has reached almost every country in the world. Its spread has left national economies and businesses counting the costs, as governments struggle with new lockdown measures to tackle the spread of the virus. Despite the development of new vaccines, many are still wondering what recovery could look like. Here is a selection of charts and maps to help you understand the economic impact of the virus so far. Big shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect the value of pensions or individual savings accounts (Isas). The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei all saw huge falls as the number of Covid-19 cases grew in the first months of the crisis. The major Asian and US stock markets have recovered following the announcement of the first vaccine in November, but the FTSE is still in negative territory. The FTSE dropped 14.3% in 2020, its worst performance since 2008. In response, central banks in many countries, including the UK, have slashed interest rates. That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy. Some markets recovered ground in January this year, but this is a normal tendency known as the ""January effect"". Analysts are worried that the possibility of further lockdowns and delays in vaccination programmes might trigger more market volatility this year. Many people have lost their jobs or seen their incomes cut. Unemployment rates have increased across major economies. In the United States, the proportion of people out of work hit a yearly total of 8.9%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), signalling an end to a decade of jobs expansion. Millions of workers have also been put on government-supported job retention schemes as parts of the economy, such as tourism and hospitality, have come to a near standstill. The numbers of new job opportunities is still very low in many countries. Job vacancies in Australia have returned to the same level of 2019, but they are lagging in France, Spain, the UK and several other countries. Some experts have warned it could be years before levels of employment return to those seen before the pandemic. If the economy is growing, that generally means more wealth and more new jobs. It's measured by looking at the percentage change in gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced, typically over three months or a year. The IMF estimates that the global economy shrunk by 4.4% in 2020. The organisation described the decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The only major economy to grow in 2020 was China.It registered a growth of 2.3%. The IMF is, however, predicting global growth of 5.2% in 2021. That will be driven primarily by countries such as India and China, forecast to grow by 8.8% and 8.2% respectively. Recovery in big, services-reliant, economies that have been hit hard by the outbreak, such as the UK or Italy, is expected to be slow. The travel industry has been badly damaged, with airlines cutting flights and customers cancelling business trips and holidays. New variants of the virus - discovered only in recent months - have forced many countries to introduce tighter travel restrictions. Data from the flight tracking service Flight Radar 24 shows that the number of flights globally took a huge hit in 2020 and it is still a long way from recovery. The hospitality sector has been hit hard, with millions of jobs and many companies bankrupt. Data from Transparent,external- an industry-leading intelligence company that covers over 35 million hotel and rental listings worldwide - has registered a fall in reservations in all the top travel destinations. Billions of dollars have been lost in 2020 and although the forecast for 2021 is better, many analysts believe that international travel and tourism won't return to the normal pre-pandemic levels until around 2025. Retail footfall has seen unprecedented falls as shoppers stayed at home. New variants and surges in cases have made problems worse. Pedestrian numbers have fallen further from the first lockdown, according to research firm ShopperTrak, Separate research suggests that consumers are still feeling anxious about their return to stores.Accountancy giant EY,externalsays 67% customers are now not willing to travel more than 5 kilometres for shopping. This change in shopping behaviour has significantly boosted online retail, with a global revenue of $3.9 trillion in 2020. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and treatment options. Shares in some pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine development have shot up. Moderna, Novavax and AstraZeneca have seen significant rises. But Pfizer has seen its share price fall. The partnership with BioNTech, the high cost of production and management of the vaccine, and the growing number of same-size competitors have reduced the investors' trust in the company to have bigger revenue in 2021. A number of pharmaceutical firms have started already distributing doses and many countries have started their vaccination programmes. Many more - such as Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi/GSK - will join the vaccine distribution during 2021.

'Our home turned into a Covid-19 hospital overnight',"All 17 members of the Garg household Mukul Garg wasnât too worried when his 57-year-old uncle developed a fever on 24 April. Then, within 48 hours, two others in his family of 17 also became ill. The symptoms trickled in as expected - temperatures spiked and voices grew hoarse with coughing. Mr Garg initially chalked it up to seasonal flu, unwilling to admit it could be coronavirus. âFive or six people often fall sick together in this house, letâs not panic,â he told himself. Over the next few days, five more people in the house showed Covid-19 symptoms. And the pit in his stomach grew. Soon, the Garg family would become its own coronavirus cluster as 11 of its 17 members tested positive. âWe met nobody from the outside and no-one entered our house. But even then the coronavirus entered our home, and infected one member after the other,âMr Garg would later write in his blog,external, which has since attracted hundreds of comments from readers. The exhaustive account shows how the multi-generational family, a mainstay of Indian life, poses a unique challenge in the fight against Covid-19. How a market became Indiaâs latest Covid-19 cluster How Covid-19 changed the 'big fat Indian wedding' The country's stringent lockdown, which began on 25 March and lasted until this week, focused on keeping people at home, off its busy streets and out of packed public spaces. But in India - where 40% of households comprise many generations (often three or even four living together under one roof) - home is a crowded place. Itâs also vulnerable becauseresearch shows that the virus is more likely to spread indoors,external. âAll families under lockdown become clusters the moment someone is infected, that is almost a given,â says virologist Dr Jacob John. And, as the Gargs discovered, social distancing isnât possible within large families, especially during a lockdown when you are already cut off from the outside world. The Gargs live in a three-storey home in a packed neighbourhood in north-west Delhi. Mr Garg, 33, his wife, 30, and their two children, aged six and two, live on the top floor, along with his parents and grandparents. On the two floors below them live his uncles - his fatherâs brothers - and their families. Members range from a four-month-old baby to a bedridden grandfather of 90. Mr Garg's uncle may have caught the virus from a vegetable vendor Contrary to cramped joint family homes where many people share a room and a bathroom, the Garg home is spacious. Each floor is about 250 square metres, roughly the size of a doubles tennis court, with three bedrooms, en suite bathrooms and a kitchen. And yet, the virus spread quickly, travelling across floors and infecting almost all the adults in the house. They identified patient zero - Mr Gargâs uncle - but the family is still not sure how he caught the virus. âWe think it could be from a vegetable vendor or from someone at the grocery store because that was the only time anyone from the family stepped outside,â he says. But as the virus spread, fear and shame kept them from getting tested. âWe were 17 of us, but we felt so alone. We worried that if something happened to us, would anyone even come to the funeral because of the stigma associated with coronavirus?â But in the first week of May, when his 54-year-old aunt complained of breathlessness, the family rushed her to a hospital. And, Mr Garg says, they knew they all had to get tested. All of May was spent fighting the virus. Mr Garg says he would spend hours talking to doctors over the phone, while everyone checked in on each other on WhatsApp daily. âWe also kept changing the position of the members depending on symptoms, so no two people with high fever were in the same room.â Six of the 11 infected have co-morbidities - diabetes, heart disease and hypertension - which made them more vulnerable. âOvernight, our home became a Covid-19 healthcare centre with all of us taking turns to play nurse,â Mr Garg says Families are particularly vulnerable to widespread infection in a lockdown Virologists say large families are like any other cluster, except for the range in ages. âWhen you have a range of age groups sharing common spaces, the risk is disproportionately distributed, with the elderly at most risk,â says Dr Partho Sarothi Ray, a virologist. This weighed heavily on Mr Garg, who worried about his 90-year-old grandfather. But the virus, which continues to confound medical experts around the world, also held surprises for the Gargs. It wasnât unusual that he and his wife, both in their early 30s, were asymptomatic. But it was bewildering that his grandfather was also asymptomatic. And one member of the family, who had no comorbidities, was taken to hospital. The others showed typical symptoms. The families turned into 'zoo animals' by quarantine The 36-day fight to get one man to breathe Mr Garg says he wrote the blog because he wanted to reach out to people worried about seeking help. âIn the beginning, we cared so much about what people would think. And reading the comments, itâs so nice to see people saying it's ok if you get it, itâs not something to be ashamed of.â In the second week of May, symptoms began to vanish and the family watched as more and more negative tests rolled in, bringing relief. This was also when Mr Garg's aunt was discharged from hospital after testing negative. They finally felt like the worst was over. By the end of May - âthe month of the diseaseâ as Mr Garg called it - only three people, including him, were still positive. On 1 June, they got tested for the third time and the results came back negative. Indiaâs large families can be a source of support and care, but also friction and thorny property disputes. But at times like these they can also come to the rescue. âCan you imagine an elderly person in quarantine all by themselves with no-one to help? Despite the challenges, joint families benefit from the young taking care of the old,â Dr John says. Cases in India have sprinted past the 250,000-mark, spurring a debate over whetherthe pandemic could threaten extended families,external, as young people worry about carrying the infection home to older relatives. India re-opened this week after a strict lockdown âIt's a system that has survived hundreds of years of an onslaught of Western values and colonisation,â says Prof Kiran Lamba Jha, who teaches sociology at Kanpur's CSJM university. âCoronavirus is not going to destroy the joint family.â The Gargs would agree. Before the virus struck, the family was thriving. It was almost reminiscent of a 90s Bollywood flick, Mr Garg says. âAs a family, we had never spent so much time together than we did that first one month of the lockdown. It was also the happiest the family had ever been,"" he says, adding that it only made it harder to watch as one person after another fell sick. âWe saw each other at our best and worst but we came out of it stronger,â he says. âWeâre still cautious about reinfection but right now, weâre basking in the glory that we managed to beat this virus and come out on the other side.â How Covid-19 changed the 'big fat Indian wedding' How a market became Indiaâs latest Covid-19 cluster The families turned into 'zoo animals' by quarantine Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

Virus could hit UK economy hardest of rich nationsThe OECD says the UK economy is likely to shrink 11.5% this year - the worst of developed countries.,"The UK is likely to be the hardest hit by Covid-19 among major economies, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned. Britain's economy is likely to slump by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, it said. If there were a second peak in the pandemic, the UK economy could contract by as much as 14%. ""The crisis will cast a long shadow over the world,"" the OECD added. It said that in what it called a ""single-hit scenario"", with no second peak, there could be contractions of 11.4% in France, 11.1% in Spain, 11.3% in Italy and 6.6% in Germany. In its latest assessment, the OECD found that the UK's largely service-based economy meant that it had been particularly badly hit by the government's lockdown restrictions. The services sector, including financial services, hospitality and tourism, makes up about three-quarters of the UK's GDP. In response to the think tank's report, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not the only one to suffer: ""In common with many other economies around the world, we're seeing the significant impact of coronavirus on our country and our economy. ""The unprecedented action we've taken to provide lifelines that help people and businesses through the economic disruption will ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""Today's evidence from the OECD is deeply worrying, showing the UK was particularly exposed when the coronavirus crisis hit. ""The government's failure to get on top of the health crisis, delay going into lockdown and chaotic mismanagement of the exit from lockdown are making the economic impact of this crisis worse."" The central finding of the OECD forecasts is that the expectations or hopes of a rapid bounceback in the economy - a so-called V-shaped chart - is not now happening. As Secretary General Angel Gurria put it to me, it will be ""U-shaped"", the question is how long will be the period at the bottom of this ""U"". This pattern is not affecting all countries equally. And in the event of there being no further peak, the prediction is that the UK is the worst hit this year, though just a little bit worse than Italy and France. For those who like a glass half full, it also predicts the strongest growth in the UK at 9% for 2021. But that is a rather hollow prize. The reason why is that the UK economy is peculiarly exposed as a trading economy with significant service and tourist sectors. But it is also a nation that has been among the hardest hit by the underlying pandemic. This hit comes despite a much-praised rapid response deploying tens of billions to keep millions of workers on payrolls. The OECD also mentions the pandemic economic impact being ""compounded"" by the looming plausible failure to sign a trade deal with the EU and new trade barriers with the European Union at the end of the year. It recommends temporarily extending the UK's stay in the single market. That is advice that the government has shown no inclination to follow so far. The bigger point is that the OECD is subtly pointing to the fact that one rescue package is not enough. Late last week the Germans announced a massive 4% stimulus to the economy, including a thumping cut to VAT, and significant subsidies for the purchase of cars. The league table is an invitation to do more. And we will soon enough get actual hard economic data, as opposed to forecasts such as this, when the monthly GDP figure for April - entirely locked down - is published on Friday. The OECD said the pandemic had started to recede in many countries and activity had begun to pick up, but it does not expect a convincing recovery. It sees the outlook for public health as extremely uncertain. OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said the pandemic would have ""dire and long-lasting consequences for people, firms and governments"". She added: ""Extraordinary policies will be required to walk the tightrope towards recovery. Even if growth does surge in some sectors, overall activity will remain muted for a while."" The OECD looked at two scenarios for how the pandemic might unfold, depending on whether there is a second wave of contagion or not before the end of this year. If that does happen, two countries - France and Spain - would suffer even deeper declines in economic activity than the UK this year. The report describes both outlooks as sobering, but either way, the deep recession now unfolding will be followed by a slow recovery. In the more severe case, the global economy could shrink by 7.6% over this year, the OECD says. That figure is significantly worse than predictions put forward by other agencies, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which have warned about the high level of uncertainty attached to their forecasts. By the end of 2021, the report says that five or more years of income growth could be lost in many countries. It says the impact on livelihoods will be especially severe among the most vulnerable groups. The OECD also says the pandemic has accelerated the shift from what it calls ""great integration"" to ""great fragmentation"". That is essentially a setback for globalisation, reflected in additional trade and investment restrictions and many borders that are closed at least while the health crisis persists.

NHS waiting list 'could hit 10 million this year',"Health bosses fear the Covid-19 crisis could see the number of people waiting for NHS treatment double to 10 million by the end of the year. The NHS Confederation said challenges include a backlog of cases, maintaining social distancing, and staffing. The body, which represents health and care leaders, said emergency funding and longer-term spending were needed. The Department of Health has said it will continue to provide the resources, funding and support the NHS needs. Guidance had been issued on how the NHS ""should start to restore services in a safe way"", a spokesman added. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to announce further plans to ease lockdown restrictions in England later, withzoos and drive-in cinemas among the businesses expected to be allowed to reopenfrom Monday. Mr Johnson will lead the daily Downing Street briefing, where he is also likely to face questions about thegovernment scrapping plans for all primary school children in England to return to schoolbefore the summer break. Projections by the NHS Confederation show that the NHS waiting list is expected to rise from about 4.2 million currently to about 10 million by Christmas. This assumes the health service makes a steady return to full capacity within the next 12 months. In a new report, the NHS Confederation said healthcare services were operating at a reduced capacity of about 60% because of infection control measures. The body - which covers organisations commissioning and providing health services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - said it faces an ""uphill battle"" as it tries to restart cancer, stroke and heart care services, while continuing to manage thousands of sick and recovering Covid-19 patients. Predicting the immediate future of the NHS and the likely path of patient demand is like holding a finger in the wind. Nobody knows whether there will be a second spike of Covid-19 cases and, if there is, when that might happen and how serious it could be. It is hard to forecast how quickly those patients who have stayed away from hospitals because of fears of the virus will return to seek urgent treatment. Hospitals, GP surgeries and other NHS sites will need time to adapt to social distancing rules and assess how they manage their workload. The NHS Confederation is simply saying that an independent forecast that the waiting list for routine surgery in England might hit 10 million by the end of this year looks reasonable. Others have floated similar predictions. The bigger point being made by the confederation is that the government in Westminster needs to think very hard about how the health service is managed in the months ahead and how patients' expectations should be prepared. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will have to face up to the same challenges. Health leaders urged the government to prepare the public not to expect the same level of service for many months. Over the past fortnight, cardiology services have restarted in England but theBritish Heart Foundation on Friday warnedof a backlog as an estimated 28,000 heart procedures had been delayed since the outbreak of coronavirus. Cancer services are also starting to reopen. Cancer Research estimatesabout 2.4 million people in the UK are waiting for screening, treatment or tests with a potential 23,000 cancers having gone undiagnosed during lockdown. The already-long waiting lists were ""certain to rise significantly"", the body said, and coronavirus patients would continue to require care in recovery including respiratory and psychological treatment. It added that care was being delivered by ""exhausted and traumatised staff"", and health leaders had to stay prepared for a second wave. In its study and accompanying letter to the prime minister, the NHS Confederation warned that it would not be possible to simply ""switch on"" NHS services immediately. A patient receives physiotherapy at the NHS Seacole Centre for patients recovering from coronavirus, as health leaders call for extra funding in rehabilitation and recovery services It also called for further assurances on the effectiveness of the Test and Trace programme and further guarantees over personal protective equipment (PPE). And the report said a review of the impact of the pandemic on NHS and social care staff was needed. Reopening NHS services must be safe, unions say A&E visits in England down to record low The Royal College of Nursing has warned it will be a ""struggle"" for ""burnt-out"" nursing staff on short-staffed wards, care homes or in clinics to restart services. ""The legacy of this pandemic is yet to dawn - the professionals are still focused on the here and now,"" a spokesman said. ""As services begin to return, the government must continue to invest in the workforce so that an exhausted profession... is properly supported."" Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for ministers to ""take heed of these warnings"". ""It is inevitable that the Covid-19 pandemic will impact our health service in the months ahead but it is vital that ministers begin to address this backlog of delayed treatment and rising clinical need,"" he said. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? The NHS Confederation has asked for an extension of the government's deal with the private sector, to provide beds, equipment and staff to the NHS, until next March. Its chief executive Niall Dickson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Frankly, we need all the capacity we can get to try and build up services going forward."" ""We're not entirely clear what the levels of demand coming out of this are. We of course know patients that were waiting beforehand, but of course we've now got a huge backlog of patients that we haven't seen and we don't know what their needs will be,"" he said. He added that infection control measures would be ""really important"" as long as the virus is in the community. Business minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the prime minister was ""absolutely committed"" to ""making sure this forecast that has been put forward doesn't actually happen"". Speaking about whether the deal with the private sector would be renewed, he said the NHS could resume delivering broader services ""without the private hospitals"". Asked when the government will publish data relating toEngland's track and trace system, he said statistical experts wanted figures to be ""robust"" before publication. ""The worst of all worlds is to publish figures that are then having to be changed or are wrong,"" he said. ""This country has a proud track record of making sure that we are transparent in everything we do. We will learn the lessons from this, I guarantee you, but we'll do it after we get through this challenge. That's the right thing to do."" An NHS England spokesperson previously told the BBC that the NHS was ""safely bringing back other services"" and was also ""significantly increasing rehab care for everyone suffering after-effects of the virus"". NHS England published a plan in May setting out how toincrease routine operations and treatment,external. In other developments: Influential figures, including the head of NHS England and the Archbishop of Canterbury, are calling for a ""country-wide thank you"" to NHS staff when the service turns 72 on 5 July. A new report on Scotland's Covid-19 outbreakhas suggested the virus could have been spreading in the community before the first cases were confirmed. The first part of a Â£60m consignment of personal protective equipment has beendelivered to Northern Ireland from China. In Wales, there are calls for patients with dementia, difficulty understanding English or other communication problems to be allowed a family member with them while in hospital.

Rapper Wretch 32's father Tasered by London police,"Rapper Wretch 32 has spoken about the lack of progression on ""police brutality"" in the UK as he shared footage of his father being Tasered. The 35-year-old posted a video on Twitter of Millard Scott falling downstairs after being Tasered by officers in north London, in April. Speaking toITV News,external, Mr Scott, 62, said he believed he would not have been Tasered if he were white. The Met Police said a review had found ""no indication of misconduct"". A spokesman for the force said officers went to the property as part of ""a long-running operation to tackle drugs supply linked to serious violence"". The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for an urgent investigation by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Describing the incident as ""distressing"", Mr Khan said: ""It is absolutely vital that our police service retains the trust of the communities it serves."" Scotland Yard later said it would not refer the incident to the IOPC. It comes amid global protests against racism, inequality and police brutality, following the death ofGeorge Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis, in the US, after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck. Thousands of people have attended largely peaceful demonstrations across the UK in recent days to mark Mr Floyd's death, and highlight racial inequality in Britain. More work needed to tackle racism - Met chief London slavery statue removed from outside museum PM urges peaceful struggle against racism Wretch 32, whose real name is Jermaine Scott, shared the 36-second clip on his Twitter account with the caption: ""This is how the police think they can treat a 62 year old black man in Tottenham but this 1 happens to be my dad."" This video can not be played Millard Scott was Tasered by officers after they entered his home in April It shows Mr Scott falling down the stairs after an officer is heard to warn: ""Police officer with a Taser. Stay where you are."" As officers ask if he is OK and tell him to keep still, a distressed woman can be heard saying: ""They've Tasered him."" Mr Scott told ITV News he was ""lucky to be alive"". He said: ""The only people who have invaded our space are the Metropolitan Police. The only people who seem to ignore the guidelines put out there are the Metropolitan Police. ""It seems at this moment in time we are being singled out and targeted."" Last year, police forces in England and Wales used Tasers on 22,059 occasions - but in only 2,473 occasions were they actually fired. On most occasions, the Tasers were drawn and aimed, but not actually discharged. Proportionally, black people have the weapons used against them eight times more often than white people. The use of Tasers has more than doubled in the five years to 2018-19, as more police forces are equipped with them. The College of Policing says that police officers must clearly communicate their intention to use the weapon and any use must be ""proportionate, lawful, accountable and absolutely necessary"". Wretch 32 told the broadcaster that there has been ""no progression"" and he now warns his own children to be wary of the police. He said: ""I've grown up in a household with a dad and uncle and I've watched them fight against police brutality. ""I'm 35 now and I have to have the same conversation with my children that my father and grandfather had with me. ""That means there's no progression."" A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: ""As officers entered the premises, a man came downstairs and started moving towards an officer suddenly. ""He was ordered to remain where he was but continued towards officers who, after several warnings, deployed a Taser. ""The man was not arrested, but was assessed by the London Ambulance Service at the scene. He did not require further medical treatment. ""Officers from the North Area Command Unit have liaised with the family to discuss any concerns they have about the incident. ""The incident, including body-worn footage, has been reviewed by the Met's directorate of professional standards and no indication of misconduct has been identified."" Police said a 22-year-old man found in the house was arrested and charged with encouraging another to commit an offence, while a 52-year-old woman was charged with obstructing police after being interviewed under caution at a later date. The force said in a further statement that, following examination of the body-worn footage, it believed the incident ""does not meet the criteria for a referral to the IOPC"".

Family visit plea over dementia patients,"This video can not be played Kate talks about the frustration of not knowing when she will be allowed to visit her mother who has Alzheimer's Patients with dementia, difficulty understanding English or other communication problems should be allowed a family member with them while in hospital, it has been argued. Visiting is currently suspended across Wales due to the coronavirus restrictions. Now calls are being made by the Welsh Liberal Democrats and Alzheimer's Society for a review. The Welsh Government said exceptions were in place for certain patients. A spokesperson suggested those with mental health issues, such as dementia, a learning disability or autismshould be able to request a visit under the current guidelines.,external But BBC Wales has spoken to a number of people in this situation who have had a different experience. Family times with Janice aren't possible at the moment Kate, from south Wales, said she fears her mother will no longer recognise her after months apart. Diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease four years ago, 71-year-old Janice was admitted to hospital a few weeks before the lockdown for help with medication. The family accompanied her on admission and would visit every day, helping her to eat and wash, bringing in her familiar shower gel, hand cream and music to trigger memories and make her feel comfortable. But then ""we were completely cut off"", Kate said. ""For somebody with dementia that has huge repercussions."" They had to wait nine weeks before being offered a video call with their mum, after an iPad was donated to the ward. Janice was admitted to hospital a few weeks before lockdown Kate said the change she noticed in Janice's condition was ""distressing"". ""The worry is if we're not in touch, will it be more difficult for her to recognise us and feel comfortable in the house when she comes home? ""It makes you feel really anxious and really concerned that nobody seems to be thinking about the bigger picture and putting a strategy in place."" ""Even if they said, 'right the R number would need to be this or we would need such and such to be in place to allow visiting' - then at least that would give us some reassurance that we're aiming for something. ""It would be something to hold on to, some light at the end of the tunnel. But at the moment it's just 'it's not safe, end of story'."" Coronavirus and dementia: 'I'm scared to go out after lockdown' Dementia deaths up during pandemic How it feels to be a dementia carer under lockdown The wife of another hospital patient in south Wales with dementia - who wished to remain anonymous - said she had been preparing to visit her husband when lockdown happened, describing the situation since then as ""like a bereavement"". ""The ward was locked with immediate effect meaning I couldn't say goodbye,"" she said. Despite having power of attorney over his health and welfare, she says she is ""not being consulted or listened to"". ""He has definitely deteriorated a lot since lockdown. Dementia can change so quickly and you lose so much."" Sue Phelps, country director for Alzheimer's Society Cymru, said the current situation could lead to ""increased isolation, anxiety and unnecessary cognitive decline"" for patients with dementia. ""The most frustrating thing for carers or loved ones is not being able to share their insight. They are the ones who know the person best, they can articulate for that person and make sure they are getting the support they are familiar with."" Concerns have also been raised for patients who have difficulties communicating for other reasons, including those for whom English is not their first language. Jane Dodds said language issues had also been raised with the party Jane Dodds, Welsh Liberal Democrats leader, said she wanted to see a relaxation of the rules, with hospitals considering whether to allow a family member to accompany patients on admission or visit them on a ""case by case basis"". Recalling her own experience of seeing her mother revert to only being able to speak Welsh at the end of her life because of dementia, she said it was ""something particularly for Wales to think about"". She also said the party had been contacted by the family of an elderly man of Asian heritage who were distraught at not being able to accompany him into hospital as he could not understand English. ""We do understand totally the situation at the moment with Covid-19 and how difficult it is for medical staff to keep everybody safe. But we're asking that they look at every case and consider, where there are people with communication problems, whether they can take somebody in with them."" The Welsh Government said exceptions were already in place to enable people to visit people with mental health issues, as well as dementia, a learning disability or autism in hospital. ""It is entirely appropriate for people with specific needs to be accompanied to hospital for an appointment if it would be detrimental to their care if they were unsupported,"" a spokesman said. ""In all such instances, agreement should be sought in advance from the nurse in charge of the area.""

Call to 'cautiously reopen' Wales' housing market,"More than half of all of Wales' 16,500 homes on the market are sold subject to contract Calls for Wales' housing market to ""cautiously reopen"" have been made to the Welsh Government after an 11-week hiatus during the coronavirus lockdown. Estate agents and lawyers want valuers to be allowed into unoccupied properties so sales can be completed - and the housing market kick-started. Property website Rightmove said 16,485 homes are for sale in Wales - with more than half sold subject to contract. The Welsh Government said valuations can only happen in ""essential moves"". Ross Johnston has waited two months for a property to be valued for a mortgage and he estimates the delay could cost him as much as an extra Â£1,500. House prices in 'largest monthly fall for 11 years' Lockdown break-ups and job changes boost rentals Why you should make the garden look nice if you want sell The 34-year-old and his business partner bought a commercial premises in Tonteg, near Pontypridd - and did it up before lockdown started in March. Mr Johnston bought these premises, now fitted out as a barber shop The father-of-one and former professional rugby player used a bridging loan to purchase the premises occupied by Soho Barbers, in Cardigan Close, and applied for the mortgage once the shop was ""looking a million dollars"" just as lockdown started. But his application has been on pause since because the mortgage company wants a valuer to physically go into the premises to value it - and that is against the Welsh Government's stay-at-home regulations. ""It's so frustrating and very stressful because its costing me a lot of money,"" said Mr Johnston, who runs Front Row Properties with Wales rugby international Rhys Gill. ""I understand the government doesn't want to risk spreading coronavirus, but there's no more risk for a valuer in full personal protection equipment going into an empty property than going to a garden centre or shop full of people."" Another one of Mr Johnston's property purchases  - a house in Treherbert, in the Rhondda valleys - is also stuck because theEnergy Performance Certificate (EPC)has expired and an EPC assessor cannot access the property to perform the 10-yearly mandatory assessment. ""We're stuck at the moment,"" said Mr Johnston from Beddau, in Rhondda Cynon Taf. ""We hope the government can consider giving businesses like ours a little breathing space without seemingly increasing any risks."" People in Wales have only been able to view houses online during the coronavirus crisis Some banks and lenders will approve some ""less risky"" mortgages using so-called ""desktop"" or remote valuations using an algorithm, or historical valuations and local house-price data, to value a house - which means a valuer does not need to go to the property. Mortgage broker Michael Powell, however, points out that virtual valuations often value houses lower because the ""risk to the lender is greater because of higher uncertainty"". ""The lenders are just comparing data rather then seeing if the property is well-decorated and had improvements like extensions or an attic conversion,"" said the broker from Caldicot, in Monmouthshire. ""So they are more cautious as no-one likes uncertainty. ""Also, most lenders demand physical valuations on the higherloan to valueproducts because of the added risk, making it virtually impossible for people with smaller deposits like first-time buyers."" Physical valuations are often required for mortgages with a high loan to value Theproperty market in England has been released from some elements of lockdownbut with strict guidelines in place for every aspect of buying, selling, and renting. There are 14% fewer properties on the market in Wales this year compared with 2019, according to Rightmove, as virtual viewings becoming commonplace. But of the 16,485 homes listed for sale in Wales on their property website today, 9,424 are sold subject to contract - with houses on the market for two-and-a-half weeks longer than their usual 10-week average. ""Getting valuers and surveyors back into properties seems a suitable amendment to cautiously and carefully reopen the property market,"" said conveyancing solicitor Wyn Williams. ""Where lenders are not doing electronic valuations because the loan to value is potentially quite tight, they will not issue a mortgage offer without a physical valuation being done. Those transactions are currently hitting a brick wall."" Mr Williams said the number of transactions his office of Harding Evans solicitors in Newport are dealing with were a fifth of what they were before the coronavirus crisis. But he says about 30% to 40% are awaiting valuations before their mortgage can be considered by their chosen lender. ""There was a little disbelief in the sector that in theslight easing of restrictions here in Wales, that something hadn't happened to help the housing market,"" added Mr Williams. ""Allowing valuers and surveying back into houses for just a few minutes for an appointment would make a huge difference to the housing market with minimal, if any, risk if full PPE is worn and social distancing respected by the occupiers vacating the premises for a short time."" UK property sales hit record low in April How many confirmed cases are there in your area? England housing market is released from lockdown The Welsh Government's next lockdown review is on 18 June and Conservative Welsh Parliament member Darren Millar has urged ministers to provide the property sector with a ""timeline"" as ""entire lives have been put on hold and they need answers now"". It's not just the valuations estate agents hope can restart, they want the government to consider allowing agents into properties to prepare houses and flats for market ready for when it reopens in Wales. Estate agent Heidi Davis wants to start ""tentatively"" preparing for Wales' housing market to reopen ""They'd need to be serious sellers with a mortgage ready for their next purchase and ideally have an offer in on another property,"" said estate agent of 30 years Heidi Davis, of Newland Rennie in Chepstow. ""We'd adhere to social distancing, wear PPE and ensure neither party had any Covid-19 symptoms. ""It's so when the market reopens, we'd have all of the details and pictures ready for any prospective buyers to see so estate agents aren't playing catch-up from day one of the market reopening. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning in Wales? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out in Wales? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? ""That and having valuers being allowed into houses where homeowners briefly leave the home, would allow the market in Wales to cautiously and tentatively reopen."" The Welsh Government has said people are ""allowed"" to move home when it ""cannot be postponed"" as they want people to stay local to curb the spread of coronavirus. ""Where a valuation is required to facilitate an essential move then this can take place as long as social distancing measures are maintained and no-one in the household is shielding or are displaying symptoms as per our guidance,"" said a government spokesperson.""

Around 2.4m 'await cancer care',"There were fewer chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments during the epidemic About 2.4 million people in the UK are waiting for cancer screening, treatment or tests, as a result of disruption to the NHS during the past 10 weeks, according to Cancer Research UK. It estimates 2.1 million have missed out on screening, while 290,000 people with suspected symptoms have not been referred for hospital tests. More than 23,000 cancers could have gone undiagnosed during lockdown. Cancer services are starting to reopen across the UK. Cancer Research UK's figures are based on data for England and estimated for the whole of the UK. During lockdown, the health service focused on the care and treatment of patients with Covid-19, while other services, such as cancer care, were scaled back. People were still encouraged to seek medical help when they needed it - but there were fewer cancer operations and many chemotherapy and radiotherapy appointments were postponed. Screening programmes that detect early signs of bowel, breast and cervical cancer were paused in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, although not officially stopped in England. And an estimated 2.1 million people who would normally have had routine screening missed out, Cancer Research UK says. Breast screening is just one of many ways of detecting cancers 'Thousands missing out on cancer diagnosis' Cancer surgery delays risk 'thousands' of deaths Cancer patients' concern over treatment suspension The charity says urgent referrals, when patients with suspected cancer symptoms are referred to hospitals by their GP, fell by up to 75% in the first four weeks of lockdown, although these figures have since improved. Patients receiving treatments for cancer also fell, with 6,000 fewer people receiving chemotherapy and 2,800 fewer receiving radiotherapy over the past 10 weeks. And there were only 60% - 12,800 fewer - of the usual number of operations to remove tumours, Cancer Research UK estimates. Chief executive Michelle Mitchell said Covid-19 has placed an ""enormous strain on cancer services"". ""The NHS has had to make very hard decisions to balance risk,"" she said. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When are children returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? ""And there have been some difficult discussions with patients about their safety and ability to continue treatment during this time,"" she said. ""Prompt diagnosis and treatment remain crucial to give people with cancer the greatest chances of survival and prevent the pandemic taking even more lives."" To ensure no-one is put at risk from the virus now that cancer care is returning, Cancer Research UK said ""frequent testing of NHS staff and patients, including those without symptoms"" was vital. It estimates that up to 37,000 tests for the virus would need to be carried out each day for this purpose if the NHS was back running as normal. This is happening at different speeds in the four nations of the UK, with the setting up of safe Covid-free spaces in hospitals key to addressing the backlog of patients. NHS England said coronavirus ""has turned millions of lives upside down"" but cancer services were now largely ""open, ready and able to receive all patients who need care"". Anyone concerned about cancer symptoms should contact their GP. The Welsh and Scottish governments said cancer screening programmes would resume when safe, based on clinical advice. In Northern Ireland, there are plans for urgent cancer surgery and treatment to resume, along with routine screening. Macmillan Cancer Support recently warned of a potential ""ticking cancer timebomb"" due to disrupted cancer services. It said urgent action was needed to make sure cancer does not become the forgotten 'C' during the pandemic. ""We continue to urge the government to set out exactly how it will support the NHS to rapidly rebuild cancer services, including how people will be protected from infection by ensuring there is enough staff, regular testing, plentiful supplies of PPE and... social distancing,"" Sara Bainbridge, head of policy, said.

How dangerous is lifting lockdown?,"Customers at Kirkgate market in Leeds Lockdown is starting to ease. Across the UK we can meet more people, while in England some children are back in school and car showrooms and open-air markets have reopened. But some scientists, even those advising government, have been in mutinous mood - saying ministers are acting too soon. And the lifting of restrictions has been described as a ""dangerous moment"" even by England's deputy chief medical officer. Things are far better than when lockdown came in. There were an estimated 100,000 new infections every day in England on 23 March, the day when Boris Johnson announced strict curbs on our daily lives. That compares with around8,000 daily infections,externalat the moment. ""It's somewhere in the range of 10-fold fewer, but that's still considerable,"" Dr Adam Kurcharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told the BBC. The speed at which the virus is spreading is also much slower. The R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - was around three when lockdown came in. That meant 10 people were passing coronavirus onto 30 others. Now the R is around 0.7-0.9, meaning 10 people would be expected to pass it onto around eight others. However,a comparison by the University of Oxford,externalsuggests the UK is in one of the worst positions globally for exiting lockdown. And it is notable the government's own coronavirus alert system for England remains at ""Level 4"" rather than ""Level 3"" when social distancing restrictions would be relaxed. How will the Covid-19 alert system work? The chief science adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warns there is ""not a lot of room"" for manoeuvre and the data ""urges caution"". R is close to one - the tipping point where cases increase again and ""we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate"". Relaxing lockdown means we will come into contact with more people and that increases the opportunity for the virus to spread. The restrictions being eased are expected to have a small role in spreading coronavirus, but their precise impact is unknown. Uncertainty is a particular issue with schools. The government's evidenceon reopening themcould not put a figure on the impact. There is also uncertainty about how we will react to the loosening of the rules. Behavioural scientists advising the government already estimate only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick. Throughout the pandemic, the scientists and politicians have been following the same script. But there is now aclear, loud and public splitbetween some of those advising government and those ""following the science"". More than a dozen Sage committee members, who advise government, have spoken out, saying we should wait untiltest and traceis fully working and cases have come down. ""Essentially, we're lifting the lid on a boiling pan and it's just going to bubble over,"" argued Prof Calum Semple. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There is a significant consequence to lifting lockdown now - it may lock us into the current number of cases. There are approximately 8,000 infections a day. If easing restrictions raises the R number close to one, then we will continue to have around 8,000 infections every day. Waiting until cases fall further would make the virus easier to control and give more time to react if there was a ""second wave"". However, that requires keeping a painful lockdown for longer. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? There is also uncertainty about how effective contact tracing will be in the UK. The aim is to replace lockdown for all with isolation for some, by rapidly identifying and quarantining anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected. The strategy is seen as one of the key reasons some Asian countries have excelled at controlling coronavirus (South Korea has around 270 deaths compared with more than 39,000 in the UK). This video can not be played How does the NHS test and trace scheme work? However, there is a danger in expecting identical results. The UK is not using GPS tracking to ensure people do as they are told, like South Korea, or taking people to quarantine centres as they do in Hong Kong. Speed is crucial in order to find contacts before they become infectious, yet there are concerns about how longhome testing takes in the UK. Andan analysis of South Korea's strategy, by Imperial College London,,externalsuggests mass testing when a cluster of cases appears in one area was more influential than tracing contacts. Estimates of the effectiveness of test and trace vary widely, from a 5% to a 30% reduction in infections, depending on how optimistic the number crunching. The number of people that have been infected remains low, so any immunity is also low. That means there is the potential for a second wave, but whether it happens depends on both government decisions and how we react. The plan is to gradually introduce measures and then monitor what happens. ""With a cautious, piecemeal approach, I think the risk of a major increase is not particularly high; let's not call it a second wave, let's call it a second bump,"" said Prof Mark Woolhouse from the University of Edinburgh. A sudden surge in cases is considered unlikely. Dr Kucharski said: ""I don't think we'll see a huge, exponential increase in numbers in a couple of weeks. ""It may take some time for that to happen if transmission is in clusters; it will be late summer or autumn or even winter, depending on what happens. It may be we're in for a long haul.""

We'll be back on theBBC News Coronavirus Live pagelater this afternoon for full rolling coverage of the PM's briefing in Downing Street. Boris Johnson at last week's daily Coronavirus briefing in Downing Street Prime Minister's Questions has just come to an end, so here are some of the highlights:  Reality Check During PMQs, Labour leader Sir
Keir Starmer used three different figures for deaths during the coronavirus
pandemic. The first was the
cumulative figure that the government uses at its daily briefings, which he
pointed out has passed 40,000. Yesterdayâs figure was 40,883. Itâs the number
of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus. The second figure
he used was based on reports of weekly deaths, which are released by the Office for National Statistics for England and Wales, and also by
National Records Scotland and Nisra. They showed that by 29 May, there had been 50,107 people who had
coronavirus mentioned on their death certificates (in these cases, it is enough
for a doctor to suspect that the virus was present). The final number
he gave was for ""excess deaths"", totalling 63,000. That is the number of people
who have died in the
UK compared with the
average number of deaths for this period over the last five years. Some of
these wonât have involved Covid-19 directly.  Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer brought up the impact coronavirus is having on
people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. Separate
reviews by the Office for National Statistics, Public Health England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank have all concluded that these
groups are being disproportionately affected. The
Office for National Statistics, which based its calculations on geographic, age
and health-related factors, found that black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani
individuals were almost twice as likely to die from Covid-19 than white people. There
is no definitive answer as to why these groups are being affected in this way,
but explanations include public-facing occupations (such as working in the NHS)
and pre-existing health inequalities. You can read moreabout the figures and the findings in this report.  Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There are trio of things to pick up on from Prime Minister's Questions. Firstly Boris Johnson said the government would be expanding targeted testing for front-line workers where there are high percentage of ethnic minorities are working. Crucially this testing will be brought in for people who are asymptomatic. Secondly the PM  announced an extra Â£63m in welfare help for the most vulnerable families - this was in response to a question from Sir Keir Starmer about providing free school meals vouchers over the Summer holidays. The third thing, the teaser, was the PM hinting he would say more about how lockdown will be pulled back when he appears at the press conference this afternoon. Allow Twitter content?

Reality Check Sir Keir Starmer has just challenged the PM to keep the
voucher scheme that replaces free school meals going over the summer. But how much is the current initiative costing? About 1.3 million children in England are eligible for free
school meals. During the coronavirus pandemic the government said that pupils
who have to stay at home would continue to receive free school meals in the
form of food parcels or vouchers. It has cost more than Â£129m in England
already and is worth Â£15 per week for each eligible child. Normally eligible pupils only receive meals during term time but
this year they weregiven vouchersduring the Easter holidays at the height of
the coronavirus crisis. MPs and campaigners are now calling on the government
to extend the scheme to cover the summer holidays at an estimated cost of Â£19m per week. Speaking at PMQs, Boris Johnson said the government was putting Â£63m into welfare assistance to help vulnerable families, with local authorities being able to use it however they choose.  House of CommonsParliament Labour's Olivia Blake asks the last question of PMQs and begins with a Bob Marley quote: ""Today they say that we are free, only to be chained in poverty."" The MP quotes figures from theTrussell Trust,externalthat there has been an 89% increase in emergency food parcels needed last month compared to 2019, adding: ""People are struggling and need help right now."" She asks the PM to meet with charities and local government leaders to arrange a boost in funding to help them tackle the issue. Boris Johnson agrees the UK is going through a ""very difficult crisis... that has put many families to great hardship"". He says the government has done a ""huge amount to help"", including providing an extra Â£3.2bn to local government and another Â£63m for extra welfare support over the summer. He concludes: ""She is entirely right we face a huge economic problem. That's why we need to get moving, get this country going forward together."" House of CommonsParliament Labour's Rachel Hopkins says people in the country have ""lost trust in the government"", are ""confused by mix messaging"" and feel ""angry Dominic Cummings seems to have been let off hook"". She also says those in her Luton South constituency are ""particularly worried"" about ""inadequate support schemes and the illogical quarantine policy impacting Luton airport"". ""How can they be confident on the next steps for easing lockdown when your government has fallen short so far,"" she asks. Boris Johnson replies that the British public have ""ignored propaganda and negativity"" from the opposition party. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Mark Logan says there has been ""much disinformation"" about a possible risk in the infection rate - or R number - in the North West of England afetr reports at the weekend it may have risen above one. He asks the prime minister to agree with him that having ""increasingly up to date local data"" on the spread of coronavirus will allow for ""greater confidence"" for his constituents. Boris Johnson says he is ""encouraged by NHS test and trace and the progress it is making"". He says the government is now identify hotspots of the virus and ""do whack-a-mole and stamp out outbreaks"".

Sir Ed adds that often it seems ""being black is enough to be suspected of being a criminal"" and urges the PM to end the practice. Boris Johnson says it is ""important stop and search is carried out sensitively"". He adds that it can be a ""very important"" tool ""in fighting violent crime"". ""It does work - it is not the whole answer but part of the mix."" Reality Check Labour
leader Sir Keir Starmer has just criticised the governmentâs policy on re-opening
schools, saying âplenty of other comparable countries are getting their children
back to schoolâ. But what are other major countries on the continent actually doing? InFrance,
primary schools started to re-open on 11 May in âgreenâ zones, where the rate
of infection was low. The government issued detailed instructions to schools on
how to ensure the safety of pupils: this includes a maximum of 15 children to a
class, no shared toys and staggered arrivals. Children over 11 are
required to wear masks. InGermany,
students who had final exams this year went back first but, from 4 May, primary
schools started to re-open too with safety provisions. Germanyâs 16 state
governments are in charge of the implementation but the majority of them
prioritised the return of final year primary pupils. Spainpartially re-opened from 26 May,
to allow for revision classes and state exams, but all other children will not return until September. Italywill keep all its schools shut until
September. House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Kirsty Blackman - also contributing by video link - asks the PM about the response from US President to death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, calling it ""horrendous"". Pointing to previous remarks, she says: ""Does he still believe Trump has 'many, many good qualities' and if so, what are they?"" Boris Johnson repeats that ""Black lives matter"" and the death of George Floyd was ""absolutely appalling"". And on President Trump, he adds: ""He is president of the United States, which is our most important ally in the world. ""And whatever those on the left might say about it, it is a bastion of peace and freedom, and has been for most of my lifetime."" House of CommonsParliament Conservative Peter Aldous says allowing zoos to re-open is ""very good news"" and urges the PM to do the same for beer gardens. ""We want to open hospitality as quickly as possible,"" replies Boris Johnson. He says it is still the plan to allow hospitality to open ""no earlier than 4 July"". However he adds that the disease still poses a danger and that he doesn't want to see a ""roiling bacchanalian mass"" over the Summer. House of CommonsParliament The leader of the SNP in Westminster, Ian Blackford, is next up by video link. He starts by referring to comments made by the PM in front of theLiaison Committee, saying he did not read all the scientific papers on coronavirus. ""No wonder it took so long on quarantine measures,"" he says. ""This has been a complete shambles and too little, too late"". He asks the PM which papers he has read on the2m social distancing rule, to which Mr Johnson replies he has read a ""huge amount"". The PM then confirms the 2m should be kept under review. Mr Blackford says the cabinet has discussed reducing the distance, but ""that is not the experts advice right now"". He adds: ""People are losing confidence in this government... will the prime minister continue to ignore the experts or start following the advice of those who have read the scientific papers?"" Johnson says ""the people of this country are overwhelmingly following the guidance"" and tomorrow the Commons will hear more on test and trace, which will labour this point. He adds: ""There are all sorts of views about the 2m view, but clearly as the incidents of the disease come down, the statistical likelihood of being infected goes down."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"'Tsunami of anxiety' over next year's examsUncertainty about schools and exams is creating a tsunami of anxiety among England's pupils, MPs hear.","Chemistry experiments are difficult to replicate at home Government plans for schooling during the pandemic ""lie in tatters"", with England's pupils set to miss six months of lessons, Sir Keir Starmer has said. Calling for a national task force to tackle the issue, the Labour leader said the consequences for inequality and children's education were stark. Boris Johnson defended the plan during Prime Minister's Questions, pledging extra support for vulnerable families. Plans for all primary pupils to go back this term were ditched on Tuesday. And although some secondary students, most of whom have been out of school since the end of March, are expected to be invited back for some face-to-face time with their teachers, their lessons are not expected to resume until September at the earliest. Speaking during Wednesday's coronavirus briefing, Mr Johnson said the government ""fully intends"" to bring all children in England back to school in September ""provided the progress we are making continues"". ""What we'll be doing is a huge amount of catch-up for pupils over the summer months,"" he said, adding that the education secretary will announce more on a catch-up programme next week. At PMQs, Sir Keir said Mr Johnson had announced his plan to reopen primaries on 1 June, without consulting head teachers or having convincing scientific evidence on safety. And he said parents had lost confidence in the government's schools plan. He accused the prime minister of ""flailing around trying to blame others"" for what had been a completely avoidable ""mess"". Mr Johnson retaliated, during a series of testy exchanges, saying Sir Keir should ask ""his friends in the left-wing trade unions"", meaning the teachers' unions, to help schools prepare. He also accused the Labour leader of changing his mind over whether schools should be open. Sir Keir said England was an ""outlier"" compared with other countries in Europe, which had re-opened some of their schools. And his attempts to set up a cross-party task force to tackle the issue had been ignored. Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said the government's decision not to require all primary school pupils in England to return to the classroom before the summer holidays was ""disappointing"". She told a House of Lords Committee she was ""saddened"" that people may have become ""more frightened than they actually need to be"". Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield called for a national strategy to return pupils to classes, warning children risked being forgotten as the lockdown lifted. And concerns were raised at the Commons Education Committee about the impact of school closures on children's life chances. Prof Lee Elliot Major, former chief executive of the Sutton Trust education equality charity, said he was ""really worried"" about the eight million children currently out of school. He said: ""There is a tsunami of anxiety hitting schools about the one million children who are going to be taking their GCSEs and A-levels next year."" And there needed to be clarity about how public exams would be handled next year, adding that he preferred a combination of exams and teacher assessment. Sally Collier, chief executive of England's exams watchdog, told the committee contingency plans were being drawn up but gave no details. Reports have suggested Ofqual might be considering delaying exams or using a system involving predictive grades. When are children going back to school? Will universities reopen in September? Ms Collier suggested the government may be re-thinking the content of exams for next year and that schools would need to know at the earliest opportunity what they were going to need to teach next year. Ofqual would be publishing a consultation in the coming weeks on possible measures to ameliorate the impact of educational disruption on next year's exam candidates, she told MPs. National Education Union joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said it was increasingly clear disruption to schooling was going to continue. ""Looking at the exams system, we could face some of this, a very similar situation, next year, we have got to learn from this year,"" he said. Dr  Zubaida Haque, of the Runnymede Trust, said there needed to be an urgent look at what could be done for pupils who were not going back to school this summer. She said there were lots of venues available out of school, which could be utilised because of Covid-19 restrictions - such as football stadiums, private schools and golf fields. She urged ministers to think creatively and urgently about how such facilities could be used, with a view to setting up summer schools to help pupils catch up and support them with pastoral and emotional needs. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Meanwhile,the Welsh government has published new guidance on the measures schools should consider when reopening, including outside learning, teaching in small groups and pupils eating at their desks. Schools in Wales will reopen to all age groups from 29 June but only a third of pupils will be in classes at any one time. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schoolswill reopen from 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. In Northern Ireland,ministers have set a target date for some pupils to go back on 17 August, with a phased return for the rest in September.

Zoos and safari parks set to reopen from 15 June - PMBoris Johnson is due to announce the move will be subject to distancing measures being in place.,"London Zoo had said it faced an ""uncertain future"" Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas are set to reopen in England from Monday, the PM has said. Speaking at Wednesday's daily briefing, Boris Johnson outlined the latest steps in the easing of the coronavirus lockdown. He said the outdoor attractions can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. Some zoos, including Chester Zoo and London Zoo, have reported financial struggles during the pandemic. A number of Tory MPshave been calling for zoos to reopen to ensure they survive the crisis. The move will pave the way for zoos to reopen in England alongside non-essential shops, which can also open from 15 June. What will happen when zoos reopen? 'It is a worrying time to be running a zoo' London Zoo faces 'perilous future' Zoo remains 'on a knife edge' despite support But Mr Johnson faced criticism from the Labour leader at Prime Minister's Questions, after theplan for the reopening of all primary schools in England by the summer was ditched by the government. Sir Keir Starmer said the government's plan for getting children back to school in England was ""in tatters"", blaming the situation on a lack of leadership from Mr Johnson. He called for a ""national taskforce"" to be set up, to find a way forward. Mr Johnson said Sir Keir had previously said school reopenings were happening too quickly and accused him of trying to have it both ways. Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the daily briefing why children could go to the zoo but not school, the prime minister said he had wanted all children to return before the summer holidays but the ""continued prevalence"" of the disease meant it wasn't possible. He said the government would be doing ""a huge amount of catch up for pupils over the summer"" and the education secretary would be setting out further details. He defended the government's policy on reopening schools saying: ""We're very much in line or slightly ahead of some other European countries."" The chair of the education select committee, Conservative MP Robert Halfon, has called on the PM to ""set out a national plan on how we get schools opening again and a catch up programme for left-behind pupils whose life chances are being damaged by being off school for 40% of school year"". Earlier this week Chester Zoo - which has been closed since 21 March - said its future was ""on a knife edge"", despite a government pledge to provide financial support. And last month London Zoo - closed since 20 March - said it faced an ""uncertain future"" without immediate support. This video can not be played A large zoo says it needs government grants as it has no visitors or income Speaking at the daily press conference, the prime minister said outdoor attractions where visitors remain in their cars can reopen because the risk of spreading the disease is lower outside. He said zoos would be able to reopen ""provided visitor numbers are managed and safeguards are put in place - that includes keeping indoor places such as reptile houses closed"". Zoos must also ensure amenities including cafes are take-away only. Downing Street continues to emphasise that the UK government wants to move forward carefully in further easing the lockdown. Wednesday's announcement on zoos reflects the belief the risk of transmission is lower outdoors and is based on social distancing rules being followed. We also know non-essential shops in England and Northern Ireland will reopen in the coming days (though we don't know when this will happen in Scotland and Wales). Small parts of normal life are returning, even if they will likely feel quite different. But while steps to reopen the economy are being taken, the slow progress on schools shows that coming out of lockdown is not always easy and not always in the hands of ministers. The delay in getting primary school pupils back to classrooms in England is a reminder that practicalities - and in some cases public reluctance - are important too. The government says it has already provided a Â£14m support fund for zoos. They have also been eligible to apply for a ""range of support schemes"", including business rate relief, during the pandemic. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Andrew Hall, spokesperson for Biaza - British and Irish Association for Zoos and Aquariums - said he was ""delighted"" with the announcement, but added the sector was ""not out of the woods"". ""Aquariums are still closed, and zoos and safari parks have taken a real hit,"" he said. ""For some zoos, particularly those reliant on tourism, reopening isn't going to be financially viable for them."" He said the announcement was ""not the full answer"" and government support would still be required, especially with limited entry. He added: ""Zoos and aquariums in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will still be facing significant challenges and we will be working hard to achieve positive outcomes in these nations.""

As we near the end of today's live coverage, here is a round-up of developments. US President Donald Trump has said he will begin holding campaign rallies in at least four states after they were paused for three months due to the pandemic. He told reporters at the White House today that rallies would restart in Oklahoma, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. He added that the first one would probably take place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, next Friday. But he did not provide details on what precautions would be taken to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading at the events. Mr Trump will face Democrat Joe Biden in November. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher notes that the majority of the chosen states are electoral battlegrounds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As former hotspots like New York and New Jersey see declining infection rates, new coronavirus cases are climbing in 21 US states, as the country marches forward with its economic reopening. And nationwide, total Covid-19 infections are creeping towards the 2 million mark, with more than 112,500 deaths. Of these 21 states, 12 of them - including South Carolina, Texas and Utah - have reported increased hospitalisation rates since the Memorial Day holiday weekend last month. In Arizona, which has seen an especially pronounced spike in both Covid infections and hospitalisations, local health officials are starting to sound the alarm. Banner Health, the state's largest hospital system, warned this week that its intensive care units were filling up, and ventilator use was rising, while the state health director told Arizona hospitals to ""fully activate"" emergency plans. As of Wednesday, Arizona had confirmed 29,852 cases and 1,101 deaths.  Global coffee chain Starbucks says it expects revenue this quarter to have plummeted by more than $3bn (Â£2.3bn) because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company also projected an adjusted loss of about 55 to 70 cents per share for its third quarter ending in June. In further bad news it said its current-quarter operating income was expected to plunge by up to $2.2bn Like other cafe and restaurant chains, Starbucks had to close thousands of outlets around the world as part of coronavirus lockdowns or convert them to drive-through or take-away only. The company says it expects to permanently close about 400 stores
in the Americas over the next 18 months. The former US ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman, has announced he has tested positive for Covid-19. ""After a second try, test results came back positive,"" he wrote on Twitter earlier today. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Huntsman, a Republican, is currently running to be governor of Utah. He served in that role from 2005 to 2009, and most recently spent two years as ambassador to Russia under President Donald Trump. He also ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. On Tuesday, he said he had received the ""wrong results"" from an earlier test. ""Very illuminating to see the process firsthand,"" he wrote on Twitter. BBC OS Queues of people with virus symptoms have formed outside hospitals in Delhi Infections in India are rising. In the capital, Delhi, images have emerged of patients queuing outside hospitals, waiting to be treated for Covid-19. Dr Parv Mittal, who works in Delhi's Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, spoke to BBC Outside Source. ""It's really difficult to say how we will be able to cope,"" he said. ""I'm not sure if we have the beds. Even if you create the beds, there will be a shortage of manpower."" Delhi is seeing more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases every day, stretching hospital resources. Dr Mittal says his hospital initially struggled to get personal protective equipment (PPE).  Now it has enough but working in PPE is ""exhausting"", he says. ""Wearing it even for one hour, you start sweating a lot. You start getting dehydrated. Initially we had to work for six to eight hours non-stop. There's a persistent fear of contracting the infection."" Chester Zoo - home to these elephants - says the lockdown has threatened its survival Some zoos and safari parks in England are preparing to throw open their doors to visitors from Monday, bringing in some much-needed revenue. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced that the outdoor attractions can reopenat today's daily briefing. Dominic Jermey, head of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) which runs London and Whipsnade Zoos, said they were ""raring to go"". ""We expect to have tickets ready to book by Friday and everyone will need to book so we can manage capacity,"" he said. Last month London Zoo said it faced an ""uncertain future"" without immediate financial support. Jamie Christon from Chester Zoo in north-west England said a week ago they had been ""in despair"", not knowing when the zoo would reopen or if it would even survive. ""The zoo has suffered severe financial damage over the past three months and the road to recovery will be long and uncertain,"" he added. Some other zoos have said they are still putting in place social distancing and hygiene measures and won't be able to open until July. This lion at London Zoo was more interested in a nap... The penguins, however, appeared ready to welcome back the public Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The lockdown may have led more individuals to become radicalised as they spend more time online, a British police chief has warned. The Metropolitan Police's Lucy D'Orsi said the precise impact of the lockdown on the terrorism threat was not yet known. She urged the public to remain alert as people return to crowded places closed in March. The current UK threat level is ""substantial"", meaning an attack is likely. ""The reality is that the threat has not gone away,"" Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner D'Orsi told the BBC. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves has welcomed the latest government guidance that adults living alone in England can form a ""support bubble"" with one other household. In a further easing of coronavirus restrictions, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that, from Saturday,single adults could spend the night at another house. Ms Reeves, Labour MP for Leeds West, said she hoped the measure would ""ease some of the loneliness that we see in society"", but qualified her support by saying that people were ""anxious about the easing of restrictions and of good work being undone"" if it wasn't backed up by the science. She said the government had ""got to get this right and needs to make sure the test, trace and isolate policy is in place to ensure that further easing of the restrictions can work"". Read more on how social bubbles work. People living alone in England will soon be able to stay at another household (of any size) to form a ""support bubble"".  The move was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as part of further easing of coronavirus restrictions. A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close contact. For example:  Read more here on how social bubbles work. A man leaves a temporary shower trailer in Manhattan for the homeless and other vulnerable communities in May New Yorkers experiencing homelessness and sleeping in shelters during the coronavirus outbreak were disproportionately vulnerable to death or illness, a report from the Coalition for the Homeless has found. As of 1 June, the Covid mortality rate in New York City overall was 200 deaths per 100,000 people. Among those sleeping in shelters, this figure was 321 deaths per 100,000 people. And according to the coalition, the number of coronavirus-related deaths among homeless New Yorkers sleeping in shelters in April 2020 was 157% higher than the number of deaths from all causes among this same group during an average month in 2019. As of 31 May, there were 926 confirmed Covid-19 cases across some 179 shelters. Places of worship have now opened in India as the country eases its lockdown measure. These images from Koltata show priests wearing protective gear, preparing to enter the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. Restrictions on shops, market places and transport services were eased on Monday. It comes despite a surge of infections in the country, which now has 266,598 confirmed cases. However experts say there was no other option but to lift the lockdown, which had a massive economic impact on the country. There is little evidence that a change in the seasons will affect the spread of Covid-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. ""We cannot rely on an expectation that the season or the temperature will be the answer to this,"" Mike Ryan, the head of the organisation's emergency programme, told reporters. ""Right now, we have no
data to suggest that the virus will behave more aggressively or
transmit more efficiently or not"" when the seasons change, he said. In the initial stages of the pandemic, some suggested that warmer weather might slow the spread of Covid-19. But this idea faded as the virus took hold during springtime in the northern hemisphere. Separately, Mr Ryan also said that a lack of personal protective equipment remained a major issue globally. ""Health systems in some countries are struggling and are under huge strain,"" he added. Chelsea are to donate their prize money for winning the Women's Super League to a charity that supports women and children experiencing domestic abuse. UK charities say there has been a huge spike in reports of domestic abuseduring the coronavirus lockdown. Chelsea Womenwere named champions on Friday, when final places in the curtailed 2019-20 WSL season were decided on a points-per-game basis. The Â£100,000 first prize will be given to Refuge.

Team manager Emma Hayes said the charity was ""close to the hearts and minds of the women's team"".

Here are some of the latest updates: Reality Check Earlier on Wednesday, Professor Chris Whitty â the chief medical officer for England  â was asked what his
biggest regret was in the handling of the pandemic He said he wished that testing
could have been speeded up âvery early onâ in the outbreak, and mentioned
Germany as an example. In the week ending 4 April, Germany
was using 132 laboratories to carrying out an average of
116,655 diagnostic tests for Covid-19 per day. The total number of tests done
by that date was over 1.3 million. The UK, by contrast, had carried
out a total of 316,836 tests by 10 April and didn't hit its target of
100,000 daily tests until the end of that month. Prince Joachim has already apologisedfor breaching Spain's quarantine rules when he travelled to the southern city of CÃ³rdoba last month. Now he will be up to â¬10,400 (Â£9,200; $11,800) out of pocket too. The 28-year-old prince, a nephew of King Philippe of Belgium, travelled to Spain last month for what the palace had described as an internship and a ""family event"". He later tested positive for Covid-19 and health officials had to get in touch with people he had been in contact with. According to local reports, the prince has been fined for failing to observe the necessary 14-day quarantine and attending two meetings or parties. If he pays up within 15 days, he only needs to pay half the fine.  Several members of the National Guard in Washington DC have tested positive for Covid-19 If you're just joining us, here are the latest coronavirus headlines from around the world:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The pandemic has, effectively,
become a game of risk management â thatâs because, as UK chief medical adviser Chris Witty says, nothing is ârisk freeâ. We could continue to suppress
the virus by not easing lockdown any further. That would further reduce the
spread of coronavirus â and no doubt save lives. But it would come at a huge cost
â economically, socially, to childrenâs education and also to peopleâs health, whether it is from mental or physical illness linked to continued strict curbs. So instead, the government and its advisers are treading a fine fine, and trying to navigate a way through this
(whether they are doing a good job or not is a different question). The aim is to keep the spread of the
virus low, while re-opening society. Whatever is done there will be
losers. After all, there is a new virus circulating, which for some is deadly. In the end it will come down to

As we near the end of today's live coverage, here is a round-up of developments. US President Donald Trump has said he will begin holding campaign rallies in at least four states after they were paused for three months due to the pandemic. He told reporters at the White House today that rallies would restart in Oklahoma, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. He added that the first one would probably take place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, next Friday. But he did not provide details on what precautions would be taken to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading at the events. Mr Trump will face Democrat Joe Biden in November. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher notes that the majority of the chosen states are electoral battlegrounds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As former hotspots like New York and New Jersey see declining infection rates, new coronavirus cases are climbing in 21 US states, as the country marches forward with its economic reopening. And nationwide, total Covid-19 infections are creeping towards the 2 million mark, with more than 112,500 deaths. Of these 21 states, 12 of them - including South Carolina, Texas and Utah - have reported increased hospitalisation rates since the Memorial Day holiday weekend last month. In Arizona, which has seen an especially pronounced spike in both Covid infections and hospitalisations, local health officials are starting to sound the alarm. Banner Health, the state's largest hospital system, warned this week that its intensive care units were filling up, and ventilator use was rising, while the state health director told Arizona hospitals to ""fully activate"" emergency plans. As of Wednesday, Arizona had confirmed 29,852 cases and 1,101 deaths.  Global coffee chain Starbucks says it expects revenue this quarter to have plummeted by more than $3bn (Â£2.3bn) because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company also projected an adjusted loss of about 55 to 70 cents per share for its third quarter ending in June. In further bad news it said its current-quarter operating income was expected to plunge by up to $2.2bn Like other cafe and restaurant chains, Starbucks had to close thousands of outlets around the world as part of coronavirus lockdowns or convert them to drive-through or take-away only. The company says it expects to permanently close about 400 stores
in the Americas over the next 18 months. The former US ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman, has announced he has tested positive for Covid-19. ""After a second try, test results came back positive,"" he wrote on Twitter earlier today. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Huntsman, a Republican, is currently running to be governor of Utah. He served in that role from 2005 to 2009, and most recently spent two years as ambassador to Russia under President Donald Trump. He also ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. On Tuesday, he said he had received the ""wrong results"" from an earlier test. ""Very illuminating to see the process firsthand,"" he wrote on Twitter. BBC OS Queues of people with virus symptoms have formed outside hospitals in Delhi Infections in India are rising. In the capital, Delhi, images have emerged of patients queuing outside hospitals, waiting to be treated for Covid-19. Dr Parv Mittal, who works in Delhi's Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, spoke to BBC Outside Source. ""It's really difficult to say how we will be able to cope,"" he said. ""I'm not sure if we have the beds. Even if you create the beds, there will be a shortage of manpower."" Delhi is seeing more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases every day, stretching hospital resources. Dr Mittal says his hospital initially struggled to get personal protective equipment (PPE).  Now it has enough but working in PPE is ""exhausting"", he says. ""Wearing it even for one hour, you start sweating a lot. You start getting dehydrated. Initially we had to work for six to eight hours non-stop. There's a persistent fear of contracting the infection."" Chester Zoo - home to these elephants - says the lockdown has threatened its survival Some zoos and safari parks in England are preparing to throw open their doors to visitors from Monday, bringing in some much-needed revenue. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced that the outdoor attractions can reopenat today's daily briefing. Dominic Jermey, head of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) which runs London and Whipsnade Zoos, said they were ""raring to go"". ""We expect to have tickets ready to book by Friday and everyone will need to book so we can manage capacity,"" he said. Last month London Zoo said it faced an ""uncertain future"" without immediate financial support. Jamie Christon from Chester Zoo in north-west England said a week ago they had been ""in despair"", not knowing when the zoo would reopen or if it would even survive. ""The zoo has suffered severe financial damage over the past three months and the road to recovery will be long and uncertain,"" he added. Some other zoos have said they are still putting in place social distancing and hygiene measures and won't be able to open until July. This lion at London Zoo was more interested in a nap... The penguins, however, appeared ready to welcome back the public Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The lockdown may have led more individuals to become radicalised as they spend more time online, a British police chief has warned. The Metropolitan Police's Lucy D'Orsi said the precise impact of the lockdown on the terrorism threat was not yet known. She urged the public to remain alert as people return to crowded places closed in March. The current UK threat level is ""substantial"", meaning an attack is likely. ""The reality is that the threat has not gone away,"" Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner D'Orsi told the BBC. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves has welcomed the latest government guidance that adults living alone in England can form a ""support bubble"" with one other household. In a further easing of coronavirus restrictions, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that, from Saturday,single adults could spend the night at another house. Ms Reeves, Labour MP for Leeds West, said she hoped the measure would ""ease some of the loneliness that we see in society"", but qualified her support by saying that people were ""anxious about the easing of restrictions and of good work being undone"" if it wasn't backed up by the science. She said the government had ""got to get this right and needs to make sure the test, trace and isolate policy is in place to ensure that further easing of the restrictions can work"". Read more on how social bubbles work. People living alone in England will soon be able to stay at another household (of any size) to form a ""support bubble"".  The move was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as part of further easing of coronavirus restrictions. A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close contact. For example:  Read more here on how social bubbles work. A man leaves a temporary shower trailer in Manhattan for the homeless and other vulnerable communities in May New Yorkers experiencing homelessness and sleeping in shelters during the coronavirus outbreak were disproportionately vulnerable to death or illness, a report from the Coalition for the Homeless has found. As of 1 June, the Covid mortality rate in New York City overall was 200 deaths per 100,000 people. Among those sleeping in shelters, this figure was 321 deaths per 100,000 people. And according to the coalition, the number of coronavirus-related deaths among homeless New Yorkers sleeping in shelters in April 2020 was 157% higher than the number of deaths from all causes among this same group during an average month in 2019. As of 31 May, there were 926 confirmed Covid-19 cases across some 179 shelters. Places of worship have now opened in India as the country eases its lockdown measure. These images from Koltata show priests wearing protective gear, preparing to enter the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. Restrictions on shops, market places and transport services were eased on Monday. It comes despite a surge of infections in the country, which now has 266,598 confirmed cases. However experts say there was no other option but to lift the lockdown, which had a massive economic impact on the country. There is little evidence that a change in the seasons will affect the spread of Covid-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. ""We cannot rely on an expectation that the season or the temperature will be the answer to this,"" Mike Ryan, the head of the organisation's emergency programme, told reporters. ""Right now, we have no
data to suggest that the virus will behave more aggressively or
transmit more efficiently or not"" when the seasons change, he said. In the initial stages of the pandemic, some suggested that warmer weather might slow the spread of Covid-19. But this idea faded as the virus took hold during springtime in the northern hemisphere. Separately, Mr Ryan also said that a lack of personal protective equipment remained a major issue globally. ""Health systems in some countries are struggling and are under huge strain,"" he added. Chelsea are to donate their prize money for winning the Women's Super League to a charity that supports women and children experiencing domestic abuse. UK charities say there has been a huge spike in reports of domestic abuseduring the coronavirus lockdown. Chelsea Womenwere named champions on Friday, when final places in the curtailed 2019-20 WSL season were decided on a points-per-game basis. The Â£100,000 first prize will be given to Refuge.

Team manager Emma Hayes said the charity was ""close to the hearts and minds of the women's team"".

Here are some of the latest updates: Reality Check Earlier on Wednesday, Professor Chris Whitty â the chief medical officer for England  â was asked what his
biggest regret was in the handling of the pandemic He said he wished that testing
could have been speeded up âvery early onâ in the outbreak, and mentioned
Germany as an example. In the week ending 4 April, Germany
was using 132 laboratories to carrying out an average of
116,655 diagnostic tests for Covid-19 per day. The total number of tests done
by that date was over 1.3 million. The UK, by contrast, had carried
out a total of 316,836 tests by 10 April and didn't hit its target of
100,000 daily tests until the end of that month. Prince Joachim has already apologisedfor breaching Spain's quarantine rules when he travelled to the southern city of CÃ³rdoba last month. Now he will be up to â¬10,400 (Â£9,200; $11,800) out of pocket too. The 28-year-old prince, a nephew of King Philippe of Belgium, travelled to Spain last month for what the palace had described as an internship and a ""family event"". He later tested positive for Covid-19 and health officials had to get in touch with people he had been in contact with. According to local reports, the prince has been fined for failing to observe the necessary 14-day quarantine and attending two meetings or parties. If he pays up within 15 days, he only needs to pay half the fine.  Several members of the National Guard in Washington DC have tested positive for Covid-19 If you're just joining us, here are the latest coronavirus headlines from around the world:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The pandemic has, effectively,
become a game of risk management â thatâs because, as UK chief medical adviser Chris Witty says, nothing is ârisk freeâ. We could continue to suppress
the virus by not easing lockdown any further. That would further reduce the
spread of coronavirus â and no doubt save lives. But it would come at a huge cost
â economically, socially, to childrenâs education and also to peopleâs health, whether it is from mental or physical illness linked to continued strict curbs. So instead, the government and its advisers are treading a fine fine, and trying to navigate a way through this
(whether they are doing a good job or not is a different question). The aim is to keep the spread of the
virus low, while re-opening society. Whatever is done there will be
losers. After all, there is a new virus circulating, which for some is deadly. In the end it will come down to
both political judgements, in terms of how quickly restrictions continue to be
lifted, and also individual judgements in terms of how quickly we each embrace
the new freedoms. That, unfortunately, is the way life is in this pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Pupils tense as teachers submit estimated grades,"Russell Harrison says many of his classmates are nervous about the estimated grades Schools and colleges in England have to submit their estimated grades for GCSE and A-levels by the end of this week. In each subject, pupils will also be ranked from highest to lowest achieving. Exam regulator Ofqual has issued extra guidance following a consultation on how to make the process as fair and accurate as possible. Any pupils unhappy with their grades will be able to sit the actual exam in October or November. But they will not know how their have fared until mid-August when results are released. Thearrangements, put in place after exams were cancelled in the coronavirus lockdown, are a source of concern for  pupils, according to Russell Harrison, a year 11 student at Blacon High School in Cheshire. ""You never know what you could have done in the exam, on the day you could have done better than any of the target grades you've been set,"" says Russell who, along with half a million other teenagers in England, was due to sit his GCSEs this May and June. Not doing the exams after the intense focus earlier in the year has been strange, he says. ""This year we had more work, more mock exams, coming into school during the holidays, [and] booster sessions to help get grades up."" Teachers to grade students for cancelled exams Teachers to estimate grades after exams cancelled Which students are going back to school? Russell recently had a bursary place at a private sixth-form school confirmed, regardless of his results, funded by the charity Hope Opportunity Trust. But he says many of his classmates will be worried, especially those unsure of achieving the grade 4 or above they need in maths and English. His mum, Julie Harrison, says her first reaction when the exams were cancelled was: ""Panic, at first."" She adds: ""I thought to myself: 'What's going to be happening with the grades?' ""It's unknown times for everybody, the first time of doing things this way, but once we knew how it was going to be worked out, we were absolutely fine with it."" For teachers this is an intensely stressful time, having not only to estimate pupil's grades but to rank each one from top to bottom in every subject. Blacon High School was rated good by Ofsted for the first time in its history in 2016, and it is now oversubscribed. More than half the pupils, 55%, qualify for pupil premium funding because at some point in recent years they have been eligible for free school meals. Headteacher Rachel Hudson says teachers feel a huge responsibility and senior staff have been reviewing decisions on every pupil. ""We all know, despite the two mock exams in November and February, that there are always students who excel at the last moment. It does tend to be boys, so trying to make a judgement holistically is very difficult."" The hardest judgements are on ranking pupils bunched around the middle grades or on grade borderlines. Headteacher Rachel Hudson says staff feel a huge responsibility Teenagers and their parents will have to wait for results day to know what grades have been submitted by the school. Like many headteachers in schools which have been working hard to improve, Ms Hudson has to hope and trust the next stage in this new system will be fair. Once the estimated grades and rankings have been submitted, the exam boards and the regulator Ofqual will compare them with previous years' exam performance and against national benchmarks, to ensure this year's results are not wildly out of kilter. But the process has faced other criticisms. Prof Kalwant Bhopal, director of Birmingham University's Centre for Race and Education, is one of a number of academics who wrote to the Department for Education when the plans were announced. ""To put it bluntly, when you look at the demographics of the teaching workforce, 85% of teachers are white - and 93% of headteachers,"" she tells BBC News. She cites a wealth of research showing the impact of unconscious stereotypes in education, particularly in estimating A-level grades, which can be measured against the actual results. Her concern is that calculated exam grades this year for both GCSE and A-level will begin with estimates and rankings made by teachers which are likely to underrate some pupils ""Teachers have unconscious bias processes about particular students. So, for example, white middle-class students are seen as ideal, black working-class students are seen as aggressive and confrontational. So within this process there will be unconscious bias."" She would have preferred to see independent scrutiny from the outset in the school stage of the process. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Ofqual has issued extra guidance about unconscious bias to teachers after its consultation highlighted the issue as a potential concern. It consulted a range of bodies including the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Its advice to schools is that at least two people, including the lead teacher on each subject, should be involved. A formal declaration has to be signed by the headteacher, saying the estimated grades and rankings are an honest and fair reflection of the grades pupils would have obtained.

"Frankie and Benny's owner to cut up to 3,000 jobsThe Restaurant Group confirms plans to close 125 sites while Monsoon Accessorize has axed 545 jobs.BusinessComments","The coronavirus pandemic has claimed another 3,600 UK jobs after the Restaurant Group, Monsoon Accessorize and Quiz announced major restructures. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie and Benny's, expects to cut up to 3,000 workers after confirming plans to shut 125 sites. Monsoon Accessorize has announced 545 job losses and the closure of 35 shops. And fashion chain Quiz has put its stores into administration because they are not currently ""financially viable"". Some 93 jobs will be lost through the reorganisation. The Restaurant Group said the closures would fall mainly on its Frankie and Benny's restaurants, but other chains such as Garfunkel's and Chiquito will also be affected. Meanwhile, Monsoon Accessorize said its current structure was ""unviable"" following the lockdown. Monsoon Accessorize assets have been put into administration and sold to a business controlled by Peter Simon, the founder and owner of the chain. It will now attempt to renegotiate the terms of its remaining 162 shops with its landlords and aims to safeguard up to 2,300 jobs. The restructurings are coming thick and fast. And it's no surprise. Retail and hospitality businesses have taken a massive hit in this pandemic. Sales have disappeared. Even when they're able to re-open, many firms will struggle, or be unable, to pay their rent bills for many months to come. These household names were already having challenges before coronavirus. And they're all now hoping to survive in a leaner, slimmed down, form by securing better deals with their landlords. Expect to see a lot more of this in the weeks and months to come. The Restaurant Group is restructuring part of its business through an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). As well as the closures of some of its eateries, the company said it would attempt to renegotiate rents and terms on a further 85 sites. Going into administration: What does it mean? Jobs go as Debenhams shuts more stores Job losses 'just the tip of the iceberg' When will shops open and what will the rules be? The Restaurant Group's chief executive, Andy Hornby, said: ""The proposed CVA will deliver an appropriately-sized estate for our Leisure business to ensure we are well positioned despite the very challenging market conditions facing the casual dining sector."" The Restaurant Group also owns the Wagamama restaurant chain, but this will not be affected by the restructuring. Some of the company's brands were struggling before the pandemic hit as conditions in the so-called fast casual dining sector in which it operates were already tough. The shift to online shopping has meant fewer visitors to its outlets on High Streets and in shopping centres. That, together with rising rent and wage costs, has prompted a wave of site closures. Last year, Restaurant Group said it would close a number of its sites, and in February said it would close a further 90 restaurants by the end of 2021. Monsoon Accessorize will try to renegotiate rental terms on 162 of its remaining shops Quiz said it would put its 82 outlets in the UK and Ireland into administration before buying them back so it can negotiate better rental terms with its landlords. It said some 822 employees out of a total of 915 would transfer to the new company. Quiz chief executive Tarak Ramzan said the company's shops were already facing challenges before the coronavirus outbreak as fewer people were shopping in store. However, he said that ""the significant economic uncertainty we now face as consumers and businesses emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic"" meant that the group had to be restructured. The coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown has prompted thousands of job cuts across the UK economy. On Tuesday, Debenhams said a further 300 jobs would go and in recent weeks Rolls-Royce, British Airways, EasyJet and car dealership Lookers have announced extensive cuts.

Zoos and safari parks set to reopen from 15 June - PMBoris Johnson is due to announce the move will be subject to distancing measures being in place.UK PoliticsComments,"London Zoo had said it faced an ""uncertain future"" Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas are set to reopen in England from Monday, the PM has said. Speaking at Wednesday's daily briefing, Boris Johnson outlined the latest steps in the easing of the coronavirus lockdown. He said the outdoor attractions can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. Some zoos, including Chester Zoo and London Zoo, have reported financial struggles during the pandemic. A number of Tory MPshave been calling for zoos to reopen to ensure they survive the crisis. The move will pave the way for zoos to reopen in England alongside non-essential shops, which can also open from 15 June. What will happen when zoos reopen? 'It is a worrying time to be running a zoo' London Zoo faces 'perilous future' Zoo remains 'on a knife edge' despite support But Mr Johnson faced criticism from the Labour leader at Prime Minister's Questions, after theplan for the reopening of all primary schools in England by the summer was ditched by the government. Sir Keir Starmer said the government's plan for getting children back to school in England was ""in tatters"", blaming the situation on a lack of leadership from Mr Johnson. He called for a ""national taskforce"" to be set up, to find a way forward. Mr Johnson said Sir Keir had previously said school reopenings were happening too quickly and accused him of trying to have it both ways. Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the daily briefing why children could go to the zoo but not school, the prime minister said he had wanted all children to return before the summer holidays but the ""continued prevalence"" of the disease meant it wasn't possible. He said the government would be doing ""a huge amount of catch up for pupils over the summer"" and the education secretary would be setting out further details. He defended the government's policy on reopening schools saying: ""We're very much in line or slightly ahead of some other European countries."" The chair of the education select committee, Conservative MP Robert Halfon, has called on the PM to ""set out a national plan on how we get schools opening again and a catch up programme for left-behind pupils whose life chances are being damaged by being off school for 40% of school year"". Earlier this week Chester Zoo - which has been closed since 21 March - said its future was ""on a knife edge"", despite a government pledge to provide financial support. And last month London Zoo - closed since 20 March - said it faced an ""uncertain future"" without immediate support. This video can not be played A large zoo says it needs government grants as it has no visitors or income Speaking at the daily press conference, the prime minister said outdoor attractions where visitors remain in their cars can reopen because the risk of spreading the disease is lower outside. He said zoos would be able to reopen ""provided visitor numbers are managed and safeguards are put in place - that includes keeping indoor places such as reptile houses closed"". Zoos must also ensure amenities including cafes are take-away only. Downing Street continues to emphasise that the UK government wants to move forward carefully in further easing the lockdown. Wednesday's announcement on zoos reflects the belief the risk of transmission is lower outdoors and is based on social distancing rules being followed. We also know non-essential shops in England and Northern Ireland will reopen in the coming days (though we don't know when this will happen in Scotland and Wales). Small parts of normal life are returning, even if they will likely feel quite different. But while steps to reopen the economy are being taken, the slow progress on schools shows that coming out of lockdown is not always easy and not always in the hands of ministers. The delay in getting primary school pupils back to classrooms in England is a reminder that practicalities - and in some cases public reluctance - are important too. The government says it has already provided a Â£14m support fund for zoos. They have also been eligible to apply for a ""range of support schemes"", including business rate relief, during the pandemic. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Andrew Hall, spokesperson for Biaza - British and Irish Association for Zoos and Aquariums - said he was ""delighted"" with the announcement, but added the sector was ""not out of the woods"". ""Aquariums are still closed, and zoos and safari parks have taken a real hit,"" he said. ""For some zoos, particularly those reliant on tourism, reopening isn't going to be financially viable for them."" He said the announcement was ""not the full answer"" and government support would still be required, especially with limited entry. He added: ""Zoos and aquariums in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will still be facing significant challenges and we will be working hard to achieve positive outcomes in these nations.""

pandemic. The first was the
cumulative figure that the government uses at its daily briefings, which he
pointed out has passed 40,000. Yesterdayâs figure was 40,883. Itâs the number
of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus. The second figure
he used was based on reports of weekly deaths, which are released by the Office for National Statistics for England and Wales, and also by
National Records Scotland and Nisra. They showed that by 29 May, there had been 50,107 people who had
coronavirus mentioned on their death certificates (in these cases, it is enough
for a doctor to suspect that the virus was present). The final number
he gave was for ""excess deaths"", totalling 63,000. That is the number of people
who have died in the
UK compared with the
average number of deaths for this period over the last five years. Some of
these wonât have involved Covid-19 directly.  Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer brought up the impact coronavirus is having on
people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. Separate
reviews by the Office for National Statistics, Public Health England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank have all concluded that these
groups are being disproportionately affected. The
Office for National Statistics, which based its calculations on geographic, age
and health-related factors, found that black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani
individuals were almost twice as likely to die from Covid-19 than white people. There
is no definitive answer as to why these groups are being affected in this way,
but explanations include public-facing occupations (such as working in the NHS)
and pre-existing health inequalities. You can read moreabout the figures and the findings in this report.  Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There are trio of things to pick up on from Prime Minister's Questions. Firstly Boris Johnson said the government would be expanding targeted testing for front-line workers where there are high percentage of ethnic minorities are working. Crucially this testing will be brought in for people who are asymptomatic. Secondly the PM  announced an extra Â£63m in welfare help for the most vulnerable families - this was in response to a question from Sir Keir Starmer about providing free school meals vouchers over the Summer holidays. The third thing, the teaser, was the PM hinting he would say more about how lockdown will be pulled back when he appears at the press conference this afternoon. Allow Twitter content?

Reality Check Sir Keir Starmer has just challenged the PM to keep the
voucher scheme that replaces free school meals going over the summer. But how much is the current initiative costing? About 1.3 million children in England are eligible for free
school meals. During the coronavirus pandemic the government said that pupils
who have to stay at home would continue to receive free school meals in the
form of food parcels or vouchers. It has cost more than Â£129m in England
already and is worth Â£15 per week for each eligible child. Normally eligible pupils only receive meals during term time but
this year they weregiven vouchersduring the Easter holidays at the height of
the coronavirus crisis. MPs and campaigners are now calling on the government
to extend the scheme to cover the summer holidays at an estimated cost of Â£19m per week. Speaking at PMQs, Boris Johnson said the government was putting Â£63m into welfare assistance to help vulnerable families, with local authorities being able to use it however they choose.  House of CommonsParliament Labour's Olivia Blake asks the last question of PMQs and begins with a Bob Marley quote: ""Today they say that we are free, only to be chained in poverty."" The MP quotes figures from theTrussell Trust,externalthat there has been an 89% increase in emergency food parcels needed last month compared to 2019, adding: ""People are struggling and need help right now."" She asks the PM to meet with charities and local government leaders to arrange a boost in funding to help them tackle the issue. Boris Johnson agrees the UK is going through a ""very difficult crisis... that has put many families to great hardship"". He says the government has done a ""huge amount to help"", including providing an extra Â£3.2bn to local government and another Â£63m for extra welfare support over the summer. He concludes: ""She is entirely right we face a huge economic problem. That's why we need to get moving, get this country going forward together."" House of CommonsParliament Labour's Rachel Hopkins says people in the country have ""lost trust in the government"", are ""confused by mix messaging"" and feel ""angry Dominic Cummings seems to have been let off hook"". She also says those in her Luton South constituency are ""particularly worried"" about ""inadequate support schemes and the illogical quarantine policy impacting Luton airport"". ""How can they be confident on the next steps for easing lockdown when your government has fallen short so far,"" she asks. Boris Johnson replies that the British public have ""ignored propaganda and negativity"" from the opposition party. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Mark Logan says there has been ""much disinformation"" about a possible risk in the infection rate - or R number - in the North West of England afetr reports at the weekend it may have risen above one. He asks the prime minister to agree with him that having ""increasingly up to date local data"" on the spread of coronavirus will allow for ""greater confidence"" for his constituents. Boris Johnson says he is ""encouraged by NHS test and trace and the progress it is making"". He says the government is now identify hotspots of the virus and ""do whack-a-mole and stamp out outbreaks"". You can read more here about the infection rate in the North West of England in this analysis by our health correspondent Nick Triggle. House of CommonsParliament Lib Dem acting leader Sir Ed Davey tells MPs that under ""suspicionless"" stop and search powers - a black person is 47 times more likely to be stopped and searched, he says. Sir Ed adds that often it seems ""being black is enough to be suspected of being a criminal"" and urges the PM to end the practice. Boris Johnson says it is ""important stop and search is carried out sensitively"". He adds that it can be a ""very important"" tool ""in fighting violent crime"". ""It does work - it is not the whole answer but part of the mix."" Reality Check Labour
leader Sir Keir Starmer has just criticised the governmentâs policy on re-opening
schools, saying âplenty of other comparable countries are getting their children
back to schoolâ. But what are other major countries on the continent actually doing? InFrance,
primary schools started to re-open on 11 May in âgreenâ zones, where the rate
of infection was low. The government issued detailed instructions to schools on
how to ensure the safety of pupils: this includes a maximum of 15 children to a
class, no shared toys and staggered arrivals. Children over 11 are
required to wear masks. InGermany,
students who had final exams this year went back first but, from 4 May, primary
schools started to re-open too with safety provisions. Germanyâs 16 state
governments are in charge of the implementation but the majority of them
prioritised the return of final year primary pupils. Spainpartially re-opened from 26 May,
to allow for revision classes and state exams, but all other children will not return until September. Italywill keep all its schools shut until
September. House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Kirsty Blackman - also contributing by video link - asks the PM about the response from US President to death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, calling it ""horrendous"". Pointing to previous remarks, she says: ""Does he still believe Trump has 'many, many good qualities' and if so, what are they?"" Boris Johnson repeats that ""Black lives matter"" and the death of George Floyd was ""absolutely appalling"". And on President Trump, he adds: ""He is president of the United States, which is our most important ally in the world. ""And whatever those on the left might say about it, it is a bastion of peace and freedom, and has been for most of my lifetime."" House of CommonsParliament Conservative Peter Aldous says allowing zoos to re-open is ""very good news"" and urges the PM to do the same for beer gardens. ""We want to open hospitality as quickly as possible,"" replies Boris Johnson. He says it is still the plan to allow hospitality to open ""no earlier than 4 July"". However he adds that the disease still poses a danger and that he doesn't want to see a ""roiling bacchanalian mass"" over the Summer. House of CommonsParliament The leader of the SNP in Westminster, Ian Blackford, is next up by video link. He starts by referring to comments made by the PM in front of theLiaison Committee, saying he did not read all the scientific papers on coronavirus. ""No wonder it took so long on quarantine measures,"" he says. ""This has been a complete shambles and too little, too late"". He asks the PM which papers he has read on the2m social distancing rule, to which Mr Johnson replies he has read a ""huge amount"". The PM then confirms the 2m should be kept under review. Mr Blackford says the cabinet has discussed reducing the distance, but ""that is not the experts advice right now"". He adds: ""People are losing confidence in this government... will the prime minister continue to ignore the experts or start following the advice of those who have read the scientific papers?"" Johnson says ""the people of this country are overwhelmingly following the guidance"" and tomorrow the Commons will hear more on test and trace, which will labour this point. He adds: ""There are all sorts of views about the 2m view, but clearly as the incidents of the disease come down, the statistical likelihood of being infected goes down."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Frankie and Benny's owner to cut up to 3,000 jobsThe Restaurant Group confirms plans to close 125 sites while Monsoon Accessorize has axed 545 jobs.","The coronavirus pandemic has claimed another 3,600 UK jobs after the Restaurant Group, Monsoon Accessorize and Quiz announced major restructures. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie and Benny's, expects to cut up to 3,000 workers after confirming plans to shut 125 sites. Monsoon Accessorize has announced 545 job losses and the closure of 35 shops. And fashion chain Quiz has put its stores into administration because they are not currently ""financially viable"". Some 93 jobs will be lost through the reorganisation. The Restaurant Group said the closures would fall mainly on its Frankie and Benny's restaurants, but other chains such as Garfunkel's and Chiquito will also be affected. Meanwhile, Monsoon Accessorize said its current structure was ""unviable"" following the lockdown. Monsoon Accessorize assets have been put into administration and sold to a business controlled by Peter Simon, the founder and owner of the chain. It will now attempt to renegotiate the terms of its remaining 162 shops with its landlords and aims to safeguard up to 2,300 jobs. The restructurings are coming thick and fast. And it's no surprise. Retail and hospitality businesses have taken a massive hit in this pandemic. Sales have disappeared. Even when they're able to re-open, many firms will struggle, or be unable, to pay their rent bills for many months to come. These household names were already having challenges before coronavirus. And they're all now hoping to survive in a leaner, slimmed down, form by securing better deals with their landlords. Expect to see a lot more of this in the weeks and months to come. The Restaurant Group is restructuring part of its business through an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). As well as the closures of some of its eateries, the company said it would attempt to renegotiate rents and terms on a further 85 sites. Going into administration: What does it mean? Jobs go as Debenhams shuts more stores Job losses 'just the tip of the iceberg' When will shops open and what will the rules be? The Restaurant Group's chief executive, Andy Hornby, said: ""The proposed CVA will deliver an appropriately-sized estate for our Leisure business to ensure we are well positioned despite the very challenging market conditions facing the casual dining sector."" The Restaurant Group also owns the Wagamama restaurant chain, but this will not be affected by the restructuring. Some of the company's brands were struggling before the pandemic hit as conditions in the so-called fast casual dining sector in which it operates were already tough. The shift to online shopping has meant fewer visitors to its outlets on High Streets and in shopping centres. That, together with rising rent and wage costs, has prompted a wave of site closures. Last year, Restaurant Group said it would close a number of its sites, and in February said it would close a further 90 restaurants by the end of 2021. Monsoon Accessorize will try to renegotiate rental terms on 162 of its remaining shops Quiz said it would put its 82 outlets in the UK and Ireland into administration before buying them back so it can negotiate better rental terms with its landlords. It said some 822 employees out of a total of 915 would transfer to the new company. Quiz chief executive Tarak Ramzan said the company's shops were already facing challenges before the coronavirus outbreak as fewer people were shopping in store. However, he said that ""the significant economic uncertainty we now face as consumers and businesses emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic"" meant that the group had to be restructured. The coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown has prompted thousands of job cuts across the UK economy. On Tuesday, Debenhams said a further 300 jobs would go and in recent weeks Rolls-Royce, British Airways, EasyJet and car dealership Lookers have announced extensive cuts.

'Over two million await cancer care',"There were fewer chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments during the epidemic About 2.4 million people in the UK are waiting for cancer screening, treatment or tests, as a result of disruption to the NHS during the past 10 weeks, according to Cancer Research UK. It estimates 2.1 million have missed out on screening, while 290,000 people with suspected symptoms have not been referred for hospital tests. More than 23,000 cancers could have gone undiagnosed during lockdown. Cancer services are starting to reopen across the UK. Cancer Research UK's figures are based on data for England and estimated for the whole of the UK. During lockdown, the health service focused on the care and treatment of patients with Covid-19, while other services, such as cancer care, were scaled back. People were still encouraged to seek medical help when they needed it - but there were fewer cancer operations and many chemotherapy and radiotherapy appointments were postponed. Screening programmes that detect early signs of bowel, breast and cervical cancer were paused in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, although not officially stopped in England. And an estimated 2.1 million people who would normally have had routine screening missed out, Cancer Research UK says. Breast screening is just one of many ways of detecting cancers 'Thousands missing out on cancer diagnosis' Cancer surgery delays risk 'thousands' of deaths Cancer patients' concern over treatment suspension The charity says urgent referrals, when patients with suspected cancer symptoms are referred to hospitals by their GP, fell by up to 75% in the first four weeks of lockdown, although these figures have since improved. Patients receiving treatments for cancer also fell, with 6,000 fewer people receiving chemotherapy and 2,800 fewer receiving radiotherapy over the past 10 weeks. And there were only 60% - 12,800 fewer - of the usual number of operations to remove tumours, Cancer Research UK estimates. Chief executive Michelle Mitchell said Covid-19 has placed an ""enormous strain on cancer services"". ""The NHS has had to make very hard decisions to balance risk,"" she said. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When are children returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? ""And there have been some difficult discussions with patients about their safety and ability to continue treatment during this time,"" she said. ""Prompt diagnosis and treatment remain crucial to give people with cancer the greatest chances of survival and prevent the pandemic taking even more lives."" To ensure no-one is put at risk from the virus now that cancer care is returning, Cancer Research UK said ""frequent testing of NHS staff and patients, including those without symptoms"" was vital. It estimates that up to 37,000 tests for the virus would need to be carried out each day for this purpose if the NHS was back running as normal. This is happening at different speeds in the four nations of the UK, with the setting up of safe Covid-free spaces in hospitals key to addressing the backlog of patients. NHS England said coronavirus ""has turned millions of lives upside down"" but cancer services were now largely ""open, ready and able to receive all patients who need care"". Anyone concerned about cancer symptoms should contact their GP. The Welsh and Scottish governments said cancer screening programmes would resume when safe, based on clinical advice. In Northern Ireland, there are plans for urgent cancer surgery and treatment to resume, along with routine screening. Macmillan Cancer Support recently warned of a potential ""ticking cancer timebomb"" due to disrupted cancer services. It said urgent action was needed to make sure cancer does not become the forgotten 'C' during the pandemic. ""We continue to urge the government to set out exactly how it will support the NHS to rapidly rebuild cancer services, including how people will be protected from infection by ensuring there is enough staff, regular testing, plentiful supplies of PPE and... social distancing,"" Sara Bainbridge, head of policy, said.

Top officer urges police to 'stand up to racists',"The UK's most senior black and minority ethnic police officer has urged forces to ""stand up to racists, inequality and injustice"". Anti-racism protests have been held across the UK in the wake of George Floyd's killing in the United States. In a message to officers,external, Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said he was ""horrified"" by Mr Floyd's death. But he said it could be ""a moment for change"" similar to the Macpherson Inquiry into Stephen Lawrence's murder. However,in an interview with The Guardian,external, Mr Lawrence's father Neville said police forces had fallen ""way, way short"" of making reforms promised after the 1999 inquiry and remain ""institutionally racist"". Black people are still treated as second-class citizens ""not only in this country but all over the world"", he added. The death of 46-year-old black man Mr Floyd, in Minneapolis, after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck, triggered an international outcry and has sparked days of protests in cities across the UK. Protests have been held across the UK since the weekend Demonstrations have been largely peaceful, but there were clashes in London on Saturday, and a statue of Winston Churchill was vandalised. In Bristol, demonstrators toppled a statue of slave trader Edward Colston and threw it into the harbour. Home Secretary Priti Patel has condemned a ""lawless minority of protesters"" who ""regrettably turned to violence"" while the prime minister urged the country to ""work peacefully, lawfully"" to defeat racism and discrimination. Thousands join UK protests over George Floyd death London slavery statue removed from outside museum Johnson urges peaceful struggle against racism Mr Basu said ""the overwhelming majority"" of protesters were ""showing solidarity with George and what his death represents"" and should be listened to. The protests on both sides of the Atlantic have been based on ""anger directed not just at police brutality but the racial bias built into the very fabric of our institutions and society"", he added. Mr Basu said there had been progress since the Macpherson Inquiry but ""despite how far we have come we must confront the fact that with many of our communities - especially the black community - we still have a long way to go"".

Babylon Health leaked patients' video consultations,"Babylon Health has acknowledged that its GP video appointment app has suffered a data breach. The firm was alerted to the problem after one of its users discovered he had been given access to dozens of video recordings of other patients' consultations. A follow-up check by Babylon revealed a small number of further UK users could also see others' sessions. The firm said it had since fixed the issue and notified regulators. Babylon allows its members to speak to a doctor, therapist or other health specialist via a smartphone video call and, when appropriate, sends an electronic prescription to a nearby pharmacy. It has more than 2.3 million registered users in the UK. Leeds-based Rory Glover had access to the service via his membership of a private health insurance plan with Bupa, one of Babylon's partners. On Tuesday morning, when he went to check a prescription, he noticed he had about 50 videos in the Consultation Replays section of the app that did not belong to him. Clicking on one revealed that the file contained footage of another person's appointment. ""I was shocked,"" he told the BBC. ""You don't expect to see anything like that when you're using a trusted app. It's shocking to see such a monumental error has been made."" Mr Glover said he alerted a work colleague to the fact, who used to work for Babylon. He in turn flagged the issue to the company's compliance department. Mr Glover discovered dozens of replay videos in his app that he should not have had access to Shortly afterwards, Mr Glover's access to the clips was rescinded. Babylon, which has its headquarters in London, has since confirmed the breach. ""On the afternoon of Tuesday 9 June we identified and resolved an issue within two hours whereby one patient accessed the introduction of another patient's consultation recording,"" it said in statement. ""Our investigation showed that three patients, who had booked and had appointments today, were incorrectly presented with, but did not view, recordings of other patients' consultations through a subsection of the user's profile within the Babylon app."" On Wednesday, the firm amended its statement to make clear that it meant two patients in addition to Mr Glover - who had in fact viewed a recording - to make the total of three. ""This was the result of a software error rather than a malicious attack,"" it continued. ""The problem was identified and resolved quickly. ""Of course we take any security issue, however small, very seriously and have contacted the patients affected to update, apologise to and support where required."" A spokesman said that Babylon's engineering team was already aware of the issue before it was contacted by Mr Glover's workmate. He said the problem had been accidentally introduced via a new feature that lets users switch from audio to video-based consultations part way through a call. And he said that Babylon had informed the Information Commissioner's Office of the matter. ""Affected users were in the UK only and this did not impact our international operations,"" he added. However, Mr Glover said he still had concerns and did not intend to use the service again. ""It's an issue of doctor-patient confidentiality,"" he said. ""You expect anything you say to be private, not for it to be shared with a stranger."" The Information Commissioner's Office has confirmed that it had been contacted by Babylon and that it was now waiting to receive the company's breach report. ""People's medical data is highly sensitive information, not only do people expect it to be handled carefully and securely, organisations also have a responsibility under the law,"" said a spokeswoman. ""When a data incident occurs, we would expect an organisation to consider whether it is appropriate to contact the people affected, and to consider whether there are steps that can be taken to protect them from any potential adverse effects."" Babylon told the BBC it had already been in touch with everyone involved to inform them and apologise.

Calls for racial justice at George Floyd's funeral,"Mourners wore ""I can't breathe"" badges at the service The funeral of George Floyd, an African American whose death in police custody spawned global outrage, has heard impassioned pleas for racial justice. Speakers in the church in Houston, Texas, lined up to remember a man whose ""crime was that he was born black"". Mr Floyd died in Minneapolis last month as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, his final moments filmed on phones. Four police officers involved have been sacked and chargedover his death. His coffin was taken from the church driven in a motorcade to the Houston Memorial Gardens where he was to be buried beside his mother. This video can not be played George Floyd's niece: 'This is not just murder, but a hate crime' One of Mr Floyd's nieces, Brooke Williams, called for a change in laws which, she argued, were designed to disadvantage black people. ""Why must this system be corrupt and broken?"" she asked. ""Laws were already put in place for the African-American system to fail. And these laws need to be changed. No more hate crimes, please! Someone said 'Make America Great Again', but when has America ever been great?"" Republican President Donald Trump's Democratic opponent in the November presidential election, Joe Biden, addressed the service in a video message, saying: ""When there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America."" George Floyd's body was loaded into a hearse Mr Biden has sharply criticised Mr Trump,accusing him at the weekend of making ""despicable"" speculative remarks about Mr Floyd. But the Democratic politician was himself recently accused of taking black American votes for grantedwhen he said African Americans ""ain't black"" if they even considered voting for Mr Trump. The service was held at the Fountain of Praise church,attended by some 500 guests,externalincluding politicians and celebrities. ""George Floyd was not expendable - this is why we're here,"" said Al Green, the local Democratic congressman. ""His crime was that he was born black."" Veteran civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton told the service: ""All over the world I see grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave masters' statues."" Talking about Mr Floyd's difficult life, he said: ""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that's gonna change the whole wide world."" In Minnesota, Governor Tim Walz called on people to honour the funeral by observing silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the time Mr Floyd was pinned to the ground before he died. Mourners paid respects before the service Many wore ""I can't breathe"" badges Mr Floyd's coffin was taken to a cemetery in Pearland, south of Houston, for a private burial ceremony. For the last mile of the procession it was conveyed in a horse-drawn carriage. Barriers were erected along the route to allow members of the public to pay their respects,externalsafely as the procession passed. Mr Floyd will be interred in a mausoleum in Pearland His body was on display at the church for six hours on Monday. This video can not be played George Floyd's ex partner: 'Gianna doesn't have a father' Memorial services were also held in Minneapolis and North Carolina, where Mr Floyd was born. After visiting the family on Monday, the Democratic candidate told CBS: ""His little daughter was there, the one who said 'daddy's going to change the world', and I think her daddy is going to change the world.""

More work needed to tackle racism - Met chief,"The UK's most senior black and minority ethnic police officer has urged forces to ""stand up to racists, inequality and injustice"". Anti-racism protests have been held across the UK in the wake of George Floyd's killing in the United States. In a message to officers,external, Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said he was ""horrified"" by Mr Floyd's death. But he said it could be ""a moment for change"" similar to the Macpherson Inquiry into Stephen Lawrence's murder. However,in an interview with The Guardian,external, Mr Lawrence's father Neville said police forces had fallen ""way, way short"" of making reforms promised after the 1999 inquiry and remain ""institutionally racist"". Black people are still treated as second-class citizens ""not only in this country but all over the world"", he added. The death of 46-year-old black man Mr Floyd, in Minneapolis, after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck, triggered an international outcry and has sparked days of protests in cities across the UK. Protests have been held across the UK since the weekend Demonstrations have been largely peaceful, but there were clashes in London on Saturday, and a statue of Winston Churchill was vandalised. In Bristol, demonstrators toppled a statue of slave trader Edward Colston and threw it into the harbour. Home Secretary Priti Patel has condemned a ""lawless minority of protesters"" who ""regrettably turned to violence"" while the prime minister urged the country to ""work peacefully, lawfully"" to defeat racism and discrimination. Thousands join UK protests over George Floyd death London slavery statue removed from outside museum Johnson urges peaceful struggle against racism Mr Basu said ""the overwhelming majority"" of protesters were ""showing solidarity with George and what his death represents"" and should be listened to. The protests on both sides of the Atlantic have been based on ""anger directed not just at police brutality but the racial bias built into the very fabric of our institutions and society"", he added. Mr Basu said there had been progress since the Macpherson Inquiry but ""despite how far we have come we must confront the fact that with many of our communities - especially the black community - we still have a long way to go"".

Actors offer action plan over drama school racism,"This video can not be played Shaniqua Okwok: ""I really felt this weight on my shoulders"" A group of young BAME actors who have spoken out about racial discrimination they endured at a leading drama school have proposed their own action plan. The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London has admitted it has been complicit in systemic racism. Now, 240 former students have signed a blueprint letter which they hope could be a model for other drama schools. They say ""racism is real at Central and it scars the lives of its students [and] staff"" as well as many alumni. The group formed after being dismayed when the institution posted a message supporting Black Lives Matter last week. Their letter says: ""Words and actions of open and overt racism - primarily by staff towards students - have taken place on a consistent and regular basis without respite or consequence."" Big names from theatre and TV, including Young Vic artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah and writer Russell T Davies have added their names to it. Former students of other drama schools, including Rada, the Oxford School of Drama, Alra and Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts,have also spoken out in recent days,externalafter similar messages. Central's acting principals have said they ""personally commit to bringing about lasting and wide-ranging change"". One former student has spoken about how she was told to accept she would play a slave in her career because she had ""inherited this trauma"", and was silenced when she complained. Others have said the school failed to take action about racism by directors and other students; that teachers regularly called black students by the wrong names; that they were stereotyped in the roles and comments they were given; and that there was a lack of diversity among staff and in the plays they studied. Anna Crichlow, who graduated in 2016, said she didn't work on a play by a black playwright until her second year, and none at all by a black British playwright over three years. ""I was told by a teacher that I would never work classically,"" she told BBC News. ""When I graduated, my first job was in a production of Pride & Prejudice. So it's just simply not true."" She added: ""People are not getting the breadth of training that prepares them for this really quite diverse industry now. They're not getting training that's inclusive to them and their experiences. ""Everyone wants to help the school move on because there is great teaching going on, but it's being detracted from because of this systemic issue and this racism which is running through the school's centre."" Another black former student said Central is not racist, ""just very stupid"". The action plan calls for: A system to report racism and prejudice, and to investigate all complaints; more staff training; to restructure the curriculum; a more diverse workforce; and more people of colour on the board. ""We hope this is taken with the intention in which it's being given,"" said Chi-San Howard, who studied movement directing and teaching until 2016. ""We are never going to not read Shakespeare. We are never going to not enjoy the work of Pinter. They are brilliant. It's just that there are other brilliant people as well who deserve to be heard and deserve to be seen."" Crichlow added that the past week had revealed that people in other drama schools had been through similar experiences. ""These places are historical and we're very lucky to have them here, but it does mean they've been operating in a similar way for a very long time,"" she said. ""I certainly think the blueprint letter that we've been working on could be applied to lots of different schools and institutions. All of our hopes are for it to be a really positive step for everyone."" The school's principal Prof Gavin Henderson, who was due to retire at the end of term, has brought forward his retirement by three months to deal with a ""personal, family matter"". His acting replacements, Debbie Scully and Prof Ross Brown, said: ""We have no way to fully understand the pain that many people will have gone through over the last week, and in the past. ""We are committed to forging a transparent course of action, and we will be reaching out to many of the people who have posted online, as well as meeting with current staff and students. ""We will learn from shared experiences and act upon them to effect transformational change."" Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

CrossFit CEO quits after joke about George Floyd,"The CrossFit fitness plan was developed by Greg Glassman The chief executive of CrossFit has quit after causing offence with remarks about the death of George Floyd and the resulting protests. Greg Glassman stepped down after athletes, gyms and sportswear firms cut ties with his $4bn (Â£3.1bn) brand. Mr Glassman acknowledged having caused a ""rift"" in the CrossFit community. His exit came on the day of Floyd's funeral in Texas. The unarmed black man died last month after a policeman in Minneapolis knelt on his neck. CrossFit is a branded exercise regimen that involves high-intensity group workouts with a focus on strength and conditioning. Gyms around the world offer classes. Calls for racial justice at George Floyd's funeral In reply to a public health body saying racism was a public health issue, Greg Glassman tweeted on Saturday night: ""It's FLOYD-19"", an apparent reference to Covid-19. He followed it up with a second tweet saying: ""Your failed model quarantined us and now you're going to model a solution to racism? George Floyd's brutal murder sparked riots nationally."" He also called an affiliate ""delusional"" for questioning why CrossFit had been silent on the killing in Minneapolis. According to Buzzfeed, hours before posting the fateful tweets, Mr Glassman had told gym owners on a private Zoom call: ""We're not mourning for George Floyd - I don't think me or any of my staff are. ""Can you tell me why I should mourn for him? Other than that it's the white thing to do."" In a statement on Tuesday,external, Mr Glassman said: ""I'm stepping down as CEO of CrossFit, Inc, and I have decided to retire. ""On Saturday I created a rift in the CrossFit community and unintentionally hurt many of its members."" He added: ""IÂ cannot let my behaviour stand in the way of HQ's or affiliates' missions. They are too important to jeopardise."" This video can not be played George Floyd's niece: 'This is not just murder, but a hate crime' His statement was followed by another from Dave Castro, his successor at the helm of the company. The incoming CEO said: ""CrossFit is a community - one that is global, diverse, and tough."" He added: ""Our community is hurt, though. Our shared bond brings together millions of people with differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences."" Mr Glassman conceived the company as a high school gymnast in his parents' garage in California. It is now affiliated with an estimated 13,000 gyms worldwide. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? Hundreds of affiliate gyms have removed CrossFit from their branding. One of these gyms, Petworth Fitness in Washington DC - formerly CrossFit Petworth - wrote on Instagram: ""For a brand that has preached about being 'for all', the deafening silence on current and past issues of racism tells us all we need to know."" It added that it would donate its annual affiliate fee - $3,000 - to the Black Lives Matter DC and Know Your Rights anti-racist campaign groups. Adidas AG, which owns Reebok, also issued a statement confirming it was ending its relationship with CrossFit. ""Recently, we have been in discussions regarding a new agreement, however, in light of recent events, we have made the decision to end our partnership with CrossFit HQ,"" the company said in a statement to AFP news agency. Several CrossFit athletes also criticised the company. Four-time CrossFit Games champion Matthew Fraser praised a colleague for disaffiliating from the company, while Olympian and three-time CrossFit Games champion Tia-Clair Toomey said she was ""incredibly saddened, disappointed and frustrated"" with Mr Glassman's comments.

Falkirk fans have saved their club Â£90,000 by declining refunds for matches missed last season. Just 2% of season ticket holders took up the offer of compensation for cancelled home games after the season was brought to an early close in April because of the Covid-19 crisis. The club offered refunds hoping some fans could afford not to claim them. Had everyone entitled to a refund claimed one, it would have cost the League One outfit around Â£90,000. Read more here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The UK and Scottish governments should act to help businesses exploit opportunities presented by new methods of working required as the lockdown eases, the founder and chief executive of Scottish tech company G-Hold tells BBC Scotland. Alison Grieve says her own business has been able to combine working from home with ""a work space that has allowed for social distancing"" while producing goods that have helped frontline workers. She realises that many businesses will find it more difficult, even impossible, to work under restrictions even as they are relaxed. But she adds: ""For some industries, there are opportunities to tap into supporting these hybrid ways of working."" In particular, office-based companies require software, cyber security and devices and Ms Grieve would like government to help fund such developments. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Restaurants in Italy have re-opened with social distancing rules A metre goes a long way in deciding whether a catering business will be viable as lockdown measures are eased, Edinburgh restaurateur Gino Stornaiuolo tells BBC Radio Scotland. He was reacting to words from Prime Minister Boris Johnson at his media briefing suggesting the present two-metre social distancing rule could be reviewed. ""A metre is not that great, but in this industry a metre is a big thing and if we can get the two metre down to one metre then I really think it will be the difference between businesses going under and businesses surviving,"" he suggests. ""I've got two restaurants. If we are open with these restrictions in place, the 100-cover restaurant could probably do quite well, but the 40-cover restaurant is going to be in trouble. I have gone to my landlord and they are shrugging their shoulders.""  The rearranged Olympic Games will ""not be done with grand splendour"" but will be simplified, Tokyo 2020 chief executive Toshiro Muto has said. The Games, originally scheduled to start next month, werepostponed for a year in Marchbecause of the pandemic. Speaking after an executive board meeting for the International Olympic Committee, Muto added that more than 200 areas had been identified ""where Olympics simplification was possible"" but that ""we are not at the stage where we have concrete ideas on how to simplify the Games"". Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. The Scottish government has confirmed the tourism and hospitality announcement applies to pubs and restaurants. A spokeswoman said: ""It is conditional on the scientific and public health evidence
being in the right place, that restrictions on travel have been eased, and that
the route-map is progressing as planned. âIt must be emphasised this is not guaranteed
and that it may be necessary to change it if sufficient progress has not been
made - but we hope the sector can begin to make its comeback on 15 July.â The tourism and hospitality sector includes
all parts under phase three of the route-map out of lockdown. This covers accommodation providers, visitor
attractions, indoor areas of pubs and restaurants and the wider aspects of
tourism. Phase four of the route map includes events. 1.Coronavirus (COVID-) Phase 1: staying at home and away
from others (physical distancing),external This is the guidance for the
first phase of easing the lockdown. We are still currently in phase one.. 2.Test and Protect,external If you have Covid-19 symptoms go
immediately to NHS Inform online or phone 0800 028 2816 to book a test 3.NHS Inform,external The latest from NHS Scotland and the Scottish
government, including social distancing, face covering and stay at home advice. 4.Coronavirus (COVID-19): shielding support and contacts,external 5.Support for those at high COVID-19 risk:,external  Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's tourism businesses, including pubs, hotels and restaurants, have been told to prepare to reopen on 15 July. The move has been welcomed by the sector, with Fiona Campbell of the Association of Scottish Self Caterers telling Drivetime it provided some hope of a tourist season. However, she also calls for a public messaging campaign to emphasise to the public that holidaying domestically will be safe, as the strength of the stay at home message may put people off. ""Communities need to be able to welcome people knowing that it is safe to do so,"" she says. Crieff Hydro is the flagship hotel in the group Meanwhile, the owner of the Crieff Hydro hotel group -which gave notice that 241 staff face redundancy- continues to warn the sector will still be in danger if the 2m rule remains in place. Stephen Leckie says he was ""delighted"" by today's news but warns businesses will continue to lose money until they are able to reach 70% occupancy. He also suggests severely limiting passenger numbers on ferries would ""throttle"" tourism on Scotland's islands. It is worth stressing the 'support bubbles' announced by Boris Johnson are for England only. Here in Scotland the rules remain that people from two households are only allowed to meet outdoors in small groups of no more than eight. You can check out the Scottish government guidelines here:Coronavirus (COVID-19) Phase 1:
staying at home and away from others (physical distancing),external. The first minister has warned  people thatmeeting up with other households indoors is a ""surefire way"" of allowing coronavirus to spread. Boris Johnson announces that from Saturday 13 June, single adult households in England can form one âsupport bubbleâ with one other household of any size. This means they can go to each otherâs houses, stay the night and donât have to maintain social distancing. The prime minister  says all those in a support bubble will be able to act as if they live in the same household. As such, if any member of the bubble develops symptoms all members of the bubble have to follow guidelines. ""We're making this change to support those who are particularly lonely,"" he says. ""It is not designed for those who do not qualify to start meeting inside people's homes, because that remains against the law."" Those who are shielding cannot take part. The rules in Scotland remain unchanged, with people from two households only allowed to meet outdoors in small groups of no more than eight. Nicola Sturgeon has warned people thatmeeting up with other households indoors is a ""surefire way"" of allowing coronavirus to spread. Allow Twitter content?

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Today's announcement that theScottish government hopes to reopen the tourism sector on 15 Julyis ""good news"" as it needed ""an indicative date"" to begin planning, according to the chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance. Marc Crothall says the UK's 14-day requirement for visitors from abroad, and the 2m social distancing rule, would still present ""a challenge"". But he tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""The 'staycation' market is our immediate opportunity and our hope is that Scots look to holiday in Scotland and get out there and spend money in local economies."" Mr Crothall thinks that there are ""a good range of businesses"" that will be able to open - self-catering, caravan parks, many hotels, visitor attractions, marine tourism and the adventure sector. ""But there will also be a number who will be having to work out whether the viability is there to trade with the distancing regulations as they stand - marine tourism and the adventure sector is well,"" he says. ""Right now it is about getting those businesses ready and getting staff back into the properties so they can be trained under the new guidance.""

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Professor
Sir David Spiegelhalter explains the risk of dying from Covid-19 very much depends on age and the likelihood of dying within the next year anyway. The average 60 year old has a 1% chance of dying within the next year - and that roughly doubles every seven years after than, the Cambridge University statistician says. This risk doubles if an older person catches coronavirus, he adds. These risks are not the same for younger people, he says. Regarding other impacts of Covid-19, Sir David says there have been lots of extra deaths from people not going to hospital when they need it. But he also says we do not yet know the full impact on mental health, nor the health impacts of the forthcoming economic issues which will affect young people. A further 245 people have died with Covid-19 in UK across all settings, the latestdaily government figures show.,external It takes the total number to have died after testing positive for coronavirus to 41,128. Meanwhile the prime minister is leading today's UK government briefing. Boris Johnson is expected to outline further easing of lockdown restrictions in England. You can follow live updates here. The UK briefing has begun Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland GPs must be better reintegrated into the Test and Protect system, a public health expert says. Prof Allyson Pollock, who is a member of the independent SAGE committee, tells Drivetime GPs have been ""locked out"" of the system, not even being able to order Covid-19 tests for patients. She calls for them to be given resources and support to help patients in the community. Prof Pollock praises Scotland's approach of utilising public health departments within health boards for contact tracing. But she warns there are still issues with how cases are being identified and referred to contact tracers. Â© 2025 BBC.

Zoos and safari parks set to reopen from 15 June - PMBoris Johnson is due to announce the move will be subject to distancing measures being in place.UK Politics,"London Zoo had said it faced an ""uncertain future"" Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas are set to reopen in England from Monday, the PM has said. Speaking at Wednesday's daily briefing, Boris Johnson outlined the latest steps in the easing of the coronavirus lockdown. He said the outdoor attractions can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. Some zoos, including Chester Zoo and London Zoo, have reported financial struggles during the pandemic. A number of Tory MPshave been calling for zoos to reopen to ensure they survive the crisis. The move will pave the way for zoos to reopen in England alongside non-essential shops, which can also open from 15 June. What will happen when zoos reopen? 'It is a worrying time to be running a zoo' London Zoo faces 'perilous future' Zoo remains 'on a knife edge' despite support But Mr Johnson faced criticism from the Labour leader at Prime Minister's Questions, after theplan for the reopening of all primary schools in England by the summer was ditched by the government. Sir Keir Starmer said the government's plan for getting children back to school in England was ""in tatters"", blaming the situation on a lack of leadership from Mr Johnson. He called for a ""national taskforce"" to be set up, to find a way forward. Mr Johnson said Sir Keir had previously said school reopenings were happening too quickly and accused him of trying to have it both ways. Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the daily briefing why children could go to the zoo but not school, the prime minister said he had wanted all children to return before the summer holidays but the ""continued prevalence"" of the disease meant it wasn't possible. He said the government would be doing ""a huge amount of catch up for pupils over the summer"" and the education secretary would be setting out further details. He defended the government's policy on reopening schools saying: ""We're very much in line or slightly ahead of some other European countries."" The chair of the education select committee, Conservative MP Robert Halfon, has called on the PM to ""set out a national plan on how we get schools opening again and a catch up programme for left-behind pupils whose life chances are being damaged by being off school for 40% of school year"". Earlier this week Chester Zoo - which has been closed since 21 March - said its future was ""on a knife edge"", despite a government pledge to provide financial support. And last month London Zoo - closed since 20 March - said it faced an ""uncertain future"" without immediate support. This video can not be played A large zoo says it needs government grants as it has no visitors or income Speaking at the daily press conference, the prime minister said outdoor attractions where visitors remain in their cars can reopen because the risk of spreading the disease is lower outside. He said zoos would be able to reopen ""provided visitor numbers are managed and safeguards are put in place - that includes keeping indoor places such as reptile houses closed"". Zoos must also ensure amenities including cafes are take-away only. Downing Street continues to emphasise that the UK government wants to move forward carefully in further easing the lockdown. Wednesday's announcement on zoos reflects the belief the risk of transmission is lower outdoors and is based on social distancing rules being followed. We also know non-essential shops in England and Northern Ireland will reopen in the coming days (though we don't know when this will happen in Scotland and Wales). Small parts of normal life are returning, even if they will likely feel quite different. But while steps to reopen the economy are being taken, the slow progress on schools shows that coming out of lockdown is not always easy and not always in the hands of ministers. The delay in getting primary school pupils back to classrooms in England is a reminder that practicalities - and in some cases public reluctance - are important too. The government says it has already provided a Â£14m support fund for zoos. They have also been eligible to apply for a ""range of support schemes"", including business rate relief, during the pandemic. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Andrew Hall, spokesperson for Biaza - British and Irish Association for Zoos and Aquariums - said he was ""delighted"" with the announcement, but added the sector was ""not out of the woods"". ""Aquariums are still closed, and zoos and safari parks have taken a real hit,"" he said. ""For some zoos, particularly those reliant on tourism, reopening isn't going to be financially viable for them."" He said the announcement was ""not the full answer"" and government support would still be required, especially with limited entry. He added: ""Zoos and aquariums in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will still be facing significant challenges and we will be working hard to achieve positive outcomes in these nations.""

"Family visit plea over dementia patientsSome families say they are ""completely cut off"" by visiting restrictions during the pandemic.Wales","This video can not be played Kate talks about the frustration of not knowing when she will be allowed to visit her mother who has Alzheimer's Patients with dementia, difficulty understanding English or other communication problems should be allowed a family member with them while in hospital, it has been argued. Visiting is currently suspended across Wales due to the coronavirus restrictions. Now calls are being made by the Welsh Liberal Democrats and Alzheimer's Society for a review. The Welsh Government said exceptions were in place for certain patients. A spokesperson suggested those with mental health issues, such as dementia, a learning disability or autismshould be able to request a visit under the current guidelines.,external But BBC Wales has spoken to a number of people in this situation who have had a different experience. Family times with Janice aren't possible at the moment Kate, from south Wales, said she fears her mother will no longer recognise her after months apart. Diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease four years ago, 71-year-old Janice was admitted to hospital a few weeks before the lockdown for help with medication. The family accompanied her on admission and would visit every day, helping her to eat and wash, bringing in her familiar shower gel, hand cream and music to trigger memories and make her feel comfortable. But then ""we were completely cut off"", Kate said. ""For somebody with dementia that has huge repercussions."" They had to wait nine weeks before being offered a video call with their mum, after an iPad was donated to the ward. Janice was admitted to hospital a few weeks before lockdown Kate said the change she noticed in Janice's condition was ""distressing"". ""The worry is if we're not in touch, will it be more difficult for her to recognise us and feel comfortable in the house when she comes home? ""It makes you feel really anxious and really concerned that nobody seems to be thinking about the bigger picture and putting a strategy in place."" ""Even if they said, 'right the R number would need to be this or we would need such and such to be in place to allow visiting' - then at least that would give us some reassurance that we're aiming for something. ""It would be something to hold on to, some light at the end of the tunnel. But at the moment it's just 'it's not safe, end of story'."" Coronavirus and dementia: 'I'm scared to go out after lockdown' Dementia deaths up during pandemic How it feels to be a dementia carer under lockdown The wife of another hospital patient in south Wales with dementia - who wished to remain anonymous - said she had been preparing to visit her husband when lockdown happened, describing the situation since then as ""like a bereavement"". ""The ward was locked with immediate effect meaning I couldn't say goodbye,"" she said. Despite having power of attorney over his health and welfare, she says she is ""not being consulted or listened to"". ""He has definitely deteriorated a lot since lockdown. Dementia can change so quickly and you lose so much."" Sue Phelps, country director for Alzheimer's Society Cymru, said the current situation could lead to ""increased isolation, anxiety and unnecessary cognitive decline"" for patients with dementia. ""The most frustrating thing for carers or loved ones is not being able to share their insight. They are the ones who know the person best, they can articulate for that person and make sure they are getting the support they are familiar with."" Concerns have also been raised for patients who have difficulties communicating for other reasons, including those for whom English is not their first language. Jane Dodds said language issues had also been raised with the party Jane Dodds, Welsh Liberal Democrats leader, said she wanted to see a relaxation of the rules, with hospitals considering whether to allow a family member to accompany patients on admission or visit them on a ""case by case basis"". Recalling her own experience of seeing her mother revert to only being able to speak Welsh at the end of her life because of dementia, she said it was ""something particularly for Wales to think about"". She also said the party had been contacted by the family of an elderly man of Asian heritage who were distraught at not being able to accompany him into hospital as he could not understand English. ""We do understand totally the situation at the moment with Covid-19 and how difficult it is for medical staff to keep everybody safe. But we're asking that they look at every case and consider, where there are people with communication problems, whether they can take somebody in with them."" The Welsh Government said exceptions were already in place to enable people to visit people with mental health issues, as well as dementia, a learning disability or autism in hospital. ""It is entirely appropriate for people with specific needs to be accompanied to hospital for an appointment if it would be detrimental to their care if they were unsupported,"" a spokesman said. ""In all such instances, agreement should be sought in advance from the nurse in charge of the area.""

Speakers in the church in Houston, Texas, lined up to remember a man whose ""crime was that he was born black"". Mr Floyd died in Minneapolis last month as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, his final moments filmed on phones.

Someone said 'Make America Great Again', but when has America ever been great?"" Republican President Donald Trump's Democratic opponent in the November presidential election, Joe Biden, addressed the service in a video message, saying: ""When there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.""

But the Democratic politician was himself recently accused of taking black American votes for grantedwhen he said African Americans ""ain't black"" if they even considered voting for Mr Trump. The service was held at the Fountain of Praise church,attended by some 500 guests,externalincluding politicians and celebrities. ""George Floyd was not expendable - this is why we're here,"" said Al Green, the local Democratic congressman. ""His crime was that he was born black."" Veteran civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton told the service: ""All over the world I see grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave masters' statues."" Talking about Mr Floyd's difficult life, he said: ""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that's gonna change the whole wide world."" In Minnesota, Governor Tim Walz called on people to honour the funeral by observing silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the time Mr Floyd was pinned to the ground before he died. Mourners paid respects before the service Many wore ""I can't breathe"" badges Mr Floyd's coffin was taken to a cemetery in Pearland, south of Houston, for a private burial ceremony.

Babylon Health admits to GP app data breachThe video call app allowed some patients to see recordings of others' sessions with medics.Technology,"Babylon Health has acknowledged that its GP video appointment app has suffered a data breach. The firm was alerted to the problem after one of its users discovered he had been given access to dozens of video recordings of other patients' consultations. A follow-up check by Babylon revealed a small number of further UK users could also see others' sessions. The firm said it had since fixed the issue and notified regulators. Babylon allows its members to speak to a doctor, therapist or other health specialist via a smartphone video call and, when appropriate, sends an electronic prescription to a nearby pharmacy. It has more than 2.3 million registered users in the UK. Leeds-based Rory Glover had access to the service via his membership of a private health insurance plan with Bupa, one of Babylon's partners. On Tuesday morning, when he went to check a prescription, he noticed he had about 50 videos in the Consultation Replays section of the app that did not belong to him. Clicking on one revealed that the file contained footage of another person's appointment. ""I was shocked,"" he told the BBC. ""You don't expect to see anything like that when you're using a trusted app. It's shocking to see such a monumental error has been made."" Mr Glover said he alerted a work colleague to the fact, who used to work for Babylon. He in turn flagged the issue to the company's compliance department. Mr Glover discovered dozens of replay videos in his app that he should not have had access to Shortly afterwards, Mr Glover's access to the clips was rescinded. Babylon, which has its headquarters in London, has since confirmed the breach. ""On the afternoon of Tuesday 9 June we identified and resolved an issue within two hours whereby one patient accessed the introduction of another patient's consultation recording,"" it said in statement. ""Our investigation showed that three patients, who had booked and had appointments today, were incorrectly presented with, but did not view, recordings of other patients' consultations through a subsection of the user's profile within the Babylon app."" On Wednesday, the firm amended its statement to make clear that it meant two patients in addition to Mr Glover - who had in fact viewed a recording - to make the total of three. ""This was the result of a software error rather than a malicious attack,"" it continued. ""The problem was identified and resolved quickly. ""Of course we take any security issue, however small, very seriously and have contacted the patients affected to update, apologise to and support where required."" A spokesman said that Babylon's engineering team was already aware of the issue before it was contacted by Mr Glover's workmate. He said the problem had been accidentally introduced via a new feature that lets users switch from audio to video-based consultations part way through a call. And he said that Babylon had informed the Information Commissioner's Office of the matter. ""Affected users were in the UK only and this did not impact our international operations,"" he added. However, Mr Glover said he still had concerns and did not intend to use the service again. ""It's an issue of doctor-patient confidentiality,"" he said. ""You expect anything you say to be private, not for it to be shared with a stranger."" The Information Commissioner's Office has confirmed that it had been contacted by Babylon and that it was now waiting to receive the company's breach report. ""People's medical data is highly sensitive information, not only do people expect it to be handled carefully and securely, organisations also have a responsibility under the law,"" said a spokeswoman. ""When a data incident occurs, we would expect an organisation to consider whether it is appropriate to contact the people affected, and to consider whether there are steps that can be taken to protect them from any potential adverse effects."" Babylon told the BBC it had already been in touch with everyone involved to inform them and apologise.

As former hotspots like New York and New Jersey see declining infection rates, new coronavirus cases are climbing in 21 US states, as the country marches forward with its economic reopening. And nationwide, total Covid-19 infections are creeping towards the 2 million mark, with more than 112,500 deaths. Of these 21 states, 12 of them - including South Carolina, Texas and Utah - have reported increased hospitalisation rates since the Memorial Day holiday weekend last month. In Arizona, which has seen an especially pronounced spike in both Covid infections and hospitalisations, local health officials are starting to sound the alarm. Banner Health, the state's largest hospital system, warned this week that its intensive care units were filling up, and ventilator use was rising, while the state health director told Arizona hospitals to ""fully activate"" emergency plans. As of Wednesday, Arizona had confirmed 29,852 cases and 1,101 deaths.  Global coffee chain Starbucks says it expects revenue this quarter to have plummeted by more than $3bn (Â£2.3bn) because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company also projected an adjusted loss of about 55 to 70 cents per share for its third quarter ending in June. In further bad news it said its current-quarter operating income was expected to plunge by up to $2.2bn Like other cafe and restaurant chains, Starbucks had to close thousands of outlets around the world as part of coronavirus lockdowns or convert them to drive-through or take-away only. The company says it expects to permanently close about 400 stores

BBC OS Queues of people with virus symptoms have formed outside hospitals in Delhi Infections in India are rising. In the capital, Delhi, images have emerged of patients queuing outside hospitals, waiting to be treated for Covid-19. Dr Parv Mittal, who works in Delhi's Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, spoke to BBC Outside Source. ""It's really difficult to say how we will be able to cope,"" he said. ""I'm not sure if we have the beds. Even if you create the beds, there will be a shortage of manpower."" Delhi is seeing more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases every day, stretching hospital resources. Dr Mittal says his hospital initially struggled to get personal protective equipment (PPE).  Now it has enough but working in PPE is ""exhausting"", he says. ""Wearing it even for one hour, you start sweating a lot. You start getting dehydrated. Initially we had to work for six to eight hours non-stop. There's a persistent fear of contracting the infection."" Chester Zoo - home to these elephants - says the lockdown has threatened its survival Some zoos and safari parks in England are preparing to throw open their doors to visitors from Monday, bringing in some much-needed revenue. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced that the outdoor attractions can reopenat today's daily briefing. Dominic Jermey, head of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) which runs London and Whipsnade Zoos, said they were ""raring to go"". ""We expect to have tickets ready to book by Friday and everyone will need to book so we can manage capacity,"" he said. Last month London Zoo said it faced an ""uncertain future"" without immediate financial support. Jamie Christon from Chester Zoo in north-west England said a week ago they had been ""in despair"", not knowing when the zoo would reopen or if it would even survive. ""The zoo has suffered severe financial damage over the past three months and the road to recovery will be long and uncertain,"" he added. Some other zoos have said they are still putting in place social distancing and hygiene measures and won't be able to open until July. This lion at London Zoo was more interested in a nap... The penguins, however, appeared ready to welcome back the public Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The lockdown may have led more individuals to become radicalised as they spend more time online, a British police chief has warned. The Metropolitan Police's Lucy D'Orsi said the precise impact of the lockdown on the terrorism threat was not yet known. She urged the public to remain alert as people return to crowded places closed in March. The current UK threat level is ""substantial"", meaning an attack is likely. ""The reality is that the threat has not gone away,"" Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner D'Orsi told the BBC. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves has welcomed the latest government guidance that adults living alone in England can form a ""support bubble"" with one other household. In a further easing of coronavirus restrictions, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that, from Saturday,single adults could spend the night at another house. Ms Reeves, Labour MP for Leeds West, said she hoped the measure would ""ease some of the loneliness that we see in society"", but qualified her support by saying that people were ""anxious about the easing of restrictions and of good work being undone"" if it wasn't backed up by the science. She said the government had ""got to get this right and needs to make sure the test, trace and isolate policy is in place to ensure that further easing of the restrictions can work"". Read more on how social bubbles work. People living alone in England will soon be able to stay at another household (of any size) to form a ""support bubble"".  The move was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as part of further easing of coronavirus restrictions. A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close contact.

A man leaves a temporary shower trailer in Manhattan for the homeless and other vulnerable communities in May New Yorkers experiencing homelessness and sleeping in shelters during the coronavirus outbreak were disproportionately vulnerable to death or illness, a report from the Coalition for the Homeless has found. As of 1 June, the Covid mortality rate in New York City overall was 200 deaths per 100,000 people. Among those sleeping in shelters, this figure was 321 deaths per 100,000 people. And according to the coalition, the number of coronavirus-related deaths among homeless New Yorkers sleeping in shelters in April 2020 was 157% higher than the number of deaths from all causes among this same group during an average month in 2019. As of 31 May, there were 926 confirmed Covid-19 cases across some 179 shelters. Places of worship have now opened in India as the country eases its lockdown measure. These images from Koltata show priests wearing protective gear, preparing to enter the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. Restrictions on shops, market places and transport services were eased on Monday. It comes despite a surge of infections in the country, which now has 266,598 confirmed cases. However experts say there was no other option but to lift the lockdown, which had a massive economic impact on the country. There is little evidence that a change in the seasons will affect the spread of Covid-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. ""We cannot rely on an expectation that the season or the temperature will be the answer to this,"" Mike Ryan, the head of the organisation's emergency programme, told reporters. ""Right now, we have no
data to suggest that the virus will behave more aggressively or
transmit more efficiently or not"" when the seasons change, he said. In the initial stages of the pandemic, some suggested that warmer weather might slow the spread of Covid-19. But this idea faded as the virus took hold during springtime in the northern hemisphere. Separately, Mr Ryan also said that a lack of personal protective equipment remained a major issue globally. ""Health systems in some countries are struggling and are under huge strain,"" he added. Chelsea are to donate their prize money for winning the Women's Super League to a charity that supports women and children experiencing domestic abuse. UK charities say there has been a huge spike in reports of domestic abuseduring the coronavirus lockdown. Chelsea Womenwere named champions on Friday, when final places in the curtailed 2019-20 WSL season were decided on a points-per-game basis. The Â£100,000 first prize will be given to Refuge.

Team manager Emma Hayes said the charity was ""close to the hearts and minds of the women's team"".

Here are some of the latest updates: Reality Check Earlier on Wednesday, Professor Chris Whitty â the chief medical officer for England  â was asked what his
biggest regret was in the handling of the pandemic He said he wished that testing
could have been speeded up âvery early onâ in the outbreak, and mentioned
Germany as an example. In the week ending 4 April, Germany
was using 132 laboratories to carrying out an average of
116,655 diagnostic tests for Covid-19 per day. The total number of tests done
by that date was over 1.3 million. The UK, by contrast, had carried
out a total of 316,836 tests by 10 April and didn't hit its target of
100,000 daily tests until the end of that month. Prince Joachim has already apologisedfor breaching Spain's quarantine rules when he travelled to the southern city of CÃ³rdoba last month. Now he will be up to â¬10,400 (Â£9,200; $11,800) out of pocket too. The 28-year-old prince, a nephew of King Philippe of Belgium, travelled to Spain last month for what the palace had described as an internship and a ""family event"". He later tested positive for Covid-19 and health officials had to get in touch with people he had been in contact with. According to local reports, the prince has been fined for failing to observe the necessary 14-day quarantine and attending two meetings or parties. If he pays up within 15 days, he only needs to pay half the fine.  Several members of the National Guard in Washington DC have tested positive for Covid-19 If you're just joining us, here are the latest coronavirus headlines from around the world:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The pandemic has, effectively,
become a game of risk management â thatâs because, as UK chief medical adviser Chris Witty says, nothing is ârisk freeâ. We could continue to suppress
the virus by not easing lockdown any further. That would further reduce the
spread of coronavirus â and no doubt save lives. But it would come at a huge cost
â economically, socially, to childrenâs education and also to peopleâs health, whether it is from mental or physical illness linked to continued strict curbs. So instead, the government and its advisers are treading a fine fine, and trying to navigate a way through this
(whether they are doing a good job or not is a different question). The aim is to keep the spread of the
virus low, while re-opening society. Whatever is done there will be
losers. After all, there is a new virus circulating, which for some is deadly. In the end it will come down to
both political judgements, in terms of how quickly restrictions continue to be
lifted, and also individual judgements in terms of how quickly we each embrace
the new freedoms. That, unfortunately, is the way life is in this pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

US President Donald Trump has said he will begin holding campaign rallies in at least four states after they were paused for three months due to the pandemic. He told reporters at the White House today that rallies would restart in Oklahoma, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. He added that the first one would probably take place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, next Friday. But he did not provide details on what precautions would be taken to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading at the events. Mr Trump will face Democrat Joe Biden in November.

As former hotspots like New York and New Jersey see declining infection rates, new coronavirus cases are climbing in 21 US states, as the country marches forward with its economic reopening. And nationwide, total Covid-19 infections are creeping towards the 2 million mark, with more than 112,500 deaths. Of these 21 states, 12 of them - including South Carolina, Texas and Utah - have reported increased hospitalisation rates since the Memorial Day holiday weekend last month. In Arizona, which has seen an especially pronounced spike in both Covid infections and hospitalisations, local health officials are starting to sound the alarm. Banner Health, the state's largest hospital system, warned this week that its intensive care units were filling up, and ventilator use was rising, while the state health director told Arizona hospitals to ""fully activate"" emergency plans. As of Wednesday, Arizona had confirmed 29,852 cases and 1,101 deaths.  Global coffee chain Starbucks says it expects revenue this quarter to have plummeted by more than $3bn (Â£2.3bn) because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company also projected an adjusted loss of about 55 to 70 cents per share for its third quarter ending in June. In further bad news it said its current-quarter operating income was expected to plunge by up to $2.2bn Like other cafe and restaurant chains, Starbucks had to close thousands of outlets around the world as part of coronavirus lockdowns or convert them to drive-through or take-away only. The company says it expects to permanently close about 400 stores
in the Americas over the next 18 months. The former US ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman, has announced he has tested positive for Covid-19.

He served in that role from 2005 to 2009, and most recently spent two years as ambassador to Russia under President Donald Trump. He also ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. On Tuesday, he said he had received the ""wrong results"" from an earlier test. ""Very illuminating to see the process firsthand,"" he wrote on Twitter. BBC OS Queues of people with virus symptoms have formed outside hospitals in Delhi Infections in India are rising. In the capital, Delhi, images have emerged of patients queuing outside hospitals, waiting to be treated for Covid-19. Dr Parv Mittal, who works in Delhi's Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, spoke to BBC Outside Source. ""It's really difficult to say how we will be able to cope,"" he said. ""I'm not sure if we have the beds. Even if you create the beds, there will be a shortage of manpower."" Delhi is seeing more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases every day, stretching hospital resources. Dr Mittal says his hospital initially struggled to get personal protective equipment (PPE).  Now it has enough but working in PPE is ""exhausting"", he says. ""Wearing it even for one hour, you start sweating a lot. You start getting dehydrated. Initially we had to work for six to eight hours non-stop. There's a persistent fear of contracting the infection."" Chester Zoo - home to these elephants - says the lockdown has threatened its survival Some zoos and safari parks in England are preparing to throw open their doors to visitors from Monday, bringing in some much-needed revenue. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced that the outdoor attractions can reopenat today's daily briefing. Dominic Jermey, head of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) which runs London and Whipsnade Zoos, said they were ""raring to go"". ""We expect to have tickets ready to book by Friday and everyone will need to book so we can manage capacity,"" he said. Last month London Zoo said it faced an ""uncertain future"" without immediate financial support. Jamie Christon from Chester Zoo in north-west England said a week ago they had been ""in despair"", not knowing when the zoo would reopen or if it would even survive. ""The zoo has suffered severe financial damage over the past three months and the road to recovery will be long and uncertain,"" he added. Some other zoos have said they are still putting in place social distancing and hygiene measures and won't be able to open until July. This lion at London Zoo was more interested in a nap...

"Hope for pangolins, as protection boosted in China","Wildlife crime is the greatest threat to the pangolin Conservation groups have welcomed China's move to remove pangolins from the official list of traditional Chinese medicine treatments, saying this could be a ""game changer"". The news, reported by China's Health Times newspaper, comes after China raised the animal's protected status to the highest level last week. Pangolins have been pushed to the brink by illegal hunting for scales and meat. They are implicated in coronavirus,but the evidence is unclear. Conservation charities have welcomed the move to remove them from the official list of traditional Chinese medicines. Paul Thomson of Save Pangolins said it was a breakthrough moment. ""China's move to phase out pangolin scales from traditional medicines could be the game changer we have been waiting for,"" he said. ""We hope China's next move will be to enforce the regulations and work to change consumer behaviour."" Hundreds of thousands of pangolins have been killed for their scales And Katheryn Wise of animal welfare campaign group, World Animal Protection, said it was ""great news"" that China had upgraded pangolins to the highest level of protection and removed them from the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. She called for this to be extended to all wild animals, ""who, like pangolins, are poached from the wild and often placed in squalid, cramped cages, creating a lethal hotbed of disease"". Pangolins are covered with a layer of scales, which are designed to protect them against predators. The scales are highly coveted by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, while pangolin meat is seen as a delicacy. Coronavirus: The race to find the source in wildlife Coronavirus: This is not the last pandemic Coronavirus: Putting the spotlight on the global wildlife trade China banned the consumption of live wild animals for food in the wake of the outbreak, but there are certain exemptions, such as for medicine or fur. Pangolins are in the spotlight as a possible animal host for coronavirus,but no direct link has been shown. There are eight species of pangolin across Asia and Africa Nicole Benjamin-Fink of Conservation Beyond Borders said that, whether pangolins served as the conduit for the coronavirus or not, it's time to halt the demand for the most trafficked mammals worldwide. ""Let's hope that this ban is the first in a series that ultimately ban all wildlife usage in traditional Chinese medicine,"" she said. Pangolins eat ants and other insects, and are often known as the scaly anteater. All eight species are protected under international law, but trade has been growing. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.
