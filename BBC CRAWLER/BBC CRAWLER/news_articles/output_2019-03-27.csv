May vows to quit if Brexit deal passed,"Theresa May has promised Tory MPs she will quit if they back her Brexit deal. She told backbench Tories: ""I am prepared to leave this job earlier than I intended in order to do what is right for our country and our party."" The PM said she knew that Tory MPs did not want her to lead the next phase of Brexit negotiations ""and I won't stand in the way of that"". But the DUP said it had not changed its position and would still vote against the deal. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the DUP's refusal to back the deal at this stage was a ""huge blow"" for Number 10. LIVE: MPs debate way forward on Brexit No majority for any of Brexit options Many Conservative Brexiteers - including the chairman of the European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg - had been waiting to see if the DUP's 10 MPs would back the deal before deciding whether to get behind it - and their decision makes it even more difficult for the deal to pass. In a statement released after the PM announced her offer to stand down, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the ""necessary changes"" she wanted to see to the backstop clause in the withdrawal agreement had still not been secured. She told the BBC the backstop threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom and her party would never ""sign up to something that would damage the Union"". This video can not be played Arlene Foster: ""Backstop makes it impossible for us to sign deal"" Justice Secretary David Gauke said he hoped Parliament would ""rally behind"" the PM's deal, and he thinks ""there is a mood in that direction"". But ERG deputy chairman Steve Baker said after Mrs May's statement that he was ""consumed with a ferocious rage after that pantomime"". Speaking at an ERG meeting, Mr Baker attacked those in the party whose ""addiction to power without responsibility"" had led them to confront MPs with a choice between the PM's deal and no Brexit and that he ""may yet resign the whip"" than ""be part of this"", sources said. Mrs May did not name a departure date at a packed meeting of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs. But if the deal is passed, she would resign as party leader after 22 May - the new Brexit date - but stay on as PM until a new leader is elected. Downing Street said it would be a ""different ball game"" if the deal was not passed by Parliament. It came as MPs seized control of the Commons agenda to hold a series votes on alternatives to the deal. None of the eight options won outright support. Sir Oliver Letwin, who secured the votes, said he wanted to hold more of them on Monday, but he said he hoped MPs would back Theresa May's deal before then. If the deal doesn't go through then it's not quite clear that Mrs May's offer to go still applies, although it is almost impossible, whether it stands or falls, that she would be able to stay. The prime minister hopes that by offering to leave Number 10, she'll take the country out of the EU with her, smoothly, without more political turmoil. And that order, of a sort, will be restored and the uncertainty for all of us will end. If that happens, we'll see a new leader in Downing Street by mid-July. But that is still a gamble. Read Laura's blog Mrs May told the 300 or so Tory MPs at the meeting ""we need to get the deal through and deliver Brexit"". ""I ask everyone in this room to back the deal so we can complete our historic duty - to deliver on the decision of the British people and leave the European Union with a smooth and orderly exit."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted that Mrs May's announcement ""shows once and for all that her chaotic Brexit negotiations have been about party management, not principles or the public interest"". He added: ""A change of government can't be a Tory stitch-up, the people must decide."" This video can not be played Nicky Morgan says some MPs were ""saying they weren't going vote for the agreement unless the PM indicated she was moving on."" George Freeman, the prime minister's former policy adviser, said she had done the ""right thing"" in announcing her decision to stand down, even though it had been a ""sad moment"". The Tory MP told BBC News her speech had been followed by a series of interventions from ""very hardline Brexiteers"" all saying ""prime minister, thank you, I will now vote for this deal"". The PM has said she wants to bring the deal back to the Commons this week, after it was previously rejected twice, by large margins. Commons Speaker John Bercow ruled last week that the government could not return for a third attempt, unless there had been ""substantial"" changes to the proposals. And he warned ministers earlier that they should ""not seek to circumvent my ruling"" by introducing procedures that could reverse his judgement. But a Downing Street spokesman said there had been a ""significant development"" at the summit in Brussels last week, after Mrs May agreed ""extra reassurances"" over the Irish backstop with the EU, and the date of exit had changed. A Tory leadership contest would start after the UK has left the EU under the terms of Mrs May's deal The timing of the contest would be up to the Conservative Party Theresa May would remain as prime minister until a new leader is elected by Tory members Candidates need to be nominated by two other MPs If there is only one candidate they become the new leader immediately If there is more than two candidates there would be a series of votes among MPs to whittle the field down to two It then goes to a vote of all Conservative Party members Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

Merchant ship 'hijacked by migrants' off Libya,"Last year, more than 60,000 migrants sailed to Europe Migrants have hijacked a merchant vessel that rescued them off Libya's coast, ordering the crew to head towards Malta, reports say. More than 100 migrants aboard the cargo ship are said to have acted after being told they would be taken back to Libya. Malta's military said the ship would not be allowed into its waters. Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini described the hijackers as ""pirates"". This comes as the EU says it is ending navy patrols in the Mediterranean. The EU says the decision to suspend Operation Sophia in September follows a request by Italy. The mission was put in place four years ago to deter people smugglers and rescue migrants trying to reach Europe by boat. Tens of thousands have been saved. Lately, the mission has largely targeted smuggling networks as the number of people making the crossing dropped sharply following a controversial deal between the EU and Libya. But Mr Salvini, the leader of the right-wing League party, has blamed Operation Sophia for continuing to bring rescued migrants to Italian shores. EU naval mission 'failed to end people smuggling' Mediterranean migrant crossings 'deadlier than ever' Sharp fall in illegal migration to EU The man behind Italy's migrant drop The Elhiblu cargo ship is believed to be carrying more than 100 migrants.  Its present location is unclear, as are the circumstances of the rescue off Libya. The Libyan coastguard has so far made no public comments on the reported hijacking. A spokesperson for the Maltese armed forces said attempts to contact the ship's captain had been unsuccessful, MaltaToday website reports. Maltese officials were monitoring the situation and were prepared for any eventuality, the spokesperson added. Meanwhile, Mr Salvini wrote on his Facebook page (in Italian): ""They are not shipwrecked but pirates, they will only see Italy through a telescope."" Italy migrant crisis: Government passes tough bill Salvini shuts ports to migrant rescue ship Mr Salvini has been at the centre of a number of international row over his refusal to allow migrant ships dock in Italian ports.

Man held over Grindr carjacking attacks,"The latest victim was stabbed repeatedly in his car on Bolton Road, Pendlebury A man has been arrested after three attempted robberies on users of the Grindr dating app. Three men were targeted in Salford and Bury by a man who demanded their car keys at knifepoint. In the most recent attack, a man in his 20s was stabbed several times by his ""date"" in his car in Pendlebury. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said a 21-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of robbery and section 18 assault and remained in custody. The latest victim had parked his car, with his ""date"" inside, in Bolton Road at about 17:45 GMT on Tuesday when the attacker demanded he hand over his car keys. He then stabbed him a number of times before running off towards Birch Drive and High Bank Road. The victim is in a serious condition in hospital. GMP believe the same man carried out two earlier attempted carjackings on Monday. A man in his 50s was threatened at his home in Irlam o' th' Height at 19:00 by an offender with a knife who demanded he hand over his car keys, but fled the scene when the vehicle failed to start. One hour later in Prestwich, a man in his 40s had a knife held to his throat on Bury Old Road by an attacker who demanded his car keys. The victim received cuts to his throat, back and forearm and was taken to hospital for treatment before he was later discharged. Ch Insp Amanda Delamore said: ""Our thoughts remain with the three victims who have all been left incredibly shaken by their ordeals and officers will continue to provide them with support at this distressing time."" 10 years of Grindr: A rocky relationship Greater Manchester Police Amazing new January sale price on this dual-drawer family air fryer Mayhem on roads as frozen pedestrian crossing buttons 'constantly' changing traffic lights to red Long traffic delays experienced due to adverse weather conditions Manchester Airport delayed and cancelled flights on Thursday, January 9 after snow closure Police's Operation AVRO day in Oldham sees criminals arrested and engagement with community Severe frosts then milder air creeping in later this weekend Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"Sturgeon: PM going could make Brexit worseThe PM's pledge to stand down if her Brexit deal is approved could make ""an already bad project even worse"", Nicola Sturgeon claims.Scotland politicsComments","Nicola Sturgeon believes the case for Scottish independence is stronger than ever Theresa May's pledge to stand down if her Brexit deal is approved risks making ""an already bad project even worse"", Nicola Sturgeon has claimed. Ms Sturgeon said it could see Scotland ""shackled to a disastrous Brexit driven by a Tory party lurching even further to the right"". She predicted that this would ""further reinforce"" the case for independence. Ms Sturgeon was speaking after Holyrood voted for Brexit to be cancelled if the UK faces leaving the EU without a deal. Later MPs at Westminster voted on a series of eight alternative Brexit options and rejected them all. No majority for any of Brexit options May vows to quit if Brexit deal passed Reaction as PM reveals her departure plan It led to SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford raising the prospect of an election amid what he described as a ""mess"" and a ""shambles"". ""Parliamentary democracy as we know it has broken down,"" he told the BBC. ""I would really appeal to people, appeal to parliamentarians, given where we are, we haven't been able to resolve this. I think the right thing to do is we need to come together and recognise we put this back to the people. ""If that doesn't happen then the only other option we've got is a general election.""

But Labour MP Ian Murray criticised the SNP for abstaining during a vote on whether there should be a customs union with the EU. The proposal would have passed if SNP MPs had voted for it. Mr Murray said: ""Nationalist MPs sat on their hands rather than deliver a parliamentary majority for a minimum of a permanent customs union to be written into law to protect the British economy and jobs - making a mockery of Nicola Sturgeon's pledge to support a 'common sense solution'. ""It's clear that the SNP cares more about constitutional chaos, indyref2 and grievance than finding a solution to Brexit, in the desperate hope of boosting support for the break-up of the UK."" Meanwhile, two SNP MPs - Angus MacNeil and Pete Wishart - abstained in a vote on whether there should be another EU referendum. The rest of the party's MPs voted in favour of the proposal. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called for a general election The prime minister told about 300 Conservative backbenchers on Wednesday afternoon that she was ""prepared to leave this job earlier than I intended in order to do what is right for our country and our party"". She said she knew that Conservative MPs did not want her to lead the next phase of Brexit negotiations ""and I won't stand in the way of that"" - but did not name a departure date. The PM wants to bring her deal back to the Commons this week. It has been rejected twice before by large margins. Commons Speaker John Bercow ruled last week that the government could not return for a third attempt, unless there had been ""substantial"" changes to the proposals. In a statement released after the prime minister's announcement, Ms Sturgeon said it did not change the fact that Mrs May's EU withdrawal deal was a ""profoundly bad one"". The first minister added: ""If Brexit ends up being forced through on the basis of a deal that no one supports - indeed a deal so bad that the PM has to promise to resign to get it through - it will make an already bad project even worse. ""For Scotland, this raises the prospect of being shackled to a disastrous Brexit driven by a Tory party lurching even further to the right, with a Brexiteer PM in charge - further reinforcing the case for our country taking its future into its own hands."" Mrs May's cabinet colleague, the Scottish Secretary David Mundell, paid tribute to the prime minster. ""She's determined to deliver our exit from the EU, an orderly exit on the basis of an agreement,"" he said. ""But she recognises that new leadership is required to take forward the next stage of the process."" Theresa May hopes pledging to stand down will increase the chances of MPs backing her Brexit deal Earlier, the Scottish Parliament voted by 89 to 28 for a motion calling for Article 50 to be revoked as a last resort, if it is the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit. The motion was originally lodged by the Greens and was backed by the SNP and Labour, who both added their own amendments to it. The result was largely symbolic, but increased the pressure on the UK government. Mrs May has previously ruled out revoking Article 50, which she said would be a ""failure of democracy"". More than five million people across the UK havesigned a petition calling for Brexit to be cancelled, with an estimated million protesters marching through London on Sunday to call for another referendum - a so-called People's Vote. Opinion polls have suggested that a narrow majority of people are now in favour of remaining in the EU,according to analysis by polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice. Patrick Harvie said people across the UK were now ""waking up to the crisis before us"" The original Green motion at Holyrood said that Article 50 should be revoked ""immediately"" if the process is not extended long enough for a new referendum to be held. However, this was amended by Labour to instead say Brexit should be cancelled if the UK is ""faced with a choice of no deal or revoke"". The SNP also added its own amendment calling on the UK government to ""stop ignoring the views of this parliament and the overwhelming majority of people in Scotland"". Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie said the Scottish Parliament had ""repeatedly sought compromise"" over Brexit, but claimed the prime minister had ""failed to listen at every stage"". Using Brexit to make the case for independence Reality Check: Can the UK cancel Brexit? Has Brexit broken Team Ruth? He added: ""The UK government is in shambles. The prime minister must seek a longer extension in order to put the question back to the people. If she is unwilling to countenance this, the only option remaining is to revoke Article 50 unilaterally."" A cross party group of politicians including Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer won a case in the European Court last year which ruled that the UK could unilaterally withdraw its Article 50 notification at any time prior to its exit from the EU. Meanwhile, an SNP MEP has urged the EU to ""leave the light on for Scotland"" as he made what could be his last ever speech in the European Parliament. Alyn Smith insisted that Scotland was a ""European nation"" - and added that independence would offer the country a ""route back"". What are indicative votes? A guide to MPs' alternative Brexit plans Downing Street said last week that Mrs May ""has said many times she will not countenance revoking Article 50"", and that she has ""long been clear that failing to deliver on the referendum result would be a failure of democracy and a failure she wouldn't countenance"".

Apology for Hispanic judge told to 'speak English',"Lina Hidalgo (centre) is the top official in a county with 43% of residents identifying as Hispanic or Latino A Texas county commissioner has apologised for criticising a local judge who spoke in Spanish during a news conference. Commissioner Mark Tice faced a swift backlash for saying Judge Lina Hidalgo was a ""joke"" for not speaking English when answering questions. Judge Hidalgo had in fact been speaking and translating between both languages. On Tuesday, Mr Tice said he ""regretted"" his words, and apologised to the judge and Hispanic community. Judge Hidalgo is an elected official in Harris County - home to the city of Houston - where 43% of the 4.6 million residents are Hispanic or Latino, according to US Census Bureau data. She is the first Latina and first woman to be elected as the county's top official, US media reported. Why Spanish speakers in US are under fire US couple detained while speaking Spanish What is the future of English in the US? The judge had been relaying updates about a chemical fire cleanup that was broadcast live on Facebook, answering reporter's questions in Spanish and English. At one point during the livestream, when the judge was speaking in Spanish, Mr Tice commented: ""She is a joke. English this is not Mexico."" He later reiterated the sentiment tothe Houston Chronicle,external. ""It's real simple,"" he said. ""This is the United States. Speak English."" Mark Tice is the commissioner of the county neighbouring Judge Hidalgo Following the widespread condemnation of his remarks, Mr Tice clarified and apologised for his emotional response, saying he thought there had been no English translation given to the Spanish questions. ""If that is not the case, then I sincerely apologise,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""I recognise how my response could have been interpreted in a derogatory manner and for that I am sorry.""

Judge Hidalgo's director of communications, Kiran Khalid, told the Chronicle the judge ""represents all of Harris County and given the county's composition and her bilingual skills, she will continue to communicate as broadly as possible especially when public safety is at stake"". The incident is one of many cases of Spanish speakers being challenged for not using English in America.

Mayor: Jussie Smollett 'abused' Chicago,"Chicago's mayor Rahm Emanuel says the sudden move to drop charges against actor Jussie Smollett over a hoax attack has made a fool of the city. The state's attorney's office maintains Mr Smollett has not been exonerated, while Mr Smollett's lawyers say his record has been wiped clean. ""They better get their stories straight because this is actually making a fool of all of us,"" the mayor told ABC News. Police maintain Mr Smollett staged a racist and homophobic attack. Mr Smollett has insisted throughout that he is innocent of all these allegations. Speaking on Good Morning America on Wednesday, Mr Emanuel pilloried the Empire actor, saying he ""abused the city of Chicago"".

Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats made the decision to drop charges against the TV actor on Tuesday in a move that blindsided police - but he maintains that Mr Smollett is guilty. ""Our priority is violent crimes and the drivers of violence,"" Mr Magatstold CBS News,external. ""Jussie Smollett is neither one of those.""

Kimberly Foxx, the top Cook County prosecutor, had recused herself from the Smollett case State's Attorney Ms Foxx recused herself from the Smollett case last month, citing a conflict of interest ""based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case"". According to local media, attorney Tina Tchen, former chief of staff to First Lady Michelle Obama, connected Ms Foxx with Mr Smollett's family in the days following the alleged attack. The Chicago Sun-Times,externalreported earlier this month that Ms Tchen had texted Ms Foxx on 1 February that the actor's family had ""concerns about the investigation"". Ms Foxx later told the Sun-Times that those worries were regarding leaked information about the case from ""police sources"", and that the family felt the FBI would keep a ""tighter lid on the information"". Days after the attack, Ms Foxx said she discussed transferring the case to the FBI with Supt Johnson, who she said seemed open to the idea. She then contacted Ms Tchen and Mr Smollett's relative to inform them about her call with the superintendent, according to records viewed by the newspaper. ""Spoke to the Superintendent Johnson,"" she wrote to Ms Tchen in an email. ""I convinced him to reach out to FBI to ask that they take over the investigation.

UK buys Â£12m New York apartment for diplomat,"The UK government has spent $15.9m (Â£12m) on a luxury New York apartment for a British diplomat to live in while he negotiates trade deals with the US. It will house the UK trade commissioner for North America and consul general in New York, Antony Phillipson. Boasting panoramic views, the seven-bedroom flat occupies the entire 38th-floor of 50 United Nations Plaza, saidthe Guardian,external, which first reported it. The Foreign Office said it had ""secured the best possible deal"". The apartment ""will help promote the UK in the commercial capital of our largest export market for years to come"", it said. What trade deals has the UK done so far? A floor plan of the 5,893 sq ft apartment shows a library, six bathrooms and a powder room. Two of the five bedrooms in the apartment are currently designated ""staff bedrooms"" on the floor plan, but the UK Foreign Office said only the consul general and his immediate family will live there. Designed by British architect Norman Foster, the 44-storey building is close to the UN headquarters in Manhattan and isdescribed as the ""ultimate global address"",external. On the website of architects Foster and Partners, the high-rise is described as a ""luxury residential tower occupying a prestigious location"". Every apartment features floor to ceiling bay windows and ""generous space for entertaining"", the firm says. ""Adding a touch of elegance to every detail, the powder room walls are fitted with glazed silk panels in a choice of either bold primary or natural colours,"" it adds. A spa in the basement has a large exercise pool for residents, according to the website. The penthouse was bought by ""Her Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs"" on 15 March, according to New York City records. In a statement, the Foreign Office, said that the residence ""will also be used to support his work to help British businesses as Her Majesty's trade commissioner for North America."" It said it was in the process of selling the consul general's current residence. ""At least someone is going to do OK out of Brexit,""Labour MP Gareth Thomas tweeted, in response to the purchase,external. Stewart Maxwell, a special adviser to Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon on business and the economy,tweeted,external: ""UK Tory government make clear that austerity isn't for everybody"". Deal to preserve UK-US trade post-Brexit Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? Chloe Westley, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, which lobbies for lower taxes and greater government efficiency, said: ""What's often forgotten is that these luxuries come at the expense of hard pressed families, who want the money that they give to the government to go primarily towards public services."" She added that taxpayers would hope diplomats ""earn their keep by creating opportunities for British businesses and consumers"". In 2015, the New Zealand government was criticised overreports,externalit spent $8m (Â£6.05m) on a ""lavish"" 18th-floor apartment in the 50 United Nations Plaza for the country's UN ambassador Gerard van Bohemen to live in. Meanwhile, Qatarreportedly,externalspent $45m (Â£34m) on four apartments in the high-rise in the same year. The building was also home to Nikki Haley while she served as the US ambassador to the UN.

"'Take over pharma' to make new antibioticsBits of the industry could be taken over as no new drugs are being made, says Lord Jim O'Neill.Health","Part of the drugs industry should be taken over to make new antibiotics, an influential economist has argued. Lord Jim O'Neill, who advised the government on antibiotic resistance, said he was shocked by pharmaceutical companies failing to tackle drug-resistant infections. He said the solution may be to ""just take it away from them and take it over"". The pharmaceutical industry said it was not standing still on the issue. Bacteria evolving resistance to antibiotics threatens to take medicine back to the dark ages. Some infections could become untreatable and losing the drugs would make surgery and cancer therapy far more risky. It is known as the antibiotic apocalypse. Global antibiotics 'revolution' needed Analysis: Antibiotic apocalypse Part of the solution is developing new drugs, however, there has not been a new class of antibiotic since the 1980s. The problem is there is simply no money in it - any new drug would need to be cheap and used rarely to minimise the risk of resistance. Projections of deaths from drug-resistant infections by 2050 Three years ago, Lord O'Neill proposed solutionsin his Review on Antimicrobial Resistance,,externalincluding giving pharmaceutical companies around a billion dollars for each novel antibiotic they developed. Lord O'Neill said that since then there had been empty words from global policy makers and that he was coming round to the idea of, in effect, nationalising part of the pharmaceutical industry. He told the BBC: ""If you had asked me three years ago, I would have thought that would have been a bit crazy. ""But nearly three years after our review came out, there's endless talk but there's no progress in waking up the pharmaceutical industry to want to do this. ""So, by default, I find my mind thinking why not explore the idea of some public utility that's got public-purpose ownership of it, just take it away from them and take it over."" He said that companies ditching antibiotic research would be an opportunity for a new public body to acquire those assets. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) said it was ""hardly standing still"" in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Dr Sheuli Porkess, the deputy chief scientific officer at the ABPI, said: ""Nationalising antibiotic development simply won't get us the antibiotics we need. ""In 2016 the private sector invested around $2bn in research and development of new antibiotics, roughly four times as much as all government and foundations combined."" The ABPI said it had been working closely with government for the past two years and companies were ""ready and waiting"" to test a new model for supporting antibiotic. ""We shouldn't write off this plan before we've tried it,"" Dr Porkess said. However, there is wide agreement that developing new drugs will only ever be part of the antimicrobial resistance solution. The practice ofhanding antibiotics out like sweetswill continue to fuel the rise of drug-resistant infections.

Apology for Hispanic judge told to 'speak English'A Texas official criticised a county judge for answering questions in Spanish during a news conference.US & Canada,"Lina Hidalgo (centre) is the top official in a county with 43% of residents identifying as Hispanic or Latino A Texas county commissioner has apologised for criticising a local judge who spoke in Spanish during a news conference. Commissioner Mark Tice faced a swift backlash for saying Judge Lina Hidalgo was a ""joke"" for not speaking English when answering questions. Judge Hidalgo had in fact been speaking and translating between both languages. On Tuesday, Mr Tice said he ""regretted"" his words, and apologised to the judge and Hispanic community. Judge Hidalgo is an elected official in Harris County - home to the city of Houston - where 43% of the 4.6 million residents are Hispanic or Latino, according to US Census Bureau data. She is the first Latina and first woman to be elected as the county's top official, US media reported. Why Spanish speakers in US are under fire US couple detained while speaking Spanish What is the future of English in the US? The judge had been relaying updates about a chemical fire cleanup that was broadcast live on Facebook, answering reporter's questions in Spanish and English. At one point during the livestream, when the judge was speaking in Spanish, Mr Tice commented: ""She is a joke. English this is not Mexico."" He later reiterated the sentiment tothe Houston Chronicle,external. ""It's real simple,"" he said. ""This is the United States. Speak English."" Mark Tice is the commissioner of the county neighbouring Judge Hidalgo Following the widespread condemnation of his remarks, Mr Tice clarified and apologised for his emotional response, saying he thought there had been no English translation given to the Spanish questions. ""If that is not the case, then I sincerely apologise,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""I recognise how my response could have been interpreted in a derogatory manner and for that I am sorry.""

The incident is one of many cases of Spanish speakers being challenged for not using English in America.

Blogger 'distressed' by homophobia claim,"Mr Campbell is seeking Â£25,000 in damages from Ms Dugdale A blogger who has taken Labour MSP Kezia Dugdale to court remains ""deeply distressed"" by her claim that he sent a ""homophobic"" tweet, a court has heard. His lawyer said it was both ""untrue and unfair"" to describe Wings Over Scotland blogger Stuart Campbell as a homophobe. But Ms Dugdale's QC said the pro-independence blogger was happy to fire ""poisoned arrows at anyone he chooses"". He said Mr Campbell should therefore ""not complain when an arrow is fired back"". And he added that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Secretary David Mundell, Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie and Stonewall Scotland director Colin Macfarlane were among those to have agreed with Ms Dugdale's view that Mr Campbell's tweet was homophobic. Dugdale stands by 'homophobic' tweet claim Kezia Dugdale's homophobia claim 'absurd' The lawyer also said there was a ""plain irony"" in Mr Campbell suing someone else for defamation, given the caustic nature of his blog and tweets. The exchanges came as both sides summed up their positions on the third and final day of the civil proof at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. Sheriff Nigel Ross, who has been hearing the case, said he hoped to deliver his ruling within the next four weeks. Ms Dugdale insists that her newspaper article was fair comment on Mr Campbell's tweet Mr Campbell is suing former Scottish Labour leader Ms Dugdale for defamation over a column she wrote in the Daily Record on March 2017 which referenced his ""homophobic tweets"" and accused him of spouting ""hatred and homophobia towards others"" from his Twitter account. The tweet at the centre of the action was posted by Mr Campbell during the Conservative Party conference and said that Conservative MSP Oliver Mundell ""is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner."" Mr Campbell, from Bath in Somerset, has denied that it was a homophobic reference to David Mundell being gay, and has insisted it was ""satirical criticism"" of Oliver Mundell's public speaking skills. The blogger's QC, Craig Sandison, opened by telling the court that Mr Campbell ""is not a homophobe"", and was seeking to protect his reputation as someone who has consistently supported the equal treatment of homosexual people. He said being accused of homophobia would put a ""stain"" on a person's character and lower them in society's eyes. The tweet at the centre of the case referenced David Mundell's sexuality Mr Sandison told the court that his client ""continues to be deeply distressed by that allegation and by the insistance by the defender on its truth"". He acknowledged that Mr Campbell, who is seeking Â£25,000 in damages, ""is not a polite man, he doesn't restrain himself in setting forth his views. He is not circumspect."" But he argued: ""None of those are aspects of his character he is seeking to protect by this action. ""What he is seeking to protect is his distinct reputation as someone who has consistently supported equal treatment of homosexual people and indeed people generally. ""That's why he is so upset, because this attack on him is so untrue, so unfair."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Sandison said that if anyone was ""abused"" by the tweet it was Oliver Mundell, based on his public speaking. He said: ""That statement about Oliver Mundell wasn't based on his sexuality, it's nothing to do with his sexuality. Was David Mundell then abused because of his sexuality? I say absolutely not."" He added that Ms Dugdale's comment was ""not fairly made"" and claimed it was motivated in part by her ""ill feeling"" towards the blogger because of articles he had written about her. On Tuesday, Ms Dugdale told the court that she had a responsibility as a gay politician to ""call out"" homophobia, and that it remained her ""honest view"" that the tweet was homophobic. Her lawyer, Roddy Dunlop QC, described the Lothian MSP as ""entirely credible and reliable"" and said the true question in the case was whether someone was entitled to view the tweet as homophobic. He said: ""The pursuer (Mr Campbell) quite clearly does not like the defender. He has been extremely rude about her on multiple occasions and on the one occasion she calls him out, he sues her. ""When he publicly tweets about two public figures, he is exposing himself to public comment and he has to thole that. There is a plain irony in the pursuer, a master of calumny, suing for defamation in this particular context. ""This is someone who has entered the political arena of his own volition, armed with a quiver of poisoned arrows which he will fire at anyone he chooses. He should not complain when an arrow is fired back.""

"'Take over pharma' to make new antibioticsBits of the industry could be taken over as no new drugs are being made, says Lord Jim O'Neill.","Part of the drugs industry should be taken over to make new antibiotics, an influential economist has argued. Lord Jim O'Neill, who advised the government on antibiotic resistance, said he was shocked by pharmaceutical companies failing to tackle drug-resistant infections. He said the solution may be to ""just take it away from them and take it over"". The pharmaceutical industry said it was not standing still on the issue. Bacteria evolving resistance to antibiotics threatens to take medicine back to the dark ages. Some infections could become untreatable and losing the drugs would make surgery and cancer therapy far more risky. It is known as the antibiotic apocalypse. Global antibiotics 'revolution' needed Analysis: Antibiotic apocalypse Part of the solution is developing new drugs, however, there has not been a new class of antibiotic since the 1980s. The problem is there is simply no money in it - any new drug would need to be cheap and used rarely to minimise the risk of resistance. Projections of deaths from drug-resistant infections by 2050 Three years ago, Lord O'Neill proposed solutionsin his Review on Antimicrobial Resistance,,externalincluding giving pharmaceutical companies around a billion dollars for each novel antibiotic they developed. Lord O'Neill said that since then there had been empty words from global policy makers and that he was coming round to the idea of, in effect, nationalising part of the pharmaceutical industry. He told the BBC: ""If you had asked me three years ago, I would have thought that would have been a bit crazy. ""But nearly three years after our review came out, there's endless talk but there's no progress in waking up the pharmaceutical industry to want to do this. ""So, by default, I find my mind thinking why not explore the idea of some public utility that's got public-purpose ownership of it, just take it away from them and take it over."" He said that companies ditching antibiotic research would be an opportunity for a new public body to acquire those assets. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) said it was ""hardly standing still"" in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Dr Sheuli Porkess, the deputy chief scientific officer at the ABPI, said: ""Nationalising antibiotic development simply won't get us the antibiotics we need. ""In 2016 the private sector invested around $2bn in research and development of new antibiotics, roughly four times as much as all government and foundations combined."" The ABPI said it had been working closely with government for the past two years and companies were ""ready and waiting"" to test a new model for supporting antibiotic. ""We shouldn't write off this plan before we've tried it,"" Dr Porkess said. However, there is wide agreement that developing new drugs will only ever be part of the antimicrobial resistance solution. The practice ofhanding antibiotics out like sweetswill continue to fuel the rise of drug-resistant infections.

May vows to quit if Brexit deal passedTheresa May tells Tory MPs a new leader will take on the next phase of Brexit negotiations.UK Politics,"Theresa May has promised Tory MPs she will quit if they back her Brexit deal. She told backbench Tories: ""I am prepared to leave this job earlier than I intended in order to do what is right for our country and our party."" The PM said she knew that Tory MPs did not want her to lead the next phase of Brexit negotiations ""and I won't stand in the way of that"". But the DUP said it had not changed its position and would still vote against the deal. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the DUP's refusal to back the deal at this stage was a ""huge blow"" for Number 10. LIVE: MPs debate way forward on Brexit No majority for any of Brexit options Many Conservative Brexiteers - including the chairman of the European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg - had been waiting to see if the DUP's 10 MPs would back the deal before deciding whether to get behind it - and their decision makes it even more difficult for the deal to pass. In a statement released after the PM announced her offer to stand down, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the ""necessary changes"" she wanted to see to the backstop clause in the withdrawal agreement had still not been secured. She told the BBC the backstop threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom and her party would never ""sign up to something that would damage the Union"". This video can not be played Arlene Foster: ""Backstop makes it impossible for us to sign deal"" Justice Secretary David Gauke said he hoped Parliament would ""rally behind"" the PM's deal, and he thinks ""there is a mood in that direction"". But ERG deputy chairman Steve Baker said after Mrs May's statement that he was ""consumed with a ferocious rage after that pantomime"". Speaking at an ERG meeting, Mr Baker attacked those in the party whose ""addiction to power without responsibility"" had led them to confront MPs with a choice between the PM's deal and no Brexit and that he ""may yet resign the whip"" than ""be part of this"", sources said. Mrs May did not name a departure date at a packed meeting of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs. But if the deal is passed, she would resign as party leader after 22 May - the new Brexit date - but stay on as PM until a new leader is elected. Downing Street said it would be a ""different ball game"" if the deal was not passed by Parliament. It came as MPs seized control of the Commons agenda to hold a series votes on alternatives to the deal. None of the eight options won outright support. Sir Oliver Letwin, who secured the votes, said he wanted to hold more of them on Monday, but he said he hoped MPs would back Theresa May's deal before then. If the deal doesn't go through then it's not quite clear that Mrs May's offer to go still applies, although it is almost impossible, whether it stands or falls, that she would be able to stay. The prime minister hopes that by offering to leave Number 10, she'll take the country out of the EU with her, smoothly, without more political turmoil. And that order, of a sort, will be restored and the uncertainty for all of us will end. If that happens, we'll see a new leader in Downing Street by mid-July. But that is still a gamble.

Kuenssberg: May plays final card,"Theresa May has always had a difficult hand to play, and she has just used up the last card, offering MPs a final bargain: ""Back my deal, and I'll quit."" In the big picture of Brexit it was always an option that in the end, the prime minister might offer up her own position as leverage for support in return. But big political moments are still a surprise when they come. Before the announcement, one of her senior colleagues told me he didn't know what she was going to do - she was tucked away somewhere in the House of Commons with her chief of staff working out her options. Another minister said they had ""no idea"". May vows to quit if Brexit deal passed A senior Brexiteer, who is resolved to oppose her deal told me, frustratedly, they thought that the PM wouldn't say anything new, it would just be more vague assurances. Remember, of course, Theresa May has only survived this far because she promised to quit before the next scheduled general election. But just before 5pm this afternoon, the Commons chamber emptied of Conservative MPs, who made the short journey up the stone stairs to Committee Room 14, to pack in to hear what she had to say, as she spoke from a prepared text. The hope in Number 10 is that her offer to depart will entice dozens of Tory backbenchers to back her deal, which ministers want to bring back to Parliament in the next 48 hours. The deal has been kicked out of the Commons twice, resoundingly, and her departure doesn't change a word of it. Boris Johnson says he will now back the PM's deal So if it shifts votes, that might sound nuts - if the Brexiteers hate the deal, surely, they still hate the deal? True to a point, but politics is a strange business, with rivalries and ambition part of many MPs' calculations. And remember too that the controversy over the prime minister's deal has mainly centred on the first phase of Brexit, the ""divorce deal"". The political declaration - the route map for the phase that will settle the longer-term relationship between the EU and the UK - is important, but extremely vague. So for many Tory MPs, a reassurance that it won't be Theresa May who leads that next phase is important. The signs already are that many MPs will switch from opposing to backing the PM's deal. Brexiteers are meeting now to discuss the strategy they want to take. Some big names, like Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg, are now coming into line for the deal. But the resistance could still be fierce - and even this sacrifice from Theresa May might not be enough. The scale of dislike for the deal was greater than Number 10 had foreseen when it was struck. That means the scale of the political move required is enormous too. But will Speaker Bercow allow the vote to take place? And we still don't know if the Speaker, John Bercow, will even allow the vote to take place. If the deal doesn't go through then it's not quite clear that Mrs May's offer to go still applies, although it is almost impossible, whether it stands or falls, that she would be able to stay. The prime minister hopes that by offering to leave Number 10, she'll take the country out of the EU with her, smoothly, without more political turmoil. And that order, of a sort, will be restored and the uncertainty for all of us will end. If that happens, we'll see a new leader in Downing Street by mid-July. But that is still a gamble. What we do know now is that Theresa May has become the latest in a line of Tory prime ministers whose time in office has been consumed by anguish over Europe and ultimately, brought to an early end.

"Results awaited of votes on Brexit optionsAlternatives to PM's deal, including a no-deal exit and a referendum, are being tested in the Commons.UK PoliticsComments","MPs had half an hour to fill out the ballot paper MPs are awaiting the results of votes on eight different proposals for the future of Brexit. Options they are considering include leaving without a deal, a customs union and a confirmatory referendum. Speaker John Bercow will announce what support there is for each later after MPs took over the Commons timetable. Theresa May has promised to stand down as prime minister if her own deal is approved, prompting several Tory Brexiteers to say they will back it. Meanwhile, MPs have approved the legislation required to change the date of Brexit from 29 March - after the EU agreed to give the UK an extension last week. Friday had long been the day written into law for the UK to leave the EU but the Commons approved a statutory instrument - by 441 votes to 105 - changing the deadline to 22 May if a withdrawal agreement is passed this week; or 12 April if it is not. The prime minister is still trying to drum up support for her withdrawal agreement despite it being voted down by a large margin twice and the DUP saying they still cannot vote for it. The government is seeking the support of MPs for the Commons to convene on Friday, if necessary, amid reports a third vote on the PM's deal could be held then. Live: MPs debate way forward for Brexit What are indicative votes? How the indicative vote process will work Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict But Mr Bercow reiterated his earlier warnings that the PM's deal could not come back for a vote if it had not significantly changed.

MPs are currently voting on a statutory instrument to confirm a delay, after the UK was given until 12 April to propose a different way forward if the current agreement cannot get through Parliament and until 22 May to finalise Brexit if the deal is passed. Earlier on Wednesday, MPs took control of parliamentary business from the government for several hours as they attempt to find a majority for the next steps in the Brexit process. Conservative backbencher Sir Oliver Letwin, whose cross-party proposal ushered in today's debate, said the only way leaving the EU with no-deal can be prevented is by crystallising an alternative majority and trying to carry it forward. He said that if MPs supported the prime minister's deal in another meaningful vote this would be ""the easy route"". But he added that he ""profoundly hopes"" that if on Monday there is a majority view in favour of a particular position, that the government will say that it will carry that forward. By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondent Never afraid of stoking controversy, the Speaker has again infuriated many Tory MPs with his latest surprise pronouncement to the Commons. Just as it seemed the government was poised to try and get its Brexit deal through again, John Bercow took it upon himself to tick ministers off before they had even tried. Why? Because last week he ruled the deal could not be brought back to the Commons for a third time without ""substantial"" changes. No 10 will only bring the deal back for a third vote if it thinks it could pass. That probably requires DUP backing and a guarantee some Labour MPs will vote for it too.

MPs voting on Brexit options,"MPs had half an hour to fill out the ballot paper MPs are awaiting the results of votes on eight different proposals for the future of Brexit. Options they are considering include leaving without a deal, a customs union and a confirmatory referendum. Speaker John Bercow will announce what support there is for each later after MPs took over the Commons timetable. Theresa May has promised to stand down as prime minister if her own deal is approved, prompting several Tory Brexiteers to say they will back it. Meanwhile, MPs have approved the legislation required to change the date of Brexit from 29 March - after the EU agreed to give the UK an extension last week. Friday had long been the day written into law for the UK to leave the EU but the Commons approved a statutory instrument - by 441 votes to 105 - changing the deadline to 22 May if a withdrawal agreement is passed this week; or 12 April if it is not. The prime minister is still trying to drum up support for her withdrawal agreement despite it being voted down by a large margin twice and the DUP saying they still cannot vote for it. The government is seeking the support of MPs for the Commons to convene on Friday, if necessary, amid reports a third vote on the PM's deal could be held then. Live: MPs debate way forward for Brexit What are indicative votes? How the indicative vote process will work Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict But Mr Bercow reiterated his earlier warnings that the PM's deal could not come back for a vote if it had not significantly changed. He said the government ""should not seek to circumvent my ruling"" by introducing procedures that could reverse his judgement. This video can not be played John Bercow: ""I do expect the government to meet the test of change."" But a Downing Street spokesman said there had been a ""significant development"" at the summit in Brussels last week, after Mrs May agreed ""extra reassurances"" over the Irish backstop with the EU, and the date of exit had changed.

"Cardi B: Why I drugged and robbed menThe rapper says ""I did what I had to do to survive"" while working as a stripper before finding fame.","In January, she became the first solo woman to win the Grammy Award for best rap album Cardi B has defended herself after a video resurfaced of her saying she drugged and robbed men who wanted to have sex with her while she worked as a stripper before finding fame. The rapper faced criticism after the three-year-old Instagram live video recirculated on social media. ""Whether or not they were poor choices at the time, I did what I had to do to survive,""she wrote on Tuesday,external. ""I never claimed to be perfect or come from a perfect world."" The original video was made as her career was starting to take off and was her response to someone who said she didn't deserve success because she hadn't put in any work. ""Nothing was handed to me. Nothing,"" she said in the video, before going on to reveal that she would invite men to a hotel before drugging and robbing them. In response to the furore, she wrote on Instagram that she had been talking ""about things in my past right or wrong that I felt I needed to do to make a living"". She added: ""I'm a part of a hip-hop culture where you can talk about where you come from, talk about the wrong things you had to do to get where you are."" The Grammy-winner also pointed out that there are rappers who ""glorify murder, violence, drugs and robbing"". She wrote: ""I never glorified the things I brought up in that live [video], I never even put those things in my music because I'm not proud of it and feel a responsibility not to glorify it. ""I made the choices that I did at the time because I had very limited options."" Cardi B ended the statement by explaining the men she referred to in the old video were men she dated or was involved with, and were ""conscious, willing and aware"". Earlier in the week, the hashtag #SurvivingCardiB was trending - a reference to Surviving R Kelly, the documentary that highlightedthe years of sexual allegationsagainst the star. Some users compared the rapper to disgraced comedianBill Cosby, who was sentenced to jail in 2018 after being accused of drugging and assaulting women. Allow Twitter content?

What Brexit options are MPs voting on?Bercow's intervention versus May's dealVideoVideoBercow warns PM not to 'circumvent' his rulingBrexit: What could happen next?Brexit jargon explained,"Parliament remains deadlocked after MPs once againrejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement. But could a series of votes on different Brexit options offer a way forward? A process, known as indicative votes,has already tried to find a consensus - but it failed to find a majority for any one outcome. No. A second round of indicative votes is expected on Monday. The process is likely to be very similar to last time,according to the order paper,external. MPs will be able to submit their options to the Speaker, John Bercow. He will then select which options are debated and eventually voted on. Last time, eight options were selected. But on this occasion Mr Bercow could decide to select fewer - for example only the three options that commanded the most support on Wednesday. Or, he could choose more. The voting system - where MPs select yes or no on each option - is expected to remain the same. Here is a reminder of what the options were and how MPs voted on them, in the first round. Proposer: Dame Margaret Beckett, Labour Result: 268 for, 295 against This option would require the public to agree to any Brexit deal, through a ""confirmatory referendum"". But it would be up to MPs to decide what the question on the ballot would be - and that could lead to renewed deadlock. For example, should there be two or more options to choose from? How could another referendum work? Proposer: Ken Clarke, Conservative Result: 265 for, 271 against Under this option, MPs could pledge to support Mrs May's Brexit deal (known asthe withdrawal agreement) in exchange for a commitment for the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU. A customs union is a trade agreement under which two or more countries do not put tariffs (taxes on imports) on goods coming in from other countries in the union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. This arrangement would give the UK a closer trading relationship with the EU and reduce the need for some (but not all) checks at the Irish border. It would go some way towards removing the need for the backstop - the insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border (eg border posts) in Ireland. But being part of a permanent customs union with the EU would stop the UK striking its own independent trade deals with other countries (such as the United States). Mrs May has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union as one of her ""red lines"". Proposer: Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Result: 237 for, 307 against Labour's position is to remain in a customs unionin addition to having a ""close alignment"" with the EU single market. While being in a customs union prevents the UK from negotiating its own trade deals, Labour says it wants the UK to be to have ""a say"" in future EU trade talks. But EU law does not currently allow non-EU members to have a formal say or veto in its trade talks. However, Labour says the EU has shown flexibility in the past and its proposal cannot be ruled out until the party has had a chance to negotiate formally. What is Labour's custom union policy? Proposer: Nick Boles, Conservative Result: 189 for, 283 against This option would involve the UK joining Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as part of theEuropean Free Trade Association (Efta),external. It would mean remaining in the single market, which would ensure the free flow of goods to and from the EU - avoiding friction at the borders. But the UK would have to retain freedom of movement (the right of EU citizens to live and work in the UK and vice-versa) - although some restrictions  could apply. The UK would also need pay into the EU budget and follow many of the EU's rules and regulations. Under the plan, the UK would also remain in a customs union until an alternative plan to a avoid a hard border in Ireland was found. This option is referred to as the Common Market 2.0 or the Norway plus plan. What is Common Market 2.0? Proposer: Joanna Cherry, SNP Result: 184 for, 293 against This would mean cancelling Brexit altogether. Article 50 is the two-year process which triggered the UK's departure from the EU. The original deadline of 29 March has now been extended for at least a couple of weeks. Last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could revoke Article 50 itself, without having to ask the other 27 EU countries for permission. By revoking Article 50, the UK would bring a halt to the entire Brexit process. It would therefore remain a member of the EU on the same terms, including keeping its budget rebate. Can the UK revoke Article 50? Proposer: John Baron, Conservative Result: 160 for, 400 against No deal is the legal default outcome in the absence of agreeing a deal or revoking Article 50. So if the political deadlock cannot be resolved, a no-deal Brexit could still be the final outcome. If the UK did leave the EU with no deal, it would mean initially trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. The Ministry of Defence says 3,500 troops will be available to be deployed in the event of a no-deal Brexit, if necessary This means that certain goods would be subject to tariffs. The UK would also lose all the trade deals it is currently part of as an EU member - although the government is currently trying to replicate these""as far as possible"". In addition to tariffs, UK goods entering the EU would be subject to extra checks. There have been warnings that this could lead to bottlenecks at some ports (such as Dover). The UK has undertaken preparations, code-named Operation Yellowhammer, to address any disruption in the first few days of a no-deal Brexit. As part of the contingency plans, up to 3,500 troops will be ready to be deployed, if necessary. What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Brexit: What trade deals have been done so far? What is operation Yellowhammer? Proposer: Marcus Fysh, Conservative Result: 139 for, 422 against This option assumes the UK is unable to pass the withdrawal agreement. Under this scenario, the UK would leave the EU but there would be a commitment from both sides to recognise each other's standards and regulations for up to two years. Supporters refer to it as a ""standstill"" agreement and say this would mean that goods could continue to flow freely and tariff-free (ie no taxes on imports). The UK would be able to negotiate its future relationship, but would continue to pay into the EU budget during this period. Supporters say such an arrangement would avoid disruption, but detractors say it would not eliminate the need for checks. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs that the EU has repeatedly said it is unwilling to accept such a plan. Proposer: George Eustice, Conservative Result: 64 for, 377 against Under this option, the UK would participate in the single market and Efta but, unlike the Common Market 2.0 option, it would not enter into an EU customs arrangement. This would give the UK the freedom to sign its own trade deals. However, it is not clear how such an outcome would avoid the need for customs checks at the Irish border - the plan acknowledges the need for ""new protocols relating to the Northern Ireland border"".

Bercow's intervention versus May's dealVideoVideoBercow warns PM not to 'circumvent' his rulingBrexit: What could happen next?Brexit jargon explained,"Never afraid of stoking controversy, the Speaker has again infuriated many Tory MPs with his latest surprise pronouncement to the Commons. Just as it seemed the government was poised to try and get its Brexit deal through again, John Bercow took it upon himself to tick ministers off before they had even tried. Why? Because last week he ruled the deal could not be brought back to the Commons for a third time without ""substantial"" changes. Reaction as May reveals her departure plan May vows to quit if Brexit deal passed MPs debate Brexit options ahead of votes Mr Bercow's intervention today suggests he doesn't think that test has yet been met. But No 10 disagrees and points to the additional backstop guarantees agreed at a summit in Strasbourg, and formally approved by the EU last week. It's clear the date of Brexit has changed too. It will be 22 May if the withdrawal agreement is passed by the Commons this week and 12 April if not - unless there is a further extension. With so little time, there is some incredulity around Parliament that the Speaker is sticking so rigidly to his ruling. The government was considering a procedural move that could have proved MPs wanted to have a vote, regardless of the parliamentary convention. But John Bercow said that wouldn't do. Hannah White from the Institute for Government said that while the Speaker is the ultimate authority on parliamentary procedure, ""the government ought to be allowed to test the will of the House on whether to set aside its own rule"". It still seems likely the government will have another crack at getting its deal through the Commons before Friday night. Tory opposition to the agreement seems to be crumbling at the same rate interest in alternative forms of Brexit is growing. Many Tory Brexit-enthusiasts who hate the withdrawal agreement are now very worried the indicative vote process might lead to a long extension and possibly no Brexit altogether. No 10 will only bring the deal back for a third vote if it thinks it could pass. That probably requires DUP backing and a guarantee some Labour MPs will vote for it too. As it stands, there isn't yet a majority for the deal, but the mood is shifting fast. It is possible the government attempts to pass the withdrawal agreement on its own - detaching the non-binding political agreement MPs are arguing over now from the terms of divorce. That may well satisfy the EU's deadline and allow MPs time to continue their wrangle over the sort of future relationship they want after Brexit.

Brexit: What could happen next?Brexit jargon explained,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

What Brexit options are MPs voting on?,"Parliament remains deadlocked after MPs once againrejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement. But could a series of votes on different Brexit options offer a way forward? A process, known as indicative votes,has already tried to find a consensus - but it failed to find a majority for any one outcome. No. A second round of indicative votes is expected on Monday. The process is likely to be very similar to last time,according to the order paper,external. MPs will be able to submit their options to the Speaker, John Bercow. He will then select which options are debated and eventually voted on. Last time, eight options were selected. But on this occasion Mr Bercow could decide to select fewer - for example only the three options that commanded the most support on Wednesday. Or, he could choose more. The voting system - where MPs select yes or no on each option - is expected to remain the same. Here is a reminder of what the options were and how MPs voted on them, in the first round. Proposer: Dame Margaret Beckett, Labour Result: 268 for, 295 against This option would require the public to agree to any Brexit deal, through a ""confirmatory referendum"". But it would be up to MPs to decide what the question on the ballot would be - and that could lead to renewed deadlock. For example, should there be two or more options to choose from? How could another referendum work? Proposer: Ken Clarke, Conservative Result: 265 for, 271 against Under this option, MPs could pledge to support Mrs May's Brexit deal (known asthe withdrawal agreement) in exchange for a commitment for the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU. A customs union is a trade agreement under which two or more countries do not put tariffs (taxes on imports) on goods coming in from other countries in the union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. This arrangement would give the UK a closer trading relationship with the EU and reduce the need for some (but not all) checks at the Irish border. It would go some way towards removing the need for the backstop - the insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border (eg border posts) in Ireland. But being part of a permanent customs union with the EU would stop the UK striking its own independent trade deals with other countries (such as the United States). Mrs May has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union as one of her ""red lines"". Proposer: Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Result: 237 for, 307 against Labour's position is to remain in a customs unionin addition to having a ""close alignment"" with the EU single market. While being in a customs union prevents the UK from negotiating its own trade deals, Labour says it wants the UK to be to have ""a say"" in future EU trade talks. But EU law does not currently allow non-EU members to have a formal say or veto in its trade talks. However, Labour says the EU has shown flexibility in the past and its proposal cannot be ruled out until the party has had a chance to negotiate formally. What is Labour's custom union policy? Proposer: Nick Boles, Conservative Result: 189 for, 283 against This option would involve the UK joining Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as part of theEuropean Free Trade Association (Efta),external. It would mean remaining in the single market, which would ensure the free flow of goods to and from the EU - avoiding friction at the borders. But the UK would have to retain freedom of movement (the right of EU citizens to live and work in the UK and vice-versa) - although some restrictions  could apply. The UK would also need pay into the EU budget and follow many of the EU's rules and regulations. Under the plan, the UK would also remain in a customs union until an alternative plan to a avoid a hard border in Ireland was found. This option is referred to as the Common Market 2.0 or the Norway plus plan. What is Common Market 2.0? Proposer: Joanna Cherry, SNP Result: 184 for, 293 against This would mean cancelling Brexit altogether. Article 50 is the two-year process which triggered the UK's departure from the EU. The original deadline of 29 March has now been extended for at least a couple of weeks. Last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could revoke Article 50 itself, without having to ask the other 27 EU countries for permission. By revoking Article 50, the UK would bring a halt to the entire Brexit process. It would therefore remain a member of the EU on the same terms, including keeping its budget rebate. Can the UK revoke Article 50? Proposer: John Baron, Conservative Result: 160 for, 400 against No deal is the legal default outcome in the absence of agreeing a deal or revoking Article 50. So if the political deadlock cannot be resolved, a no-deal Brexit could still be the final outcome. If the UK did leave the EU with no deal, it would mean initially trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. The Ministry of Defence says 3,500 troops will be available to be deployed in the event of a no-deal Brexit, if necessary This means that certain goods would be subject to tariffs. The UK would also lose all the trade deals it is currently part of as an EU member - although the government is currently trying to replicate these""as far as possible"". In addition to tariffs, UK goods entering the EU would be subject to extra checks. There have been warnings that this could lead to bottlenecks at some ports (such as Dover). The UK has undertaken preparations, code-named Operation Yellowhammer, to address any disruption in the first few days of a no-deal Brexit. As part of the contingency plans, up to 3,500 troops will be ready to be deployed, if necessary. What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Brexit: What trade deals have been done so far? What is operation Yellowhammer? Proposer: Marcus Fysh, Conservative Result: 139 for, 422 against This option assumes the UK is unable to pass the withdrawal agreement. Under this scenario, the UK would leave the EU but there would be a commitment from both sides to recognise each other's standards and regulations for up to two years. Supporters refer to it as a ""standstill"" agreement and say this would mean that goods could continue to flow freely and tariff-free (ie no taxes on imports). The UK would be able to negotiate its future relationship, but would continue to pay into the EU budget during this period. Supporters say such an arrangement would avoid disruption, but detractors say it would not eliminate the need for checks. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs that the EU has repeatedly said it is unwilling to accept such a plan. Proposer: George Eustice, Conservative Result: 64 for, 377 against Under this option, the UK would participate in the single market and Efta but, unlike the Common Market 2.0 option, it would not enter into an EU customs arrangement. This would give the UK the freedom to sign its own trade deals. However, it is not clear how such an outcome would avoid the need for customs checks at the Irish border - the plan acknowledges the need for ""new protocols relating to the Northern Ireland border"".

Developer in U-turn over 'segregation',"This video can not be played âItâs sad I canât use the playground' A developer accused of ""segregating"" children from adjoining private and social housing has made a U-turn. Henley Homes, which is behind the development in Kennington, south London, said on Tuesday that the social housing tenants simply did not have ""right of access"" to a large communal play area. But it said on Wednesday it had ""no objection"" to communal access for all. The government has said it will investigate the matter. A spokeswoman from Henley Homes said on Tuesday that walls and fences - seen as segregating children who live in the development - were merely markers between two separate estates: Wren Mews, which comprises 36 social housing properties, and the Baylis Old School estate, which comprises private owners and shared ownership residents. ""The residents of Wren Mews, a neighbouring block, which is not owned or managed by Henley Homes, do not have the right of access to the Baylis Old School estate at all,"" she said. This distinction has been dismissed by both private and social housing residents, who say both blocks are part of one development, called Baylis Old School. ""It's complete nonsense to say they are two separate estates,"" Jane Bloomfield, 43, told BBC News. The private owner, who has two children, said the 149-flat development had always been marketed as one, including in apromotional video,externalthat she says convinced her to buy a property. ""It's a lie - it's all one development,"" social housing tenant Sarina Da Silva said. Residents say there are far fewer children in the private part of the development, where there is access to a much larger play area On Wednesday, Henley Homes issued a statement by its chief executive Tariq Usmani, who said the firm had ""never had any objections"" to social housing residents having ""access to the play areas and amenities of Baylis Old School"". Mr Usmani said he would be ""leading the way forward in engaging with all relevant stakeholders to ensure a workable solution can be put in place as soon as practically possible"". Mrs Bloomfield said she was ""baffled at this statement"", adding: ""If they never had an objection, why build the wall? ""I do think they realise that this has become an incredibly emotive issue that has gained national attention, so I am glad they are acknowledging this. ""But until that wall is removed, then I will remain sceptical."" Jane Bloomfield, pictured third from left, with other Baylis Old School residents The Guinness Partnership, which owns and manages Wren Mews, said on Wednesday it was ""in absolute agreement"" with Henley Homes that ""all customers should have access to all play areas and amenities"". It added it was now working with Warwick Estates, which manages the private part of the development, to ""ensure that this happens as soon as possible"". Warwick Estates declined to comment. FollowingThe Guardian's exclusive story,externalon Monday, Giles Peaker, a solicitor who specialises in housing issues, offered his advice to a group of mothers on a pro-bono basis. The lawyer, from Anthony Gold solicitors, said he would advise residents on establishing ""what the situation is and whether there is a potential challenge"". Meanwhile, Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said he condemned any restrictions on the housing complex ""in the strongest terms"" and announced his department was ""investigating this matter and [would] be liaising with the developer and any other parties responsible to ensure children of all backgrounds can play together"". He added that the government was ""committed to tackling stigma and challenging the stereotypes perpetuated by such segregation"" as part of its social housing green paper. A spokesman for Lambeth Council, which approved the development in 2013, said: ""We are investigating what legal powers we have to ensure that any restriction of access is removed.""

MPs debate Brexit options ahead of votes,"MPs had half an hour to fill out the ballot paper MPs are awaiting the results of votes on eight different proposals for the future of Brexit. Options they are considering include leaving without a deal, a customs union and a confirmatory referendum. Speaker John Bercow will announce what support there is for each later after MPs took over the Commons timetable. Theresa May has promised to stand down as prime minister if her own deal is approved, prompting several Tory Brexiteers to say they will back it. Meanwhile, MPs have approved the legislation required to change the date of Brexit from 29 March - after the EU agreed to give the UK an extension last week. Friday had long been the day written into law for the UK to leave the EU but the Commons approved a statutory instrument - by 441 votes to 105 - changing the deadline to 22 May if a withdrawal agreement is passed this week; or 12 April if it is not. The prime minister is still trying to drum up support for her withdrawal agreement despite it being voted down by a large margin twice and the DUP saying they still cannot vote for it. The government is seeking the support of MPs for the Commons to convene on Friday, if necessary, amid reports a third vote on the PM's deal could be held then. Live: MPs debate way forward for Brexit What are indicative votes? How the indicative vote process will work Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict But Mr Bercow reiterated his earlier warnings that the PM's deal could not come back for a vote if it had not significantly changed. He said the government ""should not seek to circumvent my ruling"" by introducing procedures that could reverse his judgement. This video can not be played John Bercow: ""I do expect the government to meet the test of change."" But a Downing Street spokesman said there had been a ""significant development"" at the summit in Brussels last week, after Mrs May agreed ""extra reassurances"" over the Irish backstop with the EU, and the date of exit had changed.

MPs are currently voting on a statutory instrument to confirm a delay, after the UK was given until 12 April to propose a different way forward if the current agreement cannot get through Parliament and until 22 May to finalise Brexit if the deal is passed. Earlier on Wednesday, MPs took control of parliamentary business from the government for several hours as they attempt to find a majority for the next steps in the Brexit process. Conservative backbencher Sir Oliver Letwin, whose cross-party proposal ushered in today's debate, said the only way leaving the EU with no-deal can be prevented is by crystallising an alternative majority and trying to carry it forward. He said that if MPs supported the prime minister's deal in another meaningful vote this would be ""the easy route"". But he added that he ""profoundly hopes"" that if on Monday there is a majority view in favour of a particular position, that the government will say that it will carry that forward. By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondent Never afraid of stoking controversy, the Speaker has again infuriated many Tory MPs with his latest surprise pronouncement to the Commons. Just as it seemed the government was poised to try and get its Brexit deal through again, John Bercow took it upon himself to tick ministers off before they had even tried. Why? Because last week he ruled the deal could not be brought back to the Commons for a third time without ""substantial"" changes. No 10 will only bring the deal back for a third vote if it thinks it could pass. That probably requires DUP backing and a guarantee some Labour MPs will vote for it too. As it stands, there isn't yet a majority for the deal, but the mood is shifting fast. Read more from Ben here. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Groups have put forward different options for the UK's future relationship with the EU, with several based on the assumption Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU will be approved - albeit with changes to the controversial Northern Ireland backstop. The Speaker of the House, John Bercow, chose eight to be voted on by MPs. They are: No-deal Brexit- Leave the EU on 12 April without a deal - Tory MP John Baron Common Market 2.0- The UK joins the European Economic Area and negotiates a temporary customs union until alternative arrangements can be found  - Tory MP Nick Boles EFTA/EEA- Similar to Common Market 2.0 but rejects any kind of customs union with the EU and says the Irish backstop must be replaced with alternative arrangements - Tory MP George Eustice Customs union- Calls for the UK to negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit - Tory MP Ken Clarke Labour's alternative plan- A customs union with the EU and ""close alignment"" with the single market - Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Revoke Article 50- Cancel Brexit if the UK gets within days of leaving without a deal. MPs would be asked to vote on a no-deal exit and if they rejected that, Article 50 would be revoked - SNP MP Joanna Cherry Confirmatory public vote- Parliament cannot ratify or implement any agreement on the UK's withdrawal and future relationship ""unless and until they have been approved by the people of the UK in a confirmatory public ballot"" - Labour MP Margaret Beckett Malthouse Plan B- The UK makes its budgetary contributions to the EU to the end of 2020 and agrees with the EU a period of two years in which UK goods have full access to the EU - Tory MP Marcus Fysh Read more on the Brexit options MPs are voting on After a four-hour debate on each proposal, MPs were given a piece of paper listing the options, and had to mark each one with a ""yes"" or ""no"". MPs used both lobbies for completing the ballots in a process that took about half an hour. Several MPs, including Tory Michael Fabricant and Lib Dem Jo Swinson, posted images of their forms on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UK set to adopt vehicle speed limiters,"Speed limiting technology looks set to become mandatory for all vehicles sold in Europe from 2022, after new rules were provisionally agreed by the EU. The Department for Transport said the system would also apply in the UK, despite Brexit. Campaigners welcomed the move, saying it would save thousands of lives. Road safety charity Brake called it a ""landmark day"", but the AA said ""a little speed"" helped with overtaking or joining motorways. Safety measures approved by the European Commission included intelligent speed assistance (ISA), advanced emergency braking and lane-keeping technology. The EU says the plan could help avoid 140,000 serious injuries by 2038 and aims ultimately to cut road deaths to zero by 2050. Road deaths 'part of city living' Tougher speeding fines come into force Is the driving test getting more difficult? EU Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska said: ""Every year, 25,000 people lose their lives on our roads. The vast majority of these accidents are caused by human error. ""With the new advanced safety features that will become mandatory, we can have the same kind of impact as when safety belts were first introduced."" Under the ISA system, cars receive information via GPS and a digital map, telling the vehicle what the speed limit is. This can be combined with a video camera capable of recognising road signs. The system can be overridden temporarily. If a car is overtaking a lorry on a motorway and enters a lower speed-limit area, the driver can push down hard on the accelerator to complete the manoeuvre. A full on/off switch for the system is also envisaged, but this would lapse every time the vehicle is restarted. It's already coming into use. Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Peugeot-Citroen, Renault and Volvo already have models available with some of the ISA technology fitted. However, there is concern over whether current technology is sufficiently advanced for the system to work effectively. In particular, many cars already have a forward-facing camera, but there is a question mark over whether the sign-recognition technology is up to scratch. Other approved safety features for European cars, vans, trucks and buses include technology which provides a warning of driver drowsiness and distraction, such as when using a smartphone while driving, and a data recorder in case of an accident. This video can not be played Theo Leggett: 'The car brought us to a controlled halt' Theo Leggett, business correspondent The idea that cars will be fitted with speed limiters - or to put it more accurately, ""intelligent speed assistance"" - is likely to upset a lot of drivers. Many of us are happy to break limits when it suits us and don't like the idea of Big Brother stepping in. However, the new system as it's currently envisaged will not force drivers to slow down. It is there to encourage them to do so, and to make them aware of what the limit is, but it can be overridden. Much like the cruise control in many current cars will hold a particular speed, or prevent you exceeding it, until you stamp on the accelerator. So it'll still be a free-for-all for speeding motorists then? Not quite. Under the new rules, cars will also be fitted with compulsory data recorders, or ""black boxes"". So if you have an accident, the police and your insurance company will know whether you've been going too fast. If you've been keeping your foot down and routinely ignoring the car's warnings, they may take a very dim view of your actions. In fact, it's this ""spy on board"" which may ultimately have a bigger impact on driver behaviour than any kind of speed limiter. It's easy to get away with reckless driving when there's only a handful of traffic cops around to stop you. Much harder when there's a spy in the cab recording your every move. All of this may well reduce accidents, but it won't eliminate them. You can force people to slow down, you can watch what they're doing, you can help them with emergency braking - but you can't get rid of basic bad driving. Unless, of course, you have self-driving cars. The move was welcomed by the European Transport Safety Council, an independent body which advises Brussels on transport safety matters. But it said it could be several months before the European Parliament and Council formally approve the measures. The European Parliament will not be able to consider the provisional rules until after its elections take place in May. UK statistics showmore than 1,700 people are killed on UK roads every year,external, while Brake says speed is a contributory factor in about a quarter of all fatal crashes. Brake's campaigns director, Joshua Harris, said: ""This is a landmark day for road safety. ""These measures will provide the biggest leap forward for road safety this century."" The UK's Department for Transport said: ""We continuously work with partners across the globe to improve the safety standards of all vehicles. These interventions are expected to deliver a step-change in road safety across Europe, including the UK."" The Association of British Insurers held out the possibility that premiums could be reduced as a result. It said: ""Motor insurers support measures aimed at improving road safety. Any steps that can be shown to make our roads safer, reducing road crashes and insurance claims, can be reflected in the cost of motor insurance."" The AA thinks the system might have the unintended consequence of making drivers more reckless, not less. AA president Edmund King said there was no doubt that new in-car technology could save lives, adding there was ""a good case"" for autonomous emergency braking to be fitted in all cars. ""When it comes to intelligent speed adaptation, the case is not so clear,"" he said. ""The best speed limiter is the driver's right foot. ""The right speed is often below the speed limit - for example, outside a school with children about - but with ISA, there may be a temptation to go at the top speed allowed.""

British-born AI expert wins Turing Award,"Geoffrey Hinton is known as the ""godfather of deep learning"" British-born artificial intelligence (AI) expert Geoffrey Hinton has won the Turing Award, sometimes referred to as ""the Nobel Prize of computing"". Mr Hinton, who now lives in Canada, shares the award with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun - two other proponents of deep learning, a popular form of AI. ""The three of us have been the people who most believed in this approach,"" he told BBC News. ""It's very nice to be recognised now that it is fashionable."" A deep neural network uses many layers of artificial neurons, loosely mimicking the structure of animal brains. Such AI is increasingly used in products that people use every day - from smart speakers to Facebook. Deep learning is also seen as a promising, though not flawless, tool for the development of self-driving cars and other futuristic technologies. The 2019 Turing Award recipients' various engineering breakthroughs - made independently and, in some cases, together - had turned deep learning into ""a critical component of computing"", according to the Association for Computing Machinery,which announced the award,external. 15 key moments in the history of AI Will a robot take your job? Prof Hinton, who works for the University of Toronto and Google, told BBC News he and his co-recipients had all pursued deep learning even when it had been unusual to do so. ""I think it's great that the computer science community has recognised that this stuff is not flaky,"" he said. ""For many years, they thought that neural nets were not respectable. ""I think we're just at the beginning of a big revolution."" The other recipients have also responded to the award announcement. Yoshua Bengio, who is a professor at the University of Montreal,said on Twitter,externalhe was ""extremely honoured"" to be a recipient. And Yann LeCun, director of AI at Facebook,said he was,external""very honoured and thankful"". Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the British inventor of the world wide web,won the Turing Award in 2017. Deep learning involves building computer programs that loosely mimic the structure of animal brains, with many layers of artificial neurons that process data. When such networks digest data, their many neurons have individual responses within each layer. These outputs are passed to the next layer until the network finally forms a decision or judgement about the input. A system such as this can learn, for example, to transcribe human speech or recognise a person's face in different photographs. This video can not be played The BBC's quick guide to Artificial Intelligence Prof Hinton's great-great-grandfather was British mathematician George Boole. Booleinvented Boolean logic, which later became a key concept in computer science. In 2015,Prof Hinton told BBC Newshe did not fear a hostile attack on humanity by AI, though he acknowledged there was still ""a lot to worry about"". When asked after his award win about the ethical questions around how AI could be misused, he said: ""If you get something that increases productivity, it should be good, whether or not it actually is good [and] helps people in general is a question for the political system."" When Prof Hinton finished his PhD in the 1970s, he found it difficult to find a job working in AI in the UK, which prompted his move to Canada. He is now a British and Canadian citizen. However, he said the prospects for AI researchers in the UK had since improved greatly. ""You have big labs like the Deep Mind lab and there was nothing like that in 1978,"" he said.

MPs debate eight Brexit options ahead of vote,"MPs had half an hour to fill out the ballot paper MPs are awaiting the results of votes on eight different proposals for the future of Brexit. Options they are considering include leaving without a deal, a customs union and a confirmatory referendum. Speaker John Bercow will announce what support there is for each later after MPs took over the Commons timetable. Theresa May has promised to stand down as prime minister if her own deal is approved, prompting several Tory Brexiteers to say they will back it. Meanwhile, MPs have approved the legislation required to change the date of Brexit from 29 March - after the EU agreed to give the UK an extension last week. Friday had long been the day written into law for the UK to leave the EU but the Commons approved a statutory instrument - by 441 votes to 105 - changing the deadline to 22 May if a withdrawal agreement is passed this week; or 12 April if it is not. The prime minister is still trying to drum up support for her withdrawal agreement despite it being voted down by a large margin twice and the DUP saying they still cannot vote for it. The government is seeking the support of MPs for the Commons to convene on Friday, if necessary, amid reports a third vote on the PM's deal could be held then. Live: MPs debate way forward for Brexit What are indicative votes? How the indicative vote process will work Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict But Mr Bercow reiterated his earlier warnings that the PM's deal could not come back for a vote if it had not significantly changed. He said the government ""should not seek to circumvent my ruling"" by introducing procedures that could reverse his judgement. This video can not be played John Bercow: ""I do expect the government to meet the test of change."" But a Downing Street spokesman said there had been a ""significant development"" at the summit in Brussels last week, after Mrs May agreed ""extra reassurances"" over the Irish backstop with the EU, and the date of exit had changed.

MPs are currently voting on a statutory instrument to confirm a delay, after the UK was given until 12 April to propose a different way forward if the current agreement cannot get through Parliament and until 22 May to finalise Brexit if the deal is passed. Earlier on Wednesday, MPs took control of parliamentary business from the government for several hours as they attempt to find a majority for the next steps in the Brexit process. Conservative backbencher Sir Oliver Letwin, whose cross-party proposal ushered in today's debate, said the only way leaving the EU with no-deal can be prevented is by crystallising an alternative majority and trying to carry it forward. He said that if MPs supported the prime minister's deal in another meaningful vote this would be ""the easy route"". But he added that he ""profoundly hopes"" that if on Monday there is a majority view in favour of a particular position, that the government will say that it will carry that forward. By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondent Never afraid of stoking controversy, the Speaker has again infuriated many Tory MPs with his latest surprise pronouncement to the Commons. Just as it seemed the government was poised to try and get its Brexit deal through again, John Bercow took it upon himself to tick ministers off before they had even tried. Why? Because last week he ruled the deal could not be brought back to the Commons for a third time without ""substantial"" changes. No 10 will only bring the deal back for a third vote if it thinks it could pass. That probably requires DUP backing and a guarantee some Labour MPs will vote for it too. As it stands, there isn't yet a majority for the deal, but the mood is shifting fast. Read more from Ben here. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Groups have put forward different options for the UK's future relationship with the EU, with several based on the assumption Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU will be approved - albeit with changes to the controversial Northern Ireland backstop. The Speaker of the House, John Bercow, chose eight to be voted on by MPs. They are: No-deal Brexit- Leave the EU on 12 April without a deal - Tory MP John Baron Common Market 2.0- The UK joins the European Economic Area and negotiates a temporary customs union until alternative arrangements can be found  - Tory MP Nick Boles EFTA/EEA- Similar to Common Market 2.0 but rejects any kind of customs union with the EU and says the Irish backstop must be replaced with alternative arrangements - Tory MP George Eustice Customs union- Calls for the UK to negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit - Tory MP Ken Clarke Labour's alternative plan- A customs union with the EU and ""close alignment"" with the single market - Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Revoke Article 50- Cancel Brexit if the UK gets within days of leaving without a deal. MPs would be asked to vote on a no-deal exit and if they rejected that, Article 50 would be revoked - SNP MP Joanna Cherry Confirmatory public vote- Parliament cannot ratify or implement any agreement on the UK's withdrawal and future relationship ""unless and until they have been approved by the people of the UK in a confirmatory public ballot"" - Labour MP Margaret Beckett Malthouse Plan B- The UK makes its budgetary contributions to the EU to the end of 2020 and agrees with the EU a period of two years in which UK goods have full access to the EU - Tory MP Marcus Fysh Read more on the Brexit options MPs are voting on After a four-hour debate on each proposal, MPs were given a piece of paper listing the options, and had to mark each one with a ""yes"" or ""no"". MPs used both lobbies for completing the ballots in a process that took about half an hour. Several MPs, including Tory Michael Fabricant and Lib Dem Jo Swinson, posted images of their forms on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The process is likely to continue on Monday as MPs seek to whittle down options which could command majority support in Parliament. Now:Debate on statutory instrument (SI) bringing Brexit delay into law 21:00:Vote on SI 21:30:The Speaker announces the results of the indicative votes - though he could announce them earlier during SI debate All times approx Conservative MPs were given a free vote, meaning they were able to support or reject any proposal without pressure from party whips. Cabinet ministers will be abstaining. The decision followed warnings that more than a dozen ministers might quit if they were told they had to follow party orders. Labour MPs are being whipped to support the party's own proposal, as well as motions on a customs union, Common Market 2.0 and a confirmatory public ballot. Mr Starmer told the Commons any deal ""needs further democratic approval"" before being enacted. But the move has angered Labour MPs in Brexit-vote constituencies, with Great Grimsby MP Melanie Onn reportedly resigning as a shadow housing minister.

May vows to quit after deal is passed,"Theresa May has promised Tory MPs she will quit if they back her Brexit deal. She told backbench Tories: ""I am prepared to leave this job earlier than I intended in order to do what is right for our country and our party."" The PM said she knew that Tory MPs did not want her to lead the next phase of Brexit negotiations ""and I won't stand in the way of that"". But the DUP said it had not changed its position and would still vote against the deal. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the DUP's refusal to back the deal at this stage was a ""huge blow"" for Number 10. LIVE: MPs debate way forward on Brexit No majority for any of Brexit options Many Conservative Brexiteers - including the chairman of the European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg - had been waiting to see if the DUP's 10 MPs would back the deal before deciding whether to get behind it - and their decision makes it even more difficult for the deal to pass. In a statement released after the PM announced her offer to stand down, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the ""necessary changes"" she wanted to see to the backstop clause in the withdrawal agreement had still not been secured. She told the BBC the backstop threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom and her party would never ""sign up to something that would damage the Union"". This video can not be played Arlene Foster: ""Backstop makes it impossible for us to sign deal"" Justice Secretary David Gauke said he hoped Parliament would ""rally behind"" the PM's deal, and he thinks ""there is a mood in that direction"". But ERG deputy chairman Steve Baker said after Mrs May's statement that he was ""consumed with a ferocious rage after that pantomime"". Speaking at an ERG meeting, Mr Baker attacked those in the party whose ""addiction to power without responsibility"" had led them to confront MPs with a choice between the PM's deal and no Brexit and that he ""may yet resign the whip"" than ""be part of this"", sources said. Mrs May did not name a departure date at a packed meeting of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs. But if the deal is passed, she would resign as party leader after 22 May - the new Brexit date - but stay on as PM until a new leader is elected. Downing Street said it would be a ""different ball game"" if the deal was not passed by Parliament. It came as MPs seized control of the Commons agenda to hold a series votes on alternatives to the deal. None of the eight options won outright support. Sir Oliver Letwin, who secured the votes, said he wanted to hold more of them on Monday, but he said he hoped MPs would back Theresa May's deal before then. If the deal doesn't go through then it's not quite clear that Mrs May's offer to go still applies, although it is almost impossible, whether it stands or falls, that she would be able to stay. The prime minister hopes that by offering to leave Number 10, she'll take the country out of the EU with her, smoothly, without more political turmoil. And that order, of a sort, will be restored and the uncertainty for all of us will end. If that happens, we'll see a new leader in Downing Street by mid-July. But that is still a gamble. Read Laura's blog Mrs May told the 300 or so Tory MPs at the meeting ""we need to get the deal through and deliver Brexit"". ""I ask everyone in this room to back the deal so we can complete our historic duty - to deliver on the decision of the British people and leave the European Union with a smooth and orderly exit."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted that Mrs May's announcement ""shows once and for all that her chaotic Brexit negotiations have been about party management, not principles or the public interest"". He added: ""A change of government can't be a Tory stitch-up, the people must decide."" This video can not be played Nicky Morgan says some MPs were ""saying they weren't going vote for the agreement unless the PM indicated she was moving on."" George Freeman, the prime minister's former policy adviser, said she had done the ""right thing"" in announcing her decision to stand down, even though it had been a ""sad moment"". The Tory MP told BBC News her speech had been followed by a series of interventions from ""very hardline Brexiteers"" all saying ""prime minister, thank you, I will now vote for this deal"". The PM has said she wants to bring the deal back to the Commons this week, after it was previously rejected twice, by large margins. Commons Speaker John Bercow ruled last week that the government could not return for a third attempt, unless there had been ""substantial"" changes to the proposals. And he warned ministers earlier that they should ""not seek to circumvent my ruling"" by introducing procedures that could reverse his judgement. But a Downing Street spokesman said there had been a ""significant development"" at the summit in Brussels last week, after Mrs May agreed ""extra reassurances"" over the Irish backstop with the EU, and the date of exit had changed. A Tory leadership contest would start after the UK has left the EU under the terms of Mrs May's deal The timing of the contest would be up to the Conservative Party Theresa May would remain as prime minister until a new leader is elected by Tory members Candidates need to be nominated by two other MPs If there is only one candidate they become the new leader immediately If there is more than two candidates there would be a series of votes among MPs to whittle the field down to two It then goes to a vote of all Conservative Party members Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

What options are MPs voting on?,"Parliament remains deadlocked after MPs once againrejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement. But could a series of votes on different Brexit options offer a way forward? A process, known as indicative votes,has already tried to find a consensus - but it failed to find a majority for any one outcome. No. A second round of indicative votes is expected on Monday. The process is likely to be very similar to last time,according to the order paper,external. MPs will be able to submit their options to the Speaker, John Bercow. He will then select which options are debated and eventually voted on. Last time, eight options were selected. But on this occasion Mr Bercow could decide to select fewer - for example only the three options that commanded the most support on Wednesday. Or, he could choose more. The voting system - where MPs select yes or no on each option - is expected to remain the same. Here is a reminder of what the options were and how MPs voted on them, in the first round. Proposer: Dame Margaret Beckett, Labour Result: 268 for, 295 against This option would require the public to agree to any Brexit deal, through a ""confirmatory referendum"". But it would be up to MPs to decide what the question on the ballot would be - and that could lead to renewed deadlock. For example, should there be two or more options to choose from? How could another referendum work? Proposer: Ken Clarke, Conservative Result: 265 for, 271 against Under this option, MPs could pledge to support Mrs May's Brexit deal (known asthe withdrawal agreement) in exchange for a commitment for the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU. A customs union is a trade agreement under which two or more countries do not put tariffs (taxes on imports) on goods coming in from other countries in the union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. This arrangement would give the UK a closer trading relationship with the EU and reduce the need for some (but not all) checks at the Irish border. It would go some way towards removing the need for the backstop - the insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border (eg border posts) in Ireland. But being part of a permanent customs union with the EU would stop the UK striking its own independent trade deals with other countries (such as the United States). Mrs May has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union as one of her ""red lines"". Proposer: Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Result: 237 for, 307 against Labour's position is to remain in a customs unionin addition to having a ""close alignment"" with the EU single market. While being in a customs union prevents the UK from negotiating its own trade deals, Labour says it wants the UK to be to have ""a say"" in future EU trade talks. But EU law does not currently allow non-EU members to have a formal say or veto in its trade talks. However, Labour says the EU has shown flexibility in the past and its proposal cannot be ruled out until the party has had a chance to negotiate formally. What is Labour's custom union policy? Proposer: Nick Boles, Conservative Result: 189 for, 283 against This option would involve the UK joining Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as part of theEuropean Free Trade Association (Efta),external. It would mean remaining in the single market, which would ensure the free flow of goods to and from the EU - avoiding friction at the borders. But the UK would have to retain freedom of movement (the right of EU citizens to live and work in the UK and vice-versa) - although some restrictions  could apply. The UK would also need pay into the EU budget and follow many of the EU's rules and regulations. Under the plan, the UK would also remain in a customs union until an alternative plan to a avoid a hard border in Ireland was found. This option is referred to as the Common Market 2.0 or the Norway plus plan. What is Common Market 2.0? Proposer: Joanna Cherry, SNP Result: 184 for, 293 against This would mean cancelling Brexit altogether. Article 50 is the two-year process which triggered the UK's departure from the EU. The original deadline of 29 March has now been extended for at least a couple of weeks. Last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could revoke Article 50 itself, without having to ask the other 27 EU countries for permission. By revoking Article 50, the UK would bring a halt to the entire Brexit process. It would therefore remain a member of the EU on the same terms, including keeping its budget rebate. Can the UK revoke Article 50? Proposer: John Baron, Conservative Result: 160 for, 400 against No deal is the legal default outcome in the absence of agreeing a deal or revoking Article 50. So if the political deadlock cannot be resolved, a no-deal Brexit could still be the final outcome. If the UK did leave the EU with no deal, it would mean initially trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. The Ministry of Defence says 3,500 troops will be available to be deployed in the event of a no-deal Brexit, if necessary This means that certain goods would be subject to tariffs. The UK would also lose all the trade deals it is currently part of as an EU member - although the government is currently trying to replicate these""as far as possible"". In addition to tariffs, UK goods entering the EU would be subject to extra checks. There have been warnings that this could lead to bottlenecks at some ports (such as Dover). The UK has undertaken preparations, code-named Operation Yellowhammer, to address any disruption in the first few days of a no-deal Brexit. As part of the contingency plans, up to 3,500 troops will be ready to be deployed, if necessary. What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Brexit: What trade deals have been done so far? What is operation Yellowhammer? Proposer: Marcus Fysh, Conservative Result: 139 for, 422 against This option assumes the UK is unable to pass the withdrawal agreement. Under this scenario, the UK would leave the EU but there would be a commitment from both sides to recognise each other's standards and regulations for up to two years. Supporters refer to it as a ""standstill"" agreement and say this would mean that goods could continue to flow freely and tariff-free (ie no taxes on imports). The UK would be able to negotiate its future relationship, but would continue to pay into the EU budget during this period. Supporters say such an arrangement would avoid disruption, but detractors say it would not eliminate the need for checks. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs that the EU has repeatedly said it is unwilling to accept such a plan. Proposer: George Eustice, Conservative Result: 64 for, 377 against Under this option, the UK would participate in the single market and Efta but, unlike the Common Market 2.0 option, it would not enter into an EU customs arrangement. This would give the UK the freedom to sign its own trade deals. However, it is not clear how such an outcome would avoid the need for customs checks at the Irish border - the plan acknowledges the need for ""new protocols relating to the Northern Ireland border"".

Read Laura's blog Mrs May told the 300 or so Tory MPs at the meeting ""we need to get the deal through and deliver Brexit"". ""I ask everyone in this room to back the deal so we can complete our historic duty - to deliver on the decision of the British people and leave the European Union with a smooth and orderly exit."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted that Mrs May's announcement ""shows once and for all that her chaotic Brexit negotiations have been about party management, not principles or the public interest"". He added: ""A change of government can't be a Tory stitch-up, the people must decide."" This video can not be played Nicky Morgan says some MPs were ""saying they weren't going vote for the agreement unless the PM indicated she was moving on."" George Freeman, the prime minister's former policy adviser, said she had done the ""right thing"" in announcing her decision to stand down, even though it had been a ""sad moment"". The Tory MP told BBC News her speech had been followed by a series of interventions from ""very hardline Brexiteers"" all saying ""prime minister, thank you, I will now vote for this deal"". The PM has said she wants to bring the deal back to the Commons this week, after it was previously rejected twice, by large margins. Commons Speaker John Bercow ruled last week that the government could not return for a third attempt, unless there had been ""substantial"" changes to the proposals. And he warned ministers earlier that they should ""not seek to circumvent my ruling"" by introducing procedures that could reverse his judgement. But a Downing Street spokesman said there had been a ""significant development"" at the summit in Brussels last week, after Mrs May agreed ""extra reassurances"" over the Irish backstop with the EU, and the date of exit had changed. A Tory leadership contest would start after the UK has left the EU under the terms of Mrs May's deal The timing of the contest would be up to the Conservative Party Theresa May would remain as prime minister until a new leader is elected by Tory members Candidates need to be nominated by two other MPs If there is only one candidate they become the new leader immediately If there is more than two candidates there would be a series of votes among MPs to whittle the field down to two It then goes to a vote of all Conservative Party members Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

'Take over pharma' to make new antibiotics,"Part of the drugs industry should be taken over to make new antibiotics, an influential economist has argued. Lord Jim O'Neill, who advised the government on antibiotic resistance, said he was shocked by pharmaceutical companies failing to tackle drug-resistant infections. He said the solution may be to ""just take it away from them and take it over"". The pharmaceutical industry said it was not standing still on the issue. Bacteria evolving resistance to antibiotics threatens to take medicine back to the dark ages. Some infections could become untreatable and losing the drugs would make surgery and cancer therapy far more risky. It is known as the antibiotic apocalypse. Global antibiotics 'revolution' needed Analysis: Antibiotic apocalypse Part of the solution is developing new drugs, however, there has not been a new class of antibiotic since the 1980s. The problem is there is simply no money in it - any new drug would need to be cheap and used rarely to minimise the risk of resistance. Projections of deaths from drug-resistant infections by 2050 Three years ago, Lord O'Neill proposed solutionsin his Review on Antimicrobial Resistance,,externalincluding giving pharmaceutical companies around a billion dollars for each novel antibiotic they developed. Lord O'Neill said that since then there had been empty words from global policy makers and that he was coming round to the idea of, in effect, nationalising part of the pharmaceutical industry. He told the BBC: ""If you had asked me three years ago, I would have thought that would have been a bit crazy. ""But nearly three years after our review came out, there's endless talk but there's no progress in waking up the pharmaceutical industry to want to do this. ""So, by default, I find my mind thinking why not explore the idea of some public utility that's got public-purpose ownership of it, just take it away from them and take it over."" He said that companies ditching antibiotic research would be an opportunity for a new public body to acquire those assets. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) said it was ""hardly standing still"" in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Dr Sheuli Porkess, the deputy chief scientific officer at the ABPI, said: ""Nationalising antibiotic development simply won't get us the antibiotics we need. ""In 2016 the private sector invested around $2bn in research and development of new antibiotics, roughly four times as much as all government and foundations combined."" The ABPI said it had been working closely with government for the past two years and companies were ""ready and waiting"" to test a new model for supporting antibiotic. ""We shouldn't write off this plan before we've tried it,"" Dr Porkess said. However, there is wide agreement that developing new drugs will only ever be part of the antimicrobial resistance solution. The practice ofhanding antibiotics out like sweetswill continue to fuel the rise of drug-resistant infections.

Cardi B: Why I drugged and robbed men,"In January, she became the first solo woman to win the Grammy Award for best rap album Cardi B has defended herself after a video resurfaced of her saying she drugged and robbed men who wanted to have sex with her while she worked as a stripper before finding fame. The rapper faced criticism after the three-year-old Instagram live video recirculated on social media. ""Whether or not they were poor choices at the time, I did what I had to do to survive,""she wrote on Tuesday,external. ""I never claimed to be perfect or come from a perfect world."" The original video was made as her career was starting to take off and was her response to someone who said she didn't deserve success because she hadn't put in any work. ""Nothing was handed to me. Nothing,"" she said in the video, before going on to reveal that she would invite men to a hotel before drugging and robbing them. In response to the furore, she wrote on Instagram that she had been talking ""about things in my past right or wrong that I felt I needed to do to make a living"". She added: ""I'm a part of a hip-hop culture where you can talk about where you come from, talk about the wrong things you had to do to get where you are."" The Grammy-winner also pointed out that there are rappers who ""glorify murder, violence, drugs and robbing"". She wrote: ""I never glorified the things I brought up in that live [video], I never even put those things in my music because I'm not proud of it and feel a responsibility not to glorify it. ""I made the choices that I did at the time because I had very limited options."" Cardi B ended the statement by explaining the men she referred to in the old video were men she dated or was involved with, and were ""conscious, willing and aware"". Earlier in the week, the hashtag #SurvivingCardiB was trending - a reference to Surviving R Kelly, the documentary that highlightedthe years of sexual allegationsagainst the star. Some users compared the rapper to disgraced comedianBill Cosby, who was sentenced to jail in 2018 after being accused of drugging and assaulting women. Allow Twitter content?

UK buys ÃÂ£12m New York apartment for diplomat,"The UK government has spent $15.9m (Â£12m) on a luxury New York apartment for a British diplomat to live in while he negotiates trade deals with the US. It will house the UK trade commissioner for North America and consul general in New York, Antony Phillipson. Boasting panoramic views, the seven-bedroom flat occupies the entire 38th-floor of 50 United Nations Plaza, saidthe Guardian,external, which first reported it. The Foreign Office said it had ""secured the best possible deal"". The apartment ""will help promote the UK in the commercial capital of our largest export market for years to come"", it said. What trade deals has the UK done so far? A floor plan of the 5,893 sq ft apartment shows a library, six bathrooms and a powder room. Two of the five bedrooms in the apartment are currently designated ""staff bedrooms"" on the floor plan, but the UK Foreign Office said only the consul general and his immediate family will live there. Designed by British architect Norman Foster, the 44-storey building is close to the UN headquarters in Manhattan and isdescribed as the ""ultimate global address"",external. On the website of architects Foster and Partners, the high-rise is described as a ""luxury residential tower occupying a prestigious location"". Every apartment features floor to ceiling bay windows and ""generous space for entertaining"", the firm says. ""Adding a touch of elegance to every detail, the powder room walls are fitted with glazed silk panels in a choice of either bold primary or natural colours,"" it adds. A spa in the basement has a large exercise pool for residents, according to the website. The penthouse was bought by ""Her Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs"" on 15 March, according to New York City records. In a statement, the Foreign Office, said that the residence ""will also be used to support his work to help British businesses as Her Majesty's trade commissioner for North America."" It said it was in the process of selling the consul general's current residence. ""At least someone is going to do OK out of Brexit,""Labour MP Gareth Thomas tweeted, in response to the purchase,external. Stewart Maxwell, a special adviser to Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon on business and the economy,tweeted,external: ""UK Tory government make clear that austerity isn't for everybody"". Deal to preserve UK-US trade post-Brexit Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? Chloe Westley, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, which lobbies for lower taxes and greater government efficiency, said: ""What's often forgotten is that these luxuries come at the expense of hard pressed families, who want the money that they give to the government to go primarily towards public services."" She added that taxpayers would hope diplomats ""earn their keep by creating opportunities for British businesses and consumers"". In 2015, the New Zealand government was criticised overreports,externalit spent $8m (Â£6.05m) on a ""lavish"" 18th-floor apartment in the 50 United Nations Plaza for the country's UN ambassador Gerard van Bohemen to live in. Meanwhile, Qatarreportedly,externalspent $45m (Â£34m) on four apartments in the high-rise in the same year. The building was also home to Nikki Haley while she served as the US ambassador to the UN.

Two charged over UK girls' Ghana attack,"A search is continuing to find a third suspect Two men have been charged with a series of offences including rape aftera group of British schoolgirls was attacked at gunpoint in Ghana. A number of armed men entered accommodation where the pupils and their teachers were staying during a school trip to the west African country in December. Police said a Ghanaian security guard was shot and the female victims were ""subjected to serious sexual assaults"". Some of their possessions were stolen. Police in the UK said Ishmael Akyene, 34, a Ghanaian national, had been charged by Ghanaian police with 14 counts of robbery, one count of rape, one count of conspiracy to rape, one count of possession of a firearm, one count of possession of an instrument intended for unlawful entry and one count of money laundering. A second man, Daniel Akpan, 29, a Nigerian national, has been charged with 14 counts of robbery, two counts of rape, one count of conspiracy to rape, one count of possession of a firearm, one count of possession of an instrument intended for unlawful entry and one count of money laundering. Both men have been remanded in custody. A search is continuing to find a third suspect. Police say the victims are continuing to be supported by specially-trained police officers, their school and other agencies.

A guide to MPs' Brexit plans,"MPs are trying to forge a Brexit consensus as they debate and vote on alternatives to the government's EU withdrawal agreement. In an unprecedented show of strength by the Commons, MPs are wresting control of the parliamentary timetable from the government for a few hours to consider a range of other options and try to break the current deadlock. Commons Speaker John Bercow has chosen eight proposals, out of more than a dozen put forward by MPs, to be debated. It will then be up to MPs, when they fill in their ballot papers, to express an opinion on each of them. Any that secure the support of more than 50% of MPs could go forward to be debated again on Monday as Parliament tries to convince the government, and just as importantly the EU, that it has an alternative solution. Here's a brief rundown of proposals up for consideration and who's backing them. The general idea:It's a very straightforward motion: ""That this House agrees that the UK shall leave the EU on 12 April 2019 without a deal."" The key bits:It seeks to ensure that there will not be further delay to Brexit. Who's backing it?Conservative Brexiteers John Baron, Sir David Amess, Martin Vickers and Stephen Metcalfe Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The general idea:At least three motions were being circulated around Westminster which argue for the UK to negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU. The Speaker has selected the most straightforward one, tabled by veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke. The key bits:It does not argue for the UK to remain in the EU's current customs union. It says that any EU withdrawal agreement, and declaration on the future trading relationship, ""must include, as a minimum, a commitment to negotiate a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU"". Who's backing it?The cross-party proposal has the backing of a smattering of senior Conservative and Labour MPs, including Ken Clarke, Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The general idea:Aside from the customs union, the opposition's motion unarguably points in the direction of a ""softer Brexit"" while, the party insists, still honouring the result of the 2016 referendum. Labour argues that its proposal is negotiable with the EU - something its detractors contest. The key bits:The motion calls for ""close alignment"" with the single market, underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, and for the UK to be in harmony with laws on workers' rights and environmental protections. It seeks guarantees over the UK's continued participation in educational, scientific and cultural programmes and access to security and law enforcement schemes, including the European Arrest Warrant. Who backing it?It is being put forward by party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer. But it is unlikely to attract much support from other parties, particularly opposition parties who favour another referendum. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The general idea:Also known as ""Norway plus"", this motion takes as its starting point the Scandinavian country's relationship with the EU and seeks to build on it. It derives its name from the common market, the vernacular name for the European Economic Community (EEC) at the time the UK joined it in 1973. The key bits:The UK would reapply to join the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which it left when it signed up to the EEC. If successful, it would join what is known as the ""EEA pillar"" of the EFTA agreement. In essence, the UK would not leave the European Economic Area, to which it currently belongs as an EU member, and would continue to participate in the single market. It envisages a ""comprehensive customs arrangement"" with the EU until alternative arrangements are put in place and would maintain freedom of movement, albeit with conditions. Who's backing it?It is the brainchild of Tory MP Nick Boles, who has been championing it for nearly 18 months. It has the support of Brexiteer Tory Andrew Percy and a number of Labour MPs, including Stephen Kinnock. The Labour leadership has indicated it will order its MPs to vote for this, increasing its chances of success. The general idea:This is similar in some respects to Common Market 2.0 but with a number of important differences. While the UK would rejoin EFTA and stay within the EEA, it makes clear the UK's rights and obligations would be enforceable by the domestic courts, not the European Court of Justice. The key bits:It rejects any kind of customs union with the EU after Brexit and says the Irish backstop must be replaced with alternative arrangements to preserve the territorial integrity of the UK. Who's backing it?It has been drawn up by George Eustice, who quit as a minister last month to vote against delaying Brexit. It is largely a Tory affair but does draw support from ""soft Brexiteers"" like Nicky Morgan and Jeremy Lefroy and members of the Brexit Delivery Group of MPs. Allow Twitter content?

The general idea:This one is pretty straightforward. It says Parliament cannot ratify or implement any agreement on the UK's withdrawal and future relationship ""unless and until they have been approved by the people of the UK in a confirmatory public ballot"". The key bits:It basically requires Parliament to withhold its consent for any deal until it is approved in a referendum. Unlike Labour's motion, it does not specify what deal could be voted on or whether there should be an option to remain, thereby differentiating itself from the People's Vote campaign. Who's backing it?This was known around Westminster as the Kyle-Wilson amendment, as it's the idea of Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, but it has been tabled by Labour MP Dame Margaret Beckett. They have a long list of Labour, Lib Dem, SNP, Independent Group supporters, and a smattering of Tory rebels. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The general idea:This requires the government to stop Brexit in its tracks if the UK gets to within days of its scheduled departure from the EU and the necessary legislation implementing any withdrawal deal has not been approved. The key bits:Talk of revoking Article 50 - the legal process by which the UK is leaving the EU - has been all the rage in the past week, with a petition backing the move attracting more than five million signatures. This motion obliges the government to act if the UK reaches ""the penultimate House of Commons sitting day before exit day"" and no law implementing Brexit has been passed. In such a situation, MPs would be asked to vote on a no-deal exit and if they rejected that, Article 50 would be revoked. Who's backing it?The prime mover is the Scottish lawyer and SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who was behind a legal challenge earlier this year to establish whether the UK could unilaterally revoke Article 50. Its supporters include Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and members of the Independent Group of MPs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The general idea:This looks a bit like the ""managed no-deal"" plan that was being touted by some cabinet Brexiteers. It would see an extended transition period to December 2021 to allow time to prepare for departure on World Trade Organisation terms or a revised version of the withdrawal agreement. The key bits:It would seek to reduce the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" to the smallest amount possible - and introduce a ""standstill period"" with no tariffs and no new barriers to trade with the EU while talks are ongoing. The first part of the plan, Malthouse Plan A, which called for the current withdrawal agreement to be implemented with the ""backstop"" for the Irish border replaced by alternative arrangements, which had cross-party support, was not selected for debate Commons Speaker John Bercow. Who's backing it?Mostly Conservative Brexiteers, including Marcus Fysh, Steve Baker and Priti Patel.

US county declares measles emergency,"Despite the dangers, vaccination rates for measles are declining in many countries A county in New York state has declared a state of emergency following a severe outbreak of measles. Rockland County, on the Hudson river north of New York City, has barred unvaccinated children from public spaces after 153 cases were confirmed. Violating the order will be punishable by a fine of $500 (Â£378) and up to six months in prison. The announcement follows other outbreaks of the disease in Washington, California, Texas and Illinois. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Smitha Mundasad explains the US measles outbreak Vaccination rates have dropped steadily in the US with many parents objecting for philosophical or religious reasons, or because they believe discredited information that vaccines cause autism in children. ""We will not sit idly by while children in our community are at risk,"" Rockland County Executive Ed Day said. ""This is a public health crisis and it is time to sound the alarm."" The outbreak in Rockland County is largely concentrated in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, the New York Times reported,external. It is believed it could have spread from other predominantly ultra-Orthodox areas around New York which have already seen outbreaks of measles. Mr Day said health inspectors had encountered ""resistance"" from some local residents, which he branded ""unacceptable and irresponsible"". ""They've been told 'We're not discussing this, do not come back' when visiting the homes of infected individuals as part of their investigations,"" he said. According to the CDC,external, there are 314 cases of measles currently reported in the US, with nearly half of those coming from Rockland County. Dylan Skriloff, the editor of local newspaper the Rockland County Times, told the BBC the number of measles cases in the county had been increasing steadily in recent weeks. ""The first reports came six months ago, and each week we've had a new report with increased numbers,"" he said. ""It's become clear that it's not abating, and the authorities... don't want to accept [this reality] as the new normal."" Skriloff said that the authorities had been making ""steady progress"" in encouraging religious communities to immunise children but communication had broken down in the last month. ""The rate of immunisation in the religious communities, for young people, it's about 50%-60%, which is not nearly enough."" 'Don't be taken in by social media vaccine myths' Russian trolls 'spreading vaccine misinformation' Measles cases in Europe triple Officials said the order, which bans anyone under the age of 18 who has not been vaccinated from places such as schools, shopping centres, restaurants and places of worship, would come into effect at midnight on Wednesday and last 30 days. However, the order notes that authorities ""will not be patrolling or asking for vaccination records"", just referring those found to violate the order to the District Attorney's Office. Some critics say that without a plan to enforce the order, it is a useless measure that fails to protect anyone, while others have accused the local government of overreach. Rockland County has a population of more than 300,000. US teen warns of anti-vax misinformation Measles resurgence 'due to vaccine hesitancy' UK minister targets anti-vaccination websites By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News Both Europe and the US are dealing with outbreaks of measles, but why now? Nothing has changed about the virus; the answer instead lies in human behaviour. Myths about the vaccine causing autism have been debunked but are still affecting the number of children being immunised. And complacency from a generation of parents unfamiliar with the dangers of measles has also had an effect. So with every year that goes by, the total number of unvaccinated people grows, often in pockets in some communities. It is like an ever-growing tinderbox just waiting for a spark. Measles still runs rampant in many parts of the world - it kills around90,000 people a year,external. All it takes is a bit of travel for measles to reach those vulnerable pockets and spread like wildfire. Measles is a highly infectious disease and can cause serious health complications, including damage to the lungs and brain. But despite the dangers, vaccination rates are declining in many countries. This video can not be played There have also been outbreaks of measles in Europe In the UK, the government is seekingnew legislation to force social media companies to remove content promoting false information about vaccines. There were more than 82,500 cases in Europe in 2018- the highest number in a decade and three times the total reported in 2017. The World Health Organization has declared the anti-vaccine movement to be one of the top global health threats for 2019. Have you been affected by the order put in place? What is your reaction?

Life expectancy drops among poorer women,"The life expectancy of women living in the poorest areas of England fell by 100 days in recent years,Office for National Statistics data,externalsuggests. Between 2012-2014 and 2015-2017, female life expectancy in the richest areas increased by 84 days, widening the gap between rich and poor by half a year. In men, the gap also widened - but less markedly. Life expectancy in the UK as a whole has stopped improving at the rate expected, the ONS said. Women in the most deprived areas in England can expect to live for 78.7 years, while women in the least deprived areas can live for 86.2 years - a gap of 7.5 years. This gap in female life expectancy has widened between 2012-2014 and 2015-2017, with a particularly noticeable drop in life expectancy among poorer women. Those women living in the most deprived areas can expect to live the shortest lives and live the smallest number of healthy years, the ONS said. Ben Humberstone, deputy director for health analysis and life events at the ONS, said: ""This has led to a significant widening in the inequality in life expectancy at birth in England."" For men, the life expectancy gap is greater - nearly a decade, or 74 years in poorer areas compared to 83.3 years in richer ones. But there has been virtually no fall in life expectancy among poor men, although there was a significant increase in the most affluent men, over the period studied. NHS prevention plan aims to boost healthy life expectancy UK among worst for life expectancy rises Tim Elwell-Sutton, assistant director of strategic partnerships at the Health Foundation, said the data showed a ""staggering level of variation in the years of life you can expect to live in good health in England and Wales depending on your social and economic circumstances"". ""To reduce these stark inequalities, cross-government action and investment is needed on the wider determinants that influence our health. ""This includes access to adequate money and resources, affordable healthy food, well-designed transport systems, and good quality housing, work and education,"" he said. In Wales,,externalthe gap in life expectancy between the least and most deprived areas was 8.8 years for males and 7.6 years for females in 2015 to 2017. The changes in life expectancy since 2012-2014 in Wales were not statistically significant, the ONS said. In Scotland, the rise in life expectancy is grinding to a halt, according toa recent report. Figures for Northern Ireland were not included in this ONS report, butprevious stats show life expectancy for women at birth in Northern Ireland was unchanged.

PFA chief executive Taylor to stand down,"Gordon Taylor has headed up the PFA since 1981 Gordon Taylor has confirmed he will leave his role as chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association after 38 years. Taylor, 74, has headed up the players' union since 1981 after taking over from former secretary Cliff Lloyd. But his departure comes after the organisation announced a ""full and open review"" into its finances. ""I have given the majority of my life to the advancement of the PFA,"" he said at the PFA's annual general meeting. The meeting, held on Wednesday in Manchester, should have taken place in November. Taylor will remain in his post until the review is complete and presented at the following AGM. The PFA has also said its entire management committee and current chairman Ben Purkiss will step down. Taylor said the organisation was now ""united on the best way forward"". He added: ""Every decision I have made has been in the interest of members and I believe the review will make the PFA - the oldest and most powerful sporting union in the world - even stronger. It will ensure we have the right structures in place to support our former, current and future members. ""It goes without saying that I am extremely proud of the work and input that the PFA has had on the development of the greatest game in the world, and I will continue to fight for the organisation, its members and our role in the game - both in this country and worldwide."" Taylor is credited with negotiating the PFA's biggest source of income - around Â£25m per year from the Premier League. The former Bolton, Birmingham, Blackburn and Bury winger made over 500 appearances in an 18-year playing career. Taylor pictured outside the PFA's Manchester headquarters in 1991 Taylor's biggest success story at the PFA came in 2001 while negotiating a deal with the Premier League over what the PFA's share of television revenue should be. England internationals including David Beckham and Gary Neville were among 99% of the PFA's membership to approve strike action until a figure of Â£52.2m (over three years) was finally agreed, alongside stipulations relating to future deals. Regarded as one of football's finest administrators during the 1980s and 1990s, much of the PFA's influence on the modern game can be traced back to Taylor. Taylor established community programmes and youth training schemes (now apprenticeships) at all 92 professional football clubs. Former England internationals Tony Adams, Paul Merson, Paul Gascoigne and Paul Ince were among the first graduates, as youth development was revolutionised and the number of schoolboys entering the game at the age of 16 doubled. He played a key role in founding the 'Let's Kick Racism Out of Football' initiative in 1993, which later became the organisation Kick It Out. More recently, Taylor has pushed for football toadopt the 'Rooney rule'to increase the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) coaches in the game. While the annual PFA Awards evening in April has gone from a men-only sportsman's dinner to an inclusive and glitzy bash, it has not been without controversy. Football agent Rachel Anderson sued the PFA after being refused admission in 1998 and was awarded damages of Â£7,500, plus costs. In 2013, black American comedian Reginald D Hunterused an offensive racistterm during his performance at the Grosvenor House hotel in Mayfair, with Taylor saying the performer may have been unaware the language had been an ""emotive"" subject in football. There have also been raised eyebrows over perceived lavish expenditure at times, with Â£1.9m spent on LS Lowry's 'Going to the Match' painting. In 2013, national newspapers reported Taylor had run up more than Â£100,000 in gambling debts, and in 2015 he was forced to issue apublic apologyafter comparing the Ched Evans rape case with the Hillsborough tragedy. The PFA has also been criticised in several quarters for not acting quickly enough over the problem of football-related dementia, with Dawn Astle - the daughter of former West Brom and England striker Jeff Astle - walkingout of a meetingwith Taylor. Around 300 high-profile former and current players endorsed an open letter calling for Taylor to step down in November amid a dispute with current chairman Purkiss. In December, the Charity Commission said it would be ""engaging"" with the PFA ""to establish the facts"" amid criticism of Taylor. The latest PFA Charity accounts reveal staff costs of Â£4m, but elsewhere in the accounts it is stated that ""no salaries or wages have been paid during the year"". In separate PFA general fund accounts for 2017-18, Taylor's remuneration comes to a total of Â£2,020,393. In response to the concerns, Taylor said the organisation had ""listened"" and had ""taken the time to think carefully about what is in the best interests of our organisation and our members"". ""I have dedicated the last 40 years of my life to professional football,"" he added. 1981 - Takes charge of the PFA and introduces a non-contributory pension scheme for members. 1986 - Helps establish the Football in the Community initiative at six clubs before it is rolled out across all 92 Football League clubs. 1988 - Implements a Youth Training Scheme for 16- to 18-year-old players at professional clubs. 1989 - Agrees to join the Football League as chief executive before reconsidering and staying with the union. 1994 - Appointed President of FIFPro (the International Association of Football Players' Unions). 2001 - Secures a Â£52.2m three-year deal with the Premier League over television revenue after 99% of players back a threat to strike. 2008 - Recognised in the Queen's birthday honours for services to Football as he is appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). 2015 - Issues a public apology after comparing the Ched Evans rape case with the Hillsborough tragedy. 2017 - Dawn Astle, the daughter of former West Brom and England striker Jeff, walks out of a meeting with Taylor criticising the PFA for a lack of action on dementia research. 2018 - The PFA says it is ""disappointing"" thata disputeover the eligibility of Ben Purkiss as chairman has become public knowledge.

Club's payout to Bennell abuse survivor,"Barry Bennell was jailed for 31 years in 2018 for assaulting 12 former players Crewe Alexandra has agreed to pay a settlement to a former player after he was abused by coach Barry Bennell. Bennellwas jailed for 31 years in 2018,externalfor assaulting 12 former players during his time at the League Two club and Manchester City. The solicitor representing the player said ""it has been a long time coming"". Crewe Alexandra said it did not ""consider it appropriate to comment on individual cases that are being dealt with by its insurers"". The club reiterated it ""sincerely regrets the abuse committed by Barry Bennell and expresses its deepest sympathies to the victims and survivors"". The amount of the settlement was not disclosed, although some reports suggest it runs into tens of thousands of pounds. Who is Barry Bennell '80 coaches convicted of child sex abuse' Football abuse survivor helps Hollyoaks Solicitor Dino Nocivelli said the payment followed court proceedings and he hoped it meant other survivors would get a chance at justice. He said: ""Hopefully they [Crewe Alexandra] have seen sense now; they know what needs to be done, they know the right thing to do by survivors and hopefully they will do that. ""The question is, 'will that happen?', and the sooner the better, really."" But Mr Nocivelli said the club had not apologised to the victim, adding: ""It is not just about the money. It is about someone accepting responsibility and apologising for their failings."" Crewe Alexandra said it ""regrets the abuse committed by Barry Bennell"" Last month it emerged Crewe had admitted to a Football Association-commissioned inquiry it did no background checks on Bennell before hiring him and encouraged him and other coaches to invite boys to stay overnight at their houses and take them on holidays.

Scotland takes a different fracking path,"This video can not be played Women, symbolically dressed in white, turn up at the fracking site in Lancashire to protest daily A lot has changed in the UK's shale gas sector since the Scottish government put the brakes on it back in 2015. But despite what you might have heard from politicians, it's still not technically banned in Scotland. An ""effective ban"" announced in 2017, which uses planning legislation to stop associated development, was followed by a judicial ruling that no ban existed. Despite a promise to sort it once and for all by Holyrood's Easter recess, a final decision has been delayed again. Fracking ban decision delayed by Scottish government What is fracking and why is it controversial? Scottish ministers who sanctioned one of the world's most extensive series of reports into the impact of fracking have now decided they need a fresh consultation. Friends of the Earth Scotland said it was time to stop the ""dilly-dallying"". The drilling rig at Preston New Road shale gas exploration site South of the border, where the Tory government supports it, the march of fracking has continued. At the Preston New Road site in Lancashire, operator Cuadrilla has even managed to get the gas flowing. But the objections have continued too. For close to two years the ""women in white"" have gathered to protest at the site's entrance; a little bit of industry in a relatively rural setting. They walk half a mile or so to the gates with a police escort and the frequent ""toots"" of support from passing drivers. They might have lost the battle at this particular site but their defiance suggests they feel the war isn't lost. Barbara Richardson did not think the protest against fracking would take so long Barbara Richardson is one of the most high profile objectors and says it's been a long haul. She said: ""I never envisaged it would last this long at all, I mean I've personally been involved for five years now and it's virtually taken over my life. ""And you know the struggle still goes on, but I have noticed a change and the industry is finding it more and more difficult to find social licence. ""They're having more and more problems as we go along so there's a big change from five years ago when I first started."" A poet urges solidarity against fracking during the protest During our visit a travelling poet urges solidarity among the crowd. ""Oh England, don't they fear the way you shake?"" he recites. From poetry to full-on protests, local people at sites across England have been doing their bit to frustrate the industry's progress. And here they believe that tactic is working. Protester Miranda Cox said the protest had delayed fracking Protester Miranda Cox said: ""It's made a big difference actually. I know we've held this site up for several months. ""They're behind schedule and they will run out of planning permission at the end of this year so we know that they haven't achieved exactly what they'd hoped to in the timeframe they had."" The shale gas extraction at Preston New Road lasted just a matter of weeks before Cuadrilla called it off. They're now having their own fight with the UK government over whether rules on earth tremors can be relaxed. The immediate communities might be against drilling but the opposition isn't universal. Operator Cuadrilla has managed to get the gas flowing at its Preston New Road site In nearby Blackpool there's a desperate need for high quality jobs. It's one of Britain's most socially-deprived towns and some think a new industry is exactly what's needed. There's even talk of an ""economic renaissance"" to reverse the region's woes. Lee Petts said the jobs from shale gas could help the area transform itself Businessman Lee Petts represents Lancashire for Shale which supports the industry. He told me: ""Blackpool is pretty central to Lancashire's visitor economy and has been for a long time but it's full of very low-skilled, low-paid jobs on zero hours contracts. ""That's not great for young people with ambition and something like shale on the doorstep, that can bring an influx potentially of very highly-skilled, well-paid jobs with prospects, could really help Blackpool to transform itself in the future."" You don't need one of the seaside resort's clairvoyants to work out whether the Scottish government will seek to ban fracking permanently. But previous attempts to do so have proved stormy, resulting in a protracted court battle. The biggest question will be whether ministers can stop fracking without another legal fight. Protesters in Lancashire urge ministers to go for it. Miranda Cox added: ""I know the Scottish government have spent a lot of time, many years, looking into this industry and looking at the risks and the harms and I would say stick to your guns."" The Scottish government's next move on fracking is much anticipated. It won't now come until later in the year but it will be watched closely north and south of the border.

Typical council tax will rise by 4.7%,"Typical council tax bills in England will rise by 4.7% in April - the second biggest increase in a decade, official figures show. The levy on an average Band D property will go up by Â£78 to Â£1,750, the government said, in part owing to the cost of policing and adult social care. In the last decade, the annual increase was only higher last year, when bills went up by 5.1%. Local authority funding by central government has been cut. This has fallen by 60% in the last decade, leaving councils increasingly reliant on council tax and business rates revenue. Local authorities in England are allowed to raise their council tax by 2.99%, plus a further 2% if they provide social care. Any that want to exceed this must hold a referendum. The local referendum rule only applies in England. The National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament have the power to cap local authorities' council tax rises. In Wales, the average rise will be about 6.5%, for example in Cardiff - the largest council in Wales -leaders set an increase of 4.9%while Pembrokeshire saw a 9.92% rise and Conwy 9.6%. Taxpayers in Scotland will see council tax on typical Band D propertiesrise by an average of 3.9%to Â£1,243. Northern Ireland has arates system,externalinstead of council tax. Council spending cuts, in seven charts Essential bill arrears 'more likely among women' The typical council tax rise in England is well over twice the level of inflation, which records the rising cost of living and currently stands at 1.8%. One reason for the rise is that, in the year from April, a total of 85 out of 151 adult social care authorities will use some or all of their remaining allowance, or precept, earmarked for adult social care. Funding for the policehas also had an impact with police and crime commissioners permitted to double their precept from Â£12 to Â£24. The average area Band D council tax will be Â£1,477 in London, Â£1,739 in metropolitan areas, and Â£1,814 in unitary authority areas, the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said. More rural areas, described as ""shire"" areas, will see the biggest typical rise - up Â£82 to Â£1,826 for a Band D property. Councillor Nick Rushton, County Councils Network finance spokesman and leader of Leicestershire County Council, said: ""For a long time, county residents have borne the brunt of the historic underfunding of county areas. It cannot be fair that a resident in a terraced home in Hinkley in Leicestershire is paying double that of a resident in a multi-million-pound house in Westminster. ""No-one wants to put up council tax, but many of us have very little option with county authorities facing the most severe financial pressures."" Across England, household budgets have been dealt a blow as council tax bills hit doormats. They will be rising by double the rate of inflation this year, meaning a jump of almost 15% over the most recent three years. Part of this is owing to councils being given scope to raise bills by up to 2% to fund adult social care. They have also been given some leeway to boost funding for policing. But higher bills do not necessarily mean a boost to local services. The funding central government gives local authorities will have fallen by almost 60% this decade. Even with the latest increase, the Local Government Association is warning of a funding ""gap"" of Â£7.8bn by 2025, which could put further pressure on services.

PFA boss Taylor set to stand down,"Gordon Taylor has headed up the PFA since 1981 Gordon Taylor has confirmed he will leave his role as chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association after 38 years. Taylor, 74, has headed up the players' union since 1981 after taking over from former secretary Cliff Lloyd. But his departure comes after the organisation announced a ""full and open review"" into its finances. ""I have given the majority of my life to the advancement of the PFA,"" he said at the PFA's annual general meeting. The meeting, held on Wednesday in Manchester, should have taken place in November. Taylor will remain in his post until the review is complete and presented at the following AGM. The PFA has also said its entire management committee and current chairman Ben Purkiss will step down. Taylor said the organisation was now ""united on the best way forward"". He added: ""Every decision I have made has been in the interest of members and I believe the review will make the PFA - the oldest and most powerful sporting union in the world - even stronger. It will ensure we have the right structures in place to support our former, current and future members. ""It goes without saying that I am extremely proud of the work and input that the PFA has had on the development of the greatest game in the world, and I will continue to fight for the organisation, its members and our role in the game - both in this country and worldwide."" Taylor is credited with negotiating the PFA's biggest source of income - around Â£25m per year from the Premier League. The former Bolton, Birmingham, Blackburn and Bury winger made over 500 appearances in an 18-year playing career. Taylor pictured outside the PFA's Manchester headquarters in 1991 Taylor's biggest success story at the PFA came in 2001 while negotiating a deal with the Premier League over what the PFA's share of television revenue should be. England internationals including David Beckham and Gary Neville were among 99% of the PFA's membership to approve strike action until a figure of Â£52.2m (over three years) was finally agreed, alongside stipulations relating to future deals. Regarded as one of football's finest administrators during the 1980s and 1990s, much of the PFA's influence on the modern game can be traced back to Taylor. Taylor established community programmes and youth training schemes (now apprenticeships) at all 92 professional football clubs. Former England internationals Tony Adams, Paul Merson, Paul Gascoigne and Paul Ince were among the first graduates, as youth development was revolutionised and the number of schoolboys entering the game at the age of 16 doubled. He played a key role in founding the 'Let's Kick Racism Out of Football' initiative in 1993, which later became the organisation Kick It Out. More recently, Taylor has pushed for football toadopt the 'Rooney rule'to increase the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) coaches in the game. While the annual PFA Awards evening in April has gone from a men-only sportsman's dinner to an inclusive and glitzy bash, it has not been without controversy. Football agent Rachel Anderson sued the PFA after being refused admission in 1998 and was awarded damages of Â£7,500, plus costs. In 2013, black American comedian Reginald D Hunterused an offensive racistterm during his performance at the Grosvenor House hotel in Mayfair, with Taylor saying the performer may have been unaware the language had been an ""emotive"" subject in football. There have also been raised eyebrows over perceived lavish expenditure at times, with Â£1.9m spent on LS Lowry's 'Going to the Match' painting. In 2013, national newspapers reported Taylor had run up more than Â£100,000 in gambling debts, and in 2015 he was forced to issue apublic apologyafter comparing the Ched Evans rape case with the Hillsborough tragedy. The PFA has also been criticised in several quarters for not acting quickly enough over the problem of football-related dementia, with Dawn Astle - the daughter of former West Brom and England striker Jeff Astle - walkingout of a meetingwith Taylor. Around 300 high-profile former and current players endorsed an open letter calling for Taylor to step down in November amid a dispute with current chairman Purkiss. In December, the Charity Commission said it would be ""engaging"" with the PFA ""to establish the facts"" amid criticism of Taylor. The latest PFA Charity accounts reveal staff costs of Â£4m, but elsewhere in the accounts it is stated that ""no salaries or wages have been paid during the year"". In separate PFA general fund accounts for 2017-18, Taylor's remuneration comes to a total of Â£2,020,393. In response to the concerns, Taylor said the organisation had ""listened"" and had ""taken the time to think carefully about what is in the best interests of our organisation and our members"". ""I have dedicated the last 40 years of my life to professional football,"" he added. 1981 - Takes charge of the PFA and introduces a non-contributory pension scheme for members. 1986 - Helps establish the Football in the Community initiative at six clubs before it is rolled out across all 92 Football League clubs. 1988 - Implements a Youth Training Scheme for 16- to 18-year-old players at professional clubs. 1989 - Agrees to join the Football League as chief executive before reconsidering and staying with the union. 1994 - Appointed President of FIFPro (the International Association of Football Players' Unions). 2001 - Secures a Â£52.2m three-year deal with the Premier League over television revenue after 99% of players back a threat to strike. 2008 - Recognised in the Queen's birthday honours for services to Football as he is appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). 2015 - Issues a public apology after comparing the Ched Evans rape case with the Hillsborough tragedy. 2017 - Dawn Astle, the daughter of former West Brom and England striker Jeff, walks out of a meeting with Taylor criticising the PFA for a lack of action on dementia research. 2018 - The PFA says it is ""disappointing"" thata disputeover the eligibility of Ben Purkiss as chairman has become public knowledge.

Sports Direct readies ÃÂ£61m Debenhams bid,"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct is considering a Â£61.4m bid to take full control of Debenhams. Sports Direct already owns a near 30% stake in the retailer. The potential offer would be conditional on Mr Ashley becoming Debenhams chief executive. Sports Direct renewed its attack on the Debenhams board, saying it was either incompetent or was co-operating with lenders to wipe-out the investments of shareholders. It is considering making an offer of 5p per share for Debenhams, more than double Tuesday's closing share price of 2.2p. Debenhams said it was not making a statement at present, but it has been resisting Sports Direct takeover attempts. Sports Direct is the biggest Debenhams shareholder, with a 29.7% stake. Brandes Investment Partners, Odey Asset Management, and retail conglomerate Landmark Group are also significant shareholders. Mike Ashley owns more than 60% of Sports Direct The department store chain is currently trying to raise up to Â£200m from existing lenders. Under that deal shareholders, including Sports Direct, could see the value of their investments all but wiped-out. Abandoning that refinancing deal would be a condition of a Sports Direct offer. Debenhams would also not be able to go into administration or insolvency. Debenhams is expecting confirmation of the refinancing deal this week, andhas already said a takeover offerfrom Mr Ashley would not immediately solve its funding crisis. Sports Direct deputy chief financial officer Chris Wootton said shareholders were ""sick and tired of being ignored, cast aside and trampled underfoot by the lenders of Debenhams"". The sports retailer is continuing with plans to force an emergency general meeting in May to try to oust all but one of the directors on Debenhams' board. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The Debenhams board are bound by their duty to shareholders to give this proposal proper consideration, though it's not as yet a firm offer for the company,"" he said. ""This is not conventional corporate behaviour by any means, but that's what we've come to expect from the Sports Direct chief executive. ""What we haven't had from either Mike Ashley or Debenhams is a strategic plan for the long term future of the company, and today that still remains sadly lacking,"" he added.

Twitter birth-year hoax locks users out,"Users won't get a new colour scheme on the Twitter app if they change their birth year, the social network says Twitter has warned users to ignore a hoax suggesting an alternative colour scheme will appear in the app if they change their birth year to 2007. Instead, users who fall for the scam will be locked out of their accounts because Twitter prohibits anyone under the age of 13 from using the site. ""Please don't do this,"" the company said via a tweet. A spokesman for Twitter declined to confirm to the BBC how many people have succumbed to the hoax so far. Twitter has automatically prevented users under 13 from using the social network since May last year and its terms of use state that the social network is ""not directed to children."" Within the EU, companies aren't allowed to create contracts of service with users under 13 without parental permission, according to the recently adopted General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The original video was made as her career was starting to take off and was her response to someone who said she didn't deserve success because she hadn't put in any work. ""Nothing was handed to me. Nothing,"" she said in the video, before going on to reveal that she would invite men to a hotel before drugging and robbing them. In response to the furore, she wrote on Instagram that she had been talking ""about things in my past right or wrong that I felt I needed to do to make a living"". She added: ""I'm a part of a hip-hop culture where you can talk about where you come from, talk about the wrong things you had to do to get where you are."" The Grammy-winner also pointed out that there are rappers who ""glorify murder, violence, drugs and robbing"". She wrote: ""I never glorified the things I brought up in that live [video], I never even put those things in my music because I'm not proud of it and feel a responsibility not to glorify it. ""I made the choices that I did at the time because I had very limited options."" Cardi B ended the statement by explaining the men she referred to in the old video were men she dated or was involved with, and were ""conscious, willing and aware"". Earlier in the week, the hashtag #SurvivingCardiB was trending - a reference to Surviving R Kelly, the documentary that highlightedthe years of sexual allegationsagainst the star. Some users compared the rapper to disgraced comedianBill Cosby, who was sentenced to jail in 2018 after being accused of drugging and assaulting women. Allow Twitter content?

The murder of an Instagram star," The CCTV footage shows a white convertible in a narrow alley. A man, dressed all in white, rushes towards the driver’s seat, stops for seconds, and then runs towards a motorbike driven by another man. CCTV footage of Tara Fares's car, moments after the shooting The white sports car slowly rolls down the alley. Inside it is Tara Fares, Iraq’s most controversial social media star. She is dying from gunshot wounds. It was 27 September, 2018. Ayoush had returned to her home city Baghdad after a short trip to Turkey. About 15:00 that afternoon, Ayoush was called by someone on a mobile number she didn’t recognise. “It’s me, Tara. How was your trip? Let’s catch up today,” the voice said. Every detail of the call is seared into Ayoush’s memory. Ayoush was one of the first well-known female DJs in Iraq. Steadily, she had built up a reputation, playing a mix of Western pop and local hits, but had branched out into promoting events. Tara Fares had a different kind of fame. Her 2.7m Instagram followers saw her in different outfits, showing off her tattoos or demonstrating make-up techniques. She posted about travel, books she had read and funny things that had happened. Ayoush and Tara moved in the same circles - they were more than acquaintances, while being something less than close friends. But on this particular day they were to meet up in Baghdad’s al-Mansour neighbourhood, where the DJ’s office was located. The women needed to discuss an event to promote a contact lens brand. A couple of hours after the first phone call, Ayoush rang Tara to choose a meeting place. No-one answered. She tried calling again at about 17:30. A young man answered, screaming: “Tara Fares was shot.” Ayoush immediately checked her Facebook account. There were already posts about Tara’s death. A number included a recent Instagram photo - Tara wearing a one-shoulder denim dress, posing against a pink background. “I was scared. I went home immediately,” says Ayoush, 37, whose real name is Aisha Qusai. Her family had heard about Tara’s murder and were immediately scared that the DJ could be in danger. Journalist Sary Hussam, 22, had interviewed Tara in April. He was also shocked. He was sitting with friends in a quiet café playing cards - as many young Iraqis do on Thursdays (when the weekend starts in Iraq). The news spread like wildfire on social media. Everyone in the café suddenly knew. Sary couldn’t believe it and dialled Tara’s mobile number, but it went straight to voicemail -Tara’s message was an excerpt of Eminem’s Walk on Water featuring Beyoncé. Majd - not his real name - was one of the photographers who worked with Tara. It crossed his mind for a moment that it was all a publicity stunt - an outrageous attempt by Tara to get more attention. It wasn’t. When Tara died, social media immediately became a battleground.  She had always been controversial. Even in the wake of her death, there were hostile messages with some users branding her a “whore”. But there were just as many defending her. In many parts of the world, Tara’s Instagram would not have been remotely controversial. The pictures showed off her taste in clothes, her attitude and her tattoos. But tattoos are still a radical statement in Iraq. Tara had started with tiny ones on her fingers - a crescent, an arrow. There was a floral pattern on her arm. Photos showed an Arabic line tattooed under her neck reading “Ma yhizak reeh” - a saying that hints at someone being “unbreakable”. Also the Arabic name “Ali” appeared on her left shoulder. Then, in newer photos, there was a female face, a rose covering the back of her hand and a lion’s head spreading on her wrist and lower arm. In most of her photos she was casually dressed in loose jumpers or simple T-shirts, loose trousers, shorts, jeans and long shirts. The colour and length of her hair were constantly changing. In some photos taken not long before her death, she appeared wearing black lingerie or a nude bodysuit, stylish bra with jewellery draped across her chest or a blazer without anything underneath. All of these were risqué by Iraq’s standards. “She was different,” says Majd. “She was different because of her style and clothes. The rest of the Iraqi models are strict - or at least their families are. It is very difficult to convince an Iraqi model to wear an off-the-shoulder or a cropped top.” Tara didn’t care. She wore what she wanted. The content of her blogs was light. It was a cocktail of daily activities, including eating in her room, going to the gym or to restaurants with friends, travel and fashion. Like many young Iraqis, Tara was not worried about expressing her political opinion, especially in the beginning, when she was less well-known. She was not an activist, she just said what was on her mind. In the summer of 2015, when Iraq seemed to be at boiling point, crowds were taking to the streets over declining living conditions, and demanding political reforms. Amid electricity shortages, protesters gathered in Tahrir Square, near the Freedom Monument. A young protester was killed. In a clip, Tara said in Arabic: “The police and army opened fire on the protesters. Why is this? This is the first time we had seen this scene - Sunni, Shia and Kurds all together singing the national anthem. Is it nice that such a young man became a martyr?” August 2015: Demonstration in Tahrir Square On other occasions, she criticised corruption and corrupt politicians. In the last two years of her life, she seemed to focus on individual liberties. “Oh people, live your day to the fullest. Do what you love. Make your choices real whether people like it or not.” Her level of Instagram fame wasn’t unique in Iraq. There were other social media stars - a singer, a poet, a beauty queen who became a TV presenter. But Tara was somehow different, more outrageous. She shocked people. She swore, she smoked. That brash persona hadn’t always existed. Tara had created herself. Once, long ago, she was a very different person - a teenager in a wedding dress. An old photo taken, most probably, in 2012, shows Tara standing in a room, clad all in white, wearing heavy make-up, with her hair pulled up and decorated with a shiny crown. A big golden necklace covers her chest - possibly the groom’s gift. Similar photos could be found in albums of many brides in Baghdad. Nothing was significant, Tara looked like a very ordinary bride. But she was only 16, and being forced to marry. Years later, once she was famous, Tara used a Snapchat story to tell the tale of this unhappy relationship. In the story she wears a camouflage jacket, a thick set of eyelashes and uses the pink-and-yellow flower crown filter. Then she talks about the short, unhappy time she spent with her ex-husband. She described him as “low and mean” - accusing him of beating her up. She spent her pregnancy at her parents’ house and once the boy was born, his father arranged to take him from Tara. She had lost her child. “I was a child, only 17. What could I have done?” she later said in an interview on YouTube. She never saw her son again. By the time she was brought to the Sheikh Zayed hospital, just 4km (2.5 miles) from the crime scene, Tara was already dead, according to a nurse who was interviewed on TV. Bullets had hit her in the head, neck and chest. The medics tried to resuscitate her but failed, according to al-Hurra TV. Iraqi local media quoted official statements by the ministries of interior and health. They confirmed it - Tara Fares, aged just 22, had been shot dead in the Camp Sarah neighbourhood. The next day, the then Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, tweeted, saying he had ordered the security services to investigate and report back within 48 hours. He also promised to look into other killings. Media reports suggested Tara was the third well-known young woman to be killed in Baghdad within two months. The timing of the three deaths was similar - all on a Thursday afternoon. Rafif al-Yasiri worked at Baghdad’s Barbie Clinic offering plastic surgery not just to paying customers but also free to those who had suffered injuries. Rasha Hassan ran a beauty centre. Both were in their 30s. Both had died suddenly. The grave of Rafif al-Yasiri at Najaf cemetery, Baghdad The interior ministry had earlier said that Rafif took an overdose of drugs, while Rasha died of heart failure. But there were other conflicting reports about their deaths, and the lack of an official government verdict left room for theories and speculation, especially on social media. “Rafif was a doctor, how would she take an overdose?” activist Mariam Mandalawi asked at the time. Many others questioned the authorities’ explanation for the deaths. In the panic after Tara’s murder, her case and the August deaths of Rafif and Rasha were soon linked, despite a lack of evidence. People started saying “liberal” women and social media influencers were being targeted. News websites around the world rushed to cover Tara’s case and the possibility of a linked series of killings. But there had been other killings - of male and female activists - that had been generating headlines in Iraq. In late July in the southern city of Basra, lawyer Jabbar Karam al-Bahadli, who was known for defending protesters, had also been shot dead. Two days before the killing of Tara, activist Suad al-Ali, 46, was shot dead in Basra. She had been taking part in protests in the city against the lack of basic services, drinking water and jobs. Suad al-Ali Tara’s killing was different - a well-planned shooting in the middle of the day in a safe neighbourhood in Baghdad, in a street monitored by CCTV. “I was so scared when Suad was killed - I feared that other activists might face the same fate. But the government played it down,” says Faten Khalil Hattab, 25, an activist from Basra. “After a few days Tara Fares was killed, it was the spark that scared women. “Her death couldn’t be random, just as it couldn’t be random that Rafif, a beautician, was killed in Baghdad in ambiguous conditions, and it couldn’t be random that one week later another beautician was killed, also in ambiguous conditions.” The prime minister had linked the deaths but official statements played down the idea of foul play. The then Interior Minister Qasem al-Araji said Tara Fares “was killed by extremist groups, which are known to us. Efforts are being made to arrest them and expose them to the Iraqi people and get the just punishment”. He suggested the case would be cleared up quickly. In a TV interview on 11 October, the minister said that “accurate information” had proved that a “trained extremist group” killed Tara. He didn’t identify the group but said they had killed the aspiring Iraqi actor and model Karrar Noushi in the summer of 2017. The model Karrar Noushi was alleged to have been murdered by extremists He implied that the motorbike that carried Tara’s killer had been caught on CCTV. In the aftermath of the killing one of those held was Ayoush herself. She was taken into custody in the women’s prison in Baghdad. After an investigation, Ayoush was found innocent. In the days after Tara died, those who knew her were afraid she had been killed because of her lifestyle. Others who chose to live their lives differently said they had received threats. Former beauty queen Shimaa Qasimtold al-Arabiya TVshe had been threatened on social media.  Days after the murder, she did atearful live streamfrom her home in Amman, Jordan. “I am not scared, but my soul is tired,” she said. The wave of comments expressing happiness at the death of Tara had sickened her, she said, and she took a break from social media. “How did the lives of people become so cheap? We are famous, but we are not whores, like some are saying.” Shimaa Qasim Another prominent woman, Dumooa Tahseen, 2018 winner of Iraq’s version of talent show The Voice, also expressed her anger and shock. Ina clip posted on social media, she said: “I have lost hope in this country. Is this the Iraq that everyone used to dream of?” Dumooa Tahseen Both women are from Tara’s generation - twentysomethings who had grown up in a time of violence. Tara was seven years old in 2003 when Baghdad fell to American and British troops. “I still remember the sound of war,” Tara said in a YouTube interview months before her death. Sectarian violence cost the lives of many thousands of civilians. The role of women then was “passive”, says Loubna (not her real name), a young lecturer in Baghdad. “Women were trying just to avoid the ongoing violence and survive with those who remained from their families. They lost husbands and children. They also had to move and leave their own houses behind.” “Baghdad’s streets were destroyed. They looked dim and lifeless,” says journalist Sary Hussam. 2003: Air attacks on Baghdad He first met Tara in 2014 during a “Miss and Mr Elegance” competition in Baghdad – a kind of fashion and beauty pageant. Both were volunteers with NGOs. Tara was then 18, but had already been through a lot - dropped out of school, separated from her husband and been left as a mother without a son. “She was introverted and less confident,” Sary says. And yet she became someone different, someone who was not too scared to live. (Above: Sary Hussam) That same year, 2014, saw the Islamic State group declare its “caliphate”. They were soon notorious for their brutality - beheading enemies and ruthlessly enforcing Sharia law. Even away from areas controlled by IS fighters, some women worried about their right to express themselves, to live their lives as they wanted. Loubna left her city, Baghdad, because she felt unable to do the things she loved, including the simplest things like wearing clothes she liked. She returned four years later, just a month before Tara’s death. Tara herself decided to live in Irbil, in Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish region, which was  seen as safer than Baghdad. But she continued to take risks, and there was a constant stream of criticism. Tara was called a prostitute. Those who worked with her were told they were “bringing shame” on themselves. But she carried on regardless. Both before and after Tara’s death, threatening messages were sent to a number of women, mainly to artists and activists. Some of the messages warned: “You’re next, next Thursday.” Fear filled many hearts. Some families even pushed their daughters, and sometimes sons, to leave the country - at least temporarily. Others remained, but stopped their activism and disappeared from social media. Faten Khalil describes herself as a feminist activist, and became well-known in Iraq after doing a TV interview about child marriage. Faten decided to leave Iraq shortly after Tara’s death and is now seeking asylum in Turkey. She says she received death threats on her Instagram account, saying: “You’ll be next.” Faten Khalil Another woman, who does not want to reveal either her name or her field of art, also fled. Some time before Tara’s death she received a threatening note and decided to leave and deactivate all her social media accounts. She had been getting hostile comments, such as: “What you are doing is haram [prohibited in Islam].” Her parents felt she should leave town until things were calmer. “Baghdad is tiring, annoying and harmful, but I love it. I don’t know how to explain it,” she says. Hanaa Edwar, an Iraqi activist in her 70s, believes that with the defeat of IS in Iraq in the summer of 2017, something changed. The country was regaining its normality, and women became more visible. But some groups, which she did not identify, were not pleased with this. They wanted women to withdraw from public life. “I will never forget the fireworks that coloured again the sky over many cities across Iraq on New Year’s Eve. Men, women and children filled the streets. People became again optimistic,” she remembers. She points to the increase in the number of women who participated in the parliamentary elections in May 2018 - the first one after the fall of IS. This was despite harassment and abuse from men angry at the cheerful, confident faces of women appearing on posters. Hanaa Edwar Video of sexual content said to be of female candidates were leaked in an attempt to scare them and push them away from the public arena, Hanaa says. In the end, though, more than a quarter of those in Iraq’s parliament were women - a proportion that is higher than in the US. “Women have taken part in everything from anti-corruption protests to the opening of galleries,” says Hanaa. But “society is not ready yet to accept this,” Loubna, the lecturer, says. When Loubna returned to Baghdad, she also noticed that life had changed - women were more visible in public spaces. “The NGOs played a big role in bringing women back to the public spaces. Women have reclaimed their place through their work,” Loubna said. Women’s clothes are a good reflection of how things are. In al-Mansour, a central neighbourhood of Baghdad, Loubna wears a T-shirt with jeans. In al-Sadr city, she wears a long shirt, wide trousers, and an Abaya - a loose, flowing, outer garment. In Kurdistan’s al-Sulaimania she feels as she does in Istanbul, where she says no-one notices women’s attire. “What has happened recently shows that the women are playing a role bigger than the one tolerated by the society,” Loubna says. “They fear women.” Six months after her death, Tara’s killers have not been brought to justice. Her case, which was on the front pages in Iraq at the time, now seems largely forgotten. Even for those most affected by her death, life goes on. It always has, through all the tribulations which the country has endured. As Sary puts it: “We Iraqis have overcome horrible incidents. We learned to keep thinking only of the future.” (Above: A mourner at the grave of Tara Fares) Iraq has no shortage of unsolved murders. There were many different theories for why Tara Fares was murdered and who might have done it. Hanaa Edwar says two young men said to be close to Tara were charged with her murder but released by a judge in February because of a lack of evidence. It has not been possible to confirm this. “Just like most crimes here in Iraq, this case will be closed and the perpetrator will never be identified,” she says. “I am deeply sad and angry at this rampant insecurity.” The case is complicated, says Hussein Allawi, a lecturer on national security at Baghdad’s al-Nahrain University. He says the timing of the killing might explain why it hasn’t been solved. “She was killed in a transitional period when the government was about to change.” A month after Tara was killed, the Iraqi parliament ratified the assignment of new ministers - but the ministries of interior, defence and justice remained vacant. Even now Adel Abdul Mahdi, the prime minister, also acts as interior minister. He has announced: “We will work on restricting weapons to be only in the hands of the state. We will work on putting an end to the security chaos.” Since Tara was killed, only one person was allowed to speak on behalf of the authorities - Maj Gen Saad Maan - and he will not comment on the case. “We are used to the security authorities not revealing the [results] of ongoing investigations,” says Allawi. There are only two options, he says: “The killer has either not been identified, or the name is not announced to the public yet.” Hanaa Edwar says some kind of pressure is exercised over the interior ministry. “Horrible secrets lie behind these killings.” She refers to the killers as “ghosts”. Efforts are being made to improve the security situation, but targeted killings of both men and women continue. 2018: Iraqi federal police on patrol in Baghdad After Tara’s death, on 12 October, a teenage boy was killed because he was suspected of being gay. On 2 February 2019, four months after the killing of Tara, the Iraqi novelist, Alaa Mashzoub, 51, was shot dead by an unknown assailant in Karbala, in southern Baghdad. But the lack of security doesn’t stop people carrying on with their lives. Loubna, the young lecturer, says: “Beauty centres are open as usual, life is normal, people go to malls and party.” She says she noticed that “the cultural landscape has revitalised in Baghdad”. She is now participating in some social forums and feminist clubs. A mall in Baghdad But the path of some people has completely changed. “Although I never met her or followed her, Tara has changed my life in one way or another,” says Faten. “She shared a clip of a TV interview I did on her social media pages and commented ‘Bless her’. Also, once I wrote defending her when people were bullying her.” Faten is still waiting to hear about her asylum application in Turkey. She is now running a small online boutique, where she buys Turkish clothes and sells them to Iraqis, until she can find a job. Life has not been easy, but Faten doesn’t regret leaving Iraq. “I felt that the state is unable to protect its citizens. Only the elite and high-profile are protected. We, the ordinary people, are remembered just for votes. “I can express my opinions freely from here,” she says. “There, I had to think of every single word I said. I was threatened despite the fact that I never criticised any political or religious group. “I don’t want be killed in Iraq, I don’t want people to write bad comments about me. “We were not born and raised in a healthy environment. We have seen killings, explosions, ISIS beheading people, and displacement. “Baghdad is like a ticking time-bomb. It can appear calm and normal, but then something big happens. We are used to it.” Built with Shorthand"
UK jet skier arrested 'fleeing Australia',"The man had left from the northern tip of Australia's mainland, police say A British man wanted on drugs charges has been arrested off a remote island in Australia while trying to flee the country on a jet ski, authorities say. The 57-year-old was taken into custody on Saibai Island, just 4km (2.5 miles) south of Papua New Guinea, after travelling 150km from north Australia. The man was found on mudflats and there were reports he had been carrying a crossbow and other supplies. He is expected to be taken to Western Australia. ""This arrest sends a strong message to would-be fugitives - our reach across Australia is second to none,"" an Australian Federal Police spokesperson said. Police said the man, who has not been officially named, had launched his jet ski on Monday from Punsand Bay in Queensland. The man was tracked by federal and state police on an Australian Border Force vessel. Saibai Island is one of a string of islands in the Torres Strait which belong to Australia.

India 'is space power' after missile test,"India's election is nearly over: voting began on 11 April, and the final ballot was cast on 19 May with results out on 23 May. Every day, the BBC will be bringing you all the latest updates on the twists and turns of the world's largest democracy. What happened? The governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has told opposition parties to accept ""defeat with grace"" after a slew of exit polls suggested that the ruling party would get a comfortable majority and form the next government. Opposition parties have not only rejected the the exit polls but have also raised concerns of vote fraud. A number of videos, allegedly showing Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) being tampered with, went viral on social media on Tuesday. These prompted several leaders from opposition parties to meet election officials to raise their concerns. They have demanded more transparency in the counting process. But the BJP has rejected their concerns. ""EVM is good when Mamata Banerjee became West Bengal chief minister twice and Amarinder Singh became Punjab chief minister. If they win, EVM is good. But when there is expectation that we will win because people of this country want Narendra Modi to be prime minister again, then EVM is unreliable. The BJP condemns their (opposition) conduct and will tell humbly to accept their defeat with grace,"" Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. Why does this matter? These allegations have left a bitter taste in the aftermath of the mammoth election in the world's largest democracy, souring what should have been a triumphant achievement for the  Election Commission (EC). The bitter war of words between the ruling and opposition parties ahead of counting day on Thursday forced the EC to issue a series of ""confidence-building"" statements. Opposition parties said the EC was ""yet to come out with a mechanism"" to deal with a mismatch between an EVM result and the corresponding paper trail. During voting, EVMs are connected to a Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machine, which dispenses a slip of paper with the symbol of the party the voter selected. The Supreme Court has ordered the EC to tally the results from five EVMs with VVPAT receipts in at least five polling stations in every assembly seat. A parliamentary constituency comprises several assembly seats. But opposition parties say that the tally should be done for the entire constituency in case of a mismatch. On Tuesday: India poll officials deny 'vote fraud' More than 1.5 million e-voting machines will be used in the summer elections What happened? India's Election Commission has denied allegations that voting machines had been tampered with in parts of India. India's opposition parties are meeting the election watchdog on Tuesday to demand more transparency in counting of votes on 23 May (Thursday). Opposition leaders said the EC had to ensure that there was no possibility of anybody manipulating the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) which were used to record votes in the general election that concluded on Sunday. In Uttar Pradesh's Ghazipur constituency, a candidate belonging to the opposition Bahujan Samaj Party held a protest outside a room where the machines have been stored ahead of the counting. The candidate alleged that attempts were being made to take out the machines from the storage room. Local officials have said the allegations are baseless. Allow Twitter content?

In Chandauli constituency, supporters of Samajwadi Party have circulated a mobile phone clip, alleging that some machines were being brought to the counting station on Monday, a day after the election. Local officials have said the machines shown in the video are reserve machines which had been brought from another part of the constituency because of logistical reasons. The Election Commission has insisted that ""proper security and protocol"" was maintained in storing the electronic voting machines. Why does this matter? The move comes after a slew of exit polls predicted that the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would get a comfortable majority in parliament to form a government. Sitaram Yechury from the Left Front said the EC was ""yet to come out with a mechanism"" to deal with a mismatch between an EVM result and the corresponding paper trail. During voting, EVMs are connected to a Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machine, which dispenses a slip of paper with the symbol of the party the voter selected. The Supreme Court has ordered the EC to tally the results from five EVMs with VVPAT receipts in at least five polling stations in every assembly seat. A parliamentary constituency comprises several assembly seats. But opposition parties say that the tally should done for the entire constituency in case of a mismatch. ""On VVPATs and the EVM tally, the EC is yet to come out with a procedure in case there is a mismatch. Even if there is one mismatch in the EVMs or VVPAT samples picked for counting, to maintain the integrity of the electoral process, all VVPATs in that Assembly segment must be counted. This is important to maintain integrity of the electoral process,"" Mr Yechury said. If this were to happen however, it would considerably slow down the counting process and declaration of results. What happened? Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tweeted on the occasion of the death anniversary of former PM Rajiv Gandhi. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Modi has repeatedly attacked Mr Gandhi on the campaign trail and his slurs have prompted widespread criticism. He called Mr Gandhi the ""number one corrupt man in the country"" at a rally earlier this month in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. A few days later, he went after Mr Gandhi again - accusing him of using a naval aircraft carrier to take him and his family to an island for a ""family holiday"". Mr Gandhi was assassinated by a suicide bomber in 1991 during a campaign rally. Why does this matter? Mr Modi's tweet marking Mr Gandhi's death anniversary is customary - but it has garnered attention because he attacked the former prime minister repeatedly while campaigning and didn't back down when challenged. Many were taken aback by Mr Modi's criticism of Mr Gandhi. It elicited condemnation not just from the main opposition Congress party, but other regional opposition leaders, political commentators and even former political opponents of Mr Gandhi. Analysts said the comments were a sign of ""desperation"" and showed that Mr Modi ""knew"" his party was not going to perform as well as expected in the election. Now that campaigning is over and the election is nearly at an end, Mr Modi seems to be abandoning acerbic rhetoric for something more conciliatory. What happened? Opposition leaders have dismissed the exit polls, which suggest that the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is on course to win the general election. Allow Twitter content?

A slew of exit polls released on Sunday predict big wins for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).  The highest poll prediction for the NDA is 365 seats, and the lowest is 242. An average of all exit polls gives the NDA 295 seats. Any party or coalition needs at least 272 seats to secure a majority in parliament and form a government. The BJP welcomed the prediction and many of its leaders congratulated party workers' efforts on social media. Why does this matter? Exit polls have to be taken with caution because they have been wrong in the past - a fact that opposition leaders were quick to point out. Allow Twitter content?

The BJP is locked in a fierce electoral battle with the Congress and a clutch of regional parties in various states. But the trends suggest that the opposition's strategy may have failed. The most surprising prediction has come from the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), which sends 80 MPs to parliament - more than any other. So the state always holds the key to who forms the government - in 2014, the BJP won 71 seats. Analysts had predicted that powerful regional parties would comfortably defeat the BJP this time around. But most of the exit polls suggest the party will perform much better than expected in UP - winning anything between 38 to 68 seats. Only two polls - Nielsen-ABP and NewsX-Neta - have predicted that the BJP would lose at least 40 seats in UP to regional parties. Nielsen-ABP says the NDA will win 22 seats in the state, while NewsX-Neta gives the coalition only 33 seats. These are the the only two polls which predict that the BJP-led alliance could fall short of an outright majority. Can Rahul Gandhi unseat PM Modi?

Craft workers 'need their own titles',"Titles should be given to people with advanced craft skills, a think tank says, in the same way that an academic with a PhD is called ""Doctor"". The Social Market Foundation wants people who complete high-level apprenticeships to be called ""master craftsman"" or ""master craftswoman"". The intention is to give better public recognition to vocational skills. Report author Nicole Gicheva says it would redress the ""cultural bias"" against technical qualifications. The use of titles could be a way of showing the different standards of craft skills, says the report, sponsored by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, which promotes technical training and careers guidance. The levels of apprenticeships are ""poorly understood"" by the public, the think tank says - and introducing titles could be a way of showing people's achievements. Those who have vocational qualifications equivalent to a university degree could be known as ""craftsman"" or ""craftswoman"", the think tank says. The exhausting road to my apprenticeship dream Firms re-labelling jobs as apprenticeships Eight things about apprenticeships But those who have advanced further could be known as ""master craftsman"" or ""master craftswoman"". The report points to the example of Germany, where a ""meister"" will have achieved high professional qualifications. Hairdressing is one of the most popular apprenticeships There is also a historical precedent, of medieval guilds, in which tradesmen could become ""master craftsmen"". The report highlights the wide range of skill levels spanned by the term ""apprentice"" - and the difference in likely benefit in earnings. The analysis says that many on the lower levels will have no real extra benefit in earnings - while those on higher levels of training will see a significant boost to their wages. But it warns that the most common apprenticeships are those likely to ""deliver the lowest returns"", including those working in care, hairdressing and customer service. The report says that potential candidates for such training should have a clearer idea of how the system works. ""The best apprenticeships are highly challenging and prestigious qualifications which deliver significant returns to their holders, while some other apprenticeships do not. We need a better system to explain those differences,"" said Ms Gicheva. Sir Gerry Berragan, chief executive of the Institute for Apprenticeships, said that improving the ""public perception"" of apprenticeships was ""extremely important"" and that they should have a ""prestigious status at all levels"". But Sir Gerry said ""careful thought"" would needed over any titles used in job areas which were not traditionally seen as crafts. ""The term 'master craftsman' would not necessarily cover the wide range of modern apprenticeships now available - which for example cover professions such as legal, finance and accounting and the health sector,"" he said. TheNational Audit Office earlier this month, in a report on apprenticeships,external, said there had been a shift to emphasise ""quality and meeting employers' needs"". But the report warned ""there are risks that the programme is subsidising training that would have happened without government funding"". The spending watchdog said Â£1.6bn had been spent on the apprenticeship programme in 2017-18 - but the number of apprenticeship starts was 26% lower than 2015-16 and the target of three million apprenticeship starts by 2020 was ""very unlikely"" to be met.

UK set to adopt vehicle speed limitersThe EU plans to make the technology mandatory from 2022 and the UK says it will follow suit.,"Speed limiting technology looks set to become mandatory for all vehicles sold in Europe from 2022, after new rules were provisionally agreed by the EU. The Department for Transport said the system would also apply in the UK, despite Brexit. Campaigners welcomed the move, saying it would save thousands of lives. Road safety charity Brake called it a ""landmark day"", but the AA said ""a little speed"" helped with overtaking or joining motorways. Safety measures approved by the European Commission included intelligent speed assistance (ISA), advanced emergency braking and lane-keeping technology. The EU says the plan could help avoid 140,000 serious injuries by 2038 and aims ultimately to cut road deaths to zero by 2050. Road deaths 'part of city living' Tougher speeding fines come into force Is the driving test getting more difficult? EU Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska said: ""Every year, 25,000 people lose their lives on our roads. The vast majority of these accidents are caused by human error. ""With the new advanced safety features that will become mandatory, we can have the same kind of impact as when safety belts were first introduced."" Under the ISA system, cars receive information via GPS and a digital map, telling the vehicle what the speed limit is. This can be combined with a video camera capable of recognising road signs. The system can be overridden temporarily. If a car is overtaking a lorry on a motorway and enters a lower speed-limit area, the driver can push down hard on the accelerator to complete the manoeuvre. A full on/off switch for the system is also envisaged, but this would lapse every time the vehicle is restarted. It's already coming into use. Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Peugeot-Citroen, Renault and Volvo already have models available with some of the ISA technology fitted. However, there is concern over whether current technology is sufficiently advanced for the system to work effectively. In particular, many cars already have a forward-facing camera, but there is a question mark over whether the sign-recognition technology is up to scratch. Other approved safety features for European cars, vans, trucks and buses include technology which provides a warning of driver drowsiness and distraction, such as when using a smartphone while driving, and a data recorder in case of an accident. This video can not be played Theo Leggett: 'The car brought us to a controlled halt' Theo Leggett, business correspondent The idea that cars will be fitted with speed limiters - or to put it more accurately, ""intelligent speed assistance"" - is likely to upset a lot of drivers. Many of us are happy to break limits when it suits us and don't like the idea of Big Brother stepping in. However, the new system as it's currently envisaged will not force drivers to slow down. It is there to encourage them to do so, and to make them aware of what the limit is, but it can be overridden. Much like the cruise control in many current cars will hold a particular speed, or prevent you exceeding it, until you stamp on the accelerator. So it'll still be a free-for-all for speeding motorists then? Not quite. Under the new rules, cars will also be fitted with compulsory data recorders, or ""black boxes"". So if you have an accident, the police and your insurance company will know whether you've been going too fast. If you've been keeping your foot down and routinely ignoring the car's warnings, they may take a very dim view of your actions. In fact, it's this ""spy on board"" which may ultimately have a bigger impact on driver behaviour than any kind of speed limiter. It's easy to get away with reckless driving when there's only a handful of traffic cops around to stop you. Much harder when there's a spy in the cab recording your every move. All of this may well reduce accidents, but it won't eliminate them. You can force people to slow down, you can watch what they're doing, you can help them with emergency braking - but you can't get rid of basic bad driving. Unless, of course, you have self-driving cars. The move was welcomed by the European Transport Safety Council, an independent body which advises Brussels on transport safety matters. But it said it could be several months before the European Parliament and Council formally approve the measures. The European Parliament will not be able to consider the provisional rules until after its elections take place in May. UK statistics showmore than 1,700 people are killed on UK roads every year,external, while Brake says speed is a contributory factor in about a quarter of all fatal crashes. Brake's campaigns director, Joshua Harris, said: ""This is a landmark day for road safety. ""These measures will provide the biggest leap forward for road safety this century."" The UK's Department for Transport said: ""We continuously work with partners across the globe to improve the safety standards of all vehicles. These interventions are expected to deliver a step-change in road safety across Europe, including the UK."" The Association of British Insurers held out the possibility that premiums could be reduced as a result. It said: ""Motor insurers support measures aimed at improving road safety. Any steps that can be shown to make our roads safer, reducing road crashes and insurance claims, can be reflected in the cost of motor insurance."" The AA thinks the system might have the unintended consequence of making drivers more reckless, not less. AA president Edmund King said there was no doubt that new in-car technology could save lives, adding there was ""a good case"" for autonomous emergency braking to be fitted in all cars. ""When it comes to intelligent speed adaptation, the case is not so clear,"" he said. ""The best speed limiter is the driver's right foot. ""The right speed is often below the speed limit - for example, outside a school with children about - but with ISA, there may be a temptation to go at the top speed allowed."" Mr King added: ""Dodgem cars are all fitted with speed limiters, but they still seem to crash."" The car that won't let you crash it.

Tate Modern becomes top UK attraction,"Tate Modern's hit shows in 2018 included a major Picasso exhibition The British Museum has lost its crown as the UK's most popular visitor attraction for the first time in a decade, overtaken by Tate Modern. Almost 5.9 million people visited the Tate Modern art gallery last year, new figures show - just above the 5.8 million who went to the British Museum. Elsewhere, an exhibition of Terracotta Warriors helped visitor numbers to Liverpool's World Museum jump by 111%. Terracotta Warriors at Liverpool's World Museum That made it the most-visited English museum outside London in 2018. According to the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva), the World Museum was visited by 1.4 million people in 2018 - 610,000 of whom saw the ancient Chinese statues. It was 23rd on the overall national list, above Tate Britain and London Zoo. BeyoncÃ© help boosts Louvre visitors Banksy's 'Diana Â£10 note' goes to British Museum The art exhibition that forces you to cry (literally) Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery also saw a big rise, thanks partly to the visit by ""Dippy"" the Diplodocus. The replica dinosaur skeleton was in Birmingham for five months as part of its three-year tour from the Natural History Museum. Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery welcomed 832,000 people in 2018 - up 38% on the previous year. The new branch of the V&A in Dundee received 341,265 visits between its opening in September and the end of the year. Tate Modern, which staged blockbuster exhibitions by Picasso and Modigliani last year, is top of the overall list for the first time since it opened in 2000. Despite the overall rise in visitor numbers, some outdoor attractions had a dip - mostly blamed on the extreme cold spell early in the year. The country's second most popular garden, RHS Garden Wisley in Surrey saw its visitor numbers drop by more than 70,000. The Eden Project in Cornwall; ZSL Whipsnade Zoo, Bedfordshire; Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire; and Chatsworth House, Derbyshire also all saw a drop in visits. ""I wish tourism was slightly more sophisticated, but weather has always been a determining factor on where people go,"" said Alva director Bernard Donoghue. Alva also said the World Cup period had also led to a fall in visitors to some attractions. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

During voting, EVMs are connected to a Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machine, which dispenses a slip of paper with the symbol of the party the voter selected. The Supreme Court has ordered the EC to tally the results from five EVMs with VVPAT receipts in at least five polling stations in every assembly seat. A parliamentary constituency comprises several assembly seats. But opposition parties say that the tally should done for the entire constituency in case of a mismatch. ""On VVPATs and the EVM tally, the EC is yet to come out with a procedure in case there is a mismatch. Even if there is one mismatch in the EVMs or VVPAT samples picked for counting, to maintain the integrity of the electoral process, all VVPATs in that Assembly segment must be counted. This is important to maintain integrity of the electoral process,"" Mr Yechury said. If this were to happen however, it would considerably slow down the counting process and declaration of results. What happened? Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tweeted on the occasion of the death anniversary of former PM Rajiv Gandhi. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Modi has repeatedly attacked Mr Gandhi on the campaign trail and his slurs have prompted widespread criticism. He called Mr Gandhi the ""number one corrupt man in the country"" at a rally earlier this month in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. A few days later, he went after Mr Gandhi again - accusing him of using a naval aircraft carrier to take him and his family to an island for a ""family holiday"". Mr Gandhi was assassinated by a suicide bomber in 1991 during a campaign rally. Why does this matter? Mr Modi's tweet marking Mr Gandhi's death anniversary is customary - but it has garnered attention because he attacked the former prime minister repeatedly while campaigning and didn't back down when challenged. Many were taken aback by Mr Modi's criticism of Mr Gandhi. It elicited condemnation not just from the main opposition Congress party, but other regional opposition leaders, political commentators and even former political opponents of Mr Gandhi. Analysts said the comments were a sign of ""desperation"" and showed that Mr Modi ""knew"" his party was not going to perform as well as expected in the election. Now that campaigning is over and the election is nearly at an end, Mr Modi seems to be abandoning acerbic rhetoric for something more conciliatory. What happened? Opposition leaders have dismissed the exit polls, which suggest that the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is on course to win the general election. Allow Twitter content?

A slew of exit polls released on Sunday predict big wins for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).  The highest poll prediction for the NDA is 365 seats, and the lowest is 242. An average of all exit polls gives the NDA 295 seats. Any party or coalition needs at least 272 seats to secure a majority in parliament and form a government. The BJP welcomed the prediction and many of its leaders congratulated party workers' efforts on social media. Why does this matter? Exit polls have to be taken with caution because they have been wrong in the past - a fact that opposition leaders were quick to point out. Allow Twitter content?

The BJP is locked in a fierce electoral battle with the Congress and a clutch of regional parties in various states. But the trends suggest that the opposition's strategy may have failed. The most surprising prediction has come from the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), which sends 80 MPs to parliament - more than any other. So the state always holds the key to who forms the government - in 2014, the BJP won 71 seats. Analysts had predicted that powerful regional parties would comfortably defeat the BJP this time around. But most of the exit polls suggest the party will perform much better than expected in UP - winning anything between 38 to 68 seats. Only two polls - Nielsen-ABP and NewsX-Neta - have predicted that the BJP would lose at least 40 seats in UP to regional parties. Nielsen-ABP says the NDA will win 22 seats in the state, while NewsX-Neta gives the coalition only 33 seats. These are the the only two polls which predict that the BJP-led alliance could fall short of an outright majority. Can Rahul Gandhi unseat PM Modi?

"Scotland takes a different fracking pathAs Scotland delays its decision on a fracking ban, shale gas has already been extracted in England.Scotland","This video can not be played Women, symbolically dressed in white, turn up at the fracking site in Lancashire to protest daily A lot has changed in the UK's shale gas sector since the Scottish government put the brakes on it back in 2015. But despite what you might have heard from politicians, it's still not technically banned in Scotland. An ""effective ban"" announced in 2017, which uses planning legislation to stop associated development, was followed by a judicial ruling that no ban existed. Despite a promise to sort it once and for all by Holyrood's Easter recess, a final decision has been delayed again. Fracking ban decision delayed by Scottish government What is fracking and why is it controversial? Scottish ministers who sanctioned one of the world's most extensive series of reports into the impact of fracking have now decided they need a fresh consultation. Friends of the Earth Scotland said it was time to stop the ""dilly-dallying"". The drilling rig at Preston New Road shale gas exploration site South of the border, where the Tory government supports it, the march of fracking has continued. At the Preston New Road site in Lancashire, operator Cuadrilla has even managed to get the gas flowing. But the objections have continued too. For close to two years the ""women in white"" have gathered to protest at the site's entrance; a little bit of industry in a relatively rural setting. They walk half a mile or so to the gates with a police escort and the frequent ""toots"" of support from passing drivers. They might have lost the battle at this particular site but their defiance suggests they feel the war isn't lost. Barbara Richardson did not think the protest against fracking would take so long Barbara Richardson is one of the most high profile objectors and says it's been a long haul. She said: ""I never envisaged it would last this long at all, I mean I've personally been involved for five years now and it's virtually taken over my life. ""And you know the struggle still goes on, but I have noticed a change and the industry is finding it more and more difficult to find social licence. ""They're having more and more problems as we go along so there's a big change from five years ago when I first started."" A poet urges solidarity against fracking during the protest During our visit a travelling poet urges solidarity among the crowd. ""Oh England, don't they fear the way you shake?"" he recites. From poetry to full-on protests, local people at sites across England have been doing their bit to frustrate the industry's progress. And here they believe that tactic is working. Protester Miranda Cox said the protest had delayed fracking Protester Miranda Cox said: ""It's made a big difference actually. I know we've held this site up for several months. ""They're behind schedule and they will run out of planning permission at the end of this year so we know that they haven't achieved exactly what they'd hoped to in the timeframe they had."" The shale gas extraction at Preston New Road lasted just a matter of weeks before Cuadrilla called it off. They're now having their own fight with the UK government over whether rules on earth tremors can be relaxed. The immediate communities might be against drilling but the opposition isn't universal. Operator Cuadrilla has managed to get the gas flowing at its Preston New Road site In nearby Blackpool there's a desperate need for high quality jobs. It's one of Britain's most socially-deprived towns and some think a new industry is exactly what's needed. There's even talk of an ""economic renaissance"" to reverse the region's woes. Lee Petts said the jobs from shale gas could help the area transform itself Businessman Lee Petts represents Lancashire for Shale which supports the industry. He told me: ""Blackpool is pretty central to Lancashire's visitor economy and has been for a long time but it's full of very low-skilled, low-paid jobs on zero hours contracts. ""That's not great for young people with ambition and something like shale on the doorstep, that can bring an influx potentially of very highly-skilled, well-paid jobs with prospects, could really help Blackpool to transform itself in the future."" You don't need one of the seaside resort's clairvoyants to work out whether the Scottish government will seek to ban fracking permanently. But previous attempts to do so have proved stormy, resulting in a protracted court battle. The biggest question will be whether ministers can stop fracking without another legal fight. Protesters in Lancashire urge ministers to go for it. Miranda Cox added: ""I know the Scottish government have spent a lot of time, many years, looking into this industry and looking at the risks and the harms and I would say stick to your guns."" The Scottish government's next move on fracking is much anticipated. It won't now come until later in the year but it will be watched closely north and south of the border.

"Craft workers 'need their own titles'Skilled workers should be called ""master craftsman"" or ""master craftswoman"", a think tank says.","Titles should be given to people with advanced craft skills, a think tank says, in the same way that an academic with a PhD is called ""Doctor"". The Social Market Foundation wants people who complete high-level apprenticeships to be called ""master craftsman"" or ""master craftswoman"". The intention is to give better public recognition to vocational skills. Report author Nicole Gicheva says it would redress the ""cultural bias"" against technical qualifications. The use of titles could be a way of showing the different standards of craft skills, says the report, sponsored by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, which promotes technical training and careers guidance. The levels of apprenticeships are ""poorly understood"" by the public, the think tank says - and introducing titles could be a way of showing people's achievements. Those who have vocational qualifications equivalent to a university degree could be known as ""craftsman"" or ""craftswoman"", the think tank says. The exhausting road to my apprenticeship dream Firms re-labelling jobs as apprenticeships Eight things about apprenticeships But those who have advanced further could be known as ""master craftsman"" or ""master craftswoman"". The report points to the example of Germany, where a ""meister"" will have achieved high professional qualifications. Hairdressing is one of the most popular apprenticeships There is also a historical precedent, of medieval guilds, in which tradesmen could become ""master craftsmen"". The report highlights the wide range of skill levels spanned by the term ""apprentice"" - and the difference in likely benefit in earnings. The analysis says that many on the lower levels will have no real extra benefit in earnings - while those on higher levels of training will see a significant boost to their wages. But it warns that the most common apprenticeships are those likely to ""deliver the lowest returns"", including those working in care, hairdressing and customer service. The report says that potential candidates for such training should have a clearer idea of how the system works. ""The best apprenticeships are highly challenging and prestigious qualifications which deliver significant returns to their holders, while some other apprenticeships do not. We need a better system to explain those differences,"" said Ms Gicheva. Sir Gerry Berragan, chief executive of the Institute for Apprenticeships, said that improving the ""public perception"" of apprenticeships was ""extremely important"" and that they should have a ""prestigious status at all levels"". But Sir Gerry said ""careful thought"" would needed over any titles used in job areas which were not traditionally seen as crafts. ""The term 'master craftsman' would not necessarily cover the wide range of modern apprenticeships now available - which for example cover professions such as legal, finance and accounting and the health sector,"" he said. TheNational Audit Office earlier this month, in a report on apprenticeships,external, said there had been a shift to emphasise ""quality and meeting employers' needs"". But the report warned ""there are risks that the programme is subsidising training that would have happened without government funding"". The spending watchdog said Â£1.6bn had been spent on the apprenticeship programme in 2017-18 - but the number of apprenticeship starts was 26% lower than 2015-16 and the target of three million apprenticeship starts by 2020 was ""very unlikely"" to be met.

Austria probes far-right activist over NZ links,"Martin Sellner has denied any involvement in the Christchurch attacks Austrian investigators have raided the home of the leader of a far-right group in connection with the investigation into the New Zealand mosque attacks. Martin Sellner, of the Identitarian Movement Austria (IBÃ), said in a video he had received a donation, possibly from the chief suspect in the Christchurch shootings. But he denied any involvement in the attacks. Fifty people died and dozens more wounded in the 15 March shootings. Australian Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old self-proclaimed white supremacist, has been charged with one murder and is expected to face further charges. Martin Sellner: The new face of the far right in Europe Anti-Islam activists refused entry to the UK In a video posted online on Monday, Mr Sellner said he had received an email containing a ""disproportionally large"" donation from a person named ""Tarrant"". He said he had sent a ""thank you"" reply as he did with other donations. ""I have nothing to do with this terror attack,"" Mr Sellner said, adding that his organisation was a peaceful anti-immigration group. He said investigators raided his flat in Vienna on Monday and seized his phone, computer and other devices. Interior ministry spokesman Christoph PÃ¶lzl said the search had been carried out by anti-terrorism officers on the orders of the prosecutor's office in the city of Graz, which is investigating the case. A spokesman for the prosecutor's office said they had noticed the suspicious email address while investigating a donation of about â¬1,500 (Â£1,290; $1,700) to the IBÃ. Austrian authorities confirmed last week that Brenton Tarrant had visited the country, possibly last November, although details of his stay there are unknown. Mr Sellner has become one of the most prominent young activists of the far right in Europe. In March last yearhe and his girlfriend Brittany Pettibone - an alt-right vlogger and conspiracy theorist - were refused entry to the UK. The authorities said their presence in the UK would not have been ""conducive to the public good"".

"UK jet skier arrested 'fleeing Australia'The man, who faces drug charges, was captured near Papua New Guinea reportedly carrying a crossbow.Australia","The man had left from the northern tip of Australia's mainland, police say A British man wanted on drugs charges has been arrested off a remote island in Australia while trying to flee the country on a jet ski, authorities say. The 57-year-old was taken into custody on Saibai Island, just 4km (2.5 miles) south of Papua New Guinea, after travelling 150km from north Australia. The man was found on mudflats and there were reports he had been carrying a crossbow and other supplies. He is expected to be taken to Western Australia. ""This arrest sends a strong message to would-be fugitives - our reach across Australia is second to none,"" an Australian Federal Police spokesperson said. Police said the man, who has not been officially named, had launched his jet ski on Monday from Punsand Bay in Queensland. The man was tracked by federal and state police on an Australian Border Force vessel. Saibai Island is one of a string of islands in the Torres Strait which belong to Australia.

MPs prepare bid to break Brexit deadlock,"MPs had half an hour to fill out the ballot paper MPs are awaiting the results of votes on eight different proposals for the future of Brexit. Options they are considering include leaving without a deal, a customs union and a confirmatory referendum. Speaker John Bercow will announce what support there is for each later after MPs took over the Commons timetable. Theresa May has promised to stand down as prime minister if her own deal is approved, prompting several Tory Brexiteers to say they will back it. Meanwhile, MPs have approved the legislation required to change the date of Brexit from 29 March - after the EU agreed to give the UK an extension last week. Friday had long been the day written into law for the UK to leave the EU but the Commons approved a statutory instrument - by 441 votes to 105 - changing the deadline to 22 May if a withdrawal agreement is passed this week; or 12 April if it is not. The prime minister is still trying to drum up support for her withdrawal agreement despite it being voted down by a large margin twice and the DUP saying they still cannot vote for it. The government is seeking the support of MPs for the Commons to convene on Friday, if necessary, amid reports a third vote on the PM's deal could be held then. Live: MPs debate way forward for Brexit What are indicative votes? How the indicative vote process will work Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict But Mr Bercow reiterated his earlier warnings that the PM's deal could not come back for a vote if it had not significantly changed. He said the government ""should not seek to circumvent my ruling"" by introducing procedures that could reverse his judgement. This video can not be played John Bercow: ""I do expect the government to meet the test of change."" But a Downing Street spokesman said there had been a ""significant development"" at the summit in Brussels last week, after Mrs May agreed ""extra reassurances"" over the Irish backstop with the EU, and the date of exit had changed.

MPs are currently voting on a statutory instrument to confirm a delay, after the UK was given until 12 April to propose a different way forward if the current agreement cannot get through Parliament and until 22 May to finalise Brexit if the deal is passed. Earlier on Wednesday, MPs took control of parliamentary business from the government for several hours as they attempt to find a majority for the next steps in the Brexit process. Conservative backbencher Sir Oliver Letwin, whose cross-party proposal ushered in today's debate, said the only way leaving the EU with no-deal can be prevented is by crystallising an alternative majority and trying to carry it forward. He said that if MPs supported the prime minister's deal in another meaningful vote this would be ""the easy route"". But he added that he ""profoundly hopes"" that if on Monday there is a majority view in favour of a particular position, that the government will say that it will carry that forward. By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondent Never afraid of stoking controversy, the Speaker has again infuriated many Tory MPs with his latest surprise pronouncement to the Commons. Just as it seemed the government was poised to try and get its Brexit deal through again, John Bercow took it upon himself to tick ministers off before they had even tried. Why? Because last week he ruled the deal could not be brought back to the Commons for a third time without ""substantial"" changes. No 10 will only bring the deal back for a third vote if it thinks it could pass. That probably requires DUP backing and a guarantee some Labour MPs will vote for it too. As it stands, there isn't yet a majority for the deal, but the mood is shifting fast. Read more from Ben here.

The Speaker of the House, John Bercow, chose eight to be voted on by MPs. They are: No-deal Brexit- Leave the EU on 12 April without a deal - Tory MP John Baron Common Market 2.0- The UK joins the European Economic Area and negotiates a temporary customs union until alternative arrangements can be found  - Tory MP Nick Boles EFTA/EEA- Similar to Common Market 2.0 but rejects any kind of customs union with the EU and says the Irish backstop must be replaced with alternative arrangements - Tory MP George Eustice Customs union- Calls for the UK to negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit - Tory MP Ken Clarke Labour's alternative plan- A customs union with the EU and ""close alignment"" with the single market - Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Revoke Article 50- Cancel Brexit if the UK gets within days of leaving without a deal. MPs would be asked to vote on a no-deal exit and if they rejected that, Article 50 would be revoked - SNP MP Joanna Cherry Confirmatory public vote- Parliament cannot ratify or implement any agreement on the UK's withdrawal and future relationship ""unless and until they have been approved by the people of the UK in a confirmatory public ballot"" - Labour MP Margaret Beckett Malthouse Plan B- The UK makes its budgetary contributions to the EU to the end of 2020 and agrees with the EU a period of two years in which UK goods have full access to the EU - Tory MP Marcus Fysh Read more on the Brexit options MPs are voting on After a four-hour debate on each proposal, MPs were given a piece of paper listing the options, and had to mark each one with a ""yes"" or ""no"". MPs used both lobbies for completing the ballots in a process that took about half an hour. Several MPs, including Tory Michael Fabricant and Lib Dem Jo Swinson, posted images of their forms on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Now:Debate on statutory instrument (SI) bringing Brexit delay into law 21:00:Vote on SI 21:30:The Speaker announces the results of the indicative votes - though he could announce them earlier during SI debate All times approx Conservative MPs were given a free vote, meaning they were able to support or reject any proposal without pressure from party whips. Cabinet ministers will be abstaining. The decision followed warnings that more than a dozen ministers might quit if they were told they had to follow party orders. Labour MPs are being whipped to support the party's own proposal, as well as motions on a customs union, Common Market 2.0 and a confirmatory public ballot. Mr Starmer told the Commons any deal ""needs further democratic approval"" before being enacted. But the move has angered Labour MPs in Brexit-vote constituencies, with Great Grimsby MP Melanie Onn reportedly resigning as a shadow housing minister.

"EU plans vehicle speed limiters from 2022The UK is urged to adopt similar rules to those provisionally approved by the EU, even after Brexit.Business","Speed limiting technology looks set to become mandatory for all vehicles sold in Europe from 2022, after new rules were provisionally agreed by the EU. The Department for Transport said the system would also apply in the UK, despite Brexit. Campaigners welcomed the move, saying it would save thousands of lives. Road safety charity Brake called it a ""landmark day"", but the AA said ""a little speed"" helped with overtaking or joining motorways. Safety measures approved by the European Commission included intelligent speed assistance (ISA), advanced emergency braking and lane-keeping technology. The EU says the plan could help avoid 140,000 serious injuries by 2038 and aims ultimately to cut road deaths to zero by 2050. Road deaths 'part of city living' Tougher speeding fines come into force Is the driving test getting more difficult? EU Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska said: ""Every year, 25,000 people lose their lives on our roads. The vast majority of these accidents are caused by human error. ""With the new advanced safety features that will become mandatory, we can have the same kind of impact as when safety belts were first introduced."" Under the ISA system, cars receive information via GPS and a digital map, telling the vehicle what the speed limit is. This can be combined with a video camera capable of recognising road signs. The system can be overridden temporarily. If a car is overtaking a lorry on a motorway and enters a lower speed-limit area, the driver can push down hard on the accelerator to complete the manoeuvre. A full on/off switch for the system is also envisaged, but this would lapse every time the vehicle is restarted. It's already coming into use. Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Peugeot-Citroen, Renault and Volvo already have models available with some of the ISA technology fitted. However, there is concern over whether current technology is sufficiently advanced for the system to work effectively. In particular, many cars already have a forward-facing camera, but there is a question mark over whether the sign-recognition technology is up to scratch. Other approved safety features for European cars, vans, trucks and buses include technology which provides a warning of driver drowsiness and distraction, such as when using a smartphone while driving, and a data recorder in case of an accident. This video can not be played Theo Leggett: 'The car brought us to a controlled halt' Theo Leggett, business correspondent The idea that cars will be fitted with speed limiters - or to put it more accurately, ""intelligent speed assistance"" - is likely to upset a lot of drivers. Many of us are happy to break limits when it suits us and don't like the idea of Big Brother stepping in. However, the new system as it's currently envisaged will not force drivers to slow down. It is there to encourage them to do so, and to make them aware of what the limit is, but it can be overridden. Much like the cruise control in many current cars will hold a particular speed, or prevent you exceeding it, until you stamp on the accelerator. So it'll still be a free-for-all for speeding motorists then? Not quite. Under the new rules, cars will also be fitted with compulsory data recorders, or ""black boxes"". So if you have an accident, the police and your insurance company will know whether you've been going too fast. If you've been keeping your foot down and routinely ignoring the car's warnings, they may take a very dim view of your actions. In fact, it's this ""spy on board"" which may ultimately have a bigger impact on driver behaviour than any kind of speed limiter. It's easy to get away with reckless driving when there's only a handful of traffic cops around to stop you. Much harder when there's a spy in the cab recording your every move. All of this may well reduce accidents, but it won't eliminate them. You can force people to slow down, you can watch what they're doing, you can help them with emergency braking - but you can't get rid of basic bad driving. Unless, of course, you have self-driving cars. The move was welcomed by the European Transport Safety Council, an independent body which advises Brussels on transport safety matters. But it said it could be several months before the European Parliament and Council formally approve the measures. The European Parliament will not be able to consider the provisional rules until after its elections take place in May. UK statistics showmore than 1,700 people are killed on UK roads every year,external, while Brake says speed is a contributory factor in about a quarter of all fatal crashes. Brake's campaigns director, Joshua Harris, said: ""This is a landmark day for road safety. ""These measures will provide the biggest leap forward for road safety this century."" The UK's Department for Transport said: ""We continuously work with partners across the globe to improve the safety standards of all vehicles. These interventions are expected to deliver a step-change in road safety across Europe, including the UK."" The Association of British Insurers held out the possibility that premiums could be reduced as a result. It said: ""Motor insurers support measures aimed at improving road safety. Any steps that can be shown to make our roads safer, reducing road crashes and insurance claims, can be reflected in the cost of motor insurance."" The AA thinks the system might have the unintended consequence of making drivers more reckless, not less. AA president Edmund King said there was no doubt that new in-car technology could save lives, adding there was ""a good case"" for autonomous emergency braking to be fitted in all cars. ""When it comes to intelligent speed adaptation, the case is not so clear,"" he said. ""The best speed limiter is the driver's right foot. ""The right speed is often below the speed limit - for example, outside a school with children about - but with ISA, there may be a temptation to go at the top speed allowed."" Mr King added: ""Dodgem cars are all fitted with speed limiters, but they still seem to crash."" The car that won't let you crash it.

"EU backs controversial copyright lawSharing memes and GIFs is still allowed under the new laws, after tweaks to allow ""parody"".TechnologyComments","'No meme is illegal': Protests were held against the copyright law changes Copyright laws which critics say could change the internet have been voted in by the European Parliament. The new rules, including the controversial Article 13, will hold tech firms responsible for material posted without copyright permission. Sharing memes and GIFs will still be allowed under the new laws. Many musicians and creators say the legislation will compensate artists fairly - but others argue that they will destroy user-generated content. Copyright is the legal right that allows an artist to protect how their original work is used. Tech companies have argued that artists are already paid fairly under the current system. Google said it would ""harm Europe's creative and digital industries"". What is the controversial Article 13? Why Europe's original copyright plan was so controversial High-profile figures who have campaigned against the EU Copyright Directive include Wyclef Jean and web inventor Sir Tim Berners Lee, while Debbie Harry and Sir Paul McCartney have been among its supporters. Web pioneer Sir Tim Berners-Lee has warned about the possible consequences of copyright changes It has taken several revisions for the current legislation, which was was backed by 348 MEPs, with 274 against, to reach its final form. It is now up to member states to approve the decision. If they do, they will have two years to implement it once it is officially published. The two clauses causing the most controversy are known as Article 11 and Article 13. Article 11 states that search engines and news aggregate platforms should pay to use links from news websites. Article 13 holds larger technology companies responsible for material posted without a copyright licence. Tech companies already remove music and videos which are copyrighted, but under the new laws they will be more liable for any copyrighted content. It means they would need to apply filters to content before it is uploaded. Article 13 does not include cloud storage services and there are already existing exemptions, including parody, which, for example, includes memes. It was Article 13 which prompted fears over the future of memes and GIFs - stills, animated or short video clips that go viral -  since they mainly rely on copyrighted scenes from TV and film. Critics claimed Article 13 would have made it nearly impossible to upload even the tiniest part of a copyrighted work to Facebook, YouTube, or any other site. However, specific tweaks to the law made earlier this year made memes safe ""for purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody and pastiche"". The European Parliament said that memes would be ""specifically excluded"" from the directive, although it was unclear how tech firms would be able to enforce that rule with a blanket filter. This Getty stock image became the ""distracted boyfriend"" meme MEP for London Mary Honeyball said: ""There's no problem with memes at all. This directive was never intended to stop memes and mashups. ""I think that's doom-mongering. People who carry out their business properly have nothing to worry about at all."" Robert Ashcroft, chief executive of PRS for Music, which collects royalties for music artists, welcomed the directive as ""a massive step forward"" for consumers and creatives. ""It's about making sure that ordinary people can upload videos and music to platforms like YouTube without being held liable for copyright - that responsibility will henceforth be transferred to the platforms,"" he said. However the campaign group Open Knowledge International described it as ""a massive blow"" for the internet. ""We now risk the creation of a more closed society at the very time we should be using digital advances to build a more open world where knowledge creates power for the many, not the few,"" said chief executive Catherine Stihler.

Google said that while the latest version of the directive was improved, there remained ""legal uncertainty"". ""The details matter and we look forward to working with policy-makers, publishers, creators and rights holders, as EU member states move to implement these new rules,"" it said. Kathy Berry, senior lawyer at Linklaters, said more detail was required about how Article 13 would be enforced. ""While Article 13 may have noble aims, in its current form it functions as little more than a set of ideals, with very little guidance on exactly which service providers will be caught by it or what steps will be sufficient to comply,"" she said. European Parliament Rapporteur Axel Voss said the legislation was designed to protect people's livelihoods. ""This directive is an important step towards correcting a situation which has allowed a few companies to earn huge sums of money without properly remunerating the thousands of creatives and journalists whose work they depend on,"" he said.

"'Cancel Brexit' petition debate next weekThe government responds and says cancelling Brexit would ""break its promises"" to the British public.UK","The government has officially responded to the record-breaking petition calling for Brexit to be cancelled, which will be debated by MPs next week. The petition, which haspassed more than 5.75m signatures,has been scheduled for debate on Monday, 1 April along with two other Brexit petitions. Responding, the government said it ""acknowledges the considerable number of people"" who have signed it. But revoking Article 50 would ""break the promises"" made to voters, it said. The petition on the UK Parliament's website - started by retired lecturer Margaret Georgiadou - calls on the government to revoke Article 50, the two-year process which is triggered when a country wants to leave the EU. It is the most-signed petition ever to be submitted on the website. Mrs Georgiadou, 77, responded to a date being set for the debate by calling for more signatures, adding: ""The battle draws nigh again."" Brexit debate: Do petitions ever work? Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Stop Brexit petition tops 5.7m signatures Death threats for Brexit petition woman Any petition which gathers 100,000 signatures or more will be debated by MPs. On Tuesday, the Petitions Committee - which is in charge of considering the petitions submitted - announced that it has been scheduled to be debated in Westminster Hall at 16:30 GMT on Monday. Debates will also take place on two other petitions: One, which has passed 120,000 signatures, calling to hold another EU referendum Another, which has passed 140,000 signatures, calls for the UK to leave the EU with or without a deal on the original Brexit date of 29 March The committee said it decided to combine the three petitions into one single debate to ensure they were debated as soon as possible, ""so they would be less likely to be overtaken by events"". It comes as MPs in the House of Commonsprepare to start voting on alternative Brexit planson Wednesday. Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: What could happen next? The UK had been due to leave the EU on Friday, but both sides have agreed to postpone Brexit until a later date to give the UK more time to either approve Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal deal or decide its next steps. Mrs May's deal - which she negotiated with the EU - has been rejected twice by Parliament. She is considering asking MPs to vote on it for a third time, in the hope that enough of them have changed their minds to get it passed. If MPs pass it, the UK will leave the EU on 22 May with a deal. If it is not passed the government has until 12 April to propose a different way forward to the EU. This video can not be played Hundreds of thousands of people marched in London calling for another EU referendum In its response to the petition, the government's Department for Exiting the European Union said: ""This government will not revoke Article 50. ""We will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and work with Parliament to deliver a deal that ensures we leave the European Union."" The statement said cancelling Brexit and staying in the EU would ""undermine both our democracy and the trust that millions of voters have placed in government. ""The government acknowledges the considerable number of people who have signed this petition. ""However, close to three quarters of the electorate took part in the 2016 referendum, trusting that the result would be respected... 17.4 million people then voted to leave the European Union, providing the biggest democratic mandate for any course of action ever directed at UK Government."" It added: ""Revoking Article 50 would break the promises made by government to the British people, disrespect the clear instruction from a democratic vote, and in turn, reduce confidence in our democracy.""

"Police seize $80m 'bribes' in election raidsIndian elections are notorious for bribery - voters are wooed with cash, alcohol and freebies.India","India's election is nearly over: voting began on 11 April, and the final ballot was cast on 19 May with results out on 23 May. Every day, the BBC will be bringing you all the latest updates on the twists and turns of the world's largest democracy. What happened? The governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has told opposition parties to accept ""defeat with grace"" after a slew of exit polls suggested that the ruling party would get a comfortable majority and form the next government. Opposition parties have not only rejected the the exit polls but have also raised concerns of vote fraud. A number of videos, allegedly showing Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) being tampered with, went viral on social media on Tuesday. These prompted several leaders from opposition parties to meet election officials to raise their concerns. They have demanded more transparency in the counting process. But the BJP has rejected their concerns. ""EVM is good when Mamata Banerjee became West Bengal chief minister twice and Amarinder Singh became Punjab chief minister. If they win, EVM is good. But when there is expectation that we will win because people of this country want Narendra Modi to be prime minister again, then EVM is unreliable. The BJP condemns their (opposition) conduct and will tell humbly to accept their defeat with grace,"" Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. Why does this matter? These allegations have left a bitter taste in the aftermath of the mammoth election in the world's largest democracy, souring what should have been a triumphant achievement for the  Election Commission (EC). The bitter war of words between the ruling and opposition parties ahead of counting day on Thursday forced the EC to issue a series of ""confidence-building"" statements. Opposition parties said the EC was ""yet to come out with a mechanism"" to deal with a mismatch between an EVM result and the corresponding paper trail. During voting, EVMs are connected to a Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machine, which dispenses a slip of paper with the symbol of the party the voter selected. The Supreme Court has ordered the EC to tally the results from five EVMs with VVPAT receipts in at least five polling stations in every assembly seat. A parliamentary constituency comprises several assembly seats. But opposition parties say that the tally should be done for the entire constituency in case of a mismatch. On Tuesday: India poll officials deny 'vote fraud' More than 1.5 million e-voting machines will be used in the summer elections What happened? India's Election Commission has denied allegations that voting machines had been tampered with in parts of India. India's opposition parties are meeting the election watchdog on Tuesday to demand more transparency in counting of votes on 23 May (Thursday). Opposition leaders said the EC had to ensure that there was no possibility of anybody manipulating the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) which were used to record votes in the general election that concluded on Sunday. In Uttar Pradesh's Ghazipur constituency, a candidate belonging to the opposition Bahujan Samaj Party held a protest outside a room where the machines have been stored ahead of the counting. The candidate alleged that attempts were being made to take out the machines from the storage room. Local officials have said the allegations are baseless. Allow Twitter content?

In Chandauli constituency, supporters of Samajwadi Party have circulated a mobile phone clip, alleging that some machines were being brought to the counting station on Monday, a day after the election. Local officials have said the machines shown in the video are reserve machines which had been brought from another part of the constituency because of logistical reasons. The Election Commission has insisted that ""proper security and protocol"" was maintained in storing the electronic voting machines. Why does this matter? The move comes after a slew of exit polls predicted that the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would get a comfortable majority in parliament to form a government. Sitaram Yechury from the Left Front said the EC was ""yet to come out with a mechanism"" to deal with a mismatch between an EVM result and the corresponding paper trail. During voting, EVMs are connected to a Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machine, which dispenses a slip of paper with the symbol of the party the voter selected. The Supreme Court has ordered the EC to tally the results from five EVMs with VVPAT receipts in at least five polling stations in every assembly seat. A parliamentary constituency comprises several assembly seats. But opposition parties say that the tally should done for the entire constituency in case of a mismatch. ""On VVPATs and the EVM tally, the EC is yet to come out with a procedure in case there is a mismatch. Even if there is one mismatch in the EVMs or VVPAT samples picked for counting, to maintain the integrity of the electoral process, all VVPATs in that Assembly segment must be counted. This is important to maintain integrity of the electoral process,"" Mr Yechury said. If this were to happen however, it would considerably slow down the counting process and declaration of results. What happened? Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tweeted on the occasion of the death anniversary of former PM Rajiv Gandhi. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Modi has repeatedly attacked Mr Gandhi on the campaign trail and his slurs have prompted widespread criticism. He called Mr Gandhi the ""number one corrupt man in the country"" at a rally earlier this month in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. A few days later, he went after Mr Gandhi again - accusing him of using a naval aircraft carrier to take him and his family to an island for a ""family holiday"". Mr Gandhi was assassinated by a suicide bomber in 1991 during a campaign rally. Why does this matter? Mr Modi's tweet marking Mr Gandhi's death anniversary is customary - but it has garnered attention because he attacked the former prime minister repeatedly while campaigning and didn't back down when challenged. Many were taken aback by Mr Modi's criticism of Mr Gandhi. It elicited condemnation not just from the main opposition Congress party, but other regional opposition leaders, political commentators and even former political opponents of Mr Gandhi. Analysts said the comments were a sign of ""desperation"" and showed that Mr Modi ""knew"" his party was not going to perform as well as expected in the election. Now that campaigning is over and the election is nearly at an end, Mr Modi seems to be abandoning acerbic rhetoric for something more conciliatory. What happened? Opposition leaders have dismissed the exit polls, which suggest that the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is on course to win the general election. Allow Twitter content?

A slew of exit polls released on Sunday predict big wins for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).  The highest poll prediction for the NDA is 365 seats, and the lowest is 242. An average of all exit polls gives the NDA 295 seats. Any party or coalition needs at least 272 seats to secure a majority in parliament and form a government. The BJP welcomed the prediction and many of its leaders congratulated party workers' efforts on social media. Why does this matter? Exit polls have to be taken with caution because they have been wrong in the past - a fact that opposition leaders were quick to point out. Allow Twitter content?

The BJP is locked in a fierce electoral battle with the Congress and a clutch of regional parties in various states. But the trends suggest that the opposition's strategy may have failed. The most surprising prediction has come from the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), which sends 80 MPs to parliament - more than any other. So the state always holds the key to who forms the government - in 2014, the BJP won 71 seats. Analysts had predicted that powerful regional parties would comfortably defeat the BJP this time around. But most of the exit polls suggest the party will perform much better than expected in UP - winning anything between 38 to 68 seats. Only two polls - Nielsen-ABP and NewsX-Neta - have predicted that the BJP would lose at least 40 seats in UP to regional parties. Nielsen-ABP says the NDA will win 22 seats in the state, while NewsX-Neta gives the coalition only 33 seats. These are the the only two polls which predict that the BJP-led alliance could fall short of an outright majority. Can Rahul Gandhi unseat PM Modi?

Having a BBC account gives you a number of ways to make the most of the BBC.Find out more here. If you dismiss the message above without signing in then we'll remind you after a few days when you use the news homepage again. If you dismiss the message four times then we'll stop showing you the message. If you use different devices/browsers to access the news homepage then you may see the message appearing on each device/browser. By signing in to a BBC Account you can see more of the top stories affecting your nation, alongside the main UK and international headlines. The change we have made means that we take your UK nation (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales) into account in selecting stories at the top of the news homepage. This is an example of the stories at the top of the news homepage being different for the nations: All options still provide UK-wide stories, international stories and stories from the UK nations. The difference is that a team in each of the four nations is considering if any top stories are less relevant for that nation's audience and removing them if appropriate and adding in any stories that are more relevant. We expect that a lot of the time there will not be many changes. Some of the time there will be none. The nations feature is only available when you're signed into your BBC account. If you provided your postcode when registering for your BBC account, you'll automatically see more of the top stories for your nation (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales) when you are signed in. If you didn't provide a postcode, or if you'd like to change the selected nation, you can edit your preference using this settings option on the news homepage. You can also use this to choose to remain with the 'UK' option. In some situations we cannot reliably determine your nation from your postcode* so you'll see the 'UK' stories but you can select any of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales using the settings option on the news homepage. *this can happen because we use only the first part of your postcode (the postcode region) for this feature and some postcode regions overlap boundaries. The feature only affects the stories at the top of the news homepage. There won't always be different stories for your nation, so on some days you won't see any change. Can I give you feedback? Yes, tell us what you think of this change.Contact BBC News Online.
