Sudan blames dark forces for failed coup,"Abdalla Hamdok is Sudan's interim prime minister in the power-sharing deal created after long-term ruler Omar al-Bashir was toppled in 2019. Sudan says that ""forces of darkness"" linked to the ousted President Omar al-Bashir were behind Tuesday's failed coup attempt. ""Remnants from the previous regime"" were ""intent on aborting the civilian democratic transition"", said Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in a separate message. He described it as an ""orchestrated coup attempt"". Bashir, who had been in power for three decades, was toppled two years ago. The current administration - involving the military, civilian representatives and protest groups - was then established as part of a power-sharing agreement. Reuters news agency quotes the Sudanese military as saying 21 officers and a number of soldiers had been detained in connection with the failed putsch, and are continuing to search for the rest of the culprits. Earlier reports on Tuesday from the capital, Khartoum, and nearby Omdurman described intense military activity, and the main bridge across the River Nile was shut. In the small hours, shooting was heard near a military base housing a tank division in Omdurman, journalist Mohammed Alamin told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. Then shortly after a news flash on state TV said that a coup attempt had been thwarted. The coup plotters had tried but failed to take over a building housing the state media. Prime Minister Hamdok said his government would ""take immediate measures to fortify the transition and continue to dismantle the system of the former regime, which still poses a threat to the transition"". Several coup attempts have taken place in Sudan in the years since President Bashir was toppled, the BBC's media monitoring service reports. Mr Hamdok said several days of unrest in Port Sudan in the east of the country were also part of a plot to destabilise the country. There has been tension within the Sovereign Council which is supposed to be overseeing a return to civilian rule. ""We're not going back... there are people trying to turn back the hands of time,"" said Information Minister Hamza Baloul in a statement read earlier on state TV. He added that ""forces of darkness were targeting the revolution"" started by mass popular protests against then-President Bashir, but said government bodies would be the ""first line of defence"" protecting Sudan's transition. Correspondents say some elements within the military are likely to be strongly opposed to a transition that will see them lose considerable power. The Sudanese government says the situation in the country is now ""under control"". Video footage shared on Tuesday morning appeared to show armoured vehicles on city streets, but reports from Khartoum now say traffic is now flowing smoothly in central Khartoum and its bridges are open. Sudan's state news agency has published photos,externalof the leader of Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC), Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan,  visiting the armoured division headquarters after the aborted coup: Mohanad Hashim, a journalist for government-run Sudan TV in Khartoum, reports that the Bashir loyalists blamed for the coup say they are disgruntled with Sudan's tough economic situation. The BBC's Africa correspondent Catherine Byaruhanga says Sudan's transitional government is under pressure to deliver economic and political reforms amid competing demands from conservative and liberal constituencies.

Sudan's political crisis explained,"The military and protesters have been negotiating over the country's future Sudan has been in the midst of a political crisis since long-serving ruler Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in April. The military and pro-democracy movement have been locked in a tussle for power that has led to mass protests and killings. The security forces have used brute force to strengthen the position of the generals. In the worst such case, dozens of people were killed - and some had their bodies thrown into the River Nile - in a crackdown on protesters in the capital, Khartoum on 3 June. But tens of thousands of protesters returned to the streets a few weeks later to stage the biggest demonstration since Mr Bashir's overthrow. This forced the junta to resume talks on a power-sharing government and an agreement has now been reached. Here's what you need to know about the crisis. The unrest in Sudan can be traced back to December 2018, when then President Bashir's government imposed emergency austerity measures to try to stave off economic collapse. Cuts to bread and fuel subsidies sparked demonstrations in the east over living standards and the anger spread to the capital, Khartoum. The protests broadened into demands for the removal of Mr Bashir - who had been in charge for 30 years - and his government. President Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in a coup in April The movement reached a climax on 6 April, when demonstrators occupied the square in front of the military's headquarters to demand that the army force the president out. Five days later, the military announced that the president had been overthrown. A council of generals assumed power on 11 April but it has struggled to return normality to the country. The seven-member Transitional Military Council (TMC) is led by Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan. The council says it needs to be in charge to ensure order and security. But the army is not a unified force in Sudan. Paramilitary organisations and various Islamist militias hold some sway. The military has also faced international condemnation for the attack on protesters on 3 June, with the UK saying the military council bore ""full responsibility"". In response, the TMC expressed ""sorrow for the way events escalated"", saying that the operation had targeted ""trouble makers and petty criminals"" . This video can not be played What happened during the 3 June massacre? The economic problems brought Sudanese from all walks of life to the streets, but the organisation of demonstrations was taken on bythe Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) - a collaboration of doctors, health workers and lawyers. The protesters are mostly young, reflecting the country's demographics, but people of all ages have been seen in the crowds. Women are at the forefront of the demonstrations. A video of a young woman standing on the roof of a car and leading the chants was widely shared on social media. This video can not be played A woman dubbed 'Kandaka', which means Nubian queen, has become a symbol for protesters When the military took power in April, demonstrators stayed put outside its headquarters and insisted that it transfer authority to a civilian administration. Talks between the ruling generals and the protest organisers, who have come together under the umbrella group Forces of Freedom and Change, initially showed little sign of progress, but they eventually came to an agreement. The military and protesters have reached several agreements fleshing out the details of a power-sharing arrangement, with each side trying to overcome suspicion and build a working relationship. On 4 August they signed a constitutional declaration which will pave the way for the formation of a transitional government. A formal signing ceremony is due to take place on 17 August. There were celebrations when the 4 August deal was signed They have agreed on the following: Power-sharing will last for 39 months Elections to be held at the end of that period A sovereign council, cabinet and legislative body will be formed A general will head the council for the first 21 months, a civilian for the remaining 18 Sovereign council will have 11 members (5 civilian and 5 military nominees plus one agreed by consensus) A prime minister, nominated by the pro-democracy movement, will head the cabinet The ministers of defence and interior will be chosen by the military The other positions will be taken by pro-democracy candidates Sovereign council and cabinet members barred from running for election The long transition period is seen as a victory for the pro-democracy movement - the generals had threatened a snap election after the 3 June crackdown. Demonstrators argued that Mr Bashir's regime was so deeply entrenched that it would take time to dismantle its political network and open the way for free and fair elections.

Most African and Western countries have backed the protesters. But Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are seen to be allies of the junta. They perhaps fear the protests in Sudan could inspire similar events to take place in their countries. The TMC's vice-president, Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, also known as Hemeti, flew to Saudi Arabia in June to meet the crown prince Mohamed Bin Salman, promising to stand with the kingdom against threats and continue sending Sudanese troops to help the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. The AU suspended Sudan as a member of the pan-African body after 3 June crackdown, saying it will be reinstated only after a civilian-led transitional authority is established.

Matt Hancock's United Nations role withdrawn,"Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock has had a job offer from the United Nations withdrawn. Mr Hancock announced this week that he had been given a role helping Africa's economy recover from Covid. The UN said he would bring valuable experience - but Mr Hancock now says a rule has come to light that prevents him from taking the job while an MP. Leading figures across Africa and UK opposition parties had criticised the UN's choice of the MP for the role. Ex-Health Secretary Matt Hancock given UN role On Tuesday, the former health secretarytweeted a copy of the letter from UN Under-Secretary General Vera Songwe,externaloffering him the unpaid role. He was congratulated by former cabinet colleagues, including Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Housing Secretary Michael Gove and Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries. But the West Suffolk MP faced a backlash from critics on social media, who pointed to the fact that ahighly critical report from MPson the UK government's handling of the pandemic had been released on the same day. Mr Hancock's new role came four months after heresigned from his cabinet postfor breaking social distancing guidelines by kissing a colleague. He had been planning to continue as a Conservative MP while working as the UN special representative on financial innovation and climate change for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. The UN has now told him the appointment ""is not being taken forward"". Mr Hancock said he had been ""honoured to be approached by the UN"" but it later wrote to him to explain that UN rule ""has subsequently come to light"". He added: ""Since I am committed to continuing to serve as MP for West Suffolk, this means I cannot take up the position. ""I look forward to supporting the UN ECA in their mission in whatever way I can in my parliamentary role."" By Mark Lobel, BBC News correspondent This is undoubtedly an embarrassment for the former health secretary who was looking to resuscitate his political career. The first step in doing so appeared to come with the announcement about the unpaid role. It was not a UK government one - but there was glowing support from many senior former cabinet colleagues. Matt Hancock says a technical rule has now come to light which prevents him from taking the job as he is a sitting MP. But the appointment attracted anger too, coming on the day a group of MPs had been highly critical of the government's handling of the pandemic. And some in the international community questioned the MP's expertise, past mistakes, and his suitability for such a challenging role. It appears that added to pressure on the UN to withdraw the invitation - and three days later a spokesman confirmed it was not being taken forward. UN sources say the appointment should never have been made in the first place. Gordon Brown was a sitting MP when he took a similar role. He was appointed in 2012,two years before he announced his intention to stand down as an MP. In her letter to Mr Hancock offering him the job, Ms Songwe said his ""success"" in handling the UK's pandemic response was a testament to the strengths he would bring to the role. In his reply, the MP said: ""As we recover from the pandemic so we must take this moment to ensure Africa can prosper."" The withdrawal of the offer was welcomed by campaign group Global Justice Now. The group's director Nick Dearden said: ""If Matt Hancock wants to help African countries recover from the pandemic, he should lobby the prime minister to back a patent waiver on Covid-19 vaccines. ""If he'd done that when he was in government, tens of millions more people could already have been vaccinated. ""The last thing the African continent needs is a failed British politician. This isn't the 19th Century.""

US offers to pay relatives of Kabul drone victims,"The aftermath of the drone strike in the Afghan capital, Kabul The US government has offered financial compensation to the relatives of 10 people mistakenly killed by the American military in a drone strike on the Afghan capital, Kabul, in August. An aid worker and nine members of his family, including seven children, died in the strike. The Pentagon said it was also working to help surviving members of the family relocate to the US. The strike took place days before the US military withdrew from Afghanistan. It came amid a frenzied evacuation effort following the Taliban's sudden return to power and only days after a devastating attack close to Kabul's airport by IS-K, a local branch of the Islamic State (IS) group. US intelligence had tracked the aid worker's car for eight hours on 29 August, believing it was linked to IS-K militants, US Central Command's Gen Kenneth McKenzie said last month. The investigation found the man's car had been seen at a compound associated with IS-K, and its movements aligned with other intelligence about the terror group's plans for an attack on Kabul airport. At one point, a surveillance drone saw men loading what appeared to be explosives into the boot of the car, but these turned out to be containers of water. Gen McKenzie described the strike as a ""tragic mistake"" and added that the Taliban had not been involved in the intelligence that led to the strike. The strike happened as the aid worker - named as Zamairi Ahmadi - pulled into the driveway of his home, 3km (1.8 miles) from the airport. The explosion set off a secondary blast, which US officials initially said was proof that the car was indeed carrying explosives. However, an investigation found it was most likely caused by a propane tank in the driveway. One of those killed, Ahmad Naser, had been a translator with US forces. Other victims had previously worked for international organisations and held visas allowing them entry to the US. This video can not be played Emal Ahmadi: ""Ten people died here... including my daughter, she was two years old"" The compensation offer was made on Thursday in a meeting between Colin Kahl, the under-secretary of defence for policy, and Steven Kwon, the founder and president of an aid group active in Afghanistan called Nutrition and Education International, the Pentagon said in a statement. Mr Kahl noted Mr Ahmadi and others who were killed ""were innocent victims who bore no blame and were not affiliated with ISIS-K or threats to US forces"", said a statement attributed to Defence Department spokesman John Kirby. He reiterated Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin's commitment to the families, including ""condolence payments"". Mr Austin has apologised for the attack, but Mr Ahmadi's 22-year-old nephew Farshad Haidari said that was not enough. ""They must come here and apologise to us face-to-face,"" he told the AFP news agency in Kabul. Who are IS-K? Interpreter who helped rescue Biden leaves Afghanistan When the US started to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, the Taliban managed to seize control of the country within about two weeks in a rapid offensive. Kabul fell on 15 August. It sparked a mass evacuation effort from the US and its allies, as thousands of people tried to flee. Many were foreign nationals or Afghans who had worked for foreign governments. The security situation was further heightened after the IS-K attack on the airport. A suicide bomber killed up to 170 civilians and 13 US troops outside the airport on 26 August. Many of those killed had been hoping to board evacuation flights leaving the city. The last US soldier left Afghanistan on 31 August - the deadline President Joe Biden had set for the US withdrawal. More than 124,000 foreigners and Afghans were flown out of the country beforehand.

Police examine mental health of Norway attacker,"Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere visited Kongsberg on Friday A bow-and-arrow attack that killed five people in Norway this week is likely to have been due to the killer's mental illness, police say. Espen Andersen Brathen has admitted going on a killing spree in the small town of Kongsberg on Wednesday. It was the worst attack in Norway since far-right extremist Anders Breivik massacred 77 people a decade ago. The suspect, a Danish Muslim convert, is now in custody in a medical facility pending a psychiatric evaluation. ""The strongest hypothesis after the first days of the investigation is that illness is in the background,"" said police inspector Per Thomas Omholt. However, police are investigating a range of motives including ""anger, revenge, impulse, jihad, illness and provocation"", Mr Omholt said. He added that Brathen had admitted to the killings but did not admit guilt. Norwegian town left asking questions after murders A full psychiatric evaluation is necessary to determine whether Brathen can be held legally responsible for his actions. This could take several months. ""This indicates that things are not exactly as they should be,"" said his lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, referring to his client's mental health. ""A complete judicial assessment will clarify that,"" he told Norwegian daily VG. The head of Norway's PST intelligence service, Hans Sverre Sjovold, said Brathen had been in and out of Norway's healthcare system ""for some time"". Brathan was known to PST, which is in charge of Norway's anti-terrorism efforts, but it is as yet unclear why. ""There were fears linked to radicalisation previously,"" police official Ole Bredrup Saeverud told reporters. Espen Andersen Brathen is undergoing a psychiatric examination Five people were killed and three others injured, including an off-duty police officer, in Kongsberg, which is about 80km (49 miles) south-west of the capital, Oslo. Police first received a report of a man shooting at people with a bow and arrows at 18:12 local time (16:12 GMT) on Wednesday. Shortly afterwards, officers arrived on the scene. The officers were then shot at with arrows before the attacker escaped. Attacks were subsequently reported in different locations. Police have said the victims were most likely killed after officers first confronted the attacker. The suspect was arrested at 18:45 - 35 minutes after the attack began. Warning shots were fired during the arrest, police said. Norwegian media questioned why it took police more than half an hour to arrest the suspect after the first reports of an attack. Mr Saeverud said it had been a ""confusing"" situation.

The page was written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Katy Lewis, Kate Whannel and Mariam Issimdar. It was edited by Alex Kleiderman, Emma Atkinson and Owen Amos. The mood in Leigh-on-Sea tonight is sombre as people express their sadness and bewilderment at the fatal stabbing of their MP. Sir David Amess's constituents speak warmly ofa man who dedicated his life to serving them. Prime Minister Boris Johnson calls Sir David one of the ""kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics"". And deputy PM Dominic Rabb says he was ""a formidable campaigner with a big heart, and tremendous generosity of spirit - including towards those he disagreed with"". A fixture in the House of Commons chamber for nearly 40 years he was known as one of Parliament's characters: fun, friendly, unconventional and outspoken. He always took his work seriously, but himself rarely. Here's what we know so far about the investigation into the fatal stabbing of Essex MP Sir David Amess.  We've got more detail on what we know about the investigation so farhere.  Lord
Walney, independent adviser to the government on political violence and disruption, says he can imagine a discreet police presence at constituency
events would be an attractive option for many MPs. The former Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: âIt is not
simply the awful tragic violent act that took the life of David Amess and my
friend Jo Cox. ""It is also that sense of intimidation, if that prevents people
coming into parliament in future, and puts pressure on people to act
differently or step down that in itself is a huge attack on our democracy and
itâs something that we must be concerned about and take serious steps to
address.â Asked if he will make any recommendations for security measures
to ensure MPs physical safety, Walney says he thinks we will see the
Speaker of the House of Commons stepping up the levels of security. A Labour MP has
expressed caution over the idea that constituency surgeries should be observed
by police officers for protection, following the death of Sir David. Diane Abbott,
who served as Shadow Home Secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, says it could risk putting people off from visiting their local MP. Speaking to
Caroline Wyatt on BBC Radio 4 PM, she says: ""Iâve been talking to colleagues - there was one in North London who
was telling me that because of death threats she had a police officer outside
her advice session - and a police car in fact. Well of course the number of
people coming to see her dropped right down. ""You donât want to have a set-up
which is so off putting to ordinary people that just want help. So I wouldnât
support airport-style screening. âI would prefer, going forward, to meet constituents behind a screen, as we have now for Covid
and so on - that might be quite complicated to arrange but at least you know
someoneâs not going to just lean over the desk and stab you, which could happen
now.â People in Southend came together this afternoon at the town's Civic Centre to hold a vigil and reflect on the life of the MP David Amess and light candles. As tributes continue to pour in for Essex MP Sir David Amess let's take stock of what's happened since he was killed while meeting constituents in Leigh-on-Sea yesterday. Labour MP Naz Shah says there is ""no right or wrong answer"" over whether or not MPs should continue holding their surgeries. The Bradford West MP - who has received death threats in the past - says the attack on Sir David ""could have happened to any of us"". ""I just think you've got to respect every MP - some will have the 'Yes, we're going to carry on' view, and some people won't feel comfortable."" The West Papua independence leader Benny Wendahas sent,externalhis condolences to the family of Sir David Amess. He says he was one of the first MPs to sign the Westminster Declaration for West Papua and would ""always be fondly remembered by West Papuans"". The Westminster Declaration calls for an internationally supervised vote on independence from Indonesia for West Papua and has been signed by parliamentarians around the world.

The killing of MP Sir David Amess has highlighted a security dilemma forpoliticians across the globe. Some of the BBC's international correspondents explain what the situation is like in other countries. BBC South American correspondent Katy Watson says being an open, accessible people's representative in the major cities of Brazil - Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro - where wealth and inequalities are polarised, politicians are more likely to be flanked by bodyguards. Brazil is deeply divided politically and President Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed during his leadership campaign. Being an MP in India - the world's largest democracy - comes with a lot of privileges, a security detail is one of them, writes Vikas Pandey in Delhi. In recent years, attacks on politicians have taken the form of ink-throwing and slapping. But a number of politicians, including former PMs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, have lost their lives in violent attacks. In the Netherlands, Dutch lawmakers do not hold surgeries and only a select few Dutch politicians, including the anti-Islam leader, Geert Wilders, have protection. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, pictured below, has been seen cycling to meetings. Read the full story on the struggle politicians face to meet the public and stay safe. People have come together at Southend Civic Centre for a moment of reflection on Sir David's life. Mohammed Shamsuddin says he had known Sir David since 1983 and describes him as ""English gentleman who was so kind to our community as well as the whole of Southend"". Ruhul Shamsuddin, Joint Secretary of Essex Jamme Masjid says he had known Sir David since he was a child. He says: ""For his life to be cut short is devastating."" Mahmudul Hasan says: ""We greatly miss him and he will be always missed."" Claire Calder from the Dogs Trust says Sir David Amess was ""one of the biggest champions of animal welfare in Parliament"". She praises the MP's ""huge sense of humour"" and ""huge heart"". Recently, she says he had joined their campaigns to tackle puppy smuggling and to ban electric shock collars. Next week is the annual Westminster dog of the year contest run by the Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club. Sir David had been planning to enter his French bulldog into the contest. Allow Twitter content?

The fuel poverty charity National Energy Action describes Sir David as ""a true public servant"". The charity said the MP would be remembered for his bill aimed at eliminating fuel poverty - the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill. The bill required the government to publish and implement a strategy to reduce fuel poverty and became law in 2000. A spokesperson for the NEA said Sir David's family could ""take some small comfort from knowing the huge positive difference he has made"". ""Millions of people across the UK are now better supported through national policies and programmes than before he started his campaign and he has directly helped millions of people to be warmer and safer in their homes."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan says his thoughts are with Sir David Amess' family at ""this time of unimaginable grief"". He describes the Essex MP as ""a brilliant, kind, dedicated public
servant, widely liked and respected across the political divide"". He adds: ""Iâm utterly disgusted
by this attack on our democracy. âLike with the murder of my dear friend Jo Cox five years ago, it appears that the horrific killing of Sir David Amess was another attempt to divide us, to fuel fear and to change how we treat one another."" ""Our response must be to stand united in defiance and stay true to our values and way of life.""  We've been reporting that some MPs are holding their usual surgeries in their constituencies following the death of Sir David Amess. Among them is Craig Williams, MP for Montgomeryshire, who met voters alongside his Conservative colleague from the Welsh Parliament, Russell George. Allow Twitter content?

Kieran Mullan, the Tory MP for Crewe and Nantwich,tweeted:,external""Surgery today, we must not let people force us to do things differently. David would not have wanted that."" Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent There's no indication that the national terrorism threat level is going to be changed to a higher level in light of the attack. The threat level is currently ""substantial"" which is in the middle of the five tiers. It means the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which is part of MI5, thinks that an attack is ""likely"". It's been at that level since February. The two levels above it are typically triggered when there are ongoing concerns among counter terrorism leaders of an emerging plot or remaining questions about an incident that's already taken place. Members of Southend-On-Seaâs Muslim communities are paying tribute to Sir David Amess as a community leader, friend and mentor. A joint statement from all the mosques in the town says: ""He shared in our happiness, by attending our weddings and functions and he was there for us in our times of need.  We will all miss him dearly, but his legacy of public service will live on, as will memories of his warmth, selflessness and kindness."" It says: ""Sir Davidâs murder was an indefensible atrocity, commited on the grounds of a place of worship and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.This act was committed in the name of blind hatred, and we look forward to the perpetrator being brought to justice."" Ruhul Shamsuddin, joint secretary of Essex Jamme Masjid
remembers Sir David as ""a tremendous force for good"" and ""a truly
wonderful man"". ""Itâs an honour to say Iâve known him my whole life. Iâve lost not just a community leader, but a
family friend and mentor.â President of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, has sent his condolences to Sir David's family. He said he was killed while carrying out a fundamental role of a politician - helping their constituents. He offered his ""deepest sympathies to the family, friends, colleagues in Parliament and constituents"" of Sir David. He also extended thoughts to the family of the late Jo Cox MP, murdered just over five years ago in her constituency of Batley and Spen. ""On behalf of the Irish people, I send them our deepest sympathies."" TheBritish-Irish Parliamentary Assembly,external(BIPA) has cancelled a scheduled plenary meeting at Westminster on Monday as a mark of respect for Sir David. The British Committee for Iran Freedom (BCFIF) has issued a statement condemning the ""vicious attack, which was an assault not only on Sir David, but also on democracy in the UK"". Sir David was a champion of human rights and democracy in Iran for more than three decades. He consistently  spoke in support of the Iranian peopleâs democratic aspirations and the Iranian Resistance movement, NCRI, theBCFIF,externalsaid. ""One of the proudest things I have ever done in my political career is to support the National Council of Resistance of Iran which calls for the Iranian regime to be replaced with a safer and more democratic government,"" Sir David said on 6 September. In an email to the BBC, supporter Jahed Madumi wrote: ""With great sorrow I
heard about Sir David Amess' loss. ""As an Iranian I have to say that he was a

What Texas women make of six-week abortion ban,"Anti-abortion activist Eva Alper approaches women outside health clinic that provides abortions in Texas A new law restricting access to abortions is being celebrated by supporters in Texas, but for the doctors and pro-choice activists who could be prosecuted under it, this was a dark day. On Tuesday afternoon, Eva Alpar was approaching women outside a clinic that provides a range of health services, including abortions. As a volunteer with the San Antonio Coalition for Life, she tracks the number of cars that come by each hour and hands out goodie bags with snacks and body wash to women going inside to seek services. Inside the bags are brochures that list alternatives to an abortion. What is Texas' new abortion law? The previous 72 hours had been busy at this south Texas clinic. Across the state, abortion providers said more patients were looking to terminate their pregnancies ahead of the new law which effectively bans abortions after six weeks. For Ms Alpar, this law - which came into effect on Wednesday after the US Supreme Court did not intervene - is a huge win. ""A good day [on the job] means I'm able to get at least one referral,"" Ms Alpar said, standing in 90F (32C) heat right next to speeding cars that often honk at her. ""That means we get them to leave Planned Parenthood and go over to a woman's [health centre] instead,"" to discuss alternatives to an abortion. (Planned Parenthood is one of the largest abortion services providers in the country.) On Wednesday, members of the anti-abortion coalition showed up again at the clinic, only to find it closed for medical procedures. The website for the location reads: ""Due to Texas' new law SB 8, we are unable to provide abortion at this time. We are challenging this law and hope to resume abortion care in the future."" ""Today is a wonderful day for Texas,"" said Catherine Nix, the executive director of the Coalition for Life, after briefly speaking to a woman who accepted a bag from her. ""We are here everyday trying to help women choose life, and today the law is now behind us to help us do that."" This law, one of the nation's most restrictive, is not directly meant to penalise women seeking abortions. While it bans abortions after the detection of a foetal heartbeat, the law's broad language suggests lawsuits may be brought by private citizens against those who aid, abet or perform abortions. That includes someone who helps a patient cover the medical cost of terminating a pregnancy or provides them transportation to get the procedure - if it's done after six-weeks gestation. The law could impact someone like Bridget, who has previously volunteered with the Clinic Access Support Network to drive patients to their abortion appointments. ""This bill is targeting people who already do not have the resources necessary to get themselves to an appointment,"" she said. That includes people, often women of colour, from low-income homes who don't count on a support system from their families or partners. ""The whole purpose of the bill is to bankrupt organisations like ours and shut down clinics."" According to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas, this law will prevent eight in 10 people from obtaining abortion care. Many women do not know they are pregnant before the six-week point cited in the law. Dr Ghazaleh Moayedi, who carries out abortions in her OB/GYN practice in north Texas, said she feels targeted. In the 15 years that she has worked in abortion care, she has seen greater restrictions in the state, but never anything as aggressive as this law. ""Providing abortion care, and accessing abortion care is actually the very heart of being Texan,"" Moayedi told the BBC. ""Texans don't believe that the government should interfere in our personal lives. We believe that the community takes care of each other. It doesn't make sense that our legislators here in the state continue to go after folks for their personal lives, because that's really not what we're about here."" She said that the bill will immediately stop access to care for 90% of the people that see her for abortions and that those patients will likely be forced to consider going out of state or to continue unwanted pregnancies. She is worried about the people who will be forced into continuing an unwanted pregnancy - and she also worries for herself. ""I'm afraid for my personal future and the future of my career as a result of this.""

Nasa mission will seek out Solar System 'fossils',"Lucy left Earth aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas rocket A spacecraft has launched from Cape Canaveral on a mission to uncover ""the fossils"" of the Solar System. The Lucy probe will head out to the orbit of Jupiter to study two groups of asteroids that run in swarms ahead of, and behind, the gas giant. US space agency (Nasa) scientists say the objects are leftovers from the formation of the planets. As such, these trojans, as they're known, hold important clues about the early evolution of the Solar System. Lift-off, aboard an Atlas-V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, went ahead on schedule at 05:34 EDT (09:34 GMT; 10:34 BST). Nasa has initially committed $981m (Â£720m), over 12 years, for the mission. In this time, the Lucy probe will visit seven trojans. The Lucy fossil skeleton changed our understanding of human origins and evolution There is a famous human fossil from Africa that was nicknamed Lucy, which taught us much about where our species came from. And this new Nasa mission takes direct inspiration - and the name - from that origins story, except the fossils this spacecraft seeks are hundreds of millions of km from Earth, circling the Sun in formation with Jupiter. ""The trojan asteroids lead or follow Jupiter in its orbit by about 60 degrees,"" explained Hal Levison, Lucy's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. ""They're held there by the gravitational effect of Jupiter and the Sun. And if you put an object there early in the Solar System's history, it's been stable forever. So, these things really are the fossils of what planets formed from,"" he told reporters. Artwork: Lucy is just one in a series of Nasa missions to the Solar System's asteroids Lucy will use its instrumentation to study the city-sized (and bigger) objects, detailing their shape, structure, surface features, composition and temperature. If the trojans are made from the same sorts of materials as Jupiter's moons, it would suggest they formed at the same distance from the Sun as the gas giant. But this isn't the expectation. ""If, for example, they're made of the sorts of things we see much further out in what we call the the Kuiper Belt, then that tells us they might have formed out there and then at some point got pulled inward,"" said SwRI mission scientist Dr Carly Howett. ""This mission is a test of our models. We have this theory that there was a big re-juggle of objects early in Solar System history, when some things gravitationally got thrown out and some got thrown in. The evidence points to this billiard ball theory, but we'll be able a check on that,"" she told BBC News. The mission plan is the result of some extraordinary navigational calculations. Solar System dynamicists worked out that if the probe periodically returns to make a flyby of Earth, it can use a sling-shot effect to visit both trojan swarms. Saturday's launch would see Lucy make its encounter with the leading group of trojans in 2027/28, followed by a tour of the trailing cluster in 2033. The total travel distance is over 6 billion km (4 billion miles). Leading swarm: EurybatesandQueta(moon) - August 2027 Polymele- September 2027 Leucus- April 2028 Orus- November 2028 Trailing swarm: PatroclusandMenoetius- March 2033 Main-belt asteroid: Donaldjohanson- April 2025 ""What's amazing about this trajectory is that we can continue to do loops through the swarms, as long as the spacecraft is healthy. And so after the final encounter with Patroclus and Menoetius, we plan to propose to Nasa to do an extended mission to explore more trojans,"" said Coralie Adam from KinetX Aerospace, which is providing navigation support to the project. Although focused on the trojans, Lucy will also visit a different type of asteroid on the way out to Jupiter's orbit - an object called Donaldjohanson (sic), named after the palaeoanthropologist who discovered the Ethiopian human fossil skeleton in 1974. The 1.5-tonne Lucy spacecraft has initial funding for 12 years The spacecraft shares a lot of engineering heritage with Nasa's New Horizon's mission, which made the first - and to date only - flyby of Pluto in 2015. Lucy carries updated versions of some of New Horizons' main instruments. A big difference is the power source. Whereas the Pluto probe drew its energy from a nuclear battery, Lucy is flying with two, fan-like solar panels. These ""wings"" are huge, over 7m in diameter. They have to be that big to generate sufficient electricity to drive the spacecraft's systems at the more dimly lit distance of Jupiter's orbit. ""When we're near Earth, those wings have about 18,000 watts of power. That would be equivalent to powering up my house and a couple of my neighbours',"" explained Katie Oakman, from spacecraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin. ""However, when we fly Lucy out to the trojan asteroids, we only have about 500 watts of power. That would only light a few light bulbs, and it wouldn't be enough to power up my microwave in the morning to warm my coffee."" Fortunately, Lucy's instruments only need 82 watts to do their job. Lucy represents another stage in what is turning out to be a golden age for asteroid study by Nasa. The agency's Osiris-Rex mission is just now heading home after picking up samples from the surface of an object known as Bennu. Next year, Nasa will launch the Psyche spacecraft to a metal asteroid, also called Psyche. ""It's really the time for asteroids, and I'm expecting a leap in understanding,"" said Dr Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator for science. ""To understand any population, we need multiple measurements of different types of asteroids. That's exactly what we're doing. ""You didn't mention it but I will. Asteroids can threaten the Earth and in November we will launch a collision experiment called Dart. It will be followed up by Europe's Hera mission and will help find out if you can impart momentum to a threatening object,"" he told BBC News.

"Investigation ordered into Covid lab test failingsA lab in Wolverhampton is suspended as 43,000 people in England and Wales are potentially affected.","The Wolverhampton Science Park houses the offices and laboratories of Immensa Health Clinic The head of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has ordered an investigation into why it took a month to identify a laboratory giving incorrect Covid test results. Dr Jenny Harries said it was ""not clear yet"" what went wrong at the private lab in Wolverhampton. About 43,000 people in England and Walesmay have been wrongly told their Covid-19 test was negative. Testing at the lab has been suspended and those affected are being contacted. Questions are also being raised around how the lab won a multi-million pound government contract. Covid: Secret filming exposes contamination risk at test results lab Coronavirus testing lab 'chaotic and dangerous', scientist claims Covid tests: 'I trusted my PCR results' Concerns were flagged when people had positive lateral flow tests (LFTs) but negative follow-up PCR results from the lab between 8 September and 12 October. Most of those affected live in south-west England. The error could mean thousands of people infected with Covid were wrongly told to stop isolating, and may have infected others. Dr Harries, chief executive of the UKHSA and head of NHS Test and Trace, said local public health teams had been querying tests over the last few weeks, but it was only in the last few days that the problem was pinpointed. ""It is the location of the laboratory, combined with the geography and the time period, that has allowed us to understand this now,"" she said. ""I want to make sure if there are any further problems with other laboratories we can absolutely spot them as quickly as possible."" Dr Harries said she would conduct ""a serious incident investigation"" to make sure it doesn't happen again. All samples from the lab, where Immensa Health Clinic Ltd runs the testing operations, are now being sent to other labs. UKHSA said all other labs were working normally and there were no technical issues with the test kits themselves. Government records show that Immensa, which was founded in May 2020 just months after the start of the pandemic, has been awarded contracts for Covid testing by the Department of Health valued at Â£181m. It is connected to another company, Dante Labs, which provides genetic sequencing and other laboratory services from offices in Wolverhampton and Cambridge. It also sells private PCR Covid tests to travellers, and is one of 20 companies being investigated by the UK competition watchdog over concerns it may have unfairly treated customers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people ""should not be concerned"" by the lab's suspension. ""We're looking into what went wrong with that particular testing centre, but it doesn't affect the overall numbers,"" he said. Only a few thousand out of the 43,000 affected by the wrong result could potentially still be infected now and they will be contacted first, by text and email, to recommend they have another test. Prof Alan McNally, from the University of Birmingham, told the BBC he was ""astonished"" by the revelation and could not work out how so many tests could be incorrect. ""It comes down to quality control and quality assurance, oversight and management,"" he said. ""I cannot fathom the failings that would lead to this level of false negative results."" The UKHSA said about 400,000 samples had been processed by the privately-run lab and it estimated 43,000 people may have been given incorrect negative test results, with 4,000 of those from Wales. Some may also be in the south-east of England and scattered across the country. Graham Loader and his wife went about their normal business after negative PCR results Graham Loader, from Newbury, says his family have had three positive LFTs, all followed by negative PCR tests taken at the testing site at Newbury Showground in West Berkshire. He said each time the family got a positive LFT but negative PCR test, they assumed the LFTs must have been at fault. ""I think we just blamed the LFTs because they were a bit basic,"" he said. ""I thought they must be detecting something from a cold and be an error."" His wife, a school teacher, had felt a bit unwell but didn't have the classic symptoms of coronavirus. She had a negative PCR test but took some time off as a precaution, despite being advised she did not need to. Mr Loader, who coaches a boy's football team, thought he had come down with a cold. He added: ""I completely trusted the PCR, so I feel bad for all the people I've been in contact with."" Dr Will Welfare, public health incident director at UKHSA - which replaced Public Health England, said: ""As a result of our investigation, we are working with NHS Test and Trace and the company to determine the laboratory technical issues which have led to inaccurate PCR results being issued to people. ""We have immediately suspended testing at this laboratory while we continue the investigation."" He said the public should remain confident in using both kinds of test, and continue to get a follow-up PCR test after a positive LFT. The company said it was ""fully collaborating"" with health officials on the matter and added it had already analysed more than 2.5 million samples for NHS Test and Trace. Many coronavirus testing sites in England and Wales are likely to be affected by the lab errors, including one atNewbury Showground used by the Loader family. On Thursday evening West Berkshire council told people who had received a negative result at the site between 3 and 12 October, to book another test.

"Investigation ordered into Covid lab test failingsA lab in Wolverhampton is suspended as 43,000 people in England and Wales are potentially affected.Health","The Wolverhampton Science Park houses the offices and laboratories of Immensa Health Clinic The head of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has ordered an investigation into why it took a month to identify a laboratory giving incorrect Covid test results. Dr Jenny Harries said it was ""not clear yet"" what went wrong at the private lab in Wolverhampton. About 43,000 people in England and Walesmay have been wrongly told their Covid-19 test was negative. Testing at the lab has been suspended and those affected are being contacted. Questions are also being raised around how the lab won a multi-million pound government contract. Covid: Secret filming exposes contamination risk at test results lab Coronavirus testing lab 'chaotic and dangerous', scientist claims Covid tests: 'I trusted my PCR results' Concerns were flagged when people had positive lateral flow tests (LFTs) but negative follow-up PCR results from the lab between 8 September and 12 October. Most of those affected live in south-west England. The error could mean thousands of people infected with Covid were wrongly told to stop isolating, and may have infected others. Dr Harries, chief executive of the UKHSA and head of NHS Test and Trace, said local public health teams had been querying tests over the last few weeks, but it was only in the last few days that the problem was pinpointed. ""It is the location of the laboratory, combined with the geography and the time period, that has allowed us to understand this now,"" she said. ""I want to make sure if there are any further problems with other laboratories we can absolutely spot them as quickly as possible."" Dr Harries said she would conduct ""a serious incident investigation"" to make sure it doesn't happen again. All samples from the lab, where Immensa Health Clinic Ltd runs the testing operations, are now being sent to other labs. UKHSA said all other labs were working normally and there were no technical issues with the test kits themselves. Government records show that Immensa, which was founded in May 2020 just months after the start of the pandemic, has been awarded contracts for Covid testing by the Department of Health valued at Â£181m. It is connected to another company, Dante Labs, which provides genetic sequencing and other laboratory services from offices in Wolverhampton and Cambridge. It also sells private PCR Covid tests to travellers, and is one of 20 companies being investigated by the UK competition watchdog over concerns it may have unfairly treated customers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people ""should not be concerned"" by the lab's suspension. ""We're looking into what went wrong with that particular testing centre, but it doesn't affect the overall numbers,"" he said. Only a few thousand out of the 43,000 affected by the wrong result could potentially still be infected now and they will be contacted first, by text and email, to recommend they have another test. Prof Alan McNally, from the University of Birmingham, told the BBC he was ""astonished"" by the revelation and could not work out how so many tests could be incorrect. ""It comes down to quality control and quality assurance, oversight and management,"" he said. ""I cannot fathom the failings that would lead to this level of false negative results."" The UKHSA said about 400,000 samples had been processed by the privately-run lab and it estimated 43,000 people may have been given incorrect negative test results, with 4,000 of those from Wales. Some may also be in the south-east of England and scattered across the country. Graham Loader and his wife went about their normal business after negative PCR results Graham Loader, from Newbury, says his family have had three positive LFTs, all followed by negative PCR tests taken at the testing site at Newbury Showground in West Berkshire. He said each time the family got a positive LFT but negative PCR test, they assumed the LFTs must have been at fault. ""I think we just blamed the LFTs because they were a bit basic,"" he said. ""I thought they must be detecting something from a cold and be an error."" His wife, a school teacher, had felt a bit unwell but didn't have the classic symptoms of coronavirus. She had a negative PCR test but took some time off as a precaution, despite being advised she did not need to. Mr Loader, who coaches a boy's football team, thought he had come down with a cold. He added: ""I completely trusted the PCR, so I feel bad for all the people I've been in contact with."" Dr Will Welfare, public health incident director at UKHSA - which replaced Public Health England, said: ""As a result of our investigation, we are working with NHS Test and Trace and the company to determine the laboratory technical issues which have led to inaccurate PCR results being issued to people. ""We have immediately suspended testing at this laboratory while we continue the investigation."" He said the public should remain confident in using both kinds of test, and continue to get a follow-up PCR test after a positive LFT. The company said it was ""fully collaborating"" with health officials on the matter and added it had already analysed more than 2.5 million samples for NHS Test and Trace. Many coronavirus testing sites in England and Wales are likely to be affected by the lab errors, including one atNewbury Showground used by the Loader family. On Thursday evening West Berkshire council told people who had received a negative result at the site between 3 and 12 October, to book another test. For several weeks, there have beenwidespread reports in the south-west of Englandof people testing positive with LFTs, but then later testing negative after a PCR test. Scientists had called for the issue to be looked into quickly, withone study suggesting positive LFT results were very accurate and should be trusted.

What's going on with US abortion rights?,"This video can not be played The abortion battle explained in three minutes Louisiana has joined a slew of states across the US in legalising an anti-abortion measure that bans the procedure as soon as six weeks into a pregnancy. What's behind the push - and the backlash - for anti-abortion bills across the US? In the first months of this year, nearly 30 states introduced some form of an abortion ban in their legislature. Fifteen have specifically been working with so-called ""heartbeat bills"", that would ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. These bills are part of a wider movement of anti-abortion measures sweeping the US. Earlier in May, Alabama lawmakers passed a bill to ban abortion outright. And Missouri's sole remaining abortion clinic remains embroiled in a legal battle to keep its operating license from the state health department. If the provider loses, Missouri will become the only US state without an abortion clinic. ""Heartbeat bills"", as the term implies, seek to make abortion illegal as soon as what anti-abortion supporters describe as a foetus' heartbeat becomes detectable. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says the name is misleading, and that what is being detected is ""a portion of the foetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops"". In most cases, this point is at the six-week mark of a pregnancy - before many women even know they are pregnant. ""We have never seen so much action around six-week abortion bans,"" said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute - a pro-choice group that researches sexual and reproductive health. ""But we now have seen a shift in the composition of the US Supreme Court."" Anti-abortion activists outside the Supreme Court President Donald Trump has placed two conservative Supreme Court justices and, Ms Nash says, making it seem more amenable to revoking abortion rights. ""Because of this, we are seeing state legislatures looking to ban abortion as a way to kickstart litigation that would come before the [Supreme] court, and the court could then roll back abortion rights."" Other legislators are also responding - in January, New York signed into law a bill safeguarding abortion rights after 24 weeks in certain cases, reigniting discussions about the controversial procedure. Illinois is the latest Democrat-led state to protect abortion rights, passing a bill in June repealing a 1975 abortion law that required spousal consent, waiting periods, restrictions on facilities and penalties for doctors. The new measure changes the definition of viability to survival outside the womb without extraordinary medical measures and allows for abortions after the viability point to protect the mother's health. Vermont also passed legislation affirming abortion rights, and Maine's Democratic Governor Janet Mills signed a bill allowing health care providers who are not physicians to also perform abortions. Why are people talking about NY's abortion law? How US abortion debate got to this point What US ruling may mean for Roe v Wade A growing number of public figures have threatened to divest from the states enacting anti-abortion legislation. Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, says Georgia's six-week ban would make it ""difficult"" to keep filming there. Georgia has become a popular destination for Hollywood producers who flock to the state for its generous tax breaks for films. It offers a 20% incentive on productions of $500,000 or more and a further 10% if the film includes Georgia's logo in its credits. Blockbusters like Black Panther and Avengers: Endgame were recently shot in the state. However, Mr Iger said ""many people who work for us will not want to work there"" should the law go into effect. Disney may quit Georgia over abortion law ""We will have to heed their wishes,"" he told Reuters. Earlier this week, streaming giant Netflix said it would ""rethink"" its operations in the state if the law goes into effect. Netflix series Stranger Things and Ozark are both shot in Georgia. Pro-choice and anti-abortion protestors face off in front of the Supreme Court at protests in May. But the threats to leave Georgia if the law should take effect are unlikely to be realised in the near future. Georgia's new law - like others in the anti-abortion movement - are intentionally unconstitutional. Anti-abortion supporters anticipate resulting legal challenges and hope the appeals will reach the US Supreme Court to allow them to re-visit federal laws protecting the procedure. As of yet, despite the wave of abortion bans, it remains legal in all 50 US states. Meanwhile, stars including Amy Schumer, Ben Stiller, Christina Applegate, Laverne Cox and Alec Baldwinwrote to the governor,externalsaying they would ""do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women"". Actor Jason Bateman, who stars in the Netflix show Ozark and in HBO's The Outsider, which are both currently filming in Georgia, told The Hollywood Reporter: ""I will not work in Georgia, or any other state, that is so disgracefully at odds with women's rights"". The US movement against abortion began in the 1800s, spearheaded by physicians who saw non-medical professionals providing abortion services as both a threat to their industry and harmful to women's health. By 1900, every state had banned abortions entirely - with exceptions granted only at the discretion of a licensed physician. The issue arose again in the 1960s, when women began advocating for reproductive rights. Colorado changed its anti-abortion law in 1967, followed soon after by California and New York. Amid these efforts to return the choice to women, the anti-abortion movement as we currently see it was born, led largely by Catholics and other conservative religious groups. The oldest such group in the US, the National Right to Life, was founded in 1968. Most funding for the movement still comes from religious conservatives - including wealthy donors like the vocally pro-life DeVos family. In 1973, the Supreme Court issued the landmark Roe v Wade ruling legalising abortion in all 50 states. Roe v Wade protects a woman's right to an abortion only until viability - that is, the point at which a foetus is able to live outside the womb, generally at the start of the third trimester, 28 weeks into a pregnancy. In Missouri, the battle over abortion rights is centred on the state's last remaining abortion clinic, which is in jeopardy amidst a standoff with state officials. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services refused to renew the licence for the clinic unless its physicians agree to interviews about what it calls ""potential deficient practices"". The last remaining abortion clinic in Missouri is under threat of closure Planned Parenthood, which runs the clinic, has refused, saying it could mean doctors who perform abortions face criminal charges. It won a court order last month to keep the clinic open on the day it was due to close. ""Today is a victory for women across Missouri, but this fight is far from over,"" said Dr Leana Wen, president of the reproductive health organisation. If Planned Parenthood ultimately loses the case, Missouri could become the first state not to have a legal abortion clinic since 1973. Missouri's last abortion clinic wins reprieve This week, the Supreme Court issued two decisions on an Indiana law restricting abortions, providing a hint at how the top court may respond to other anti-abortion laws. In an unsigned opinion, the justices upheld a state requirement that all foetal remains - whether the product of a miscarriage or an abortion - be either buried or cremated. Abortion rights supporters protest outside the Supreme Court But the justices declined to revive another part of the law that would ban abortions if chosen because of the sex or disability of a foetus. The court's actions were a mixed bag for those on both sides of the abortion debate. Anti-abortion activists viewed the provision as a step toward recognising foetal tissue not as medical waste but as human remains deserving dignified treatment. Abortion rights groups countered that the Supreme Court precedent does not consider a foetus to be human. The purpose of the Indiana law, Planned Parenthood wrote in a statement, is to ""shame and stigmatise"" women seeking abortions. By not examining the case in full, the top court effectively punted an opportunity to revisit the 1973 Roe v Wade precedent upholding a woman's right to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, said his colleagues on the bench would eventually have to act. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says the ruling could be an indication that a majority of the justices on the court are in no hurry to reverse 46 years of precedent. Read Anthony in full - What surprise US court ruling means for abortion For Karen Swallow Prior, a professor at the evangelical Liberty University who is a proponent of banning abortion outright, these six-week bans are ""a good faith effort"" to restrict abortion. ""These bills and the pro-life [anti-abortion] movement are not about punishing women for having sex, they are about preserving a human life that already exists,"" Prof Prior says. She emphasised it was not a religiously motivated viewpoint, but one based on science and human rights. This video can not be played The Pink House: The last abortion clinic in Mississippi In addition to these six-week bans, anti-abortion activists have fought for restrictions on abortion methods, rationales (such as sex or race or abnormality) and trigger bans that would end abortion if Roe v Wade is overturned. According to the Guttmacher Institute,external, 18 states have laws that would restrict abortion in the absence of the federal law, while 10 have laws that would protect abortion in the same scenario. This video can not be played Voices from the abortion frontline But some activists are focusing instead on changing infrastructure they view as promoting abortion, rather than seeking to immediately criminalise the procedure. Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, founder of New Wave Feminists, says her organisation wants to make abortion ""unthinkable"". ""We're arguing about autonomy - which is more important, the woman's or the child's? As a pro-life feminist, I believe we have to take into account both."" She is not opposed to the bills, but says her own activism focuses on women's empowerment. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""We know statistically it's a decision made on financial constraints, lack of access to healthcare, things like that,"" she says. ""Let's get to the real root as to why women feel they have to have an abortion in the first place."" Reverend Marie Alford-Harkey says the right to have an abortion goes hand in hand with the right to follow one's own values and morals. Rev Alford-Harkey, who is a Christian pastor and the president and CEO of the Religious Institute, a national multi-faith organisation working for sexual, gender, and reproductive justice, says the notion of reproductive justice, a term created by black women in the 1990s, is behind her pro-choice views. ""It's the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, to have children, to not have children, to parent in safe and sustainable communities,"" Rev Alford-Harkey explains. ""Justice is a very Christian concept, and this particular framework grew out of communities that were not being served."" Rev Alford-Harkey recently began working as an abortion doula, accompanying women into the exam rooms, speaking with them before, after and sometimes even during the procedure. ""I've been asked once or twice if I think God would forgive them and I say, I don't think there's anything for God to forgive. What I think is a sin is that we've taught people that God won't forgive them for doing what's best for their own bodies, their own lives."" Women fear abortion rights under threat On the battle lines over US abortion An abortion doula speaks with a patient at a clinic in Virginia President Donald Trump broke his silence last week on the recent restrictions across the US. Mr Trump, whose position on abortion has shifted dramatically over the years, posted a series of tweets outlining his views, saying he was against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a ""serious health risk"" to the mother. Trump breaks silence amid US abortion row ""I am very strongly pro-life, with the three exceptions - rape, incest and protecting the life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan"", he said.

The president added that judicial measures, such as his appointment of conservative Supreme Court judges Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, had helped to make abortion laws in various states more restrictive. Mr Trump's views on abortion have evolved considerably over time. In 1999, he said: ""I'm very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still - I just believe in choice."" But in March 2016, he clarified that his position was ""pro-life with exceptions"". In May, he tweeted that Republicans must unite to ""win for life in 2020"". Why are people talking about NY's abortion law?

LivePatel orders review of MPs' security after killing,"Police say they are treating the killing of MP Sir David Amess as a terrorist incident There is a potential link to Islamist extremism, and counter-terrorism officers are searching two addresses in the London area The Conservative MP was stabbed multiple times in the attack in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on Friday Boris Johnson and the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have laid flowers at the scene Home Secretary Priti Patel says Sir David was killed doing a job he loved Ms Patel, who also has an Essex constituency, calls Sir David a ""dear and loyal friend"" A 25-year-old British man is being held in police custody on suspicion of murder Government sources tell the BBC he is a UK national who, from initial inquiries, appears to be of Somali heritage Edited by Emma Atkinson We are bringing our live updates on the killing of Essex MP Sir David Amess to a close for the evening. The page was written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Katy Lewis, Kate Whannel and Mariam Issimdar. It was edited by Alex Kleiderman, Emma Atkinson and Owen Amos. The mood in Leigh-on-Sea tonight is sombre as people express their sadness and bewilderment at the fatal stabbing of their MP. Sir David Amess's constituents speak warmly ofa man who dedicated his life to serving them. Prime Minister Boris Johnson calls Sir David one of the ""kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics"". And deputy PM Dominic Rabb says he was ""a formidable campaigner with a big heart, and tremendous generosity of spirit - including towards those he disagreed with"". A fixture in the House of Commons chamber for nearly 40 years he was known as one of Parliament's characters: fun, friendly, unconventional and outspoken. He always took his work seriously, but himself rarely. Here's what we know so far about the investigation into the fatal stabbing of Essex MP Sir David Amess.  We've got more detail on what we know about the investigation so farhere.  Lord
Walney, independent adviser to the government on political violence and disruption, says he can imagine a discreet police presence at constituency
events would be an attractive option for many MPs. The former Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: âIt is not
simply the awful tragic violent act that took the life of David Amess and my
friend Jo Cox. ""It is also that sense of intimidation, if that prevents people
coming into parliament in future, and puts pressure on people to act
differently or step down that in itself is a huge attack on our democracy and
itâs something that we must be concerned about and take serious steps to
address.â Asked if he will make any recommendations for security measures
to ensure MPs physical safety, Walney says he thinks we will see the
Speaker of the House of Commons stepping up the levels of security. A Labour MP has
expressed caution over the idea that constituency surgeries should be observed
by police officers for protection, following the death of Sir David. Diane Abbott,
who served as Shadow Home Secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, says it could risk putting people off from visiting their local MP. Speaking to
Caroline Wyatt on BBC Radio 4 PM, she says: ""Iâve been talking to colleagues - there was one in North London who
was telling me that because of death threats she had a police officer outside
her advice session - and a police car in fact. Well of course the number of
people coming to see her dropped right down. ""You donât want to have a set-up
which is so off putting to ordinary people that just want help. So I wouldnât
support airport-style screening. âI would prefer, going forward, to meet constituents behind a screen, as we have now for Covid
and so on - that might be quite complicated to arrange but at least you know
someoneâs not going to just lean over the desk and stab you, which could happen
now.â People in Southend came together this afternoon at the town's Civic Centre to hold a vigil and reflect on the life of the MP David Amess and light candles. As tributes continue to pour in for Essex MP Sir David Amess let's take stock of what's happened since he was killed while meeting constituents in Leigh-on-Sea yesterday. Labour MP Naz Shah says there is ""no right or wrong answer"" over whether or not MPs should continue holding their surgeries. The Bradford West MP - who has received death threats in the past - says the attack on Sir David ""could have happened to any of us"". ""I just think you've got to respect every MP - some will have the 'Yes, we're going to carry on' view, and some people won't feel comfortable."" The West Papua independence leader Benny Wendahas sent,externalhis condolences to the family of Sir David Amess. He says he was one of the first MPs to sign the Westminster Declaration for West Papua and would ""always be fondly remembered by West Papuans"". The Westminster Declaration calls for an internationally supervised vote on independence from Indonesia for West Papua and has been signed by parliamentarians around the world.

The killing of MP Sir David Amess has highlighted a security dilemma forpoliticians across the globe. Some of the BBC's international correspondents explain what the situation is like in other countries. BBC South American correspondent Katy Watson says being an open, accessible people's representative in the major cities of Brazil - Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro - where wealth and inequalities are polarised, politicians are more likely to be flanked by bodyguards. Brazil is deeply divided politically and President Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed during his leadership campaign. Being an MP in India - the world's largest democracy - comes with a lot of privileges, a security detail is one of them, writes Vikas Pandey in Delhi. In recent years, attacks on politicians have taken the form of ink-throwing and slapping. But a number of politicians, including former PMs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, have lost their lives in violent attacks. In the Netherlands, Dutch lawmakers do not hold surgeries and only a select few Dutch politicians, including the anti-Islam leader, Geert Wilders, have protection. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, pictured below, has been seen cycling to meetings. Read the full story on the struggle politicians face to meet the public and stay safe. People have come together at Southend Civic Centre for a moment of reflection on Sir David's life. Mohammed Shamsuddin says he had known Sir David since 1983 and describes him as ""English gentleman who was so kind to our community as well as the whole of Southend"". Ruhul Shamsuddin, Joint Secretary of Essex Jamme Masjid says he had known Sir David since he was a child. He says: ""For his life to be cut short is devastating."" Mahmudul Hasan says: ""We greatly miss him and he will be always missed."" Claire Calder from the Dogs Trust says Sir David Amess was ""one of the biggest champions of animal welfare in Parliament"". She praises the MP's ""huge sense of humour"" and ""huge heart"". Recently, she says he had joined their campaigns to tackle puppy smuggling and to ban electric shock collars. Next week is the annual Westminster dog of the year contest run by the Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club. Sir David had been planning to enter his French bulldog into the contest. Allow Twitter content?

The fuel poverty charity National Energy Action describes Sir David as ""a true public servant"". The charity said the MP would be remembered for his bill aimed at eliminating fuel poverty - the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill. The bill required the government to publish and implement a strategy to reduce fuel poverty and became law in 2000. A spokesperson for the NEA said Sir David's family could ""take some small comfort from knowing the huge positive difference he has made"". ""Millions of people across the UK are now better supported through national policies and programmes than before he started his campaign and he has directly helped millions of people to be warmer and safer in their homes."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan says his thoughts are with Sir David Amess' family at ""this time of unimaginable grief"". He describes the Essex MP as ""a brilliant, kind, dedicated public
servant, widely liked and respected across the political divide"". He adds: ""Iâm utterly disgusted
by this attack on our democracy. âLike with the murder of my dear friend Jo Cox five years ago, it appears that the horrific killing of Sir David Amess was another attempt to divide us, to fuel fear and to change how we treat one another."" ""Our response must be to stand united in defiance and stay true to our values and way of life.""

Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent There's no indication that the national terrorism threat level is going to be changed to a higher level in light of the attack.
